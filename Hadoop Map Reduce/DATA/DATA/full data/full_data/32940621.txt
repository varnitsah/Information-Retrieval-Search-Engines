crisis     book i   chapter i which deals with origins  faithfully to relate how eliphalet hopper came try st louis is to betray no secret mr hopper is wont to tell the story now when his daughterinlaw is not by and sometimes he tells it in her presence for he is a shameless and determined old party who denies the divine right of boston and has taken again to chewing tobacco  when eliphalet came to town his sons wife mrs samuel d or s dwyer as she is beginning to call herself was not born gentlemen of cavalier and puritan descent had not yet begun to arrive at the planters house to buy hunting shirts and broad rims belts and bowies and depart quietly for kansas there to indulge in that most pleasurable of anglosaxon pastimes a free fight mr douglas had not thrown his bone of local sovereignty to the sleeping dogs of war  to return to eliphalets arrivala picture which has much that is interesting in it behold the friendless boy he stands in the prow of the great steamboat louisiana of a scorching summer morning and looks with something of a nameless disquiet on the chocolate waters of the mississippi there have been other sights since passing louisville which might have disgusted a massachusetts lad more a certain deck on the paducah which took him as far as cairo was devoted to cattleblack cattle eliphalet possessed a fortunate temperament the deck was dark and the smell of the wretches confined there was worse than it should have been and the incessant weeping of some of the women was annoying inasmuch as it drowned many of the profane communications of the overseer who was showing eliphalet the sights then a finelinened planter from down river had come in during the conversation and paying no attention to the overseers salute cursed them all into silence and left  eliphalet had ambition which is not a wholly undesirable quality he began to wonder how it would feel to own a few of these valuable fellowcreatures he reached out and touched lightly a young mulatto woman who sat beside him with an infant in her arms the peculiar dumb expression on her face was lost on eliphalet the overseer had laughed coarsely  what skeered on em said he and seizing the girl by the cheek gave it a cruel twinge that brought a cry out of her  eliphalet had reflected upon this incident after he had bid the overseer goodby at cairo and had seen that pitiful coffle piled aboard a steamer for new orleans and the result of his reflections was that some day he would like to own slaves  a dome of smoke like a mushroom hung over the city visible from far down the river motionless in the summer air a long line of steamboatswhite patient animalswas tethered along the levee and the louisiana presently swung in her bow toward a gap in this line where a mass of people was awaiting her arrival some invisible force lifted eliphalets eyes to the upper deck where they rested as if by appointment on the trim figure of the young man in command of the louisiana he was very young for the captain of a large new orleans packet when his lips moved something happened once he raised his voice and a negro stevedore rushed frantically aft as if he had received the end of a lightningbolt admiration burst from the passengers and one man cried out captain brents ageit was thirtytwo  eliphalet snapped his teeth together he was twentyseven and his ambition actually hurt him at such times after the boat was fast to the landing stage he remained watching the captain who was speaking a few parting words to some passengers of fashion the bodyservants were taking their luggage to the carriages mr hopper envied the captain his free and vigorous speech his ready jokes and his hearty laugh all the rest he knew for his ownin times to come the carriages the trained servants the obsequiousness of the humbler passengers for of such is the republic  then eliphalet picked his way across the hot stones of the levee pushing hither and thither in the rough crowd of river men dodging the mules on the heavy drays or making way for the carriages of the few people of importance who arrived on the boat if any recollections of a cool white farmhouse amongst barren new england hills disturbed his thoughts this is not recorded he gained the mouth of a street between the low houses which crowded on the broad river front the black mud was thick under his feet from an overnight shower and already steaming in the sun the brick pavement was lumpy from much travel and near as dirty as the street here too were drays blocking the way and sweaty negro teamsters swinging cowhides over the mules the smell of many wares poured through the open doors mingling with the perspiration of the porters on every side of him were busy clerks with their suspenders much in evidence and eliphalet paused once or twice to listen to their talk it was tinged with that dialect he had heard since leaving cincinnati  turning a corner eliphalet came abruptly upon a prophecy a great drove of mules was charging down the gorge of the street and straight at him he dived into an entrance and stood looking at the animals in startled wonder as they thundered by flinging the mud over the pavements a cursing lot of drovers on ragged horses made the rear guard  eliphalet mopped his brow the mules seemed to have aroused in him some sense of his atomity where the sight of the pillar of smoke and of the black cattle had failed the feeling of a stranger in a strange land was upon him at last a strange land indeed could it be one with his native new england did congress assemble from the antipodes wasnt the great ugly river and dirty city at the end of the earth to be written about in boston journals  turning in the doorway he saw to his astonishment a great store with high ceilings supported by columns the door was stacked high with bales of dry goods beside him was a sign in gold lettering carvel and company wholesale dry goods and lastly looking down upon him with a quizzical expression was a gentleman there was no mistaking the gentleman he was cool which eliphalet was not and the fact is the more remarkable because the gentleman was attired according to the fashion of the day for men of his age in a black coat with a teal of ruffled shirt showing and a heavy black stock around his collar he had a white mustache and a goatee and white hair under his black felt hat his face was long his nose straight and the sweetness of its smile had a strange effect upon eliphalet who stood on one foot  well sonny scared of mules are you the speech is a stately drawl very different from the nasal twang of eliphalets bringing up reckon you dont come from anywhere round here  no sir said eliphalet from willesden massachusetts  come in on the louisiana  yes sir but why this politeness  the elderly gentleman lighted a cigar the noise of the rushing mules had now become a distant roar like a whirlwind which has swept by but eliphalet did not stir  friends in town inquired the gentleman at length  no sir sighed mr hopper  at this point of the conversation a crisp step sounded from behind and wonderful smile came again on the surface  mornin colonel said a voice which made eliphalet jump and he swung around to perceive the young captain of the louisiana  why captain lige cried the colonel without ceremony and how do you find yourself today suh a good trip from orleans we did not look for you so soon  tolluble colonel tolluble said the young man grasping the colonels hand well colonel i just called to say that i got the seventy bales of goods you wanted  ephum cried the colonel diving toward a counter where glasses were set outa custom new to eliphaletephum some of that very particular colonel crittenden sent me over from kentucky last week  an old darkey with hair as white as the colonels appeared from behind the partition  i lowed youd want it marse comyn when i seed de capn comin said he with the privilege of an old servant indeed the bottle was beneath his arm  the colonel smiled  hope youse well capn said ephum as he drew the cork  tolluble ephum replied the captain but ephumsay ephum  yes sah  hows my little sweetheart ephum  bress your soul sah said ephum his face falling perceptibly bress your soul sah miss jinnys done gone to halcyondale in kaintuck to see her grandma ole ephum aint de same nigger when shes away  the young captains face showed as much disappointment as the darkeys  cuss it said he strongly if that aint too bad i brought her a creole doll from new orleans which madame claire said was dressed finer than any one shed ever seen all lace and french gewgaws colonel but youll send it to her  that i will lige said the colonel heartily and she shall write you the prettiest note of thanks you ever got  bless her pretty face cried the captain her health colonel heres a long life to miss virginia carvel and may she rule forever how old did you say this was he asked looking into the glass  over half a century said colonel carvel  if it came from the ruins of pompeii cried captain brent it might be worthy of her  what an idiot you are about that child lige said the colonel who was not hiding his pleasure the colonel could hide nothing you ruin her  the bluff young captain put down his glass to laugh  ruin her he exclaimed her pa dont ruin her i eh ephum her pa dont ruin her  lawsy marse lige i reckon hes wussn any  ephum said the colonel pulling his goatee thoughtfully youre a damned impertinent nigger i vow ill sell you south one of these days have you taken that letter to mr renault he winked at his friend as the old darkey faded into the darkness of the store and continued did i ever tell you about wilson peales portrait of my grandmother dorothy carvel that i saw this summer at my brother daniels in pennsylvania jinnys going to look something like her sir um she was a fine woman black hair though jinnys is brown like her mas the colonel handed a cigar to captain brent and lit one himself daniel has a book my grandfather wrote mostly about her lord i remember her she was the queenbee of the family while she lived i wish some of us had her spirit  colonel remarked captain lige whats this i heard on the levee just now about your shootin at a man named babcock on the steps here  the colonel became very grave his face seemed to grow longer as he pulled his goatee  he was standing right where you are sir he replied captain lige moved and he proposed that i should buy his influence  what did you do  colonel carvel laughed quietly at the recollection  shucks said he i just pushed him into the streets gave him a little start and put a bullet past his ear just to let the trash know the sound of it then russell went down and bailed me out  the captain shook with laughter but mr eliphalet hoppers eyes were glued to the mildmannered man who told the story and his hair rose under his hat  by the way lige hows that boy tato somehow after i let you have him on the louisiana i thought id made a mistake to let him run the river easters afraid hell lose the little religion she taught him  it was the captains turn to be grave  i tell you what colonel said he we have to have hands of course but somehow i wish this business of slavery had never been started  sir said the colonel with some force god made the sons of ham the servants of japheths sons forever and forever  well well we wont quarrel about that sir said brent quickly if they all treated slaves as you do there wouldnt be any cry from bostonway and as for me i need hands i shall see you again colonel  take supper with me tonight lige said mr carvel i reckon youll find it rather lonesome without jinny  awful lonesome said the captain but youll show me her letters wont you  he started out and ran against eliphalet  hello he cried whos this  a young yankee you landed here this morning lige said the colonel what do you think of him  humph exclaimed the captain  he has no friends in town and he is looking for employment isnt that so sonny asked the colonels kindly  yes  come lige would you take him said mr carvel  the young captain looked into eliphalets face the dart that shot from his eyes was of an aggressive honesty and mr hoppers after an attempt at defiance were dropped  no said the captain  why not lige  well for one thing hes been listening said captain lige as he departed  colonel carvel began to hum softly to himself      one said it was an owl and the other he said nay      one said it was a church with the steeple torn away      look a there now  i reckon youre a rank abolitionist said he to eliphalet abruptly  i dont see any particular harm in keepin slaves mr hopper replied shifting to the other foot  whereupon the colonel stretched his legs apart seized his goatee pulled his head down and gazed at him for some time from under his eyebrows so searchingly that the blood flew to mr hoppers fleshy face he mopped it with a darkred handkerchief stared at everything in the place save the gentleman in front of him and wondered whether he had ever in his life been so uncomfortable then he smiled sheepishly hated himself and began to hate the colonel  ever hear of the liberator  no sir said mr hopper  where do you come from this was downright directness from which there was no escape  willesden massachusetts  umph and never heard of mr garrison  ive had to work all my life  what can you do sonny  i callate to sweep out a store i have kept books mr hopper vouchsafed  would you like work here asked the colonel kindly the green eyes looked up swiftly and down again  whatll you give me  the good man was surprised well said he seven dollars a week  many a time in after life had the colonel reason to think over this scene he was a man the singleness of whose motives could not be questioned the one and sufficient reason for giving work to a homeless boy from the hated state of the liberator was charity the colonel had his moods like many another worthy man  the small specks on the horizon sometimes grow into the hugest of thunder clouds and an act of charity out of the wisdom of god may produce on this earth either good or evil  eliphalet closed with the bargain ephum was called and told to lead the recruit to the presence of mr hood the manager and he spent the remainder of a hot day checking invoices in the shipping entrance on second street  it is not our place here to chronicle eliphalets faults whatever he may have been he was not lazy but he was an anomaly to the rest of the young men in the store for those were days when political sentiments decided fervent loves or hatreds in two days was eliphalets reputation for wisdom made during that period he opened his mouth to speak but twice the first was in answer to a pointless question of mr barbos aetat 25 to the effect that he eliphalet hopper was a pierce democrat who looked with complacency on the extension of slavery this was wholly satisfactory and saved the owner of these sentiments a broken head the other time eliphalet spoke was to ask mr barbo to direct him to a boardinghouse  i reckon mr barbo reflected that youll want one of them congregational boardinghouses weve got a heap of yankees in the town and they all flock together and pray together i reckon youd ruther go to miss cranes nor anywhere  forthwith to miss cranes eliphalet went and that lady being a greek herself knew a greek when she saw one the kindhearted barbo lingered in the gathering darkness to witness the game which ensued a game dear to all new englanders comical to barbo the two contestants calculated barbo reckoned and put his money on his newfound fellowclerk eliphalet indeed never showed to better advantage the shyness he had used with the colonel and the taciturnity practised on his fellowclerks he slipped off like coat and waistcoat for the battle the scene was in the front yard of the third house in dorcas row everybody knows where dorcas row was miss crane tall with all the severity of side curls and bombazine stood like a stone lioness at the gate in the background by the steps the boarders sat an interested group eliphalet girded up his loins and sharpened his nasal twang to cope with hers the preliminary sparring was an exchange of compliments and deceived neither party it seemed rather to heighten mutual respect  you be from willesden eh said crane i calculate you know the salters  if the truth were known this evidence of an apparent omniscience rather staggered eliphalet but training stood by him and he showed no dismay yes he knew the salters and had drawed many a load out of hiram salters woodlot to help pay for his schooling  let me see said miss crane innocently who was it one of them salters girls married and lived across the way from the meetinhouse  spauldin was the prompt reply  wal i want t know cried the spinster not ezra spauldin  eliphalet nodded that nod was one of infinite shrewdness which commended itself to miss crane these courtesies far from making awkward the material discussion which followed did not affect it in the least  so you want me to board you said she as if in consternation  eliphalet calculated if they could come to terms and mr barbo keyed himself to enjoyment  single gentlemen said she pay as high as twelve dollars and she added that they had no cause to complain of her table  eliphalet said he guessed hed have to go somewhere else upon this the lady vouchsafed the explanation that those gentlemen had high positions and rented her large rooms since mr hopper was from willesden and knew the salters she would be willing to take him for less eliphalet said bluntly he would give three and a half barbo gasped this particular kind of courage was wholly beyond him  half an hour later eliphalet carried his carpetbag up three flights and put it down in a tiny bedroom under the eaves still pulsing with heat waves here he was to live and eat at miss cranes table for the consideration of four dollars a week  such is the story of the humble beginning of one substantial prop of the american nation and what a hackneyed story it is how many other young men from the east have travelled across the mountains and floated down the rivers to enter those strange cities of the west the growth of which was like jonahs gourd  two centuries before when charles stuart walked out of a window in whitehall palace to die when the great english race was in the throes of a civil war when the stern and the gay slew each other at naseby and marston moor two currents flowed across the atlantic to the new world then the stern men found the stern climate and the gay found the smiling climate  after many years the streams began to move again westward ever westward over the ever blue mountains from the wonderland of virginia into the greater wonderland of kentucky and through the marvels of the inland seas and by white conestogas threading flat forests and floating over wide prairies until the two tides met in a maelstrom as fierce as any in the great tawny torrent of the strange father of waters a city founded by pierre laclede a certain adventurous subject of louis who dealt in furs and who knew not marly or versailles was to be the place of the mingling of the tides after cycles of separation puritan and cavalier united on this claybank in the louisiana purchase and swept westward togetherlike the struggle of two great rivers when they meet the waters for a while were dangerous  so eliphalet was established among the puritans at miss cranes the dishes were to his taste brown bread and beans and pies were plentiful for it was a land of plenty all kinds of puritans were there and they attended mr davitts congregational church and may it be added in justice to mr hopper that he became not the least devout of the boarders     chapter ii the mole  for some years while stephen a douglas and franklin pierce and other gentlemen of prominence were playing at bowls on the united states of america while kansas was furnishing excitement free of charge to any citizen who loved sport mr eliphalet hopper was at work like the industrious mole underground it is safe to affirm that colonel carvel forgot his new hand as soon as he had turned him over to mr hood the manager as for mr hopper he was content we can ill afford to dissect motives genius is willing to lay the foundations of her structure unobserved  at first it was mr barbo alone who perceived eliphalets greatnessmr barbo whose opinions were so easily had that they counted for nothing the other clerks to say the least found the newcomer uncompanionable he had no time for skylarking the heat of the day meant nothing to him and he was never sleepy he learned the stock as if by intuition and such was his strict attention to business that mr hood was heard is say privately he did not like the looks of it a young man should have other interests and then although he would not hold it against him he had heard that mr hopper was a teacher in mr davitts sunday school  because he did not discuss his ambitions at dinner with the other clerks in the side entry it must not be thought that eliphalet was without other interests he was likewise too shrewd to be dragged into political discussions at the boardinghouse table he listened imperturbably to the outbursts against the border ruffian and smiled when mr abner reed in an angry passion asked him to declare whether or not he was a friend of the divine institution after a while they forgot about him all save miss crane which was what mr hopper of all things desired  one other friend besides miss crane did eliphalet take unto himself wherein he showed much discrimination this friend was none other than mr davitt minister for many years of the congregational church for mr davitt was a good man zealous in his work unpretentious and kindly more than once eliphalet went to his home to tea and was pressed to talk about himself and his home life the minister and his wife ware invariably astonished after their guest was gone at the meagre result of their inquiries  if love had ever entered such a discreet soul as that into which we are prying he used a back entrance even mr barbos inquiries failed in the discovery of any young person with whom eliphalet kept company whatever the notions abroad concerning him he was admittedly a model there are many kinds of models with some young ladies at the sunday school indeed he had a distant bowing acquaintance they spoke of him as the young man who knew the bible as thoroughly as mr davitt himself the only time that mr hopper was discovered showing embarrassment was when mr davitt held his hand before them longer than necessary on the church steps mr hopper was not sentimental  however fascinating the subject i do not propose to make a whole book about eliphalet yet sidelights on the life of every great man are interesting and there are a few incidents in his early career which have not gotten into the subscription biographical encyclopaedias in several of these volumes to be sure we may see steel engravings of him true likenesses all his was the type of face which is the glory of the steel engravingsquare and solid as a cornerstone should be the very clothes he wore were made for the steel engraving stiff and wiry in texture with sharp angles at the shoulders and sombre in hue as befit such grave creations  let us go back to a certain fine morning in the september of the year 1857 when mr hopper had arrived all unnoticed at the age of two and thirty industry had told he was now the managers assistant and be it said in passing knew more about the stock than mr hood himself on this particular morning about nine oclock he was stacking bolts of woollen goods near that delectable counter where the colonel was wont to regale his principal customers when a vision appeared in the door visions were rare at carvel  companys this one was followed by an old negress with leathery wrinkles whose smile was joy incarnate they entered the store paused at the entrance to the colonels private office and surveyed it with dismay  clar t goodness miss jinny yo pa aint heah an whahs ephum dat black goodfonuthin  miracle number onemr hopper stopped work and stared the vision was searching the store with her eyes and pouting  how mean of pa she exclaimed when i took all this trouble to surprise him not to be here where are they all wheres ephum wheres mr hood  the eyes lighted on eliphalet his blood was sluggish but it could be made to beat faster the ladies he had met at miss cranes were not of this description as he came forward embarrassment made him shamble and for the first time in his life he was angrily conscious of a poor figure her first question dashed out the spark of his zeal  oh said she are you employed here  thoughtless virginia you little know the man you have insulted by your haughty drawl  yes  then find mr carvel wont you please and tell him that his daughter has come from kentucky and is waiting for him  i callate mr carvel wont be here this morning said eliphalet he went back to the pile of dry goods and began to work but he was unable to meet the displeasure in her face  what is your name miss carvel demanded  hopper  then mr hopper please find ephum or mr hood  two more bolts were taken off the truck out of the corner of his eye he watched her and she seemed very tall like her father she was taller than he in fact  i aint a servant miss carvel he said with a meaning glance at the negress  laws miss jinny cried she i mays ell find ephum i knows hes loafin somewhar hereabouts an i aint seed him dese five month and she started for the back of the store  mammy  the old woman stopped short eliphalet electrified looked up and instantly down again  you say you are employed by mr carvel and refuse to do what i ask  i aint a servant mr hopper repeated doggedly he felt that he was in the rightand perhaps he was  it was at this critical juncture in the proceedings that a young man stepped lightly into the store behind miss jinny mr hoppers eye was on him and had taken in the details of his costume before realizing the import of his presence he was perhaps twenty and wore a coat that sprung in at the waist and trousers of a light buffcolor that gathered at the ankle and were very copious above his features were of the straight type which has been called from time immemorial patrician he had dark hair which escaped in waves from under his hat and black eyes that snapped when they perceived miss virginia carvel at sight of her indeed the goldheaded cane stopped in its gyrations in midair  why jinny he criedjinny  mr hopper would have sold his soul to have been in the young mans polished boots to have worn his clothes and to have been able to cry out to the young lady why jinny  to mr hoppers surprise the young lady did not turn around she stood perfectly still but a red flush stole upon her cheek and laughter was dancing in her eyes yet she did not move the young man took a step forward and then stood staring at her with such a comical expression of injury on his face as was too much for miss jinnys serenity she laughed that laugh also struck minor chords upon mr hoppers heartstrings  but the young gentleman very properly grew angry  youve no right to treat me the way you do virginia he cried why didnt you let me know that you were coming home his tone was one of authority you didnt come from kentucky alone  i had plenty of attendance i assure you said miss carvel a governor and a senator and two charming young gentlemen from new orleans as far as cairo where i found captain liges boat and mr brinsmade brought me here to the store i wanted to surprise pa she continued rapidly to head off the young gentlemans expostulations how mean of him not to be here  allow me to escort you home said he with ceremony  allow me to decline the honah mr colfax she cried imitating him i intend to wait here until pa comes in  then eliphalet knew that the young gentleman was miss virginias first cousin and it seemed to him that he had heard a rumor amongst the clerks in the store that she was to marry him one day  where is uncle comyn demanded mr colfax swinging his cane with impatience  virgina looked hard at mr hopper  i dont know she said  ephum shouted mr colfax ephum easters where the deuce is that goodfornothing husband of yours  i dunno marse clarence spec he whah he oughtnt ter be  mr colfax spied the stooping figure of eliphalet  do you work here he demanded  i callate  what  i callate to responded mr hopper again without rising  please find mr hood directed mr colfax with a wave of his cane and say that miss carvel is here  whereupon miss carvel seated herself upon the edge of a bale and giggled which did not have a soothing effect upon either of the young men how abominably you were wont to behave in those days virginia  just say that mr colfax sent you clarence continued with a note of irritation theres a good fellow  virginia laughed outright her cousin did not deign to look at her his temper was slipping its leash  i wonder whether you hear me he remarked  no answer  colonel carvel hires you doesnt he he pays you wages and the first time his daughter comes in here you refuse to do her a favor by thunder ill see that you are dismissed  still eliphalet gave him no manner of attention but began marking the tags at the bottom of the pile  it was at this unpropitious moment that colonel carvel walked into the store and his daughter flew into his arms  well well he said kissing her thought youd surprise me eh jinny  oh pa she cried looking reproachfully up at his face you knewhow mean of you  ive been down on the louisiana where some inconsiderate man told me or i should not have seen you today i was off to alton but what are these goingson said the colonel staring at young mr colfax rigid as one of his own gamecocks he was standing defiantly over the stooping figure of the assistant manager  oh said virginia indifferently its only clarence hes so tiresome hes always wanting to fight with somebody  whats the matter clarence asked the colonel with the mild unconcern which deceived so many of the undiscerning  this person sir refused to do a favor for your daughter she told him and i told him to notify mr hood that miss carvel was here and he refused  mr hopper continued his occupation which was absorbing but he was listening  colonel carvel pulled his goatee and smiled  clarence said he i reckon i can run this establishment without any help from you and jinny ive been at it now for a good many years  if mr barbo had not been constitutionally unlucky he might have perceived mr hopper before dark that evening in conversation with mr hood about a certain customer who lived up town and presently leave the store by the side entrance he walked as rapidly as his legs would carry him for they were a trifle short for his body and in due time as the lamps were flickering he arrived near colonel carvels large double residence on tenth and locust streets then he walked slowly along tenth his eyes lifted to the tall curtained windows now and anon they scanned passersby for a chance acquaintance  mr hopper walked around the block arriving again opposite the carvel house and beside mr renaults which was across from it eliphalet had inherited the principle of mathematical chances it is a fact that the discreet sometimes take chances towards the back of mr renaults residence a wide area was sunk to the depth of a tall man which was apparently used for the purpose of getting coal and wood into the cellar mr hopper swept the neighborhood with a glance the coast was clear and he dropped into the area  although the evening was chill at first mr hopper perspired very freely he crouched in the area while the steps of pedestrians beat above his head and took no thought but of escape at last however he grew cooler removed his hat and peeped over the stone coping colonel carvels househer housewas now ablaze with lights and the shades not yet drawn there was the dining room where the negro butler was moving about the table and the pantry where the butler went occasionally and the kitchen with black figures moving about but upstairs on the two streets was the sitting room the straight figure of the colonel passed across the light he held a newspaper in his hand suddenly full in the window he stopped and flung away the paper a graceful shadow slipped across the wall virginia laid her hands on his shoulders and he stooped to kiss her now they sat between the curtains she on the arm of his chair and leaning on him together looking out of the window  how long this lasted mr hopper could not say even the wise forget themselves but all at once a wagon backed and bumped against the curb in front of him and eliphalets head dropped as if it had been struck by the wheel above him a sash screamed as it opened and he heard mr renaults voice say to some person below  is that you capitaine grant  the same was the brief reply  i am charmed that you have brought the wood i thought that you had forgotten me  i try to do what i say mr renault  attendezwait cried mr renault and closed the window  now was eliphalets chance to bolt the perspiration had come again and it was cold but directly the excitable little man renault had appeared on the pavement above him he had been running  it is a long voyage from gravois with a load of wood capitainei am very grateful  business is business mr renault was the selfcontained reply  alphonse cried mr renault alphonse a door opened in the back wall du vin pour monsieur le capitaine  oui msieu  eliphalet was too frightened to wonder why this taciturn handler of wood was called captain and treated with such respect  guess i wont take any wine tonight mr renault said he you go inside or youll take cold  mr renault protested asked about all the residents of gravois way and finally obeyed eliphalets heart was in his mouth a bolder spirit would have dashed for liberty eliphalet did not possess that kind of bravery he was waiting for the captain to turn toward his wagon  he looked down the area instead with the light from the street lamp on his face fear etched an ineffaceable portrait of him on mr hoppers mind so that he knew him instantly when he saw him years afterward little did he reckon that the fourth time he was to see him this man was to be president of the united states he wore a closecropped beard an old blue army overcoat and his trousers were tucked into a pair of muddy cowhide boots  swiftly but silently the man reached down and hauled eliphalet to the sidewalk by the nape of the neck  what were you doing there demanded he of the blue overcoat sternly  eliphalet did not answer with one frantic wrench he freed himself and ran down locust street at the corner turning fearfully he perceived the man in the overcoat calmly preparing to unload his wood     chapter iii the unattainable simplicity  to mr hopper the being caught was the unpardonable crime and indeed with many of us it is humiliation and not conscience which makes the sting he walked out to the end of the citys growth westward where the new houses were going up he had reflected coolly on consequences and found there were none to speak of many a moralist mr davitt included would have shaken his head at this miss cranes whole puritan household would have raised their hands in horror at such a doctrine  some novelists i know of who are in reality celebrated surgeons in disguise would have shown a good part of mr eliphalet hoppers mental insides in as many words as i have taken to chronicle his arrival in st louis they invite us to attend a clinic and the horrible skill with which they wield the scalpel holds us spellbound for god has made all of us rogue and saint burglar and burgomaster marvellously alike we read a patent medicine circular and shudder with seven diseases we peruse one of mr so and sos intellectual tonics and are sure we are complicated scandals fearfully and wonderfully made  alas i have neither the skill nor the scalpel to show the diseases of mr hoppers mind if indeed he had any conscience when contracted is just as troublesome as croup mr hopper was thoroughly healthy he had ambition as i have said but he was not morbidly sensitive he was calm enough when he got back to the boardinghouse which he found in as high a pitch of excitement as new englanders ever reach  and over what  over the prospective arrival that evening of the brices mother and son from boston miss crane had received the message in the morning palpitating with the news she had hurried rustling to mrs abner reed with the paper in her hand  i guess you dont mean mrs appleton brice said mrs reed  thats just who i mean answered miss crane triumphantlynay aggressively  mrs abner shook her curls in a way that made people overwhelm her with proofs  mirandy youre cracked said she aint you never been to boston  miss crane bridled this was an uncalledfor insult  i guess i visited down bostonway oftener than you eliza reed you never had any clothes  mrs reeds strength was her imperturbability  and you never set eyes on the brice house opposite the common with the swelled front id like to find out where you were avisitin and youve never heard tell of the brice homestead at westbury that was colonel wilton brices who fought in the revolution im astonished at you mirandy when i used to be at the dales in mount vernon street in thirtyseven mrs charles atterbury brice used to come there in her carriage acallin she was appletons mother severe save us exclaimed mrs reed but she was stiff as starched crepe his father was minister to france the brices were in the india trade and they had money enough to buy the whole of st louis  miss crane rattled the letter in her hand she brought forth her reserves  yes and appleton brice lost it all in the panic and then he died and left the widow and son without a cent  mrs reed took off her spectacles  i want to know she exclaimed the durned fool well appleton brice didnt have the family brains ands he was kind of softhearted ive heard mehitabel dale say that she paused to reflect so theyre coming here she added i wonder why  miss cranes triumph was not over  because silas whipple was some kin to appleton brice and he has offered the boy a place in his law office  miss reed laid down her knitting  save us she said this is a day of wonders mirandy now lord help the boy if hes gain to work for the judge  the judge has a soft heart if he is crabbed declared the spinster ive heard say of a good bit of charity hes done hes a soft heart  soft as a green quince said mrs abner scornfully how many friends has he  those he has are warm enough miss crane retorted look at colonel carvel who has him to dinner every sunday  thats plain as your nose mirandy crane they both like quarrellin better than anything in this world  well said miss crane i must go make ready for the brices  such was the importance of the occasion however that she could not resist calling at mrs merrills room and she knocked at mrs chandlers door to tell that lady and her daughter  no burke has as yet arisen in this country of ours to write a peerage fame awaits him indeed it was even then awaiting him at the time of the panic of 1857 with what infinite pains were the pedigree and possessions of the brice family pieced together that day by the scattered residents from puritanland in the city of st louis and few buildings would have borne the wear and tear of many housecleanings of the kind miss crane indulged in throughout the morning and afternoon  mr eliphalet hopper on his return from business was met on the steps and requested to wear his sunday clothes like the good republican that he was mr hopper refused he had ascertained that the golden charm which made the brices worthy of tribute had been lost commercial supremacythat was mr hoppers creed family is a good thing but of what use is a crest without the panels on which to paint it can a diamond brooch shine on a calico gown mr hopper deemed church the place for worship he likewise had his own idol in his closet  eliphalet at willesden had heard a great deal of boston airs and graces and intellectuality of the favored few of that city who lived in mysterious houses and who crossed the sea in ships he pictured mrs brice asking for a spoon and young stephen sniffing at mrs cranes boardinghouse and he resolved with democratic spirit that he would teach stephen a lesson if opportunity offered his own discrepancy between the real and the imagined was no greater than that of the rest of his fellowboarders  barring eliphalet there was a dress parade that eveningsilks and bombazines and broadcloths and miss cranes special preserves on the teatable alas that most of the deserved honors of this world should fall upon barren ground  the quality which baffled mr hopper and some other boarders was simplicity none save the truly great possess it but this is not generally known mrs brice was so natural that first evening at tea that all were disappointed the hero upon the reviewing stand with the halo of the unknown behind his head is one thing the lady of family who sits beside you at a boardinghouse and discusses the weather and the journey is quite another they were prepared to hear mrs brice rail at the dirt of st louis and the crudity of the west they pictured her referring with sighs to her connections and bewailing that stephen could not have finished his course at harvard  she did nothing of the sort  the first shock was so great that mrs abner reed cried in the privacy of her chamber and the widow crane confessed her disappointment to the confiding ear of her bosom friend mrs merrill not many years later a man named grant was to be in springfield with a carpet bag despised as a vagabond a very homely man named lincoln went to cincinnati to try a case before the supreme court and was snubbed by a man named stanton  when we meet the truly great several things may happen in the first place we begin to believe in their luck or fate or whatever we choose to call it and to curse our own we begin to respect ourselves the more and to realize that they are merely clay like us that we are great men without opportunity sometimes if we live long enough near the great we begin to have misgivings then there is hope for us  mrs brice with her simple black gowns quiet manner and serene face with her interest in others and none in herself had a wonderful effect upon the boarders they were nearly all prepared to be humble they grew arrogant and pretentious they asked mrs brice if she knew this and that person of consequence in boston with whom they claimed relationship or intimacy her answers were amiable and selfcontained  but what shall we say of stephen brice let us confess at once that it is he who is the hero of this story and not eliphalet hopper it would be so easy to paint stephen in shining colors and to make him a firstclass prig the horror of all novelists that we must begin with the drawbacks first and worst it must be confessed that stephen had at that time what has been called the boston manner this was not stephens fault but bostons young mr brice possessed that wonderful power of expressing distance in other terms besides ells and furlongsand yet he was simple enough with it all  many a furtive stare he drew from the table that evening there were one or two of discernment present and they noted that his were the generous features of a marked manif he chose to become marked he inherited his mothers look hers was the face of a strong woman wide of sympathy broad of experience showing peace of mind amid troublesthe touch of femininity was there to soften it  her son had the air of the collegebred in these surroundings he escaped arrogance by the wonderful kindliness of his eye which lighted when his mother spoke to him but he was not at home at miss cranes table and he made no attempt to appear at his ease  this was an unexpected pleasure for mr eliphalet hopper let it not be thought that he was the only one at that table to indulge in a little secret rejoicing but it was a peculiar satisfaction to him to reflect that these people who had held up their heads for so many generations were humbled at last to be humbled meant in mr hoppers philosophy to lose ones money it was thus he gauged the importance of his acquaintances it was thus he hoped some day to be gauged and he trusted and believed that the time would come when he could give his fillip to the upper rim of fortunes wheel and send it spinning downward  mr hopper was drinking his tea and silently forming an estimate he concluded that young brice was not the type to acquire the money which his father had lost and he reflected that stephen must feel as strange in st louis as a cod might amongst the catfish in the mississippi so the assistant manager of carvel  company resolved to indulge in the pleasure of patronizing the bostonian  callatin to go to work he asked him as the boarders walked into the best room  yes replied stephen taken aback and it may be said here that if mr hopper underestimated him certainly he underestimated mr hopper  it aint easy to get a job this fall said eliphalet st louis houses have felt the panic  i am sorry to hear that  what business was you callatin to grapple with  law said stephen  gosh exclaimed mr hopper i want to know in reality he was a bit chagrined having pictured with some pleasure the boston aristocrat going from store to store for a situation you didnt come here figurin on makin a pile i guess  a what  a pile  stephen looked down and over mr hopper attentively he took in the blocky shoulders and the square head and he pictured the little eyes at a vanishingpoint in lines of a bargain then humor blessed humorcame to his rescue he had entered the race in the west where all start equal he had come here like this man who was succeeding to make his living would he succeed  mr hopper drew something out of his pocket eyed miss crane and bit off a corner  what office was you going into he asked genially mr brice decided to answer that  judge whipplesunless he has changed his mind eliphalet gave him a look more eloquent than words  know the judge  silent laughter  if all the fourth of julys weve had was piled into one said mr hopper slowly and with conviction they wouldnt be a circumstance to silas whipple when he gets mad my boss colonel carvel is the only man in town wholl stand up to him ive seen em begin a quarrel in the store and carry it all the way up the street i callate you wont stay with him a great while     chapter iv black cattle  later that evening stephen brice was sitting by the open windows in his mothers room looking on the streetlights below  well my dear asked the lady at length what do you think of it all  they are kind people he said  yes they are kind she assented with a sigh but they are notthey are not from among our friends stephen  i thought that one of our reasons for coming west mother answered stephen  his mother looked pained  stephen how can you we came west in order that you might have more chance for the career to which you are entitled our friends in boston were more than good  he left the window and came and stood behind her chair his hands clasped playfully beneath her chin  have you the exact date about you mother  what date stephen  when i shall leave st louis for the united states senate and you must not forget that there is a youth limit in our constitution for senators  then the widow smileda little sadly perhaps but still a wonderfully sweet smile and it made her strong face akin to all that was human and helpful  i believe that you have the subject of my first speech in that august assembly and by the way what was it  it was on the status of the emigrant she responded instantly thereby proving that she was his mother  and it touched the rights of privacy he added laughing which do not seem to exist in st louis boardinghouses  in the eyes of your misguided profession statesmen and authors and emigrants and other public charges have no rights of privacy said she mr longfellow told me once that they were to name a brand of flour for him and that he had no redress  have you too been up before miss cranes commission he asked with amused interest  his mother laughed  yes she said quietly  they have some expert members he continued this mrs abner reed could be a shining light in any bar i overheard a part of her crossexamination sheshe had evidently studied our case  my dear answered mrs brice i suppose they know all about us she was silent a moment i had so hoped that they wouldnt they lead the same narrow life in this house that they did in their little new england towns theythey pity us stephen  mother  i did not expect to find so many new englanders herei wish that mr whipple had directed us elsewhere  he probably thought that we should feel at home among new englanders i hope the southerners will be more considerate i believe they will he added  they are very proud said his mother a wonderful peopleborn aristocrats you dont remember those randolphs with whom we travelled through england they were with us at hollingdean lord northwells place you were too small at the time there was a young girl eleanor randolph a beauty i shall never forget the way she entered those english drawingrooms they visited us once in beacon street afterwards and i have heard that there are a great many good southern families here in st louis  you did not glean that from judge whipples letter mother said stephen mischievously  he was very frank in his letter sighed mrs brice  i imagine he is always frank to put it delicately  your father always spoke in praise of silas whipple my dear i have heard him call him one of the ablest lawyers in the country he won a remarkable case for appleton here and he once said that the judge would have sat on the supreme bench if he had not been pursued with such relentlessness by rascally politicians  the judge indulges in a little relentlessness now and then himself he is not precisely what might be termed a mild man if what we hear is correct  mrs brice started  what have you heard she asked  well there was a gentleman on the steamboat who said that it took more courage to enter the judges private office than to fight a border ruffian and another a young lawyer who declared that he would rather face a wild cat than ask whipple a question on the new code and yet he said that the judge knew more law than any man in the west and lastly there is a polished gentleman named hopper here from massachusetts who enlightened me a little more  stephen paused and bit his tongue he saw that she was distressed by these things heaven knows that she had borne enough trouble in the last few months  come mother he said gently you should know how to take my jokes by this time i didnt mean it i am sure the judge is a good manone of those aggressive good men who make enemies i have but a single piece of guilt to accuse him of  and what is that asked the widow  the cunning forethought which he is showing in wishing to have it said that a certain senator and judge brice was trained in his office  stephenyou goose she said  her eye wandered around the roomwidow cranes best bedroom it was dimly lighted by an extremely ugly lamp the hideous stuffy bed curtains and the more hideous imitation marble mantel were the two objects that held her glance there was no change in her calm demeanor but stephen who knew his mother felt that her little elation over her arrival had ebbed neither would confess dejection to the other  ieven i said stephen tapping his chest have at least made the acquaintance of one prominent citizen mr eliphalet d hopper according to mr dickens he is a true american gentleman for he chews tobacco he has been in st louis five years is now assistant manager of the largest dry goods house and still lives in one of miss cranes fourdollar rooms i think we may safely say that he will be a millionaire before i am a senator  he paused  and mother  yes dear  he put his hands in his pockets and walked over to the window  i think that it would be better if i did the same thing  what do you mean my son  if i went to workstarted sweeping out a store i mean see here mother youve sacrificed enough for me already after paying fathers debts weve come out here with only a few thousand dollars and the nine hundred i saved out of this years law school allowance what shall we do when that is gone the honorable legal profession as my friend reminded me tonight is not the swiftest road to millions  with a mothers discernment she guessed the agitation he was striving to hide she knew that he had been gathering courage for this moment for months and she knew that he was renouncing thus lightly for her sake an ambition he had had from his school days  widow passed her hand over her brow it was a space before she answered him  my son she said let us never speak of this again  it was your fathers dearest wish that you should become a lawyer andand his wishes are sacred god will take care of us  she rose and kissed him goodnight  remember my dear when you go to judge whipple in the morning remember his kindness and  and keep my temper i shall mother  a while later he stole gently back into her room again she was on her knees by the walnut bedstead  at nine the next manning stephen left miss cranes girded for the struggle with the redoubtable silas whipple he was not afraid but a poor young man as an applicant to a notorious dragon is not likely to be bandied with velvet even though the animal had been a friend of his father dragons as a rule have had a hard rime in their youths and believe in others having a hard time  to a young man who as his fathers heir in boston had been the subject of marked consideration by his elders the situation was keenly distasteful but it had to be gone through so presently after inquiry he came to the open square where the new court house stood the dome of which was indicated by a mass of staging and one wing still to be completed across from the building on market street and in the middle of the block what had once been a golden hand pointed up a narrow dusty stairway  here was a sign law office of silas whipple  stephen climbed the stairs and arrived at a ground glass door on which the sign was repeated behind that door was the future so he opened it fearfully with an impulse to throw his arm above his head but he was struck dumb on beholding instead of a dragon a goodnatured young man who smiled a broad welcome the reaction was as great as though one entered a dragons den armed to the teeth to find a st bernard doing the honors  stephens heart went out to this young manafter that organ had jumped back into its place this keeper of the dragon looked the part even the long black coat which custom then decreed could not hide the bone and sinew under it the young man had a broad forehead placid dresdenblue eyes flaxen hair and the german coloring across one of his high cheekbones was a great jagged scar which seemed to add distinction to his appearance that caught stephens eye and held it he wondered whether it were the result of an encounter with the judge  you wish to see mr whipple he asked in the accents of an educated german  yes said stephen if he isnt busy  he is out said the other with just a suspicion of a d in the word you know he is much occupied now fighting election frauds you read the papers  i am a stranger here said stephen  ach exclaimed the german now i know you mr brice the young one from boston the judge spoke of but you did not tell him of your arrival  i did not wish to bother him stephen replied smiling  my name is richtercarl richter sir  the pressure of mr richters big hands warmed stephen as nothing else had since he had come west he was moved to return it with a little more fervor than he usually showed and he felt whatever the judge might be that he had a powerful friend near at handmr richters welcome came near being an embrace  sit down mr brice he said mild weather for november eh the judge will be here in an hour  stephen looked around him at the dusty books on the shelves and the still dustier books heaped on mr richters big table at the cuspidors at the engravings of washington and webster at the window in the jog which looked out on the courthouse square and finally at another groundglass door on which was printed                 silas whipple                  private  this then was the denthe arena in which was to take place a memorable interview but the thought of waiting an hour for the dragon to appear was disquieting stephen remembered that he had something over nine hundred dollars in his pocket which he had saved out of his last years allowance at the law school so he asked mr richter who was dusting off a chair to direct him to the nearest bank  why certainly said he mr brinsmades bank on chestnut street he took stephen to the window and pointed across the square i am sorry i cannot go with you he added but the judges negro shadrach is out and i must stay in the office i will give you a note to mr brinsmade  his negro exclaimed stephen why i thought that mr whipple was an abolitionist  mr richter laughed  the man is free said he the judge pays him wages  stephen thanked his new friend for the note to the bank president and went slowly down the stairs to be keyed up to a battlepitch and then to have the battle deferred is a trial of flesh and spirit  as he reached the pavement he saw people gathering in front of the wide entrance of the court house opposite and perched on the copings he hesitated curious then he walked slowly toward the place and buttoning his coat pushed through the loafers and passersby dallying on the outskirts of the crowd there in the bright november sunlight a sight met his eyes which turned him sick and dizzy  against the walls and pillars of the building already grimy with soot crouched a score of miserable human beings waiting to be sold at auction mr lynchs slave pen had been disgorged that morning old and young husband and wifethe moment was come for all and each how hard the stones and what more pitiless than the gaze of their fellowcreatures in the crowd below o friends we who live in peace and plenty amongst our families how little do we realize the terror and the misery and the dumb heartaches of those days stephen thought with agony of seeing his own mother sold before his eyes and the building in front of him was lifted from its foundation and rocked even as shall the temples on the judgment day  the oily auctioneer was inviting the people to pinch the wares men came forward to feel the creatures and look into their mouths and one brute unshaven and with filthy linen snatched a child from its mothers lap stephen shuddered with the sharpest pain he had ever known an oceanwide tempest arose in his breast samsons strength to break the pillars of the temple to slay these men with his bare hands seven generations of stern life and thought had their focus here in himfrom oliver cromwell to john brown  stephen was far from prepared for the storm that raged within him he had not been brought up an abolitionistfar from it nor had his fathers friendswho were deemed at that time the best people in bostonbeen abolitionists only three years before when boston had been aflame over the delivery of the fugitive anthony burns stephen had gone out of curiosity to the meeting at faneuil hall how well he remembered his fathers indignation when he confessed it and in his anger mr brice had called phillips and parker agitators but his father nor his fathers friends in boston had never been brought face to face with this hideous traffic  hark was that the singsong voice of the auctioneer he was selling the cattle high and low caressing an menacing he teased and exhorted them to buy the were bidding yes for the possession of souls bidding in the currency of the great republic and between the eager shouts came a moan of sheer despair what was the attendant doing now he was tearing two of then from a last embrace  threefour were sold while stephen was in a dream  then came a lull a hitch and the crowd began to chatter gayly but the misery in front of him held stephen in a spell figures stood out from the group a whitehaired patriarch with eyes raised to the sky a flatbreasted woman whose child was gone whose weakness made her valueless then two girls were pushed forth one a quadroon of great beauty to be fingered stephen turned his face awayto behold mr eliphalet hopper looking calmly on  wal mr brice this is an interesting show now aint it something we dont have i generally stop here to take a look when im passing and he spat tobacco juice on the coping  stephen came to his senses  and you are from new england he said  mr hopper laughed  tarnation said he you get used to it when i came here i was a sort of an abolitionist but after youve lived here awhile you get to know that niggers aint fit for freedom  silence from stephen  likely gal that beauty eliphalet continued unrepressed theres a wellknown new orleans dealer named jenkins after her i callate shell go down river  i reckon youre right mistah a man with a matted beard chimed in and added with a wink shell find it pleasant enoughfer a while some of those other niggers will go too and theyd rather go to hell they do treat em nefarious down thah on the wholesale plantations household niggers there aint none better off than them but seven years in a cotton swampseven years it takes thats all mistah  stephen moved away he felt that to stay near the man was to be tempted to murder he moved away and just then the auctioneer yelled attention  gentlemen he cried i have heah two sisters the propety of the late mistah robet benbow of st louis as fine a pair of wenches as was ever offed to the public from these heah steps  speak for the handsome gal cried a wag  sell off the cart hoss fust said another  the auctioneer turned to the darker sister  sal aint much on looks gentlemen he said but shes the best nigger for work mistah benbow had he seized her arm and squeezed it while the girl flinched and drew back shes solid gentlemen and sound as a dollar and she kin sew and cook twentytwo years old what am i bid  much to the auctioneers disgust sal was bought in for four hundred dollars the interest in the beautiful sister having made the crowd impatient stephen sick at heart turned to leave halfway to the corner he met a little elderly man who was the color of a dried gourd and just as stephen passed him this man was overtaken by an old negress with tears streaming down her face who seized the threadbare hem of his coat stephen paused involuntarily  well nancy said the little man we had marvellous luck i was able to buy your daughter for you with less than the amount of your savings  tank you mistah cantah wailed the poor woman tank you suh praised be de name ob de lawd he gib me sal again oh mistah cantah the agony in that cry is you gwineter stan heah an see her sister hester sol totooh ma little chile de little chile dat i nussed dat i raised up

would have gone down on her knees on the stone flagging before him her suffering was stamped on the little mans faceand it seemed to stephen that this was but one trial more which adversity had brought to mr canter  nancy he answered how often and to how many must he have had to say the same thing i havent the money nancy would to god that i had nancy  she had sunk down on the bricks but she had not fainted it was not so merciful as that it was stephen who lifted her and helped her to the coping where she sat with her bandanna awry  stephen was not of a descent to do things upon impulse but the tale was told in after days that one of his first actions in st louis was of this nature the waters stored for ages in the four great lakes given the opportunity rush over niagara falls into ontario  take the woman away said stephen in a low voice and i will buy the girlif i can  the little man looked up dazed  give me your cardyour address i will buy the girl if i can and set her free  he fumbled in his pocket and drew out a dirty piece of pasteboard it read r canter second hand furniture 20 second street and still he stared at stephen as one who gazes upon a mystery a few curious pedestrians had stopped in front of them  get her away if you can for gods sake said stephen again and he strode off toward the people at the auction he was trembling in his eagerness to reach a place of vantage before the girl was sold he pushed roughly into the crowd  but suddenly he was brought up short by the blocky body of mr hopper who grunted with the force of the impact  gosh said that gentleman but you are intersted they aint begun to sell her yethes waitin for somebody callatin to buy her asked mr hopper with genial humor  stephen took a deep breath if he knocked mr hopper down he certainly could not buy her and it was a relief to know that the sale had not begun  as for eliphalet he was beginning to like young brice he approved of any man from boston who was not too squeamish to take pleasure in a little affair of this kind  as for stephen mr hopper brought him back to earth he ceased trembling and began to think  tarnation said eliphalet theres my boss colonel carvel across the street guess id better move on but what dye think of him for a real southern gentleman  the young dandy is his nephew clarence colfax he callates to own this town eliphalet was speaking leisurely as usual while preparing to move thats virginia carvel in red any gals down bostonway to beat her guess you wont find many as proud  he departed and stephen glanced absently at the group they were picking their way over the muddy crossing toward him was it possible that these people were coming to a slave auction surely not and yet here they were on the pavement at his very side  she wore a long talma of crimson cashmere and her face was in that most seductive of frames a scoop bonnet of dark green velvet for a fleeting second her eyes met his and then her lashes fell but he was aware when he had turned away that she was looking at him again he grew uneasy he wondered whether his appearance betrayed his purpose or made a question of his sanity  sanity yes probably he was insane from her point of view a sudden anger shook him that she should be there calmly watching such a scene  just then there was a hush among the crowd the beautiful slavegirl was seized roughly by the man in charge and thrust forward half fainting into view stephen winced but unconsciously he turned to see the effect upon virginia carvel  thank god there were tears upon her lashes  here was the rasp of the auctioneers voice gentlemen i reckon there aint never been offered to bidders such an opportunity as this heah look at her well gentlemen i ask you aint she a splendid creature  colonel carvel in annoyance started to move on come jinny he said i had no business to bring you aver  but virginia caught his arm pa she cried its mr benbows hester dont go dear buy her for me you know that i always wanted her please  the colonel halted irresolute and pulled his goatee young colfax stepped in between them  ill buy her for you jinny mother promised you a present you know and you shall have her  virginia had calmed  do buy her one of you was all she said  you may do the bidding clarence said the colonel and well settle the ownership afterward taking virginias arm he escorted her across the street  stephen was left in a quandary here was a home for the girl and a good one why should me spend the money which meant so much to him he saw the man jenkin elbowing to the front and yetsuppose mr colfax did not get her he had promised to buy her if he could and to set her free  stephen had made up his mind he shouldered his way after jenkins     chapter v the first spark passes  now gentlemen shouted the auctioneer when he had finished his oration upon the girls attractions what tin i bid eight hundred  stephen caught his breath there was a long pause no one cared to start the bidding  come gentlemen come theres my friend alf jenkins he knows what shes worth to a cent whatll you give alf is it eight hundred  mr jenkins winked at the auction joined in the laugh  three hundred he said  the auctioneer was mortally offended then some one criedthree hundred and fifty  it was young colfax he was recognized at once by name evidently as a person of importance  thank you mistah colfax suh said the auctioneer with a servile wave of the hand in his direction while the crowd twisted their necks to see him he stood very straight very haughty as if entirely oblivious to his conspicuous position  three seventyfive  thats better mistah jenkins said the auctioneer sarcastically he turned to the girl who might have stood to a sculptor for a figure of despair her hands were folded in front of her her head bowed down the auctioneer put his hand under her chin and raised it roughly cheer up my gal he said you aint got nothing to blubber about now  hesters breast heaved and from her black eyes there shot a magnificent look of defiance he laughed that was the white blood  the white blood  clarence colfax had his bid taken from his lips above the heads of the people he had a quick vision of a young man with a determined face whose voice rang clear and strong four hundred  even the auctioneer braced two ways was thrown off his balance by the sudden appearance of this new force stephen grew red over the sensation he made apparently the others present had deemed competition with such as jenkins and young colfax the grossest folly he was treated to much liberal staring before the oily salesman arranged his wits to grapple with the third factor  four hundred fromfromfrom that gentleman and the chubby index seemed the finger of scorn  four hundred and fifty said mr colfax defiantly  whereupon mr jenkins the new orleans dealer lighted a very long cigar and sat down on the coping the auctioneer paid no attention to this manoeuvre but mr brice and mr colfax being very young fondly imagined that they had the field to themselves to fight to a finish  here wisdom suggested in a mild whisper to stephen that there was a last chance to pull out and let colfax have the girl never that was pride and most reprehensible but second he thought of mr canter and of nancy and that was not pride  four seventyfive he cried  thank you suh  now fur it young uns said the wag and the crowd howled with merriment  five hundred snapped mr colfax  he was growing angry but stephen was from new england and poor and he thought of the size of his purse a glance at his adversary showed that his blood was up money was plainly no consideration to him and young colfax did not seem to be the kind who would relish returning to a young lady and acknowledge a defeat  stephen raised the bid by ten dollars the southerner shot up fifty again stephen raised it ten he was in full possession of himself now and proof against the thinly veiled irony of the oily mans remarks in favor of mr colfax in an incredibly short time the latters impetuosity had brought them to eight hundred and ten dollars  then several things happened very quickly  mr jenkins got up from the curb and said eight hundred and twentyfive with his cigar in his mouth scarcely had the hum of excitement died when stephen glancing at colfax for the next move saw that young gentleman seized from the rear by his uncle the tall colonel and across the street was bliss virginia carvel tapping her foot on the pavement  what are you about sir the colonel cried the wench isnt worth it  mr colfax shook himself free  ive got to buy her now sir he cried  i reckon not said the colonel you come along with me  naturally mr colfax was very angry he struggled but he went and so protesting he passed stephen at whom he did not deign to glance the humiliation of it must have been great for mr colfax jinny wants her sir he said and i have a right to buy her  jinny wants everything was the colonels reply and in a single look of curiosity and amusement his own gray eyes met stephens they seemed to regret that this young man too had not a guardian then uncle and nephew recrossed the street and as they walked off the colonel was seen to laugh virginia had her chin in the air and clarences was in his collar  the crowd of course indulged in roars of laughter and even stephen could not repress a smile a smile not without bitterness then he wheeled to face mr jerkins out of respect for the personages involved the auctioneer had been considerately silent daring the event it was mr brice who was now the centre of observation  come gentlemen come this heres a jokeeight twentyfive shes worth two thousand ive been in the business twenty yeas and i neve seen her equal give me a bid mrmryou have the advantage of me suh  eight hundred and thirtyfive said stephen  now mr jerkins now suh weve got twenty me to sell  eight fifty said mr jerkins  eight sixty said stephen and they cheered him  mr jenkins took his cigar out of his teeth and stared  eight seventyfive said he  eight eightyfive said stephen  there was a breathless pause  nine hundred said the trader  nine hundred and ten cried stephen  at that mr jerkins whipped his hat from off his head and made stephen a derisive bow  shes youahs suh he said these here are panic times ive struck my limit i can do bettah in louisville fo less congratulate you suhreckon you want her wussn i do  at which sally stephen grew scarlet and the crowd howled with joy  what yelled the auctioneer why gentlemen this heahs a joke nine hundred and ten dollars gents nine hundred and ten weve just begun gents come mr jerkins thats giving her away  the trader shook his head and puffed at his cigar  well cried the oily man this is a slaughter going at nine hundred an tennine tengoinggoing down came the hammergone at nine hundred and ten to mrmryou have the advantage of me suh  an attendant had seized the girl who was on the verge of fainting and was dragging her back stephen did not heed the auctioneer but thrust forward regardless of stares  handle her gently you blackguard he cried  the man took his hands off  suttinly sah he said  hester lifted her eyes and they were filled with such gratitude and trust that suddenly he was overcome with embarrassment  can you walk he demanded somewhat harshly  yes massa  then get up he said and follow me  she rose obediently then a fat man came out of the court house with a quill in his hand and a merry twinkle in his eye that stephen resented  this way please sah and he led him to a desk from the drawer of which he drew forth a blank deed  name please  stephen atterbury brice  residence mr brice  stephen gave the number but instead of writing it clown the man merely stared at him while the fat creases in his face deepened and deepened finally he put down his quill and indulged in a gale of laughter hugely to mr brices discomfiture  shucks said the fat man as soon as he could  what are you givin us that thes a yankee boadin house  and i suppose that that is part of your business too said stephen acidly  the fat man looked at him pressed his lips wrote down the number shaken all the while with a disturbance which promised to lead to another explosion finally after a deal of pantomime and whispering and laughter with the notary behind the wire screen the deed was made out signed attested and delivered stephen counted out the money grimly in gold and boston drafts  out in the sunlight on chestnut street with the girl by his side it all seemed a nightmare the son of appleton brice of boston the owner of a beautiful quadroon girl and he had bought hex with his last cent  miss crane herself opened the door in answer to his ring her keen eyes instantly darted over his shoulder and dilated but stephen summoning all his courage pushed past her to the stairs and beckoned hester to follow  i have brought thisthis person to see my mother he said  the spinster bowed from the back of her neck she stood transfixed on a great rose in the hall carpet until she heard mrs brices door open and slam and then she strode up the stairs and into the apartment of mrs abner reed as she passed the first landing the quadroon girl was waiting in the hall     chapter vi silas whipple  the trouble with many narratives is that they tell too much stephens interview with his mother was a quiet affair and not historic miss cranes boardinghouse is not an interesting place and the tempest in that teapot is better imagined than described out of consideration for mr stephen brice we shall skip likewise a most affecting scene at mr canters secondhand furniture store  that afternoon stephen came again to the dirty flight of steps which led to judge whipples office he paused a moment to gather courage and then gripping the rail he ascended the ascent required courage now certainly he halted again before the door at the top but even as he stood there came to him in low rich tones the notes of a german song he entered and mr richter rose in shirtsleeves from his desk to greet him all smiling  ach my friend said he but you are late the judge has been awaiting you  has he inquired stephen with illconcealed anxiety  the big young german patted him on the shoulder  suddenly a voice roared from out the open transom of the private office like a cyclone through a gap  mr richter  sir  who is that  mr brice sir  then why in thunder doesnt he come in  mr richter opened the private door and in stephen walked the door closed again and there he was in the dragons dens face to face with the dragon who was staring him through and through the first objects that caught stephens attention were the grizzly gray eye brows which seemed as so much brush to mark the fire of the deepset battery of the eyes and that battery when in action must have been truly terrible  the judge was shaven save for a shaggy fringe of gray beard around his chin and the size of his nose was apparent even in the full face  stephen felt that no part of him escaped the search of mr whipples glance but it was no code or course of conduct that kept him silent nor was it fear entirely  so you are appleton brices son said the judge at last his tone was not quite so gruff as it might have been  yes sir said stephen  humph said the judge with a look that scarcely expressed approval i guess youve been patted on the back too much by your fathers friends he leaned back in his wooden chair how i used to detest people who patted boys on the back and said with a smirk i know your father i never had a father whom people could say that about but sir cried the judge bringing down his fist on the litter of papers that covered his desk i made up my mind that one day people should know me that was my spur and youll start fair here mr brice they wont know your father here  if stephen thought the judge brutal he did not say so he glanced around the little roomat the bed in the corner in which the judge slept and which during the day did not escape the flood of books and papers at the washstand with a roll of legal cap beside the pitcher  i guess you think this town pretty crude after boston mr brice mr whipple continued from time immemorial it has been the pleasant habit of old communities to be shocked at newer settlements built by their own countrymen are you shocked sir  stephen flushed fortunately the judge did not give him time to answer  why didnt your mother let me know that she was coming  she didnt wish to put you to any trouble sir  wasnt i a good friend of your fathers didnt i ask you to come here and go into my office  but there was a chance mr whipple  a chance of what  that you would not like me and there is still a chance of it added stephen smiling  for a second it looked as if the judge might smile too he rubbed his nose with a fearful violence  mr richter tells me you were looking for a bank said he presently  stephen quaked  yes sir i was but  but mr whipple merely picked up the counterfeit bank note detector  beware of western state currency as you would the devil said he thats one thing we dont equal the east inyet and so you want to become a lawyer  i intend to become a lawyer sir  and so you shall sir cried the judge bringing down his yellow fist upon the bank note detector ill make you a lawyer sir but my methods aint harvard methods sir  i am ready to do anything mr whipple  the judge merely grunted he scratched among his papers and produced some legal cap and a bunch of notes  go out there he said and take off your coat and copy this brief mr richter will help you today and tell your mother i shall do myself the honor to call upon her this evening  stephen did as he was told without a word but mr richter was not in the outer office when he returned to it he tried to compose himself to write although the recollection of each act of the morning hung like a cloud over the back of his head therefore the first sheet of legal cap was spoiled utterly but stephen had a deep sense of failure he had gone through the ground glass door with the firm intention of making a clean breast of the ownership of hester now as he sat still the trouble grew upon him he started a new sheet and ruined that once he got as far as his feet and sat down again but at length he had quieted to the extent of deciphering ten lines of mr whipples handwriting when the creak of a door shattered his nerves completely  he glanced up from his work to beholdnone other than colonel comyn carvel  glancing at mr richters chair and seeing it empty the colonels eye roved about the room until it found stephen there it remained and the colonel remained in the middle of the floor his soft hat on the back of his head one hand planted firmly on the gold head of his stick and the other tugging at his goatee pulling down his chin to the quizzical angle  whoopee he cried  the effect of this was to make one perspire freely stephen perspired and as there seemed no logical answer he made none  suddenly mr carvel turned shaking with a laughter he could not control and strode into the private office the door slammed behind him mr brices impulse was flight but he controlled himself  first of all there was an eloquent silence then a ripple of guffaws then the scratchscratch of a quill pen and finally the judges voice  carvel what the devils the matter with you sir  a squall of guffaws blew through the transom and the colonel was heard slapping his knee  judge whipple said he his voice vibrating from suppressed explosions i am happy to see that you have overcome some of your ridiculous prejudices sir  what prejudices sir the judge was heard to shout  toward slavery judge said mr carvel seeming to recover his gravity you are a broader man than i thought sir  an unintelligible gurgle came from the judge then he said  carvel havent you and i quarrelled enough on that subject  you didnt happen to attend the nigger auction this morning when you were at the court asked the colonel blandly  colonel said the judge ive warned you a hundred times against the stuff you lay out on your counter for customers  you werent at the auction then continued the colonel undisturbed you missed it sir you missed seeing this young man youve just employed buy the prettiest quadroon wench i ever set eyes on  now indeed was poor stephen on his feet but whether to fly in at the one entrance or out at the other he was undecided  colonel said mr whipple is that true  sir mr brice  it did not seem to stephen as if he was walking when he went toward the ground glass door he opened it there was colonel carvel seated on the bed his goatee in his hand and there was the judge leaning forward from his hips straight as a ramrod fire was darting from beneath his bushy eyebrows mr brice said he there is one question i always ask of those whom i employ i omitted it in your case because i have known your father and your grandfather before you what is your opinion sir on the subject of holding human beings in bondage  the answer was immediatelikewise simple  i do not believe in it mr whipple  the judge shot out of his chair like a long jackinthe box and towered to his full height  mr brice did you or did you not buy a woman at auction today  i did sir  mr whipple literally staggered but stephen caught a glimpse of the colonels hand slipping from his chin cover his mouth  good god sir cried the judge and he sat down heavily you say that you are an abolitionist  no sir i do not say that but it does not need an abolitionist to condemn what i saw this morning  are you a slaveowner sir said mr whipple  yes sir  then get your coat and hat and leave my office mr brice  stephens coat was on his arm he slipped it on and turned to go he was if the truth were told more amused than angry it was colonel carvels voice that stopped him  hold on judge he drawled i reckon you havent got all the packing out of that case  mr whipple locked at him in a sort of stupefaction then he glanced at stephen  come back here sir he cried ill give you hearing no man shall say that i am not just  stephen looked gratefully at the colonel  i did not expect one sir he said  and you dont deserve one sir cried the judge  i think i do replied stephen quietly  the judge suppressed something  what did you do with this person he demanded  i took her to miss cranes boardinghouse said stephen  it was the colonels turn to explode the guffaw which came from hire drowned every other sound  good god said the judge helplessly again he looked at the colonel and this time something very like mirth shivered his lean frame and what do you intend to do with her he asked in strange tones  to give her freedom sir as soon as i can find somebody to go on her bond  again silence mr whipple rubbed his nose with more than customary violence and looked very hard at mr carvel whose face was inscrutable it was a solemn moment  mr brice said the judge at length take off your coat sir i will go her bond  it was stephens turn to be taken aback he stood regarding the judge curiously wondering what manner of man he was he did not know that this question had puzzled many before him  thank you sir he said  his hand was on the knob of the door when mr whipple called him back abruptly his voice had lost some of its gruffness  what were your fathers ideas about slavery mr brice  the young man thought a moment as if seeking to be exact  i suppose he would have put slavery among the necessary evils sir he said at length but he never could bear to have the liberator mentioned in his presence he was not at all in sympathy with phillips or parker or summer and such was the general feeling among his friends  then said the judge contrary to popular opinion in the west and south boston is not all abolition  stephen smiled  the conservative classes are not at all abolitionists sir  the conservative classes growled the judge the conservative classes i am tired of hearing about the conservative classes why not come out with it sir and say the moneyed classes who would rather see souls held in bondage than risk their worldly goods in an attempt to liberate them  stephen flushed it was not at all clear to him then how he was to get along with judge whipple but he kept his temper  i am sure that you do them an injustice sir he said with more feeling them he had yet shown i am not speaking of the rich alone and i think that if you knew boston you would not say that the conservative class there is wholly composed of wealthy people many of may fathers friends were by no means wealthy and i know that if he had been poor he would have held the same views  stephen did not mark the quick look of approval which colonel carvel gave him judge whipple merely rubbed his nose  well sir he said what were his views then  my father regarded slaves as property sir and conservative people stephen stuck to the word respect property the world over my fathers argument was this if men are deprived by violence of one kind of property which they hold under the law all other kinds of property will be endangered the result will be anarchy furthermore he recognized that the economic conditions in the south make slavery necessary to prosperity and he regarded the covenant made between the states of the two sections as sacred  there was a brief silence during which the uncompromising expression of the judge did not change  and do you sir he demanded  i am not sure sir after what i saw yesterday ii must have time to see more of it  good lord said colonel carvel if the conservative people of the north act this way when they see a slave sale what will the abolitionists do whipple he added slowly but with conviction this means war  then the colonel got to his feet and bowed to stephen with ceremony  whatever you believe sir he said permit me to shake your hand you are a brave man sir and although my own belief is that the black race is held in subjection by a divine decree i can admire what you have done mr brice it was a noble act sira right noble act and i have more respect for the people of boston now sir than i ever had before sir  having delivered himself of this somewhat dubious compliment which he meant well the colonel departed  judge whipple said nothing     chapter vii callers  if the brices had created an excitement upon their arrival it was as nothing to the mad delirium which raged at miss cranes boardinghouse during the second afternoon of their stay twenty times was miss crane on the point of requesting mrs brice to leave and twenty times by the advice of mrs abner deed she desisted the culmination came when the news leaked out that mr stephen brice had bought the young woman in order to give her freedom like those who have done noble acts since the world began stephen that night was both a hero and a fool the cream from which heroes is made is very apt to turn  phew cried stephen when they had reached their room after tea wasnt that meal a fearful experience lets find a hovel mother and go and live in it we cant stand it here any longer  not if you persist in your career of reforming an institution my son answered the widow smiling  it was beastly hard luck said he that i should have been shouldered with that experience the first day but i have tried to think it over calmly since and i can see nothing else to have done he paused in his pacing up and down a smile struggling with his serious look it was quite a hotheaded business for one of the staid brices wasnt it  the family has never been called impetuous replied his mother it must be the western air  he began his pacing again his mother had not said one word about the money neither had he once more he stopped before her  we are at least a year nearer the poorhouse he said you havent scolded me for that i should feel so much better if you would  oh stephen dont say that she exclaimed god has given me no greater happiness in this life than the sight of the gratitude of that poor creature nancy i shall never forget the old womans joy at the sight of her daughter it made a palace out of that dingy furniture shop hand me my handkerchief dear  stephen noticed with a pang that the lace of it was frayed and torn at the corner  there was a knock at the door  come in said mrs brice hastily putting the handkerchief down  hester stood on the threshold and old nancy beside her  evenin mis brice de good lawd bless you lady an miste brice said the old negress  well nancy  nancy pressed into the room mis brice  yes  ain you gwineter low hester an me to wuk fo you  indeed i should be glad to nancy but we are boarding  yassm yassm said nancy and relapsed into awkward silence then again mis brice  yes nancy  ef you lows us t come heah an straighten out you close an mend emyou dunno how happy you mek me an hesterdes to do dat much mis brice  the note of appeal was irresistible mrs brice rose and unlocked the trunks  you may unpack them nancy she said  with what alacrity did the old woman take off her black bonnet and shawl whaffor you stannin dere hester she cried  hester is tired said mrs brice compassionately and tears came to her eyes again at the thought of what they had both been through that day  tired said nancy holding up her hands nom she ain tired she des kinder stupefied by you goodness mis brice  a scene was saved by the appearance of miss cranes hired girl  mr and mrs cluyme in the parlor mum she said  if mr jacob cluyme sniffed a little as he was ushered into miss cranes best parlor it was perhaps because of she stuffy dampness of that room mr cluyme was one of those persons the effusiveness of whose greeting does not tally with the limpness of their grasp he was attempting when stephen appeared to get a little heat into his hands by rubbing them as a man who kindles a stick of wood for a visitor the gentleman had red chopwhiskersto continue to put his worst side foremost which demanded a ruddy face he welcomed stephen to st louis with neighborly effusion while his wife a round little woman bubbled over to mrs brice  my dear sir said mr cluyme i used often to go to boston in the forties in factahemi may claim to be a new englander alas no i never met your father but when i heard of the sad circumstances of his death i felt as if i had lost a personal friend his probity sir and his religious principles were an honor to the athens of america i have listened to my friend mr atterburymr samuel atterburyeulogize him by the hour  stephen was surprised  why yes said he mr atterbury was a friend  of course said mr cluyme i knew it four years ago the last business trip i made to boston i met atterbury on the street absence makes no difference to some men sir nor the west for that matter they never change atterbury nearly took me in his arms my dear fellow he cried how long are you to be in town i was going the next day sorry i cant ask you to dinner says he but step into the tremont house and have a bitewasnt that like atterbury  stephen thought it was but mr cluyme was evidently expecting no answer  well said he what i was going to say was that we heard you were in town friends of samuel atterbury my dear i said to my wife we are neighbors mr brace you must know the girls you must come to supper we live very plainly sir very simply i am afraid that you will miss the luxury of the east and some of the refinement stephen i hope i may call you so my boy we have a few cultured citizens stephen but all are not so i miss the atmosphere i seemed to live again when i got to boston but business sirthe making of money is a sordid occupation you will come to supper  i scarcely think that my mother will go out said stephen  oh be friends it will cheer her not a dinnerparty my boy only a plain comfortable meal with plenty to eat of course she will of course she will not a boston social function you understand boston stephen i have always looked upon as the centre of the universe our universe i mean america for americans is a motto of mine oh no he added quickly i dont mean a know nothing religious freedom my boy is part of our great constitution by the way stephenatterbury always had such a respect for your fathers opinions  my father was not an abolitionist sir said stephen smiling  quite right quite right said mr cluyme  but i am not sure since i have come here that i have not some sympathy and respect for the abolitionists  mr cluyme gave a perceptible start he glanced at the heavy hangings on the windows and then out of the open door into the hall for a space his wifes chatter to mrs brace on boston fashions filled the room  my dear stephen said the gentleman dropping his voice that is all very well in boston but take a little advice from one who is old enough to counsel you you are young and you must learn to temper yourself to the tone of the place which you have made your home st louis is full of excellent people but they are not precisely abolitionists we are gathering it is true a small party who are for gradual emancipation but our new england population here is small yet compared to the southerners and they are very violent sir  stephen could not resist saying judge whipple does not seem to have tempered himself sir  silas whipple is a fanatic sir cried mr cluyme  his hand is against every mans he denounces douglas on the slightest excuse and would go to washington when congress opens to fight with stephens and toombs and davis but what good does it do him he might have been in the senate or on the supreme bench had he not stirred up so much hatred and yet i cant help liking whipple do you know him  a resounding ring of the doorbell cut off stephens reply and mrs cluymes small talk to mrs brice in the hall rumbled a familiar voice and in stalked none other than judge whipple himself without noticing the other occupants of the parlor he strode up to mrs brice looked at her for an instant from under the grizzled brows and held out his large hand  pray maam he said what have you done with your slave  mrs cluyme emitted a muffled shriek like that of a person frightened in a dream her husband grasped the curved back of his chair but stephen smiled and his mother smiled a little too  are you mr whipple she asked  i am madam was the reply  my slave is upstairs i believe unpacking my trunks said mrs brice  mr and mrs cluyme exchanged a glance of consternation then mrs cluyme sat down again rather heavily as though her legs had refused to hold her  well well maam the judge looked again at mrs brice and a gleam of mirth lighted the severity of his face he was plainly pleased with herthis serene lady in black whose voice had the sweet ring of women who are well born and whose manner was so selfcontained to speak truth the judge was prepared to dislike her he had never laid eyes upon her and as he walked hither from his house he seemed to foresee a helpless little woman who once he had called would fling her boston pride to the winds and dump her woes upon him he looked again and decidedly approved of mrs brice and was unaware that his glance embarrassed her  mr whipple she saiddo you know mr and mrs cluyme  the judge looked behind him abruptly nodded ferociously at mr cluyme and took the hand that fluttered out to him from mrs cluyme  know the judge exclaimed that lady i reckon we do and my belle is so fond of him she thinks there is no one equal to mr whipple judge you must come round to a family supper belle will surpass herself  umph said the judge i think i like edith best of your girls maam  edith is a good daughter if i do say it myself said mrs cluyme i have tried to do right by my children she was still greatly flustered and curiosity about the matter of the slave burned upon her face neither the judge nor mrs brice were people one could catechise stephen scanning the judge was wondering how far he regarded the matter as a joke  well madam said mr whipple as he seated himself on the other end of the horsehair sofa ill warrant when you left boston that you did not expect to own a slave the day after you arrived in st louis  but i do not own her said mrs brice it is my son who owns her  this was too much for mr cluyme  what he cried to stephen you own a slave you a mere boy have bought a negress  and what is more sir i approve of it the judge put in severely i am going to take the young man into my office  mr cluyme gradually retired into the back of his chair looking at mr whipple as though he expected him to touch a match to the window curtains but mr cluyme was elastic  pardon me judge said he but i trust that i may be allowed to congratulate you upon the abandonment of principles which i have considered a clog to your career they did you honor sir but they were quixotic i sir am for saving our glorious union at any cost and we have no right to deprive our brethren of their property of their very means of livelihood  the judge grinned diabolically mrs cluyme was as yet too stunned to speak only stephens mother sniffed gunpowder in the air  this mr cluyme said the judge mildly is an age of shifting winds it was not long ago he added reflectively when you and i met in the planters house and you declared that every drop of northern blood spilled in kansas was in a holy cause do you remember it sir  mr cluyme and mr cluymes wife alone knew whether he trembled  and i repeat that sir he cried with far too much zeal i repeat it here and now and yet i was for the omnibus bill and i am with mr douglas in his local sovereignty i am willing to bury my abhorrence of a relic of barbarism for the sake of union and peace  well sir i am not retorted the judge like lightning he rubbed the red spat on his nose and pointed a bony finger at mr cluyme many a criminal had grovelled before that finger i too am for the union and the union will never be safe until the greatest crime of modern times is wiped out in blood mind what i say mr cluyme in blood sir he thundered  poor mrs cluyme gasped  but the slave sir did i not understand you to approve of mr brices ownership  as i never approved of any other good night sir good night madam but to mrs brice he crossed over and took her hand it has been further claimed that he bowed this is not certain  good night madam he said i shall call again to pay my respects when you are not occupied     volume 2     chapter viii bellegarde  miss virginia carvel came down the steps in her ridinghabit and ned who had been waiting in the street with the horses obsequiously held his hand while his young mistress leaped into vixens saddle leaving the darkey to follow upon black calhoun she cantered off up the street greatly to the admiration of the neighbor they threw open their windows to wave at her but virginia pressed her lips and stared straight ahead she was going out to see the russell girls at their fathers country place on bellefontaine road especially to proclaim her detestation for a certain young yankee upstart she had unbosomed herself to anne brinsmade and timid eugenie renault the day before  it was indian summer the gold and purple season of the year frost had come and gone wasps were buzzing confusedly about the eaves again marvelling at the balmy air and the two misses russell puss and emily were seated within the wide doorway at needlework when virginia dismounted at the horseblock  oh jinny im so glad to see you said miss russell heres elise saint simon from new orleans you must stay all day and tonight  i cant puss said virginia submitting impatiently to miss russells warm embrace she was disappointed at finding the stranger i only cameto say that i am going to have a birthday party in a few weeks you must be sure to come and bring your guest  virginia took her bridle from ned and miss russells hospitable face fell  youre not going she said  to bellegarde for dinner answered virginia  but its only ten oclock said puss and jinny  yes  theres a new young man in town and they do say his appearance is very strikingnot exactly handsome you know but stronglooking  hes horrid said virginia hes a yankee  how do you know demanded puss and emily in chorus  and hes no gentleman said virginia  but how do you know jinny  hes an upstart  oh but he belongs to a very good boston family they say  there are no good boston families replied virginia with conviction as she separated her reins he has proved that who ever heard of a good yankee family  what has he done to you virginia asked puss who had brains  virginia glanced at the guest but her grievance was too hot within her for suppression  do you remember mr benbows hester girls the one i always said i wanted she was sold at auction yesterday pa and i were passing the court house with clarence when she was put up for sale we crossed the street to see what was going on and there was your stronglooking yankee standing at the edge of the crowd i am quite sure that he saw me as plainly as i see you puss russell  how could he help it said puss slyly  virginia took no notice of the remark  he heard me ask pa to buy her he heard clarence say that he would bid her in for me i know he did and yet he goes in and outbids clarence and buys her himself do you think any gentleman would do that puss russell  he bought her himself cried the astonished miss russell why i thought that all bostonians were abolitionists  then he set her free said miss carvel contemptuously judge whipple went on her bond today  oh im just crazy to see him now said miss russell  ask him to your party virginia she added mischievously  do you think i would have him in my house cried virginia  miss russell was likewise courageousi dont see why not you have judge whipple every sunday dinner and hes an abolitionist  virginia drew herself up  judge whipple has never insulted me she said with dignity  puss gave way to laughter whereupon despite her protests and prayers for forgiveness virginia took to her mare again and galloped off they saw her turn northward on the bellefontaine road  presently the woodland hid from her sight the noble river shining far below and virginia pulled vixen between the gateposts which marked the entrance to her aunts place bellegarde half a mile through the cool forest the black dirt of the driveway flying from vixens hoofs and there was the colfax house on the edge of the gentle slope and beyond it the orchard and the blue grapes withering on the vinesand beyond that fields and fields of yellow stubble the silver smoke of a steamboat hung in wisps above the water a young negro was busily washing the broad veranda but he stopped and straightened at sight of the young horsewoman  sambo wheres your

his arms but she drew back from his grasp  why jinny he cried whats the matter  nothing max she often called him so his middle name being maxwell but you have no right to do that  to do what said clarence making a face  you know answered virginia curtly wheres aunt lillian  why havent i the right he asked ignoring the inquiry  because you have not unless i choose and i dont choose  are you

he replied apologetically i rode over to the race track to see the new trotter ive called him halcyon jinny he continued with enthusiasm and hell win the handicap sure  she sat down on the veranda steps with her knees crossed and her chin resting on her hands the air was heavy with the perfume of the grapes and the smell of late flowers from the sunken garden near by a blue haze hung over the illinois shore  max you promised me you wouldnt drink so much  and i havent been jinny pon my word he replied but i met old sparks at the tavern and he started to talk about the horses andand he insisted  and you hadnt the strength of character she said scornfully to refuse  pshaw jinny a gentleman must be a gentleman im no yankee  for a space virginia answered nothing then she said without changing her position  if you were you might be worth something  virginia  she did not reply but sat gazing toward the water he began to pace the veranda fiercely  look here jinny he cried pausing in front of her there are some things you cant say to me even in jest  virginia rose flicked her ridingwhip and started down the steps  dont be a fool max she said  he followed her bewildered she skirted the garden passed the orchard and finally reached a summer house perched on a knoll at the edge of the wood then she seated herself on a bench silently he took a place on the opposite side with his feet stretched out dejectedly  im tired trying to please you he said i have been a fool you dont care that for me it was all right when i was younger when there was no one else to take you riding and jump off the barn for your amusement miss now you have tom catherwood and jack brinsmade and the russell boys running after you its different i reckon ill go to kansas there are yankees to shoot in kansas  he did not see her smile as he sat staring at his feet  max said she all at once why dont you settle down to something why dont you work  young mr colfaxs arm swept around in a circle  there are twelve hundred acres to look after here and a few niggers thats enough for a gentleman  pooh exclaimed his cousin this isnt a cotton plantation aunt lillian doesnt farm for money if she did you would have to check your extravagances mighty quick sir  i look after pompeys reports i do as much work as my ancestors answered clarence hotly  ah that is the trouble said virginia  what do you mean her cousin demanded  we have been gentlemen too long said virginia  the boy straightened up and rose the pride and wilfulness of generations was indeed in his handsome face and something else went with it around the mouth a grave tinge of indulgence  what has your life been she went on speaking rapidly a mixture of gamecocks and ponies and race horses and billiards and idleness at the virginia springs and fighting with other boys what do you know you wouldnt go to college you wouldnt study law you cant write a decent letter you dont know anything about the history of your country what can you do  i can ride and fight he said i can go to new orleans tomorrow to join walkers nicaragua expedition weve got to beat the yankeestheyll have kansas away from us before we know it  virginias eye flashed appreciation  do you remember jinny he cried one day long ago when those dutch ruffians were teasing you and anne on the road and bert russell and jack and i came along we whipped em jinny and my eye was closed and you were bathing it here and one of my buttons was gone and you counted the rest  rich man poor man beggarman thief doctor lawyer merchant chief she recited laughing she crossed over and sat beside him and her tone changed max cant you understand it isnt that max if you would only work at something that is why the yankees beat us if you would learn to weld iron or to build bridges or railroads or if you would learn business and go to work in pas store  you do not care for me as i am  i knew that you did not understand she answered passionately it is because i care for you that i wish to make you great you care too much for a good time for horses max you love the south but you think too little how she is to be saved if war is to come we shall want men like that captain robert lee who was here a man who can turn the forces of the earth to his own purposes  for a moment clarence was moodily silent  i have always intended to go into politics after pas example he said at length  then began virginia and paused  then he said  thenyou must study law  he gave her the one keen look and she met it with her lips tightly pressed together then he smiled  virginia you will never forgive that yankee brice  i shall never forgive any yankee she retorted quickly but we are not talking about him i am thinking of the south and of you  he stooped toward her face but she avoided him and went back to the bench  why not he said  you must prove first that you are a man she said  for years he remembered the scene the vineyard the yellow stubble and the river rushing on and on with tranquil power and the slow panting of the steamboat a doe ran out of the forest and paused her head raised not twenty feet away  and then you will marry me jinny he asked finally  before you may hope to control another we shall see whether you can control yourself sir  but it has all been arranged he exclaimed since we played here together years ago  no one shall arrange that for me replied virginia promptly and i should think that you would wish to have some of the credit for yourself  jinny  again she avoided him by leaping the low railing the doe fled into the forest whistling fearfully virginia waved her hand to him and started toward the house at the corner of the porch she ran into her aunt mrs colfax was a beautiful woman beautiful when addison colfax married her in kentucky at nineteen beautiful still at three and forty this i am aware is a bald statement prove it you say we do not believe it it was told you by some old beau who lives upon the memory of the past  ladies a score of different daguerrotypes of lillian colfax are in existence and whatever may be said of portraits daguerrotypes do not flatter all the town admitted that she was beautiful all the town knew that she was the daughter of old judge colfaxs overseer at halcyondale if she had not been beautiful addison colfax would not have run away with her that is certain he left her a rich widow at five and twenty mistress of the country place he had bought on the bellefontaine road near st louis and when mrs colfax was not dancing off to the virginia wateringplaces bellegarde was a gay house  jinny exclaimed her aunt how you scared me what on earth is the matter  nothing said virginia  she refused to kiss me put in clarence half in play half in resentment  mrs colfax laughed musically she put one of her white hands on each of her nieces cheeks kissed her and then gazed into her face until virginia reddened  law jinny youre quite pretty said her aunt  i hadnt realized itbut you must take care of your complexion youre horribly sunburned and you let your hair blow all over your face its barbarous not to wear a mask when you ride your pa doesnt look after you properly i would ask you to stay to the dance tonight if your skin were only white instead of red youre old enough to know better virginia mr vance was to have driven out for dinner have you seen him clarence  no mother  he is so amusing mrs colfax continued and he generally brings candy i shall die of the blues before supper she sat down with a grand air at the head of the table while alfred took the lid from the silver souptureen in front of her jinny cant you say something bright do i have to listen to clarences horse talk for another hour tell me some gossip will you have some gumbo soup  why do you listen to clarences horse talk said virginia why dont you make him go to work  mercy said mrs colfax laughing what could he do  thats just it said virginia he hasnt a serious interest in life  clarence looked sullen and his mother as usual took his side  what put that into your head jinny she said he has the place here to look after a very gentlemanly occupation thats what they do in virginia  yes said virginia scornfully were all gentlemen in the south what do we know about business and developing the resources of the country not that  you make my head ache my dear was her aunts reply where did you get all this  you ask me because i am a girl said virginia you believe that women were made to look at and to play withnot to think but if we are going to get ahead of the yankees we shall have to think it was all very well to be a gentleman in the days of my greatgrandfather but now we have railroads and steamboats and who builds them the yankees we of the south think of our ancestors and drift deeper and deeper into debt we know how to fight and we know how to command but we have been ruined by here she glanced at the retreating form of alfred and lowered her voice by niggers  mrs colfaxs gaze rested languidly on her nieces faces which glowed with indignation  you get this terrible habit of argument from comyn she said he ought to send you to boardingschool how mean of mr vance not to come youve been talking with that old reprobate whipple why does comyn put up with him  he isnt an old reprobate said virginia warmly  you really ought to go to school said her aunt dont be eccentric it isnt fashionable i suppose you wish clarence to go into a factory  if i were a man said virginia and going into a factory would teach me how to make a locomotive or a cotton press or to build a bridge i should go into a factory we shall never beat the yankees until we meet them on their own ground  there is mr vance now said mrs colfax and added fervently thank the lord     chapter ix a quiet sunday in locust street  if the truth were known where virginia got the opinions which she expressed so freely to her aunt and cousin it was from colonel carvel himself the colonel would rather have denounced the dred scott decision than admit to judge whipple that one of the greatest weaknesses of the south lay in her lack of mechanical and manufacturing ability but he had confessed as much in private to captain elijah brent the colonel would often sit for an hour or more after supper with his feet tucked up on the mantel and his hat on the back of his head buried in thought then he would saunter slowly down to the planters house bar which served the purposes of a club in those days in search of an argument with other prominent citizens the colonel had his own particular chair in his own particular corner which was always vacated when he came in at the door and then he always had three fingers of the best bourbon whiskey no more and no less every evening  he never met his bosom friend and pet antagonist at the planters house bar judge whipple indeed took his meals upstairs but he never descendedit was generally supposed because of the strong slavery atmosphere there however the judge went periodically to his friends for a quiet sunday dinner so called in derision by st louisans on which occasions virginia sat at the end of the table and endeavored to pour water on the flames when they flared up too fiercely  the sunday following her ride to bellegarde was the judges sunday certain tastes which she had inherited had hitherto provided her with pleasurable sensations while these battles were in progress more than once had she scored a fair hit on the judge for her fatherto the mutual delight of both gentlemen but today she dreaded being present at the argument just why she dreaded it is a matter of feminine psychology best left to the reader for solution  the argument began as usual with the tearing apart limb by limb of the unfortunate franklin pierce by judge whipple  what a miserable exhibition in the eyes of the world said the judge franklin pierce of new hampshire he pronounced this name with infinite scorn managed by jefferson davis of mississippi  and he was well managed sir said the colonel  what a pliant tool of your southern slaveholders i hear that you are to give him a plantation as a reward  no such thing sir  he deserves it continued the judge with conviction see the magnificent forts he permitted davis to build up in the south the arsenals he let him stock the country does not realize this but the day will come when they will execrate pierce before benedict arnold sir and look at the infamous kansasnebraska act that is the greatest crime and douglas and pierce the greatest criminals of the century  do have some more of that fried chicken judge said virginia  mr whipple helped himself fiercely and the colonel smiled  you should be satisfied now said he another northern man is in the white house  buchanan roared the judge with his mouth full  another traitor sir another traitor worse than the first he swallows the dred scott decision and smirks what a blot on the history of this republic o lord cried mr whipple what are we coming to a northern man he could gag and bind kansas and force her into slavery against the will of her citizens he packs his cabinet to support the ruffians you send over the borders the very governors he ships out there his henchmen have their stomachs turned look at walker whom they are plotting against in washington he cant stand the smell of this lecompton constitution buchanan is trying to jam down their throats jefferson davis would have troops there to be sure that it goes through if he had his way cant you see how one sin leads to another carvel how slavery is rapidly demoralizing a free people  it is because you wont let it alone where it belongs sir retorted the colonel it was seldom that he showed any heat in his replies he talked slowly and he had a way of stretching forth his hand to prevent the more eager judge from interrupting him  the welfare of the whole south as matters now stand sir depends upon slavery our plantations could not exist a day without slave labor if you abolished that institution judge whipple you would ruin millions of your fellowcountrymenyou would reduce sovereign states to a situation of disgraceful dependence and all sir now he raised his voice lest the judge break in all sir for the sake of a low breed that aint fit for freedom you and i who have the magna charta and the declaration of independence behind us who are descended from a race that has done nothing but rule for ten centuries and more may well establish a republic where the basis of stability is the selfcontrol of the individualas long as men such as you and i form its citizens look at the south americans how do republics go there and the minute you and i let in niggers who havent any more selfcontrol than dogs on an equal basis with as much of a vote as you haveniggers sir that have lived like wild beasts in the depths of the jungle since the days of hamwhats going to become of our republic  education cried the judge  but the word was snatched out of his mouth  education isnt a matter of one generation no sir nor two nor three nor four but of centuries  sir said the judge i can point out negroes of intelligence and learning  and i reckon you could teach some monkeys to talk english and recite the catechism and sing emotional hymns if you brought over a couple of million from africa answered the colonel dryly as he rose to put on his hat and light a cigar  it was his custom to offer a cigar to the judge who invariably refused and rubbed his nose with scornful violence  virginia on the verge of leaving stayed on fascinated by the turn the argument had taken  your prejudice is hidebound sir said mr whipple  no whipple said the colonel when god washed off this wicked earth and started new he saw fit to put the sons of ham in subjection theyre slaves of each other in africa and i reckon theyre treated no better than they are here abuses cant be helped in any system sir though we are bettering them were the poor in london in the days of the edwards as well off as our niggers are today  the judge snorted  a divine institution he shouted a black curse because the world has been a wicked place of oppression since noahs day is that any reason why it should so continue until the day of judgment  the colonel smiled which was a sign that he was pleased with his argument  now see here whipple said he if we had any guarantee that you would let us alone where we are to manage our slaves and to cultivate our plantations there wouldnt be any trouble but the country keeps on growing and growing and youre not content with half you want everythingall the new states must abolish slavery and after a while you will overwhelm us and ruin us and make us paupers do you wonder that we contend for our rights tooth and nail they are our rights  if it had not been for virginia and maryland and the south this nation would not be in existence  the colonel laughed  first rate jinny he cried thats so  but the judge was in a revery he probably had not heard her  the nation is going to the dogs he said mumbling rather to himself than to the others we shall never prosper until the curse is shaken off or wiped out in blood it clogs our progress our merchant marine of which we were so proud has been annihilated by these continued disturbances but sir he cried hammering his fist upon the table until the glasses rang the party that is to save us was born at pittsburgh last year on washingtons birthday the republican party sir  shucks exclaimed mr carvel with amusement the black republican party made up of old fools and young anarchists of dutchmen and niggerworshippers why whipple that partys a joke wheres your leader  in illinois was the quick response  whats his name  abraham lincoln sir thundered mr whipple and to my way of thinking he has uttered a more significant phrase on the situation than any of your washington statesmen this government said he to a friend of mine cannot exist half slave and half free  so impressively did mr whipple pronounce these words that mr carvel stirred uneasily and in spite of himself as though he were listening to an oracle he recovered instantly  hes a demagogue seeking for striking phrases sir youre too intelligent a man to be taken in by such as he  i tell you he is not sir  i know him sir cried the colonel taking down his feet hes an obscure lawyer poor white trash torn down poor my friend mr richardson of springfield tells me he is low down he was born in a log cabin and spends most of his time in a drugstore telling stories that you would not listen to judge whipple  i would listen to anything he said replied the judge poor white trash sir the greatest men rise from the people a demagogue mr whipple fairly shook with rage the nation doesnt know him yet but mark my words the day will come when it will he was ballotted for vicepresident in the philadelphia convention last year nobody paid any attention to that if the convention had heard him speak at bloomington he would have been nominated instead of fremont if the nation could have heard him he would be president today instead of that miserable buchanan i happened to be at bloomington and while the idiots on the platform were drivelling the people kept calling for lincoln i had never heard of him then ive never forgot him since he came ambling out of the back of the hall a lanky gawky looking man ridiculously ugly sir but the moment he opened his mouth he had us spellbound the language which your lowdown lawyer used was that of a godsent prophet sir he had those illinois bumpkins all worked upthe women crying and some of the men too and mad good lord they were madwe will say to the southern disunionists he criedwe will say to the southern disunionists we wont go out of the union and you shant  there was a silence when the judge finished but presently mr carvel took a match and he stood over the judge in his favorite attitudewith his feet apartas he lighted another cigar  i reckon were going to have war silas said he slowly but dont you think that your mr lincoln scares me into that belief i dont count his bluster worth a cent no sirree its this youngster who comes out here from boston and buys a nigger with all the money hes got in the world and if hes an impetuous young fool im no judge of men  appleton brice wasnt precisely impetuous remarked mr whipple and he smiled a little bitterly as though the word had stirred a memory  i like that young fellow mr carvel continued it seems to be a kind of fatality with me to get along with yankees i reckon theres a screw loose somewhere but brice acted the man all the way through he goa a fall out of you silas in your room after the show where are you going jinny  virginia had risen and she was standing very erects with a flush on her face waiting for her father to finish  to see anne brinsmade she said goodby uncle silas  she had called him so from childhood hers was the one voice that seemed to soften himit never failed he turned to her now with a movement that was almost gentle virginia i should like you to know my young yankee said he  thank you uncle silas said the girl with dignity but i scarcely think that he would care to know me he feels so strongly  he feels no stronger than i do replied the judge  you have gotten used to me in eighteen years and besides she flashed you never spent all the money you had in the world for a principle  mr whipple smiled as she went out of the door  i have spent pretty near all he said but more to himself than to the colonel  that evening some young people came in to tea two of the four big catherwood boys anne brinsmade and her brother jack puss russell and bert and eugenie renault but virginia lost her temper in an evil moment puss russell started the subject of the young yankee who had deprived her of hester puss was ably seconded by jack brinsmade whose reputation as a tormentor extended far back into his boyhood in vain did anne the peacemaker try to quench him while the big catherwoods and bert russell laughed incessantly no wonder that virginia was angry she would not speak to puss as that young lady bade her good night and the colonel coming home from an evening with mr brinsmade found his daughter in an armchair staring into the sittingroom fire there was no other light in the room her chin was in her hand and her lips were pursed  heigho said the colonel whats the trouble now  nothing said virginia  come he insisted what have they been doing to my girl  pa  yes honey  i dont want to go to balls all my life i want to go to boardingschool and learn something emily is going to monticello after christmas pa will you let me  mr carvel winced he put an arm around her he thought of his lonely widowerhood of her whose place virginia had taken  and what shall i do he said trying to smile  it will only be for a little while and monticello isnt very far pa  well well there is plenty of time to think it over between now and january he said and now i have a little favor to ask of you honey  yes she said  the colonel took the other armchair stretched his feet toward the blaze and stroked his goatee he glanced covertly at his daughters profile twice he cleared hip throat  jinny  yes pa without turning her head  jinny i was going to speak of this young brice hes a stranger here and he comes of a good family andand i like him  and you wish me to invite him to my party finished virginia  the colonel started i reckon you guessed it he said  virginia remained immovable she did not answer at once then she said  do you think in bidding against me that he behaved like a gentleman  the colonel blundered  lord virginia he said i thought you told the judge this afternoon teat it was done out of principle  virginia ignored this but she bit her lip  he is like all yankees without one bit of consideration for a woman he knew i wanted hester  what makes you imagine that he thought of you at all my dear asked her father mildly he does not know you  this time the colonel scored certainly the firelight saved virginia  he overheard our conversation she answered  i reckon that he wasnt worrying much about us and besides he was trying to save hester from jennings  i thought that you said that it was to be my party pa said virginia irrelevantly  the colonel looked thoughtful then he began to laugh  havent we enough black republican friends she asked  so you wont have him said the colonel  i didnt say that i wouldnt have him she answered  the colonel rose and brushed the ashes from his goat  by gum he said women beat me     chapter x the little house  when stephen attempted to thank judge whipple for going on hesters bond he merely said tut tut  the judge rose at six so his man shadrach told stephen he had his breakfast at the planters house at seven read the missouri democrat and returned by eight sometimes he would say good morning to stephen and richter and sometimes he would not mr whipple was out a great part of the day and he had many visitors he was a very busy man like a great specialist which he was he would see only one person at a time and stephen soon discovered that his employer did not discriminate between age or sex or importance or condition of servitude in short stephens opinion of judge whipple altered very materially before the end of that first week he saw poor women and disconsolate men go into the private room ahead of rich citizens who seemed content to wait their turn on the hard wooden chairs against the wall of the main office there was one incident in particular when a welldressed gentleman of middle age paced impatiently for two mortal hours after shadrach had taken his card into the sanctum when at last he had been admitted mr richter whispered to stephen his name it was that of a big railroad man from the east the transom let out the true state of affairs  see here callender the judge was heard to say you fellows dont like me and you wouldnt come here unless you had to but when your road gets in a tight place you turn up and expect to walk in ahead of my friends no sir if you want to see me youve got to wait  mr callender made some inaudible reply money roared the judge take your money to stetson and see if you win your case  mr richter smiled at stephen as if in sheer happiness at this vindication of an employer who had never seemed to him to need a defence  stephen was greatly drawn toward this young german with the great scar on his pleasant face and he was itching to know about that scar every day after coming in from dinner richter lighted a great brown meerschaum and read the st louis anzeiger and the westliche post often he sang quietly to himself            deutschlands sohne           laut ertone           euer vaterlandgesang           vaterland du land des ruhmes           weih zu deines heiligthumes           hutern uns and unser schwert  there were other songs too and some wonderful quality in the germans voice gave you a thrill when you heard them albeit you could not understand the words richter never guessed how stephen with his eyes on his book used to drink in those airs and presently he found out that they were inspired  the day that the railroad man called and after he and the judge had gone out together the ice was broken  you americans from the north are a queer people mr brice remarked mr richter as he put on his coat you do not show your feelings you are ashamed the judge at first i could not comprehend himhe would scold and scold but one day i see that his heart is warm and since then i love him have you ever eaten a german dinner mr brice no then you must come with me now  it was raining the streets ankledeep in mud and the beergarden by the side of the restaurant to which they went was dreary and bedraggled but inside the place was warm and cheerful inside to all intents and purposes it was germany a most genial host crossed the room to give mr richter a welcome that any man might have envied he was introduced to stephen  we were all streber together in germany said richter  you were all what asked stephen interested  strivers you might call it in english in the vaterland those who seek for higher and better thingsfor liberty and to be rid of oppressionare so called that is why we fought in 48 and lost and that is why we came here to the republic ach i fear i will never be the great lawyerbut the striver yes always we must fight once more to be rid of the black monster that sucks the blood of freedomvampire is it not so in english  stephen was astonished at this outburst  you think it will come to war  i fearyes i fear said the german shaking his head we fear we are already preparing  preparing you would fight richter you a foreigner  a foreigner cried richter with a flash of anger in his blue eyes that died as suddenly as it camedied into reproach call me not a foreignerwe germans will show whether or not we are foreigners when the time is ripe this great country belongs to all the oppressed your ancestors founded it and fought for it that the descendants of mine might find a haven from tyranny my friend onehalf of this city is german and it is they who will save it if danger arises you must come with me one night to south st louis that you may know us then you will perhaps understand stephen you will not think of us as foreign swill but as patriots who love our new vaterland even as you love it you must come to our turner halls where we are drilling against the time when the union shall have need of us  you are drilling now exclaimed stephen in still greater astonishment the germans eloquence had made him tingle even as had the songs  prosit deine blume answered richter smiling and holding up his glass of beer you will come to a commerce and see  this is not our blessed lichtenhainer that we drink at jena one may have a pint of lichtenhainer for less than a groschen at jena aber he added as he rose with a laugh that showed his strong teeth we americans are rich  as stephens admiration for his employer grew his fear of him waxed greater likewise the judges methods of teaching law were certainly not harvards methods for a fortnight he paid as little attention to the young man as he did to the messengers who came with notes and cooled their heels in the outer office until it became the judges pleasure to answer them this was a trifle discouraging to stephen but he stuck to his chitty and his greenleaf and his kent it was richter who advised him to buy whittleseys missouri form book and warned him of mr whipples hatred for the new code well that he did there came a fearful hour of judgment with the swiftness of a hawk mr whipple descended out of a clear sky and instantly the law terms began to rattle in stephens head like dried peas in a can it was the old style of pleading this time without a knowledge of which the judge declared with vehemence that a lawyer was not fit to put pen to legal cap  now sir the pleadings he cried  first said stephen was the declaration the answer to that was the plea the answer to that was the replication then came the rejoinder then the surrejoinder then the rebutter then the surrebutter but they rarely got that far he added unwisely  a good principle in law sir said the judge is not to volunteer information  stephen was somewhat cast down when he reached home that saturday evening he had come out of his examination with feathers drooping he had been given no more briefs to copy nor had mr whipple vouchsafed even to send him on an errand he had not learned how common a thing it is with young lawyers to feel that they are of no use in the world besides the rain continued this was the fifth day  his mother knitting before the fire in her own room greeted him with her usual quiet smile of welcome he tried to give her a humorous account of his catechism of the morning but failed  i am quite sure that he doesnt like me said stephen  his mother continued to smile  if he did he would not show it she answered  i can feel it said stephen dejectedly  the judge was here this afternoon said his mother  what cried stephen again this week they say that he never calls in the daytime and rarely in the evening what did he say  he said that some of this boston nonsense must be gotten out of you answered mrs brice laughing he said that you were too stiff that you needed to rub against the plain men who were building up the west who were making a vast worldpower of the original little confederation of thirteen states and stephen she added more earnestly i am not sure but what he is right  then stephen laughed and for a long time he sat staring into the fire  what else did he say he asked after a while  he told me about a little house which we might rent very cheaply too cheaply it seems the house is on this street next door to mr brinsmade to whom it belongs and mr whipple brought the key that we might inspect it tomorrow  but a servant objected stephen i suppose that we must have a servant  his mothers voice fell  that poor girl whom you freed is here to see me every day old nancy does washing but hester has no work and she is a burden to judge whipple oh no she continued in response to stephens glance the judge did not mention that but i think he had it in mind that nester might come and i am sure that she would  sunday dawned brightly after church mrs brice and stephen walked down olive street and stood looking at a tiny house wedged in between two large ones with scrolled fronts sad memories of beacon street filled them both as they gazed but they said nothing of this to each other as stephen put his hand on the latch of the little iron gate a gentleman came out of the larger house next door he was past the middle age somewhat scrupulously dressed in the old fashion in swallowtail coat and black stock benevolence was in the generous mouth in the large nose that looked like washingtons and benevolence fairly sparkled in the blue eyes he smiled at them as though he had known them always and the world seemed brighter that very instant they smiled in return whereupon the gentleman lifted his hat and the kindliness and the courtliness of that bow made them very happy did you wish to look at the house madam he asked yes sir said mrs brice  allow me to open it for you he said graciously taking the key from her i fear that you will find it inconvenient and incommodious maam i should be fortunate indeed to get a good tenant  he fitted the key in the door while stephen and his mother smiled at each other at the thought of the rent the gentleman opened the door and stood aside to let them enter very much as if he were showing them a palace for which he was the humble agent  they went into the little parlor which was nicely furnished in mahogany and horsehair and it had back of it a bit of a dining room with a little porch overlooking the back yard mrs brice thought of the dark and stately highceiled diningroom she had known throughout her married days of the board from which a royal governor of massachusetts colony had eaten and some governors of the commonwealth since thank god she had not to sell that nor the brice silver which had stood on the high sideboard with the wolves and the shield upon it the widows eyes filled with tears she had not hoped again to have a home for these things nor the fathers armchair nor the few family treasures that were to come over the mountains  the gentleman with infinite tact said little but led the way through the rooms there were not many of them at the door of the kitchen he stopped and laid his hand kindly on stephens shoulder here we may not enter this is your department maam said he  finally as they stood without waiting for the gentleman who insisted upon locking the door they observed a girl in a ragged shawl hurrying up the street as she approached them her eyes were fixed upon the large house next door but suddenly as the gentleman turned she caught sight of him and from her lips escaped a cry of relief she flung open the gate and stood before him  oh mr brinsmade she cried mother is dying you have done so much for us sircouldnt you come to her for a little while she thought if she might see you once more she would die happy the voice was choked by a sob  mr brinsmade took the girls hand in his own and turned to the lady with as little haste with as much politeness as he had shown before  you will excuse me maam he said with his hat in his hand  the widow had no words to answer him but she and her son watched him as he walked rapidly down the street his arm in the girls until they were out of sight and then they walked home silently  might not the price of this little house be likewise a piece of the brinsmade charity     chapter xi the invitation  mr eliphalet hopper in his sundaybest broadcloth was a marvel of propriety it seemed to stephen that his face wore a graver expression on sunday when he met him standing on miss cranes doorstep picking the lint from his coat stephens intention was not to speak but he remembered what the judge had said to his mother and nodded why indeed should he put on airs with this man who had come to st louis unknown and unrecommended and poor who by sheer industry had made himself of importance in the large business of carvel  company as for stephen brice he was not yet earning his salt but existing by the charity of judge silas whipple  howdy mr brice said mr hopper his glance caught by the indefinable in stephens costume this would have puzzled mr hoppers tailor more  very well thanks  a fine day after the rain  stephen nodded and mr hopper entered the hours after him  be you asked to virginia carvels party he asked abruptly  i do not know miss carvel said stephen wondering how well the other did and if the truth be told he was a little annoyed at mr hoppers free use of her name  that shouldnt make no difference said eliphalet with just a shade of bitterness in his tone they keep open house like all southerners mr hopper hesitatedfor such as come well recommended i most forgot said he i callate youre not any too well recommended i most forgot that little transaction down to the court house they do say that she wanted that gal almighty badshe was most awful cut up not to get her served her right though im glad you did show her she cant have everything her own way and say he added with laughter how you did fix that there stuckup colfax boy hell never forgive you no more than she but said mr hopper meditatively it was a durnedfool trick  i think stephens critics will admit that he had a good right to be angry and that they will admire him just a little bit because he kept his temper but mr hopper evidently thought he had gone too far  she aint got no use for me neither he said  she shows poor judgment answered stephen  shes not long sighted thats sure replied eliphalet with emphasis  at dinner stephen was tried still further and it was then he made the determination to write for the newspapers in order to pay the rent on mr brinsmades house miss carvels comingout party was the chief topic  they do say the colonel is to spend a sight of money on that ball said mrs abner reed i guess it wont bankrupt him and she looked hard at mr hopper  i callate he aint pushed for money that gentleman vouchsafed  hes a good man and done well by you mr hopper  soso answered eliphalet but i will say that i done something for the colonel ive saved him a hundred times my pay since i showed old hood the leaks and i got a thousand dollar order from wright  company this week for him  i dare say youd keep a tight hand enough on expenses said miss crane half in sarcasm half in approval  if colonel carvel was doin business in new england said eliphalet hed been bankrupt long ago  that young clarence colfax mrs abner reed broke in hell get a right smart mint o money when he marries virginia they do say her mother left her independent how now mr hopper  eliphalet looked mysterious and knowing he did not reply  and young colfax aint precisely a pauper said miss crane  ill risk a good deal that she dont marry colfax said mr hopper  what on earth do you mean cried mrs abner it aint broke off  no he answered it aint broke off but i callate she wont have him when the time comes shes got too much sense  heavy at heart stephen climbed the stairs thanking heaven that he had not been drawn into the controversy a partial comprehension of mr hopper was dawning upon him he suspected that gentleman of an aggressive determination to achieve wealth and the power which comes with it for the purpose of using that power upon those beneath him nay when he thought over his conversation he suspected him of moreof the intention to marry virginia carvel  it will be seen whether stephen was right or wrong  he took a walk that afternoon as far out as a place called lindells grove which afterward became historic and when he returned to the house his mother handed him a little white envelope  it came while you were out she said  he turned it over and stared at his name written across the front in a feminine hand in those days young ladies did not write in the bold and masculine manner now deemed proper stephen stared at the note manlike and pondered  who brought it mother  why dont you open it and see asked his mother with a smile  he took the suggestion what a funny formal little note we should think it now it was not funny to stephenthen he read it and he read it again and finally he walked over to the window still holding it in his hand  some mothers would have shown their curiosity mrs brice did not wherein she proved herself their superiors in the knowledge of mankind  stephen stood for a long while looking out into the gathering dusk then he went over to the fireplace and began tearing the note into little bits only once did he pause to look again at his name on the envelope  it is an invitation to miss carvels party he said  by thursday of that week the brices with thanksgiving in their hearts had taken possession of mr brinsmades little house     chapter xii miss jinny  the years have sped indeed since that gray december when miss virginia carvel became eighteen old st louis has changed from a pleasant southern town to a bustling city and a high building stands on the site of that wide and hospitable home of colonel carvel and the colonels thoughts that morning as ned shaved him flew back through the years to a gently rolling kentucky countryside and a pillared white house among the oaks he was riding again with beatrice colfax in the springtime again he stretched out his arm as if to seize her bridlehand and he felt the thoroughbred rear then the vision faded and the memory of his dead wife became an angels face farso far away  he had brought her to st louis and with his inheritance had founded his business and built the great double house on the corner the child came and was named after the noble state which had given so many of her sons to the service of the republic  five simple happy yearsthen war a black war of conquest which like many such was to add to the nations fame and greatness glory beckoned honor calledor comyn carvel felt them with nothing of the profession of arms save that born in the carvels he kissed beatrice farewell and steamed down the mississippi a captain in missouri regiment the young wife was ailing anguish killed her had comyn carvel been selfish  ned as he shaved his masters face read his thoughts by the strange sympathy of love he had heard the last pitiful words of his mistress had listened choking to dr posthlewaite as he read the sublime service of the burial of the dead it was ned who had met his master the colonel at the levee and had fallen sobbing at his feet  long after he was shaved that morning the colonel sat rapt in his chair while the faithful servant busied himself about the room one eye on his master the while but presently mr carvels revery is broken by the swift rustle of a dress and a girlish figure flutters in and plants itself on the wide arm of his mahogany barber chair mammy easter in the door behind her and the colonel stretching forth his hands strains her to him and then holds her away that he may look and look again into her face  honey he said i was thinking of your mother  virginia raised her eyes to the painting on the wall over the marble mantel the face under the heavy coils of brown hair was sweet and gentle delicately feminine it had an expression of sorrow that seemed a prophecy  the colonels hand strayed upward to virginias head  you are not like her honey he said you may see for yourself you are more like your aunt bess who lived in baltimore and she  i know said virginia she was the image of the beauty dorothy manners who married my greatgrandfather  yes jinny replied the colonel smiling that is so you are somewhat like your greatgrandmother  somewhat cried virginia putting her hand over his mouth i like that you and captain lige are always afraid of turning my head i need not be a beauty to resemble her i know that i am like her when you took me on to calvert house to see uncle daniel that time i remember the picture by by  sir joshua reynolds  yes sir joshua  you were only eleven says the colonel  she is not a difficult person to remember  no said mr carvel laughing especially if you have lived with her  not that i wish to be that kind said virginia meditativelyto take london by storm and keep a man dangling for years  but he got her in the end said the colonel where did you hear all this he asked  uncle daniel told me he has richard carvels diary  and a very honorable record it is exclaimed the colonel jinny we shall read it together when we go avisiting to culvert house i remember the old gentleman as well as if i had seen him yesterday  virginia appeared thoughtful  pa she began pa did you ever see the pearls dorothy carvel wore on her wedding day what makes you jump like that did you ever see them  well i reckon i did replied the colonel gazing at her steadfastly  pa uncle daniel told me that i was to have that necklace when i was old enough  law said the colonel fidgeting your uncle daniel was just fooling you  hes a bachelor said virginia what use has he got for it  why says the colonel hes a young man yet your uncle only fiftythree ive known older fools than he to go and do it eh ned  yes marsa yes suh ive seed em at seventy an shufflin about peart as marse clarences gamecocks why dar was old marse ludlow  now mister johnson virginia put in severely no more about old ludlow  ned grinned from ear to ear and in the ecstasy of his delight dropped the colonels clothesbrush lan sakes he cried ef she aint recommembered recovering his gravity and the brush simultaneously he made virginia a low bow mornin miss jinny i sholy is gwinter slute you dis day may de good lawd make you happy miss jinny an give you a good husban  thank you mister johnson thank you said virginia blushing  how come she recommembered marse comyn dats de quality dats why doant you talk to ned bout de quality marsa  and when did i ever talk to you about the quality you scalawag asks the colonel laughing  th aint none cept de bes quality keep they word dataway said ned as he went off to tell uncle ben in the kitchen  was there ever in all this wide country a good cook who was not a tyrant uncle ben carvel was a veritable emperor in his own domain and the colonel himself had he desired to enter the kitchen would have been obliged to come with humble and submissive spirit as for virginia she had had since childhood more than one passage at arms with uncle ben and the question of who had come off victorious had been the subject of many a debate below stairs  there were a few days in the year however when uncle ben permitted the sanctity of his territory to be violated one was the seventh of december on such a day it was his habit to retire to the broken chair beside the sink the chair to which he had clung for fiveandtwenty years there he would sit blinking and carrying on the while an undercurrent of protests and rumblings while miss virginia and other young ladies mixed and chopped and boiled and baked and gossiped but woe to the unfortunate rosetta if she overstepped the bounds of respect woe to ned or jackson or tato if they came an inch over the threshold from the hall beyond even aunt easter stepped gingerly though she was wont to affirm when assisting miss jinny in her toilet an absolute contempt for bens commands  so ben ordered you out mammy virginia would say mischievously  order me out hugh think ise skeered o him honey reckon id frail em good ef he cotched hole of me with his black hands jes let him try to come upstairs once honey an see what i say to m  nevertheless ben had on one nevertobeforgotten occasion ordered mammy easter out and she had gone and now as she was working the beat biscuits to be baked that evening uncle bens eye rested on her with suspicion  what mere man may write with any confidence of the delicacies which were prepared in uncles kitchen that morning no need in those days of cooking schools what southern lady to the manner born is not a cook from the cradle even ben noted with approval miss virginias scorn for pecks and pints and grunted with satisfaction over the accurate pinches of spices and flavors which she used and he did miss eugenie the honor to eat one of her praleens  that night came captain lige brent the figure of an eager and determined man swinging up the street and pulling out his watch under every lamppost and in his haste in the darkness of a midblock he ran into another solid body clad in high boots and an old army overcoat beside a wood wagon  howdy captain said he of the high boots  well i just thought as much was the energetic reply minute i seen the rig i knew captain grant was behind it  he held out a big hand which captain grant clasped just looking at his own with a smile the stranger was captain elijah brent of the louisiana  now said brent ill just bet a full cargo that youre off to the planters house and smoke an el sol with the boys  mr grant nodded youre keen captain said he  ive got something here thatll outlast an el sol a whole day continued captain breast tugging at his pocket and pulling out a sixinch cigar as black as the night just you try that  the captain instantly struck a match on his boot and was puffing in a silent enjoyment which delighted his friend  reckon he dont bring out cigars when you make him a call said the steamboat captain jerking his thumb up at the house it was mr jacob cluymes  captain grant did not reply to that nor did captain lige expect him to as it was the custom of this strange and silent man to speak ill of no one he turned rather to put the stakes back into his wagon  where are you off to lige he asked  lord bless my soul said captain lige to think that i could forget he tucked a bundle tighter under his arm grant did you ever see my little sweetheart jinny carvel the captain sighed she aint little any more and she eighteen today  captain grant clapped his hand to his forehead  say lige said he that reminds me a month or so ago i pulled a fellow out of renaults area across from there first i thought he was a thief after he got away i saw the colonel and his daughter in the window  instantly captain lige became excited and seized captain grant by the cape of his overcoat  say grant what kind of appearing fellow was he  short thickset blocky face  i reckon i know said breast bringing down his fist on the wagon board ive had my eye on him for some little time  he walked around the block twice after captain grant had driven down the muddy street before he composed himself to enter the carvel mansion he paid no attention to the salutations of jackson the butler who saw him coming and opened the door but climbed the stairs to the sittingroom  why captain lige you must have put wings on the louisiana said virginia rising joyfully from the arm of her fathers chair to meet him we had given you up  what cried the captain give me up dont you know better than that what give me up when i never missed a birthdayand this the best of all of em  if your pa had got sight of me shovin in wood and cussin the pilot for slowin at the crossins hed never let you ride in my boat again bill jenks said are you plum crazy brent look at them cressets five dollars says i wouldnt go in for five hundred tomorrows jinny carvels birthday and ive just got to be there i reckon the times come when ive got to say miss jinny he added ruefully  the colonel rose laughing and hit the captain on the back  drat you lige why dont you kiss the girl cant you see shes waiting  the honest captain stole one glance at virginia and turned red copper color  shucks colonel i cant be kissing her always whatll her husband say  for an instant mr carvels brow clouded  well not talk of husbands yet awhile lige  virginia went up to captain lige deftly twisted into shape his black tie and kissed him on the check how his face burned when she touched him  there said she and dont you ever dare to treat me as a young lady why pa hes blushing like a girl i know hes ashamed to kiss me now hes going to be married at last to that creole girl in new orleans  the colonel slapped his knee winked slyly at lige while virginia began to sing         i built me a house on the mountain so high         to gaze at my true love as she do go by  theres only one id ever marry jinny protested the captain soberly and im a heap too old for her but ive seen a youngster that might mate with her colonel he added mischievously if he just wasnt a yankee jinny whats the story i hear about judge whipples young man buying hester  mr carvel looked uneasy it was virginias turn to blush and she grew red as a peony  hes a tall hateful black republican yankee she said  pheeew whistled the captain any more epithets  hes a nasty abolitionist  there you do him wrong honey the colonel put in  i hear he took hester to miss cranes the captain continued filling the room with his hearty laughter that boy has sand enough jinny id like to know him  youll have that priceless opportunity tonight retorted miss virginia as she flung herself out of the room pa has made me invite him to my party  here jinny hold on cried the captain running after her ive got something for you  she stopped on the stairs hesitating whereupon the captain hastily ripped open the bundle under his arm and produced a very handsome india shawl with a cry of delight virginia threw it over her shoulders and ran to the long glass between the high windows  who spoils her lige asked the colonel fondly  her father i reckon was the prompt reply  who spoils you jinny  captain lige said she turning to him if you had only kept the presents you have brought me from new orleans you might sell out your steamboat and be a rich man  he is a rich man said the colonel promptly did you ever miss bringing her a present lige he asked  when the cora anderson burnt answered the captain  why cried virginia you brought me a piece of her wheel with the char on it you swam ashore with it  so i did said captain brent i had forgotten that it was when the french dress with the furbelows which madame pitou had gotten me from paris for you was lost  and i think i liked the piece of wheel better says virginia it was brought me by a brave man the last to leave his boat  and who should be the last to leave but the captain i saw the thing in the water and i just thought we ought to have a relic  lige said the colonel putting up his feet do you remember the french toys you used to bring up here from new orleans  colonel replied brent do you recall the rough and uncouth young citizen who came over here from cincinnati as clerk on the vicksburg  i remember sir that he was so promising that they made him provisional captain the next trip and he was not yet twentyfour years of age  and do you remember buying the vicksburg at the sheriffs sale for twenty thousand dollars and handing her over to young brent and saying there my son shes your boat and you can pay for her when you like  shucks brent said mr carvel sternly your memorys too good but i proved myself a good business man jinny he paid for her in a year  you dont mean that you made him pay you for the boat cried jinny why pa i didnt think you were that mean  the two men laughed heartily  i was a heap meaner said her father i made him pay interest  virginia drew in her breath and looked at the colonel in amazement  hes the meanest man i know said captain lige he made me pay interest and a mint julep  upon my word pa said miss virginia soberly i shouldnt have believed it of you  just then jackson in his white jacket came to announce that supper was ready and they met ned at the diningroom door fairly staggering under a load of roses  marse clarence done send em in des picked outn de hothouse dis afternoon miss jinny jackson fotch a bowl  no said virginia she took the flowers from ned one by one and to the wonderment of captain lige and herfather strewed them hither and thither upon the table until the white cloth was hid by the red flowers the colonel stroked his goatee and nudged captain lige  lookathere now said he any other woman would have spent two mortal hours stickin em in china  virginia having critically surveyed her work amid exclamations from ned and jackson had gone around to her place and there upon her plate lay a pearl necklace for an instant she clapped her palms together staring at it in bewilderment and once more the little childish cry of delight long sweet to the colonels ears escaped her  pa she said is it and there she stopped for fear that it might not be but he nodded encouragingly  dorothy carvels necklace no it cant be  yes honey said the colonel your uncle daniel sent it as he promised and when you go upstairs if easter has done as i told her you will see a primrose dress with blue coinflowers on your bed daniel thought you might like that too for a keepsake dorothy manners wore it in london when she was a girl  and so virginia ran and threw her arms about her fathers neck and kissed him again and again and lest the captain feel badly she laid his india shawl beside her and the necklace upon it  what a joyful supper they hadjust the three of them and as the fresh roses filled the room with fragrance virginia filled it with youth and spirits and mr carvel and the captain with honest manly merriment and jackson plied captain brent who was a prime favorite in that house with broiled chicken and hot beat biscuits and with waffles until at length he lay back in his chair and heaved a sigh of content lighting a cigar and then virginia with a little curtsey to both of them ran off to dress for the party  well said captain brent i reckon therell be gay goingson here tonight i wouldnt miss the sight of em colonel for all the cargoes on the mississippi aint there anything i can do  no thank you lige mr carvel answered do you remember one morning some five years ago when i took in at the store a yankee named hopper you didnt like him i believe  captain brent jumped and the ashes of his cigar fell on his coat he had forgotten his conversation with captain grant  i reckon i do he said dryly  for a moment he was on the point of telling the affair then he desisted he could not be sure of eliphalet from grants description so he decided to await a better time captain brent was one to make sure of his channel before going ahead  well continued the colonel i have been rather pushed the last week and hopper managed things for this dance he got the music and saw the confectioner but he made such a close bargain with both of em that they came around to me afterward he added laughing  is he coming here tonight demanded the captain looking disgusted  lige replied the colonel you never do get over a prejudice yes hes coming just to oversee things he seems to have mighty little pleasure and hes got the best business head i ever did see a yankee said mr carvel meditatively as he put on his hat a yankee when he will work works like all possessed hood dont like him any more than you do but he allows hopper is a naturalborn business man last month samuels got tight and wright  company were going to place the largest order in years i called in hood go yourself colonel says he i im too old to solicit business hood said i then theres only one man to send says he young hopper hell get the order or ill give up this place ive had for twenty years hopper callated to get it and another small one pitched in and youd die laughing lige to hear how he did it  some slickness ill gamble grunted captain lige  well i reckon twas slick said the colonel thoughtfully you know old man wright hates a solicitor like poison he has his notions and maybe youve noticed signs stuck up all over his store no solicitors nor travelling men allowed here  the captain nodded  but hopperhopper walks in sir bold as you please right past the signs till he comes to the old mans cage i want to see mr wright says he to the clerk and the clerk begins to grin name please says he mr hopper whips out his business card what shouts old wright flying round in his chair what the devil does this mean cant you read sir callate to says mr hopper and you dare to come in here  business is business says hopper you callate bellowed the old man i reckon youre a damned yankee i reckon ill upset your callations for once and if i catch you in here again ill wring your neck like a roostahs git  who told you this asked captain brent  wright himselfafterward replied mr carvel laughing but listen lige the old man lives at the planters house you know what does mr hopper do but go round there that very night and give a nigger two bits to put him at the old mans table when wright comes and sees him he nearly has one of his apoplectic fits but in marches hopper the next morning with twice the order the good lord knows how he did it  there was a silence then the doorbell rang  hes dangerous said the captain emphatically thats what i call him  the yankees are changing business in this town was the colonels answer weve got to keep the pace lige     chapter xiii the party  to gentle miss anne brinsmade to puss russell of the mischievous eyes and even to timid eugenie renault the question that burned was would he come or would he not and secondarily how would virginia treat him if he came put our friend stephen for the subjective and miss carvers party for the objective in the above and we have the clew for very young girls are given to making much out of a very little in such matters if virginia had not gotten angry when she had been teased a fortnight before all would have been well  even puss who walked where angels feared to tread did not dare to go too far with virginia she had taken care before the day of the party to beg forgiveness with considerable humility it had been granted with a queenly generosity and after that none of the bevy had dared to broach the subject to virginia jack brinsmade had he told puss afterward that when virginia got through with him he felt as if he had taken a rapid trip through the wheelhouse of a large steamer puss tried by various ingenious devices to learn whether mr brice had accepted his invitation she failed  these things added a zest to a party long looked forward to amongst virginias intimates in those days young ladies did not come out so frankly as they do now mothers did not announce to the world that they possessed marriageable daughters the world was supposed to know that and then the matrimonial market was feverishly active young men proposed as naturally as they now ask a young girl to go for a walkand were refused quite as naturally an offer of marriage was not the fearful and wonderful thingto be dealt with gingerlywhich it has since become seventeen was often the age at which they began and one of the big catherwood boys had a habit of laying his heart and hand at virginias feet once a month nor did his vanity suffer greatly when she laughed at him  it was with a flutter of excitement therefore that miss carvels guests flitted past jackson who held the door open obsequiously the boldest of them took a rapid survey of the big parlor before they put foot on the stairs to see whether mr brice had yet arrived and if their curiosity held them too long they were usually kissed by the colonel  mr carvel shook hands heartily with the young mean and called them by their first names for he knew most of their fathers and grandfathers and if an older gentleman arrived perhaps the two might be seen going down the hall together arm in arm so came his beloved enemy judge whipple who did not make an excursion to the rear regions of the house with the colonel but they stood and discussed mr president buchanans responsibility for the recent panic until the band which mr hopper had stationed under the stairs drowned their voices  as we enter the room there stands virginia under the rainbowed prisms of the great chandelier receiving but here was suddenly a woman of twentyeight where only this evening we knew a slip of a girl it was a trick she had to become majestic in a ballgown she held her head high as a woman should and at her slender throat glowed the pearls of dorothy manners  the result of all this was to strike a little awe into the souls of many of her playmates little eugenie nearly dropped a curtsey belle cluyme was so impressed that she forgot for a whole hour to be spiteful but puss russell kissed her on both cheeks and asked her if she really wasnt nervous  nervous exclaimed jinny why  miss russell glanced significantly towards the doorway but she said nothing to her hostess for fear of marring an otherwise happy occasion she retired with jack brim made to a corner where she recited       oh young lochinvar is come out of the east      of millions of yankees i love him the least  what a joke if he should come cried jack  miss russell gasped  just as mr clarence colfax resplendent in new evening clothes just arrived from new york was pressing his claim for the first dance with his cousin in opposition to numerous other claims the chatter of the guests died away virginia turned her head and for an instant the pearls trembled on her neck there was a young man cordially and unconcernedly shaking hands with her father and captain lige her memory of that moment is strangely not of his face she did not deign to look at that but of the muscle of his shoulder half revealed as he stretched forth his arm  young mr colfax bent over to her ear  virginia he whispered earnestly almost fiercely virginia who invited him here  i did said virginia calmly of course who invites any one here  but cried clarence do you know who he is  yes she answered i know and is that any reason why he should not come here as a guest would you bar any gentleman from your house on account of his convictions  ah virginia who had thought to hear that argument from your lips what would frank captain lige say of the consistency of women if he heard you now and how give an account of yourself to anne brinsmade what contrariness has set you so intense against your own argument  before one can answer this before mr clarence can recover from his astonishment and remind her of her vehement words on the subject at bellegarde mr stephen is making thither with the air of one who conquers again the natural contrariness of women what barefaced impudence has he no shame that he should hold his head so high she feels her color mounting even as her resentment rises at his selfpossession and yet she would have despised him had he shown selfconsciousness in gait or manner in the sight of her assembled guests nearly as tall as the colonel himself he is plainly seen and miss puss in her corner does not have to stand on tiptoe mr carvel does the honors of the introduction  but a daughter of the carvels was not to fail before such a paltry situation as this shall it be confessed that curiosity stepped into the breach as she gave him her hand she was wondering how he would act  as a matter of fact he acted detestably he said nothing whatever but stood regarding her with a clear eye and a face by far too severe the thought that he was meditating on the incident of the auction sale crossed through her mind and made her blood simmer how dared he behave so the occasion called for a little small talk an evil spirit took possession of virginia she turned  mr brice do you know my cousin mr colfax she said  mr brice bowed i know mr colfax by sight he replied  then mr colfax made a stiff bow to this new phase his sense of humor did not rise mr brice was a yankee and no gentleman inasmuch as he had overbid a lady for hester  have you come here to live mr brice he asked  the colonel eyed his nephew sharply but stephen smiled  yes he said if i can presently make enough to keep me alive then turning to virginia he said will you dance miss carvel  the effrontery of this demand quite drew the breath from the impatient young gentlemen who had been waiting their turn several of them spoke up in remonstrance and for the moment let one confess it who knows virginia was almost tempted to lay her arm in his then she made a bow that would have been quite as effective the length of the room  thank you mr brice she said but i am engaged to mr colfax  abstractedly he watched her glide away in her cousins arms stephen had a way of being preoccupied at such times when he grew older he would walk the length of olive street look into face after face of acquaintances not a quiver of recognition in his eyes but most probably the next week he would win a brilliant case in the supreme court and so now indifferent to the amusement of some about him he stood staring after virginia and clarence where had he seen colfaxs face before he came west ah he knew many many years before he had stood with his father in the mellow light of the long gallery at hollingdean kent before a portrait of the stuarts time the face was that of one of lord northwells ancestors a sporting nobleman of the time of the second charles it was a head which compelled one to pause before it strangely enoughit was the head likewise of clarence colfax  the image of it stephen had carried undimmed in the eye of his memory whitehaired northwells story also it was not a story that mr brice had expected his small son to grasp as a matter of fact stephen had not grasped it thenbut years afterward it was not a pleasant storyand yet there was much of credit in it to the young rake its subjectof dash and courage and princely generosity beside the profligacy and incontinence  the face had impressed him with its story he had often dreamed of it and of the lace collar over the dullgold velvet that became it so well and here it was at last in a city west of the mississippi river here were the same delicately chiselled features with their pallor and satiety engraved there at one and twenty here was the same lazy scorn in the eyes and the look which sleeplessness gives to the lids the hair straight and fine and black the wilful indulgencenot of one life but of generationsabout the mouth the pointed chin and yet it was a fact to dare anything and to do anything  one thing more ere we have done with that which no man may explain had he dreamed too of the girl of virginia stephen might not tell but thrice had the colonel spoken to him before he answered  you must meet some of these young ladies sir  it was little wonder that puss russell thought him dull on that first occasion out of whom condescension is to flow is a matter of which heaven takes no cognizance to use her own words puss thought him stuck up when he should have been grateful we know that stephen was not stuck up and later miss russell learned that likewise very naturally she took preoccupation for indifference it is a matter worth recording however that she did not tease him because she did not dare he did not ask her to dance which was rude so she passed him back to mr carvel who introduced him to miss renault and miss saint cyr and other young ladies of the best french families and finally drifting hither and thither with his eyes on virginia in an evil moment he was presented to mrs colfax perhaps it has been guessed that mrs colfax was a very great lady indeed albeit the daughter of an overseer she bore addison colfaxs name spent his fortune and retained her good looks on this particular occasion she was enjoying herself quite as much as any young girl in the room and while resting from a waltz was regaling a number of gentlemen with a humorous account of a scandal at the virginia springs  none but a great lady could have meted out the punishment administered to poor stephen none but a great lady could have concerned it and he who had never been snubbed before fell headlong into her trap how was the boy to know that there was no heart in the smile with which she greeted him it was all over in an instant she continued to talk about virginia springs oh mr brice of course you have been there of course you know the edmunds no you havent been there you dont know the edmunds i thought every body had been there charles you look as if you were just dying to waltz lets have a turn before the music stops  and so she whirled away leaving stephen forlorn a little too angry to be amused just then in that state he spied a gentleman coming towards hima gentleman the sight of whom he soon came to associate with all that is good and kindly in this world mr brinsmade and now he put his hand on stephens shoulder whether he had seen the incident just past who can tell  my son said he i am delighted to see you here now that we are such near neighbors we must be nearer friends you must know my wife and my son jack and my daughter anne  mrs brinsmade was a pleasant little body but plainly not a fit mate for her husband jack gave stephen a warm grasp of the hand and an amused look as for anne she was more like her father she was stephens friend from that hour  i have seen you quite often going in at your gate mr brice and i have seen your mother too i like her said anne she has such a wonderful face and the girl raised her truthful blue eyes to his  my mother would be delighted to know you he ventured not knowing what else to say it was an effort for him to reflect upon their new situation as poor tenants to a wealthy family  oh do you think so cried anne i shall call on her tomorrow with mother do you know mr brice she continued do you know that your mother is just the person i should go to if i were in trouble whether i knew her or not  i have found her a good person in trouble said stephen simply he might have said the same of anne  anne was enchanted she had thought him cold but these words belied that she had wrapped him in that diaphanous substance with which young ladies and sometimes older ones are wont to deck their heroes she had approached a mysteryto find it human as are many mysteries but thank heaven that she found a dignity a seriousnessand these more than satisfied her likewise she discovered something she had not looked for an occasional way of saying things that made her laugh she danced with him and passed him back to miss puss russell who was better pleased this time she passed him on to her sister who also danced with him and sent him upstairs for her handkerchief  nevertheless stephen was troubled as the evening wore on he was more and more aware of an uncompromising attitude in his young hostess whom he had seen whispering to various young ladies from behind her fan as they passed her he had not felt equal to asking her to dance a second time honest captain lige breast who seemed to have taken a fancy to him bandied him on his lack of courage with humor that was a little rough and to stephens amazement even judge whipple had pricked him on  it was on his way upstairs after emily russells handkerchief that he ran across another acquaintance mr eliphalet hopper in sunday broadcloth was seated on the landing his head lowered to the level of the top of the high door of the parlor stephen caught a glimpse of the picture whereon his eyes were fixed perhaps it is needless to add that miss virginia carvel formed the central figure of it  enjoy in yourself asked mr hopper  stephen countered  are you he asked  so so said mr hopper and added darkly i aint in no hurry just now they callate im about good enough to manage the business end of an affair like this here i guess i can wait but some day said he suddenly barring stephens way some day ill give a party and hark to me when i tell you that these here aristocrats ll be glad enough to get invitations  stephen pushed past coldly this time the man made him shiver the incident was all that was needed to dishearten and disgust him kindly as he had been treated by others far back in his soul was a thing that rankled shall it be told crudely why he went that night stephen brice who would not lie to others lied to himself and when he came downstairs again and presented miss emily with her handkerchief his next move was in his mind and that was to say goodnight to the colonel and more frigidly to miss carvel herself but music has upset many a mans calculations  the strains of the jenny lind waltz were beginning to float through the rooms there was miss virginia in a corner of the big parlor for the moment alone with her cousin and thither stephen sternly strode not a sign did she give of being aware of his presence until he stood before her even then she did not lift her eyes but she said so you have come at last to try again mr brice  and mr brice said if you will do me the honor miss carvel  she did not reply at once clarence colfax got to his feet then she looked up at the two men as they stood side by side and perhaps swept them both in an instants comparison  the new englanders face must have reminded her more of her own father colonel carvel it possessed from generations known the power to control itself she afterwards admitted that she accepted him to tease clarence miss russell whose intuitions are usually correct does not believe this  i will dance with you said virginia  but once in his arms she seemed like a wild thing resisting although her gown brushed his coat the space between them was infinite and her hand lay limp in his unresponsive of his own pressure not so her feet they caught the step and moved with the rhythm of the music and round the room they swung more than one pair paused in the dance to watch them then as they glided past the door stephen was disagreeably conscious of some one gazing down from above and he recalled eliphalet hopper and his position the sneer from eliphalets seemed to penetrate like a chilly draught  all at once virginia felt her partner gathering up his strength and by some compelling force more of wild than of muscle draw her nearer unwillingly her hand tightened under his and her blood beat faster and her color came and went as they two moved as one angerhelpless angertook possession of her as she saw the smiles on the faces of her friends and puss russell mockingly throwing a kiss as she passed her and then strange in the telling a thrill as of power rose within her which she strove against in vain a knowledge of him who guided her so swiftly so unerringly which she had felt with no other man faster and faster they stepped each forgetful of self and place until the waltz came suddenly to a stop  by gum said captain lige to judge whipple you can whollop me on my own forecastle if they aint the handsomest couple i ever did see     book ii     volume 3     chapter i raw material  summer intolerable summer was upon the city at last the families of its richest citizens had fled even at that early day some braved the long railroad journey to the atlantic coast amongst these were our friends the cluymes who come not strongly into this history some went to the virginia springs but many like the brinsmades and the russells the tiptons and the hollingsworths retired to the local paradise of their country places on the bellefontaine road on the cool heights above the river thither as a respite from the hot office stephen was often invited by kind mr brinsmade who sometimes drove him out in his own buggy likewise he had visited miss puss russell but miss virginia carvel he had never seen since the night he had danced with her this was because after her return from the young ladies school at monticello she had gone to glencoe glencoe magic spot perched high on wooded highlands and under these the meramec crystal pure ran lightly on sand and pebble to her bridal with that turbid tyrant the father of waters  to reach glencoe you spent two dirty hours on that railroad which it was fondly hoped would one day stretch to the pacific ocean you generally spied one of the big catherwood boys in the train or their tall sister maude the catherwoods likewise lived at glencoe in the summer and on some saturday afternoons a grim figure in a linen duster and a silk skullcap took a seat in the forward car that was judge whipple on his way to spend a quiet sunday with colonel carvel  to the surprise of many good people the judge had recently formed another habit at least once a week he would drop in at the little house on olive street next to mr brinsmades big one which was shut up and take tea with mrs brice afterward he would sit on the little porch over the garden in the rear or on the front steps and watch the bobtailed horsecars go by his conversation was chiefly addressed to the widow rarely to stephen whose wholesome respect for his employer had in no wise abated  through the stifling heat of these summer days stephen sat in the outer office straining at the law had it not been for the fact that mr whipple went to his mothers house despair would have seized him long since apparently his goingsout and his comingsin were noted only by mr richter truly the judges methods were not harvard methods and if there were pride in the young bostonian mr whipple thought he knew the cure for it  it was to richter stephen owed a debt of gratitude in these days he would often take his midday meal in the downtown beer garden with the quiet german then there came a sunday afternoon to be marked with a red letter when richter transported him into germany itself stephens eyes were opened richter took him across the rhine the rhine was market street and south of that street was a country of which polite american society took no cognizance  here was an epic movement indeed for south st louis was a great sod uprooted from the fatherland and set down in all its vigorous crudity in the warm black mud of the mississippi valley here lager beer took the place of bourbon and black bread and sausages of hot rolls and fried chicken here were quaint market houses squatting in the middle of wide streets lutheran churches square and uncompromising and bulky turner halls where german children were taught the german tongue here in a shady grove of mulberry and locust two hundred families were spread out at their ease  for a while richter sat in silence puffing at a meerschaum with a huge brown bowl a trick of the mind opened for stephen one of the histories in his fathers library in beacon street across the pages of which had flitted the ancestors of this blueeyed and greatchested saxon he saw them in cathedral forests with the red hair long upon their bodies he saw terrifying battles with the roman empire surging back and forth through the low countries he saw a lad of twenty at the head of rugged legions clad in wild skins sweeping rome out of gaul back in the dim ages richters fathers must have defended grim eresburg and it seemed to him that in the end the new republic must profit by this rugged stock which had good women for wives and mothers and for fathers men in whose blood dwelt a fierce patriotism and contempt for cowardice  this fancy of ancestry pleased stephen he thought of the forefathers of those whom he knew who dwelt north of market street many though this generation of the french might know it not had bled at calais and at agincourt had followed the court of france in clumsy coaches to blois and amboise or lived in hovels under the castle walls others had charged after the black prince at poitiers and fought as serf or noble in the war of the roses had been hatters or tailors in cromwells armies or else had sacrificed lands and fortunes for charles stuart these english had toiled slow but resistless over the misty blue ridge after boone and harrod to this old st louis of the french their enemies whose fur traders and missionaries had long followed the veins of the vast western wilderness and now on to the structure builded by these two comes germany to be welded to strengthen or to weaken  richter put down his pipe on the table  stephen he said suddenly you do not share the prejudice against us here  stephen flushed he thought of some vigorous words that miss puss russell had used on the subject of the dutch  no said he emphatically  i am glad answered richter with a note of sadness in his voice do not despise us before you know more of us we are still feudal in germanyof the middle ages the peasant is a serf he is compelled to serve the lord of the land every year with so much labor of his hands the small farmers the gross and mittel bauern we call them are also mortgaged to the nobles who tyrannize our vaterland our merchants are little merchantsshopkeepers you would say my poor father an educated man was such they fought our revolution  and now said stephen why do they not keep their hold  richter sighed  we were unused to ruling he answered we knew not how to actwhat to do you must remember that we were not trained to govern ourselves as are you of the english race from children those who have been for centuries ground under heel do not make practical parliamentarians no your heritage is libertyyou americans and english and we germans must desert our native land to partake of it  and was it not hard to leave asked stephen gently  the eyes of the german filled at the recollection nor did he seem ashamed of his tears  i had a poor old father whose life was broken to save the vaterland but not his spirit he cried no not that my father was born in 1797 god directed my grandfather to send him to the kolnisches gymnasium where the great jahn taught jahn was our washington the father of germany that is to be  then our fatherland was french our women wore parisian clothes and spoke the language french immorality and atheism had spread like a plague among us napoleon the vile had taken the sword of our frederick from berlin it was father jahn so we love to call him it was father jahn who founded the turnschulen that the generations to come might return to simple german waysplain fare high principles our native tongue and the development of the body the downfall of the fiend napoleon and the vaterland unitedthese two his scholars must have written in their hearts all summer long in their black caps and linen pantaloons they would trudge after him begging a crust here and a cheese there to spread his teachings far and wide under the thatched roofs  then came 1811 i have heard my father tell how in the heat of that year a great red comet burned in the sky even as that we now see my friend god forbid that this portends blood but in the coming spring the french conscripts filled our sacred land like a swarm of locusts devouring as they went and at their head with the pomp of darius rode that destroyer of nations and homes napoleon what was germany then ashes but the red embers were beneath fanned by father jahn napoleon at dresden made our princes weep never even in the days of the frankish kings had we been so humbled he dragged our young men with him to russia and left them to die moaning on the frozen wastes while he drove off in his sledge  it was the next year that germany rose high and low rich and poor jaeger and landwehr came flocking into the army and even the old men the landsturm russia was an ally and later austria my father a last of sixteen was in the landwehr under the noble blucher in silesia when they drove the french into the katzbach and the neisse swollen by the rains into torrents it had rained until the forests were marshes powder would not burn but blucher ah there was a man he whipped his great sabre from under his cloak crying vorwarts vorwarts and the landwehr with one great shout slew their enemies with the butts of their muskets until their arms were weary and the bodies were tossed like logs in the foaming waters they called blucher marachall vorwarts  then napoleon was sent to elba but the victors quarrelled amongst themselves while talleyrand and metternich tore our vaterland into strips and set brother against brother and our blood and the grief for the widows and the fatherless went for nothing  richter paused to light his pipe  after a while he continued presently came the german confederation with austria at the head rid of napoleon we had another despot in metternich but the tree which jahn had planted grew and its branches spread the great master was surrounded by spies my father had gone to jena university when he joined the burschenschaft or students league of which i will tell you later it was pledged to the rescue of the vaterland he was sent to prison for dipping his handkerchief in the blood of sand beheaded for liberty at mannheim afterwards he was liberated and went to berlin and married my mother who died when i was young twice again he was in prison because the societies met at his house we were very poor my friend you in america know not the meaning of that word his health broke and when 48 came he was an old man his hair was white and he walked the streets with a crutch but he had saved a little money to send me to jena  he was proud of me i was bigboned and fair like my mother and when i came home at the end of a semester i can see him now as he would hobble to the door wearing the red and black and gold of the burschenschaft and he would keep me up half the nighttelling him of our schlager fights with the aristocrats my father had been a noted swordsman in his day  he stopped abruptly and colored for stephen was staring at the jagged scar he had never summoned the courage to ask richter how he came by it  schlager fights he exclaimed  broadswords answered the german hastily some day i will tell you of them and of the struggle with the troops in the breite strasse in march we lost as i told you because we knew not how to hold what we had gained  i left germany hoping to make a home here for my poor father how sad his face as he kissed me farewell and he said to me carl if ever your new vaterland the good republic be in danger sacrifice all i have spent my years in bondage and i say to you that life without liberty is not worth the living three months i was gone and he was dead without that for which he had striven so bravely he never knew what it is to have an abundance of meat he never knew from one day to the other when he would have to embrace me all he owned and march away to prison because he was a patriot richters voice had fallen low but now he raised it do you think my friend he cried do you think that i would not die willingly for this new country if the time should come yes and there are a million like me once german now american who will give their lives to preserve this union for without it the world is not fit to live in  stephen had food for thought as he walked northward through the strange streets on that summer evening here indeed was a force not to be reckoned and which few had taken into account     chapter ii abraham lincoln  it is sometimes instructive to look back and see hour destiny gave us a kick here and fate a shove there that sent us in the right direction at the proper time and when stephen brice looks backward now he laughs to think that he did not suspect the judge of being an ally of the two who are mentioned above the sum total of mr whipples words and advices to him that summer had been these stephen was dressed more carefully than usual in view of a visit to bellefontaine road whereupon the judge demanded whether he were contemplating marriage without waiting for a reply he pointed to a rope and a slab of limestone on the pavement below and waved his hand unmistakably toward the mississippi  miss russell was of the opinion that mr whipple had once been crossed in love  but we are to speak more particularly of a putup job although stephen did not know this at the time  towards five oclock of a certain afternoon in august of that year 1858 mr whipple emerged from his den instead of turning to the right he strode straight to stephens table his communications were always a trifle startling this was no exception  mr brice said he you are to take the six fortyfive train on the st louis alton and chicago road tomorrow morning for springfield illinois  yes sir  arriving at springfield you are to deliver this envelope into the hands of mr abraham lincoln of the law firm of lincoln  herndon  abraham lincoln cried stephen rising and straddling his chair but sir  abraham lincoln interrupted the judge forcibly i try to speak plainly sir you are to deliver it into mr lincolns hands if he is not in springfield find out where he is and follow him up your expenses will be paid by me the papers are important do you understand sir  stephen did and he knew better than to argue the matter with mr whipple he had read in the missouri democrat of this man lincoln a country lawyer who had once been to congress and who was even now disputing the senatorship of his state with the renowned douglas in spite of their complacent amusement he had won a little admiration from conservative citizens who did not believe in the efficacy of judge douglass squatter sovereignty likewise this mr lincoln who had once been a railsputter was uproariously derided by northern democrats because he had challenged mr douglas to seven debates to be held at different towns in the state of illinois david with his sling and his smooth round pebble must have had much of the same sympathy and ridicule  for mr douglas senator and judge was a national character mighty in politics invulnerable in the armor of his oratory and he was known far and wide as the little giant those whom he did not conquer with his logic were impressed by his person  stephen remembered with a thrill that these debates were going on now one indeed had been held and had appeared in fine print in a corner of the democrat perhaps this lincoln might not be in springfield perhaps he stephen brice might by chance hit upon a debate and see and hear the tower of the democracy the honorable stephen a douglas  but it is greatly to be feared that our friend stephen was bored with his errand before he arrived at the little wooden station of the illinois capital standing on the platform after the train pulled out he summoned up courage to ask a citizen with no mustache and a beard which he swept away when he spat where was the office of lincoln  herndon the stranger spat twice regarded mr brice pityingly and finally led him in silence past the picket fence and the new englandlooking meetinghouse opposite until they came to the great square on which the state house squatted the state house was a building with much pretension to beauty built in the classical style of a yellow stone with sold white blinds in the high windows and mighty columns capped at the gently slanting roof but on top of it was reared a crude wooden dome like a clay head on a marble statue  that there said the stranger is whar we watches for the county delegations when they come in to a meetin and with this remark pointing with a stubby thumb up a wellworn stair he departed before stephen could thank him stephen paused under the awning of which there were many shading the brick pavement to regard the straggling line of stores and houses which surrounded and did homage to the yellow pile the brick house in which mr lincolns office was had decorations above the windows mounting the stair stephen found a room bare enough save for a few chairs and law books and not a soul in attendance after sitting awhile by the window mopping his brow with a handkerchief he went out on the landing to make inquiries there he met another citizen in shirt sleeves like unto the first in the very act of sweeping his beard out of the way of a dexterous expectoration  wal young man said he who be you lookin for here  for mr lincoln said stephen  at this the gentleman sat down on the dirty top step and gave vent to quiet but annoying laughter  i reckon you come to the wrong place  i was told this was his office said stephen with some heat  whar be you from said the citizen with interest  i dont see what that has to do with it answered our friend  wal said the citizen critically if you was from philadelphy or boston you might stand acquitted  stephen was on the point of claiming boston but wisely hesitated  im from st louis with a message for mr lincoln he replied  ye talk like y e was from down east said the citizens who seemed in the humor for conversation i reckon old abes too busy to see you say young man did you ever hear of stephen arnold douglas alias the little giant alias the idol of our state sir  this was too much for stephen who left the citizen without the compliment of a farewell continuing around the square inquiring for mr lincolns house he presently got beyond the stores and burning pavements on to a plank walk under great shade trees and past old brick mansions set well back from the street at length he paused in front of a wooden house of a dirty grayish brown too high for its length and breadth with tall shutters of the same color and a picket fence on top of the retaining wall which lifted the yard above the plank walk it was an ugly house surely but an ugly house may look beautiful when surrounded by such heavy trees as this was their shade was the most inviting thing stephen had seen a boy of sixteen or so was swinging on the gate plainly a very mischievous boy with a round laughing sunburned face and bright eyes in front of the gate was a shabby carriage with top and side curtains hitched to a big bay horse  can you tell me where mr lincoln lives inquired stephen  well i guess said the boy im his son and he lives right here when hes at home but that hasnt been often lately  where is he asked stephen beginning to realize the purport of his conversations with citizens  young mr lincoln mentioned the name of a small town in the northern part of the state where he said his father would stop that night he told stephen that he looked wilted invited him into the house to have a glass of lemonade and to join him and another boy in a fishing excursion with the big bay horse stephen told young mr lincoln that he should have to take the first train after his father  jimmy exclaimed the other enviously then youll hear the freeport debate  now it has been said that the day was scorching hot and when stephen had got back to the wooden station and had waited an hour for the bloomington express his anxiety to hear the freeport debate was not as keen as it might have been late in the afternoon he changed at bloomington to the illinois central railroad the sun fell down behind the cardboard edge of the prairie the train rattled on into the north wrapped in its dust and smoke and presently became a long comet roaring red to match that other comet which flashed in the sky  by this time it may be said that our friend was heartily sick of his mission he tried to doze but two men a farmer and a clerk got in at a way station and sat behind him they began to talk about this man lincoln  shucks said the clerk think of him opposing the little giant  hes right smart sam said the farmer hes got a way of sayin things thats clear we boys can foller him but steve douglas he only mixes you up  his companion guffawed  because why he shouted because you aint had no education what does a railsputter like abe know about this government judge douglas has worked it all out hes smart let the territories take care of themselves besides abe aint got no dignity the fust of this week i seen him sidetracked down the road here in a caboose while doug went by in a special  abe is a plain man sam the farmer answered solemnly but you watch out for him  it was ten oclock when stephen descended at his destination merciful night hid from his view the forlorn station and the ragged town the baggage man told him that mr lincoln was at the tavern  that tavern will words describe the impression it made on a certain young man from boston it was long and low and ramshackly and hot that night as the inside of a brickkiln as he drew near it on the single plant walk over the black prairiemud he saw countrymen and politicians swarming its narrow porch and narrower hall discussions in all keys were in progress and it was with vast difficulty that our distracted young man pushed through and found the landlord this personage was the coolest of the lot confusion was but food for his smiles importunity but increased his suavity and of the seeming hundreds that pressed him he knew and utilized the christian name of all from behind a corner of the bar he held them all at bay and sent them to quarters like the old campaigner he was  now ben taint no use gettin mad you and josh way an will an sam an the capn an the four beaver brothers will all sleep in number ten whats that franklin no sirree the honerable abe and mister hill and jedge oglesby is sleepin in seven the smell of perspiration was stifling as stephen pushed up to the master of the situation whats that supper young man aint you had no supper gosh i reckon if you can fight your way to the dinin room the galsll give you some pork and a cup of coffee  after a preliminary scuffle with a drunken countryman in mudcaked boots mr brice presently reached the long table in the diningroom a sense of humor not quite extinct made him smile as he devoured pork chops and greasy potatoes and heavy apple pie as he was finishing the pie he became aware of the tavern keeper standing over him  are you one of them flip chicagy reporters asked that worthy with a suspicious eye on stephens clothes  our friend denied this  you didnt talk jest like em guess youll be here tonight  yes said stephen wearily and he added outs of force of habit can you give me a room  i reckon was the cheerful reply number ten there aint nobody in there but ben billings and the four beaver brothers an three more ill have a shakedown for ye next the north window  stephens thanks for the hospitality perhaps lacked heartiness but perceiving his host still contemplating him he was emboldened to say  has mr lincoln gone to bed  who old abe at halfpast ten wal i reckon you dont know him  stephens reflections here on the dignity of the senatorial candidate of the republican party in illinois were novel at any rate he thought of certain senators he had seen in massachusetts  the only reason he aint down here swappin yarns with the boys is because hes havin some sort of confab with the jedge and joe medill of the chicagy press and tribune  do you think he would see me asked stephen eagerly he was emboldened by the apparent lack of ceremony of the candidate the landlord looked at him in some surprise  wal i reckon jest go up an knock at the door number seven and say tom wright sent ye  how shall i know mr lincoln asked stephen  pick out the ugliest man in the room there aint nobody i kin think of uglier than abe  bearing in mind this succinct description of the candidate stephen climbed the rickety stairs to the low second story all the bedroom doors were flung open except one on which the number 7 was inscribed from within came bursts of uproarious laughter and a summons to enter  he pushed open the door and as soon as his eyes became accustomed to the tobacco smoke he surveyed the room there was a bowl on the floor the chair where it belonged being occupied there was a very inhospitable looking bed two shakedowns and four windsor chairs in more or less state of dilapidationall occupied likewise a country glass lamp was balanced on a rough shelf and under it a young man sat absorbed in making notes and apparently oblivious to the noise around him every gentleman in the room was collarless coatless tieless and vestless some were engaged in fighting gnats and june bugs while others battled with mosquitoesall save the young man who wrote he being wholly indifferent  stephen picked out the homeliest man in the room there was no mistaking him and instead of a discussion of the campaign with the other gentlemen mr lincoln was defending what do you think mr lincoln was defending an occasional and judicious use of swear words  judge said he you do an almighty lot of cussing in your speeches and perhaps it aint a bad way to keep things stirred up  well said the judge a fellow will rip out something once in a while before he has time to shut it off  mr lincoln passed his fingers through his tousled hair his thick lower lip crept over in front of the upper one a gleam stirred in the deepset gray eyes  boys he asked did i ever tell you about saml the old quakers apprentice  there was a chorus of nos and go ahead abe the young man who was writing dropped his pencil as for stephen this long uncouth man of the plains was beginning to puzzle him the face with its crude features and deep furrows relaxed into intense soberness and mr lincoln began his story with a slow earnestness that was truly startling considering the subject  this apprentice judge was just such an incurable as you laughter and saml when he wanted to could get out as many cusses in a second as his anvil shot sparks and the old man used to wrastle with him nights and speak about punishment and pray for him in meeting but it didnt do any good when anything went wrong saml had an appropriate word for the occasion one day the old man got an inspiration when he was scratching around in the dirt for an oddsized iron  saml says he i want thee  saml went and found the old man standing over a big rat hole where the rats came out to feed on the scraps  saml says he fetch the tongs  saml fetched the tongs  now saml says the old man thou wilt sit here until thou hast a rat never mind thy dinner and when thou hast him if i hear thee swear thou wilt sit here until thou hast another dost thou mind  here mr lincoln seized two cotton umbrellas rasped his chair over the bare boor into a corner of the room and sat hunched over an imaginary rat hole for all the world like a gawky quaker apprentice and this was a candidate for the senate of the united states who on the morrow was to meet in debate the renowned and polished douglas  well mr lincoln continued that was on a monday i reckon and the boys ashouting to have their horses shod maybe you think they didnt have some fun with saml but saml sat there and sat there and sat there and after a while the old man pulled out his dinnerpail saml never opened his mouth first thing you know snip went the tongs mr lincoln turned gravely around what do you reckon saml said judge  the judge at random summoned up a good one to the delight of the audience  judge said mr lincoln with solemnity i reckon thats what youd have said saml never said a word and the old man kept on eating his dinner one oclock came and the folks began to drop in again but saml he sat there long towards night the boys collected round the door they were getting kind of interested saml he never looked up here mr lincoln bent forward a little and his voice fell to a loud drawling whisper first thing you know here come the whiskers peeping up then the pink eyes ablinking at the forge then  suddenly he brought the umbrellas together with whack  by god yells saml i have thee at last  amid the shouts mr lincoln stood up his long body swaying to and fro as he lifted high the improvised tongs they heard a terrified squeal and there was the rat squirming and wrigglingit seemed before their very eyes and stephen forgot the country tavern the country politician and was transported straightway into the quakers smithy     chapter iii in which stephen learns something  it was mr lincoln who brought him back the astonishing candidate for the senate had sunk into his chair his face relaxed into sadness save for the sparkle lurking in the eyes so he sat immobile until the laughter had died down to silence then he turned to stephen  sonny he said did you want to see me  stephen was determined to be affable and kind and shall we say it he would not make mr lincoln uncomfortable either by a superiority of english or the certain frigidity of manner which people in the west said he had but he tried to imagine a massachusetts senator mr sumner for instance going through the rat story and couldnt somehow massachusetts senators hadnt this gift and yet he was not quite sure that it wasnt a fetching gift stephen did not quite like to be called sonny but he looked into two gray eyes and at the face and something curious happened to him how was he to know that thousands of his countrymen were to experience the same sensation  sonny said mr lincoln again did you want to see me  yes sir stephen wondered at the sir it had been involuntary he drew from his inner pocket the envelope which the judge had given him  mr lincoln ripped it open a document fell out and a letter he put the document in his tall hat which was upside down on the floor as he got deeper into the letter he pursed his mouth and the lines of his face deepened in a smile then he looked up grave again  judge whipple told you to run till you found me did he mr brice  yes sir  is the judge the same old crisscross contrary violent fool that he always was  providence put an answer in stephens mouth  hes been very good to me mr lincoln  mr lincoln broke into laughter  why hes the biggesthearted man i know you know him oglesbysilas whipple but a man has to be a daniel or a general putnam to venture into that den of his theres only one man in the world who can beard silas and hes the finest statesright southern gentleman you ever saw i mean colonel carvel youve heard of him oglesby dont they quarrel once in a while mr brice  they do have occasional arguments said stephen amused  arguments cried mr lincoln well i couldnt come as near to fighting every day and stand it if my dog and bills dog across the street walked around each other and growled for half a day and then lay down together as carvel and whipple do by jing id put pepper on their noses  i reckon colonel carvel isnt a fighting man said some one at random  strangely enough stephen was seized with a desire to vindicate the colonels courage both mr lincoln and judge oglesby forestalled him  not a fighting man exclaimed the judge why the other day  now oglesby put in mr lincoln i wanted to tell that story  stephen had heard it and so have we but mr lincolns imitation of the colonels drawl brought him a pang like homesickness  no suh i didnt intend to shoot not if he had gone off straight but he wriggled and twisted like a rattlesnake and i just couldnt resist suh then i sent mnigger ephum to tell him not to let me catch sight of him round the planters house yes suh thats what he was one of these damned yankees who come south and go into niggerdeals and politics  mr lincoln glanced at stephen and then again at the judges letter he took up his silk hat and thrust that too into the worn lining which was already filled with papers he clapped the hat on his head and buttoned on his collar  i reckon ill go for a walk boys he said and clear my head so as to be ready for the little giant tomorrow at freeport mr brice do you feel like walking  stephen taken aback said that he did  now abe this is just durned foolishness one of the gentlemen expostulated we want to know if youre going to ask douglas that question  if you do you kill yourself lincoln said another who stephen afterwards learned was mr medill proprietor of the great press and tribune  i guess ill risk it joe said mr lincoln gravely suddenly comes the quiver about the corners of his mouth and the gray eyes respond boys said he did you ever hear the story of farmer bell down in egypt ill tell it to you boys and then perhaps youll know why ill ask judge douglas that question farmer bell had the prize bartlett pear tree and the prettiest gal in that section and he thought about the same of each of em all the boys were after sue bell but there was only one who had any chance of getting her and his name was jim rickets jim was the handsomest man in that section hes been hung since but jim had a good deal out of lifeall the appetites and some of the gratifications he liked sue and he liked a luscious bartlett and he intended to have both and it just so happened that that prize pear tree had a whopper on that year and old man bell couldnt talk of anything else  now there was an ugly galoot whose name isnt worth mentioning he knew he wasnt in any way fit for sue and he liked pears about as well as jim rickets well one night here comes jim along the road whistling to court susan and there was the ugly galoot ayearning on the bank under the pear tree jim was all fixed up and he says to the galoot lets have a throw now the galoot knew old bell was looking over the fence so he says all right and he gives jim the first shotjim fetched down the big pear got his teeth in it and strolled off to the house kind of pitiful of the galoot for a halfwitted ass when he got to the door there was the old man what are you here for says he why says rickets in his offhand way for he always had great confidence to fetch sue  the old man used to wear brass toes to keep his boots from wearing out said mr lincoln dreamily  you see continued mr lincoln you see the galoot knew that jim rickets wasnt to be trusted with susan bell  some of the gentlemen appeared to see the point of this political parable for they laughed uproariously the others laughed too then they slapped their knees looked at mr lincolns face which was perfectly sober and laughed again a little fainter then the judge looked as solemn as his title  it wont do abe said he you commit suicide  youd better stick to the pear abe said mr medill and fight stephen a douglas here and now this isnt any picnic do you know who he is  why yes joe said mr lincoln amiably hes a man with tens of thousands of blind followers its my business to make some of those blind followers see  by this time stephen was burning to know the question that mr lincoln wished to ask the little giant and why the other gentlemen were against it but mr lincoln surprised him still further in taking him by the arm turning to the young reporter mr hill who had finished his writing he said  bob a little air will do you good ive had enough of the old boys for a while and im going to talk to somebody any own age  stephen was halfway down the corridor when he discovered that he had forgotten his hat as he returned he heard somebody say  if that aint just like abe he stopped to pull a flea out of his stocking when he was going to fight that duel with shields and now hes walking with boys before a debate with the smartest man in this country and theres heaps of things he ought to discuss with us  reckon we havent got much to do with it said another half laughing half rueful theres some things abe wont stand  from the stairs stephen saw mr lincoln threading his way through the crowd below laughing at one pausing to lay his hand on the shoulder of another and replying to a rough sally of a third to make the place a tumult of guffaws but none had the temerity to follow him when stephen caught up with him in the little country street he was talking earnestly to mr hill the young reporter of the press and tribune and what do you think was the subject the red comet in the sky that night stephen kept pace in silence with mr lincolns strides another shock in store for him this railsplitter this postmaster this flatboatman whom he had not credited with a knowledge of the new code was talking astronomy and strange to say mr brice was learning  bob said mr lincoln can you elucidate the problem of the three bodies  to stephens surprise mr hill elucidated  the talk then fell upon novels and stories a few of which mr lincoln seemed to have read he spoke among others of the gold bug the story is grand said he but it might as well have been written of robinson crusoes island what a fellow wants in a book is to know where he is there are not many novels or ancient works for that matter that put you down anywhere  there is that genuine fragment which cicero has preserved from a last work of aristotle said mr hill slyly if there were beings who lived in the depths of the earth and could emerge through the open fissures and could suddenly behold the earth the sea and thevault of heaven  but youyou impostor cried mr lincoln interrupting youre giving us humboldts cosmos  mr hill owned up laughing  it is remarkable how soon we accustom ourselves to a strange situation and to stephen it was no less strange to be walking over a muddy road of the prairie with this most singular man and a newspaper correspondent than it might have been to the subterrestrial inhabitant to emerge on the earths surface stephens mind was in the process of a chemical change suddenly it seemed to him as if he had known this tall illinoisan always the whim of the senatorial candidate in choosing him for a companion he did not then try to account for  come mr stephen said mr lincoln presently where do you hail from  boston said stephen  no said mr lincoln incredulously and how does it happen that you come to me with a message from a rank abolitionist lawyer in st louis  is the judge a friend of yours sir stephen asked  what exclaimed mr lincoln didnt he tell you he was  he said nothing at all sir except to tell me to travel until i found you  i call the judge a friend of mine said mr lincoln he may not claim me because i do not believe in putting all slaveowners to the sword  i do not think that judge whipple is precisely an abolitionist sir  what and how do you feel mr stephen  stephen replied in figures it was rare with him and he must have caught it from mr lincoln  i am not for ripping out the dam suddenly sir that would drown the nation i believe that the water can be drained off in some other way  mr lincolns direct answer to this was to give stephen stinging slap between the shoulderblades  god bless the boy he cried he has thought it out bob take that down for the press and tribune as coming from a rising young politician of st louis  why stephen blurted out ii thought you were an abolitionist mr lincoln  mr brice said mr lincoln i have as much use for the boston liberator as i have for the charleston courier you may guess how much that is the question is not whether we shall or shall not have slavery but whether slavery shall stay where it is or be extended according to judge douglass ingenious plan the judge is for breeding worms i am for cauterizing the sore so that it shall not spread but i tell you mr brice that this nation cannot exist half slave and half free  was it the slap on the back that opened stephens eyes it was certain that as they returned to the tavern the man at his side was changed he need not have felt chagrined men in high places underestimated lincoln or did not estimate him at all affection came first the great warm heart had claimed stephen as it claimed all who came near it  the tavern was deserted save for a few stragglers under the dim light at the bar mr lincoln took off his hat and drew the judges letter from the lining  mr stephen said he would you like to come to freeport with me tomorrow and hear the debate  an hour earlier he would have declined with thanks but now now his face lighted at the prospect and suddenly fell again mr lincoln guessed the cause he laid his hand on the young mans shoulder and laughed  i reckon youre thinking of what the judge will say  stephen smiled  ill take care of the judge said mr lincoln im not afraid of him he drew forth from the inexhaustible hat a slip of paper and began to write  there said he when he had finished a friend of mine is going to springfield in the morning and hell send that to the judge  and this is what he had written       i have borrowed steve for a day or two and guarantee      to return him a good republican                   a lincoln  it is worth remarking that this was the first time mr brice had been called steve and had not resented it  stephen was embarrassed he tried to thank mr lincoln but that gentlemans quizzical look cut him short and the next remark made him gasp  look here steve said he you know a parlor from a drawingroom what did you think of me when you saw me tonight  stephen blushed furiously and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth  ill tell you said mr lincoln with his characteristic smile you thought that you wouldnt pick me out of a bunch of horses to race with the senator     chapter iv the question  many times since abraham lincoln has been called to that mansion which god has reserved for the patriots who have served him also stephen brice has thought of that steaming night in the lowceiled room of the country tavern reeking with the smell of coarse food and hot humanity he remembers vividly how at first his gorge rose and recalls how gradually there crept over him a forgetfulness of the squalidity and discomfort then came a space gray with puzzling wonder then the dawning of a worship for a very ugly man in a rumpled and illmade coat  you will perceive that there was hope for stephen on his shakedown that night oblivious to the snores of his companions and the droning of the insects he lay awake and before his eyes was that strange marked face with its deep lines that blended both humor and sadness there it was homely and yet stephen found himself reflecting that honesty was just as homely and plain truth and yet both were beautiful to those who had learned to love them just so this mr lincoln  he fell asleep wondering why judge whipple had sent him  it was in accord with nature that reaction came with the morning such a morning and such a place  he was awakened shivering by the beat of rain on the roof and stumbling over the prostrate forms of the four beaver brothers reached the window clouds filled the sky and joshway whose pallet was under the sill was in a blessed state of moisture  no wonder some of his enthusiasm had trickled away  he made his toilet in the wet under the pump outside where he had to wait his turn and he rather wished he were going back to st louis he had an early breakfast of fried eggs and underdone bacon and coffee which made him pine for hesters the dishes were neither too clean nor too plentiful being doused in water as soon as ever they were out of use  but after breakfast the sun came out and a crowd collected around the tavern although the air was chill and the muck deep in the street stephen caught glimpses of mr lincoln towering above the knots of country politicians who surrounded him and every once in a while a knot would double up with laughter there was no sign that the senatorial aspirant took the situation seriously that the coming struggle with his skilful antagonist was weighing him down in the least stephen held aloof from the groups thinking that mr lincoln had forgotten him he decided to leave for st louis on the morning train and was even pushing toward the tavern entrance with his bag in his hand when he was met by mr hill  i had about given you up mr brice he said mr lincoln asked me to get hold of you and bring you to him alive or dead  accordingly stephen was led to the station where a long train of twelve cars was pulled up covered with flags and bunting on entering one of these he perceived mr lincoln sprawled he could think of no other word to fit the attitude on a seat next the window and next him was mr medill of the press and tribune the seat just in front was reserved for mr hill who was to make any notes necessary mr lincoln looked up his appearance was even less attractive than the night before as he had on a dirty gray linen duster  i thought youd got loose steve he said holding out his hand glad to see you just you sit down there next to bob where i can talk to you  stephen sat down diffident for he knew that there were others in that train who would give ten years of their lives for that seat  ive taken a shine to this bostonian joe said mr lincoln to mr medill weve got to catch em young to do anything with em you know now steve just give me a notion how politics are over in st louis what do they think of our new republican party too bran new for old st louis eh  stephen saw expostulation in mr medills eyes and hesitated and mr lincoln seemed to feel medills objections as by mental telepathy but he said well come to that little matter later joe when the cars start  naturally stephen began uneasily but under the influence of that kindly eye he thawed and forgot himself he felt that this man was not one to feign an interest the shouts of the people on the little platform interrupted the account and the engine staggered off with its load  i reckon st louis is a nest of southern democrats mr lincoln remarked and not much opposition  there are quite a few old line whigs sir ventured stephen smiling  joe said mr lincoln did you ever hear warfields definition of an old line whig  mr medill had not  a man who takes his toddy regularly and votes the democratic ticket occasionally and who wears ruffled shirts  both of these gentlemen laughed and two more in the seat behind who had an ear to the conversation  but sir said stephen seeing that he was expected to go on i think that the republican party will gather a considerable strength there in another year or two we have the material for powerful leaders in mr blair and others mr lincoln nodded at the name we are getting an ever increasing population from new england mostly of young men who will take kindly to the new party and then he added thinking of his pilgrimage the sunday before south st louis is a solid mass of germans who are all antislavery but they are very foreign still and have all their german institutions  the turner halls mr lincoln surprised him by inquiring  yes and i believe that they drill there  then they will the more easily be turned into soldiers if the time should come said mr lincoln and he added quickly i pray that it may not  stephen had cause to remember that observation and the acumen it showed long afterward  the train made several stops and at each of them shoals of country people filled the aisles and paused for a most familiar chat with the senatorial candidate many called him abe his appearance was the equal in roughness to theirs his manner if anything was more democraticyet in spite of all this stephen in them detected a deference which might almost be termed a homage there were many women among them had our friend been older he might have known that the presence of good women in a political crowd portends something as it was he was surprised he was destined to be still more surprised that day  when they had left behind them the shouts of the little down of dixon mr lincoln took off his hat and produced a crumpled and not too immaculate scrap of paper from the multitude therein  now joe said he here are the four questions i intend to ask judge douglas i am ready for you fire away  we dont care anything about the others answered mr medill but i tell you this if you ask that second one youll never see the united states senate  and the republican party in this state will have had a blow from which it can scarcely recover added mr judd chairman of the committee  mr lincoln did not appear to hear them his eyes were far away over the wet prairie  stephen held his breath but neither he nor medill nor judd nor hill guessed at the pregnancy of that moment how were they to know that the fate of the united states of america was concealed in that questionwas to be decided on a rough wooden platform that day in the town of freeport illinois  but abraham lincoln the uncouth man in the linen duster with the tousled hair knew it and the stone that was rejected of the builders was to become the cornerstone of the temple  suddenly mr lincoln recalled himself glanced at the paper and cleared his throat in measured tones plainly heard above the rush and roar of the train he read the question     can the people of a united states territory in any lawful way    against the wish of any citizen of the united states exclude    slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state    constitution  mr medill listened intently  abe said he solemnly douglas will answer yes or equivocate and that is all the assurance these northern democrats want to put steve douglas in the senate theyll snow you under  all right answered mr lincoln quietly  all right asked mr medill reflecting the sheer astonishment of the others then why the devil are you wearing yourself out and why are we spending our time and money on you  mr lincoln laid his hand on medills sleeve  joe said he a rat in the larder is easier to catch than a rat that has the run of the cellar you know where to set your trap in the larder ill tell you why im in this campaign to catch douglas now and keep him out of the white house in 1860 to save this country of ours joe shes sick  there was a silence broken by two exclamations  but see here abe said mr medill as soon as ever he got his breath what have we got to show for it where do you come in  mr lincoln smiled wearily  nowhere i reckon he answered simply  good lord said mr judd  mr medill gulped  you mean to say as the candidate of the republican party you dont care whether you get to the senate  not if i can send steve douglas there with his wings broken was the calm reply  suppose he does answer yes that slavery can be excluded said mr judd  then said mr lincoln then douglas loses the vote of the great slaveholders the vote of the solid south that he has been fostering ever since he has had the itch to be president without the solid south the little giant will never live in the white house and unless im mightily mistaken steve douglas has had his aye as far ahead as 1860 for some time  another silence followed these words there was a stout man standing in the aisle and he spat deftly out of the open window  you may wing steve douglas abe said he gloomily but the gun will kick you over the bluff  dont worry about me ed said mr lincoln im not worth it  in a wave of comprehension the significance of all this was revealed to stephen brice the grim humor the sagacious statesmanship and best of allthe superb self sacrifice of it struck him suddenly i think it was in that hour that he realized the full extent of the wisdom he was near which was like unto solomons  shame surged in stephens face that he should have misjudged him he had come to patronize he had remained to worship and in after years when he thought of this new vital force which became part of him that day it was in the terms of emerson pythagoras was misunderstood and socrates and jesus and luther and copernicus and galileo and newton and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh to be great is to be misunderstood  how many have conversed with lincoln before and since and knew him not  if an outward and visible sign of mr lincolns greatness were neededhe had chosen to speak to them in homely parables the story of farmer bell was plain as day jim rickets who had life all his own way was none other than stephen a douglas the easily successful the ugly galoot who dared to raise his eyes only to the pear was mr lincoln himself and the pear was the senatorship which the galoot had denied himself to save susan from being mr rickets bride  stephen could understand likewise the vehemence of the republican leaders who crowded around their candidate and tried to get him to retract that question he listened quietly he answered with a patient smile now and then he threw a story into the midst of this discussion which made them laugh in spite of themselves the hopelessness of the case was quite plain to mr hill who smiled and whispered in stephens ear he has made up his mind they will not budge him an inch and they know it  finally mr lincoln took the scrap of paper which was even more dirty and fingermarked by this time and handed it to mr hill the train was slowing down for freeport in the distance bands could be heard playing and along the track line upon line of men and women were cheering and waving it was ten oclock raw and cold for that time of the year and the sun was trying to come out  bob said mr lincoln be sure you get that right in your notes and steve you stick close to me and youll see the show why boys he added smiling theres the great mans private car cannon and all  all that stephen saw was a regular daycar on a sidetrack a brass cannon was on the tender hitched behind it     chapter v the crisis  stephen a douglas called the little giant on account of his intellect was a type of man of which our race has had some notable examples although they are not characteristic capable of sacrifice to their country personal ambition is nevertheless the mainspring of their actions they must either be before the public or else unhappy this trait gives them a large theatrical strain and sometimes brands them as adventurers their ability saves them from being demagogues  in the case of douglas he had deliberately renewed some years before the agitation on the spread of slavery by setting forth a doctrine of extreme cleverness this doctrine like many others of its kind seemed at first sight to be the balm it pretended instead of an irritant as it really was it was calculated to deceive all except thinking men and to silence all save a merciless logician and this merciless logician who was heavensent in time of need was abraham lincoln  mr douglas was a juggler a political prestidigitateur he did things before the eyes of the senate and the nation his balm for the healing of the nations wounds was a patent medicine so cleverly concocted that experts alone could show what was in it so abstruse and twisted were some of mr douglass doctrines that a genius alone might put them into simple words for the common people  the great panacea for the slavery trouble put forth by mr douglas at that time was briefly this that the people of the new territories should decide for themselves subject to the constitution whether they should have slavery or not and also decide for themselves all other questions under the constitution unhappily for mr douglas there was the famous dred scott decision which had set the south wild with joy the year before and had cast a gloom over the north the chief justice of the united states had declared that under the constitution slaves were propertyand as such every american citizen owning slaves could carry them about with him wherever he went therefore the territorial legislatures might pass laws until they were dumb and yet their settlers might bring with them all the slaves they pleased  and yet we must love the judge he was a gentleman a strong man and a patriot he was magnanimous and to his immortal honor be it said that he in the end won the greatest of all struggles he conquered himself he put down that mightiest thing that was in himhis ambition for himself and he set up instead his ambition for his country he bore no illwill toward the man whose fate was so strangely linked to his and who finally came to that high seat of honor and of martyrdom which he coveted we shall love the judge and speak of him with reverence for that sublime act of kindness before the capitol in 1861  abraham lincoln might have prayed on that day of the freeport debate  forgive him lord he knows not what he does lincoln descried the danger afar and threw his body into the breach  that which passed before stephens eyes and to which his ears listened at freeport was the great republic pressing westward to the pacific he wondered whether some of his eastern friends who pursed their lips when the wrest was mentioned would have sneered or prayed a young english nobleman who was there that day did not sneer he was filled instead with something like awe at the vigor of this nation which was sprung from the loins of his own crudeness he saw vulgarity he heard but force he felt and marvelled  america was in freeport that day the rush of her people and the surprise of her climate the rain had ceased and quickly was come out of the northwest a boisterous wind chilled by the lakes and scented by the hemlocks of the minnesota forests the sun smiled and frowned clouds hurried in the sky mocking the human hubbub below cheering thousands pressed about the station as mr lincolns train arrived they hemmed him in his triumphal passage under the great arching trees to the new brewster house the chief marshal and his aides great men before were suddenly immortal the county delegations fell into their proper precedence like ministers at a state dinner we have faith in abraham yet another county for the railsputter abe the giantkillerso the banners read here much bedecked was the galena lincoln club part of joe daviess shipment fifes skirled and drums throbbed and the stars and stripes snapped in the breeze and here was a delegation headed by fifty sturdy ladies on horseback at whom stephen gaped like a countryman then came carryalls of all ages and degrees wagons from this county and that county giddily draped drawn by horses from one to six or by mules their inscriptions addressing their senatorial candidate in all degrees of familiarity but not contempt what they seemed proudest of was that he had been a railsplitter for nearly all bore a fencerail  but stay what is this wagon with the high sapling flagstaff in the middle and the leaves still on it       westward the star of empire takes its way      the girls link on to lincoln their mothers were for clay  here was glory to blind youtwo and thirty maids in red sashes and blue liberty caps with white stars each was a state of the union and every one of them was for abraham who called them his basket of flowers behind them most touching of all sat a thirtythird shackled in chains that was kansas alas the men of kansas was far from being as sorrowful as the part demandedin spite of her instructions she would smile at the boys but the appealing inscription she bore set me free was greeted with storms of laughter the boldest of the young men shouting that she was too beautiful to be free and some of the old men to their shame be it said likewise shouted no false embarrassment troubled kansas she was openly pleased but the young men who had brought their sweethearts to town and were standing hand in hand with them for obvious reasons saw nothing they scarcely dared to look at kansas and those who did were so loudly rebuked that they turned down the side streets  during this part of the day these loving couples whose devotion was so patent to the whole world were by far the most absorbing to stephen he watched them having their fortunes told the young women blushing and crying say and aint he wicked and the young men getting their ears boxed for certain remarks he watched them standing openmouthed at the booths and side shows with hands still locked or again they were chewing cream candy in unison or he glanced sidewise at them seated in the open places with the world so far below them that even the insistent sound of the fifes and drums rose but faintly to their ears  and perhapswe shall not say positivelyperhaps mr brices thoughts went something like this o that love were so simple a matter to all but graven on his face was what is called the boston scorn and no scorn has been known like unto it since the days of athens  so stephen made the best of his way to the brewster house the elegance and newness of which the citizens of freeport openly boasted mr lincoln had preceded him and was even then listening to a few remarks of burning praise by an honorable gentleman mr lincoln himself made a few remarks which seemed so simple and rang so true and were so free from political rococo and decoration generally that even the young men forgot their sweethearts to listen then mr lincoln went into the hotel and the sun slipped under a black cloud  the lobby was full and rather dirty since the supply of spittoons was so far behind the demand like the firmament it was divided into little bodies which revolved about larger bodies but there lacked not here supporters of the little giant and discreet farmers of influence in their own counties who waited to hear the afternoons debate before deciding these and others did not hesitate to tell of the magnificence of the little giants torchlight procession the previous evening every dredscottite had carried a torch and many transparencies so that the very glory of it had turned night into day the chief lictor had distributed these torches with an unheardof liberality but there lacked not detractors who swore that john dibble and other lincolnites had applied for torches for the mere pleasure of carrying them since dawn the delegations had been heralded from the housetops and wagered on while they were yet as worms far out or the prairie all the morning these continued to came in and form in line to march past their particular candidate the second great event of the day was the event of the special over the galena roar of sixteen cars and more than a thousand pairs of sovereign lungs with military precision they repaired to the brewster house and ahead of then a banner was flung winnebago county for the tall sucker and the tall sucker was on the steps to receive them  but mr douglas who had arrived the evening before to the booming of two and thirty guns had his banners end his bunting too the neighborhood of freeport was stronghold of northern democrats ardent supporters of the little giant if once they could believe that he did not intend to betray them  stephen felt in his bones the coming of a struggle and was thrilled once he smiled at the thought that he had become an active partisannay a worshipperof the uncouth lincoln terrible suspicion for a bostonianhad he been carried away was his hero after all a homespun demagogue had he been wise in deciding before he had taught a glimpse of the accomplished douglas whose name end fame filled the land stephen did not waver in his allegiance but in his heart there lurked a fear of the sophisticated judge and senator and man of the world whom he had not yet seen in his notebook he had made a copy of the question and young mr hill discovered him pondering in a corner of the lobby at dinnertime after dinner they went together to their candidates room they found the doors open and the place packed and there was mr lincolns very tall hat towering above those of the other politicians pressed around him mr lincoln took three strides in stephens direction and seized him by the shoulder  why steve said he i thought you had got away again turning to a big burly man with a goodnatures face who was standing by he added jim i want you to look out for this young man get him a seat on the stands where he can hear  stephen stuck close to jim he never knew what the gentlemans last name was or whether he had any it was but a few minutes walk to the grove where the speaking was to be and as they made their way thither mr lincoln passed them in a conestoga wagon drawn by six milkwhite horses jim informed stephen that the little giant had had a sixhorse coach the grove was black with people hovering about the hem of the crowd were the sunburned young men in their sunday best still clinging fast to the hands of the young women bands blared columbia gem of the ocean fakirs planted their stands in the way selling painkillers and ague cures watermelons and lemonade jugglers juggled and beggars begged jim said that there were sixteen thousand people in that grove and he told the truth  stephen now trembled for his champion he tried to think of himself as fifty years old with the courage to address sixteen thousand people on such a day and quailed what a man of affairs it must take to do that sixteen thousand people into each of whose breasts god had put different emotions and convictions he had never even imagined such a crowd as this assembles merely to listen to a political debate but then he remembered as they dodged from in front of the horses what it was not merely a political debate the pulse of nation was here a great nation stricken with approaching fever it was not now a case of excise but of existence  this son of toil who had driven his family thirty miles across the prairie blanketed his tired horses and slept on the ground the night before who was willing to stand all through the afternoon and listen with pathetic eagerness to this debate must be moved by a patriotism divine in the breast of that farmer in the breast of his tired wife who held her child by the hand had been instilled from birth that sublime fervor which is part of their life who inherit the declaration of independence instinctively these men who had fought and won the west had scented the danger with the spirit of their ancestors who had left their farms to die on the bridge at concord or follow ethan allen into ticonderoga these had come to freeport what were three days of bodily discomfort what even the loss of part of a cherished crop if the nations existence were at stake and their votes might save it  in the midst of that heaving human sea rose the bulwarks of a wooden stand but how to reach it jim was evidently a personage the rough farmers commonly squeezed a way for him and when they did not he made it with his big body as they drew near their haven a great surging as of a tidal wave swept them off their feet there was a deafening shout and the stand rocked on its foundations before stephen could collect his wits a fierce battle was raging about him abolitionist and democrat free soiler and squatter sov defaced one another in a rush for the platform the committeemen and reporters on top of it rose to its defence well for stephen that his companion was along jim was recognized and hauled bodily into the fort and stephen after him the populace were driven off and when the excitement died down again he found himself in the row behind the reporters young mr hill paused while sharpening his pencil to wave him a friendly greeting  stephen craning in his seat caught sight of mr lincoln slouched into one of his favorite attitudes his chin resting in his hand  but who is this erect compact aggressive searching with a confident eye the wilderness of upturned faces a personage truly to be questioned timidly to be approached advisedly here indeed was a lion by the very look of him master of himself and of others by reason of its regularity and masculine strength a handsome face a man of the world to the cut of the coat across the broad shoulders here was one to lift a youngster into the realm of emulation like a character in a play to arouse dreams of washington and its senators and great men for this was one to be consulted by the great alone a figure of dignity and power with magnetism to compel moods since when he smiled you warmed in spite of yourself and when he frowned the world looked grave  the inevitable comparison was come and stephens hero was shrunk once more he drew a deep breath searched for the word and gulped there was but the one word how country abraham lincoln looked beside stephen arnold douglas  had the lord ever before made and set over against each other two such different men yes for such are the ways of the lord           the preliminary speaking was in progress but stephen neither heard nor saw until he felt the heavy hand of his companion on his knee  theres something mighty strange like fate between them two he was saying i recklect twentyfive years ago when they was first in the legislatur together a man told me that they was both admitted to practice in the spreme court in 39 on the same day sir then you know they was nip an tuck after the same young lady abe got her theyve been in congress together the little giant in the senate and now here they be in the greatest set of debates the people of this state ever heard young man the hand of fate is in this here mark my words  there was a hush and the waves of that vast human sea were stilled a man lean angular with coattail flappingunfolded like a grotesque figure at a sideshow  no confidence was there stooping forward abraham lincoln began to speak and stephen brice hung his head and shuddered could this shrill falsetto be the same voice to which he had listened only that morning could this awkward yellow man with his hands behind his back be he whom he had worshipped ripples of derisive laughter rose here and there on the stand and from the crowd thrice distilled was the agony of those moments  but what was this feeling that gradually crept over him surprise cautiously he raised his eyes the hands were coming around to the front suddenly one of them was thrown sharply back with a determined gesture the head was raisedandand his shame was for gotten in its stead wonder was come but soon he lost even that for his mind was gone on a journey and when again he came to himself and looked upon abraham lincoln this was a man transformed the voice was no longer shrill nay it was now a powerful instrument which played strangely on those who heard now it rose and again it fell into tones so low as to start a stir which spread and spread like a ripple in a pond until it broke on the very edge of that vast audience     can the people of a united states territory in any lawful way    against the wish of any citizen of the united states exclude    slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state    constitution  it was out at last irrevocably writ in the recording book of history for better for worse beyond the reach of politician committee or caucus but what man amongst those who heard and stirred might say that these minutes even now basting into eternity held the crisis of a nation that is the hope of the world not you judge douglas who sit there smiling consternation is a stranger in your heartbut answer the question if you can yes your nimble wit has helped you out of many a tight corner you do not feel the nooseas yet you do not guess that your reply will make or mar the fortunes of your country it is not you who can look ahead two short years and see the ship of democracy splitting on the rocks at charleston and at baltimore when the power of your name might have steered her safely  but see what is this man about whom you despise one by one he is taking the screws out of the engine which you have invented to run your ship look he holds them in his hands without mixing them and shows the false construction of its secret parts  for abraham lincoln dealt with abstruse questions in language so limpid that many a farmer dulled by toil heard and understood and marvelled the simplicity of the bible dwells in those speeches and they are now classics in our literature and the wonder in stephens mind was that this man who could be a buffoon whose speech was coarse and whose person unkempt could prove himself a tower of morality and truth that has troubled many another before and since the debate at freeport  that short hour came all too quickly to an end and as the moderator gave the signal for mr lincoln it was stephens big companion who snapped the strain and voiced the sentiment of those about him  by gosh he cried he baffles steve i didnt think abe had it in him  the honorable stephen a douglas however seemed anything but baffled as he rose to reply as he waited for the cheers which greeted him to die out his attitude was easy and indifferent as a public mans should be the question seemed not to trouble him in the least but for stephen brice the judge stood there stripped of the glamour that made him even as abraham lincoln had stripped his doctrine of its paint and colors and left it punily naked  standing up the very person of the little giant was contradictory as was the man himself his height was insignificant but he had the head and shoulders of a lion and even the lions roar what at contrast the ring of his deep bass to the tentative falsetto of mr lincolns opening words if stephen expected the judge to tremble he was greatly disappointed mr douglas was far from dismay as if to show the people how lightly he held his opponents warnings he made them gape by putting things down mr lincolns shirtfront and taking them out of his mouth but it appeared to stephen listening with all his might that the judge was a trifle more on the defensive than his attitude might lead one to expect was he not among his own northern democrats at freeport and yet it seemed to give him a keen pleasure to call his hearers black republicans not black came from the crowd again and again and once a man shouted couldnt you modify it and call it brown not a whit cried the judge and dubbed them yankees although himself a vermonter by birth he implied that most of these black republicans desired negro wives  but quickto the question how was the little giant artful in debate as he was to get over that without offence to the great south very skillfully the judge disposed of the first of the interrogations and then save for the gusts of wind rustling the trees the grove might have been empty of its thousands such was the silence that fell but tighter and tighter they pressed against the stand until it trembled  oh judge the time of all artful men will come at length how were you to foresee a certain day under the white dome of the capitol had your sight been long you would have paused before your answer had your sight been long you would have seen this ugly lincoln bareheaded before the nation and you are holding his hat judge douglas this act alone has redeemed your faults it has given you a nobility of which we did not suspect you at the end god gave you strength to be humble and so you left the name of a patriot  judge you thought there was a passage between scylla and charybdis which your craftiness might overcome  it matters not you cried when you answered the question it matters not which way the supreme court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under the constitution the people have the lawful means to introduce or to exclude it as they please for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police regulations  judge douglas uneasy will you lie tonight for you have uttered the freeport heresy  it only remains to be told how stephen brice coming to the brewster house after the debate found mr lincoln on his knee in transports of delight was a small boy and mr lincoln was serenely playing on the childs jewsharp standing beside him was a proud father who had dragged his son across two counties in a farm wagon and who was to return on the morrow to enter this event in the family bible in a corner of the room were several impatient gentlemen of influence who wished to talk about the question  but when he saw stephen mr lincoln looked up with a smile of welcome that is still and ever will be remembered and cherished  tell judge whipple that i have attended to that little matter steve he said  why mr lincoln he exclaimed you have had no time  i have taken the time mr lincoln replied and i think that i am well repaid steve said he unless im mightily mistaken you know a little more than you did yesterday  yes sir i do said stephen  come steve said mr lincoln be honest didnt you feel sorry for me last night  stephen flushed scarlet  i never shall again sir he said  the wonderful smile so ready to come and go flickered and went out in its stead on the strange face was ineffable sadnessthe sadness of the worlds tragedies of stephen stoned of christ crucified  pray god that you may feel sorry for me again he said  awed the child on his lap was still the politician had left the room mr lincoln had kept stephens hand in his own  i have hopes of you stephen he said do not forget me  stephen brice never has why was it that he walked to the station with a heavy heart it was a sense of the man he had left who had been and was to be this lincoln of the black loam who built his neighbors cabin and hoed his neighbors corn who had been storekeeper and postmaster and flatboatman who had followed a rough judge dealing a rough justice around a rough circuit who had rolled a local bully in the dirt rescued women from insult tended the bedside of many a sick coward who feared the judgment told coarse stories on barrels by candlelight but these are pure beside the vice of great cities who addressed political mobs in the raw swooping down from the stump and flinging embroilers east and west this physician who was one day to tend the sickbed of the nation in her agony whose large hand was to be on her feeble pulse and whose knowledge almost divine was to perform the miracle of her healing so was it that the physician himself performed his cures and when work was done died a martyr  abraham lincoln died in his name     chapter vi glencoe  it was nearly noon when stephen walked into the office the next day dusty and travelworn and perspiring he had come straight from the ferry without going home and he had visions of a quiet dinner with richter under the trees at the beergarden where he could talk about abraham lincoln had richter ever heard of lincoln  but the young german met him at the top of the stairand his face was more serious than usual although he showed his magnificent teeth in a smile of welcome  you are a little behind your time my friend said he what has happened you  didnt the judge get mr lincolns message asked stephen with anxiety  the german shrugged his shoulders  ah i know not he answered he has gone is glencoe the judge is ill stephen doctor polk says that he has worked all his life too hard the doctor and colonel carvel tried to get him to go to glencoe but he would not budge until miss carvel herself comes all the way from the country yesterday and orders him ach exclaimed richter impulsively what wonderful women you have in america i could lose my head when i think of miss carvel  miss carvel was here you say stephen repeated in a tone of inquiry  donner said richter disgusted you dont care  stephen laughed in spite of himself  why should i he answered and becoming grave again added except on judge whipples account have you heard from him today carl  this morning one of colonel carvels servants came for his letters he must be feeling better ii pray that he is better said richter his voice breaking he has been very good to me  stephen said nothing but he had been conscious all at once of an affection for the judge of which he had not suspected himself that afternoon on his way home he stopped at carvel  companys to inquire mr whipple was better so mr hopper said and added that he presumed likely the colonel would not be in for a week it was then saturday eliphalet was actually in the colonels sanctum behind the partition giving orders to several clerks at the time he was so prosperous and important that he could scarce spare a moment to answer stephen who went away wondering whether he had been wise to choose the law  on monday when stephen called at carvel  companys eliphalet was too busy to see him but ephum who went out to glencoe every night with orders told him that the jedge was wuss suh on wednesday there being little change mrs brice ventured to despatch a jelly by ephum on friday afternoon when stephen was deep in whittlesey and the new code he became aware of ephum standing beside him in reply to his anxious question ephum answered  i reckon he better suh he an de colonel done commence wrastlin bout a man name o linkum de colonel done wrote you dis note suh  it was a very polite note containing the colonels compliments asking mr brice to glencoe that afternoon with whatever papers or letters the judge might wish to see and since there was no convenient train in the evening colonel carvel would feel honored if mr brice would spend the night the colonel mentioned the train on which mr brice was expected  the missouri side of the mississippi is a very different country from the hot and treeless prairies of illinois as stephen alighted at the little station at glencoe and was driven away by ned in the colonels buggy he drew in deep breaths of the sweet air of the meramec valley  there had been a shower and the sun glistened on the drops on grass and flowers and the great trees hung heavy over the clay road at last they came to a white gate in the picket fence in sight of a rambling wooden house with a veranda in front covered with honeysuckle and then he saw the colonel in white marseilles smoking a cigar this indeed was real country  as stephen trod the rough flags between the high grass which led toward the house colonel carvel rose to his full height and greeted him  you are very welcome sir he said gravely the judge is asleep now he added i regret to say that we had a little argument this morning and my daughter tells me it will be well not to excite him again today jinny is reading to him now or she would be here to entertain you mr brice jackson cried mr carvel show mr brice to his room  jackson appeared hurriedly seized stephens bag and led the way upstairs through the cool and darkened house to a pretty little room on the south side with matting and roses on the simple dressingtable after he had sat awhile staring at these and at the wet flowergarden from between the slats of his shutters he removed the signs of the railroad upon him and descended the colonel was still on the porch in his easychair he had lighted another cigar and on the stand beside him stood two tall glasses green with the fresh mint colonel carvel rose and with his own hand offered one to stephen  your health mr brice he said and i hope you will feel at home here sir jackson will bring you anything you desire and should you wish to drive i shall be delighted to show you the country  stephen drank that julep with reverence and then the colonel gave him a cigar he was quite overcome by this treatment of a penniless young yankee the colonel did not talk politicssuch was not his notion of hospitality to a stranger he talked horse and no great discernment on stephens part was needed to perceive that this was mr carvels hobby  i used to have a stable mr brice before they ruined gentlemans sport with these trotters ten years ago yes sir we used to be at lexington one week and louisville the next and over here on the ames track after that did you ever hear of water witch and netty boone  yes stephen had from mr jack brinsmade  the colonels face beamed  why sir he cried that very nigger ned who drove you here from the carshe used to ride netty boone would you believe that mr brice he was the best jockey ever strode a horse on the elleardsville track here he wore my yellow and green sir until he got to weigh one hundred and a quarter and i kept him down to that weight a whole year mr brice yes sirree a whole year  kept him down said stephen  why yes sir i had him wrapped in blankets and set in a chair with holes bored in the seat then we lighted a spirit lamp under him many a time i took off ten pounds that way it needs fire to get flesh off a nigger sir  he didnt notice his guests amazement  then sir he continued they introduced these damned trotting races trotting races are for white trash mr brice  pa  the colonel stopped short stephen was already on his feet i wish you could have seen miss virginia carvel as he saw her then she wore a white lawn dress a teatray was in her hand and her head was tilted back as women are apt to do when they carry a burden it was so that these southern families who were so bitter against abolitionists and yankees entertained them when they were poor and nursed them when they were ill  stephen for his life could not utter a word but virginia turned to him with perfect selfpossession  he has been boring you with his horses mr brice she said has he told you what a jockey ned used to be before he weighed one hundred and a quarter a laugh has he given you the points of water witch and netty boone more laughter increasing embarrassment for stephen pa i tell you once more that you will drive every guest from this house your jockey talk is intolerable  o that you might have a notion of the way in which virginia pronounced intolerable  mr carvel reached for another cigar asked my dear he asked how is the judge  my dear said virginia smiling he is asleep mammy easter is with him trying to make out what he is saying he talks in his sleep just as you do  and what is he saying demanded the colonel interested  virginia set down the tray  a house divided against itself said miss carvel with a sweep of her arm cannot stand i believe that this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to dissolvei do not expect the house to fallbut i do expect it will cease to be divided would you like any more added miss virginia  no cried the colonel and banged his fist down on the table why said he thoughtfully stroking the white goatee on his chin cuss me if that aint from the speech that country bumpkin lincoln made in june last before the black republican convention in illinois  virginia broke again into laughter and stephen was very near it for he loved the colonel that gentleman suddenly checked himself in his tirade and turned to him  i beg your pardon sir he said i reckon that you have the same political sentiments as the judge believe me sir i would not willingly offend a guest  stephen smiled i am not offended sir he said a speech which caused mr carvel to bestow a quick glance upon him but stephen did not see it he was looking at virginia  the colonel rose  you will pardon my absence for a while sir he said  my daughter will entertain you  in silence they watched him as he strode off under the trees through tall grass a yellow setter at his heels a strange peace was over stephen the shadows of the walnuts and hickories were growing long and a rich country was giving up its scent to the evening air from a cabin behind the house was wafted the melody of a plantation song to the young man after the burnt city this was paradise and then he remembered his mother as she must be sitting on the tiny porch in town and sighed only two years ago she had been at their own place at westbury  he looked up and saw the girl watching him he dared not think that the expression he caught was one of sympathy for it changed instantly  i am afraid you are the silent kind mr brice said she i believe it is a yankee trait  stephen laughed  i have known a great many who were not said he when they are garrulous they are very much so  i should prefer a garrulous one said virginia  i should think a yankee were bad enough but a noisy yankee not to be put up with he ventured  virginia did not deign a direct reply to this save by the corners of her mouth  i wonder said she thoughtfully whether it is strength of mind or a lack of ideas that makes them silent  it is mostly prudence said mr brice prudence is our dominant trait  virginia fidgeted usually she had an easier time  you have not always shown it she said with an innocence which in women is often charged with meaning  stephen started her antagonism was still there he would have liked greatly to know whether she referred to his hasty purchase of hester or to his rashness in dancing with her at her party the winter before  we have something left to be thankful for he answered we are still capable of action  on occasions it is violence said virginia desperately this man must not get ahead of her  it is just as violent said he as the repressed feeling which prompts it  this was a new kind of conversation to virginia of all the young men she knew not one had ever ventured into anything of the sort they were either flippant or sentimental or both she was at once flattered and annoyed flattered because as a woman stephen had conceded her a mind many of the young men she knew had minds but deemed that these were wasted on women whose language was generally supposed to be a kind of childish twaddle even jack brinsmade rarely risked his dignity and reputation at an intellectual tilt this was one of virginias grievances she often argued with her father and if the truth were told had had more than one victory over judge whipple  virginias annoyance came from the fact that she perceived in stephen a natural and merciless logica faculty for getting at the bottom of things his brain did not seem to be thrown out of gear by local magnetic influencesby beauty for instance he did not lose his head as did some others she knew at the approach of feminine charms here was a grand subject then to try the mettle of any woman one with less mettle would have given it up but virginia thought it would be delightful to bring this particular yankee to his knees andand leave him there  mr brice she said i have not spoken to you since the night of my party i believe we danced together  yes we did said he and i called but was unfortunate  you called  ah virginia  they did not tell you cried stephen  now miss carvel was complacency itself  jackson is so careless with cards said she and very often i do not take the trouble to read them  i am sorry said he as i wished for the opportunity to tell you how much i enjoyed myself i have found everybody in st louis very kind to strangers  virginia was nearly disarmed she remembered how she had opposed his coning but honesty as well as something else prompted her to say it was my father who invited you  stephen did not reveal the shock his vanity had received  at least you were good enough to dance with me  i could scarcely refuse a guest she replied  he held up his head  had i thought it would have given you annoyance he said quietly i should not have asked you  which would have been a lack of good manners said virginia biting her lips  stephen answered nothing but wished himself in st louis he could not comprehend her cruelty but just then the bell rang for supper and the colonel appeared around the end of the house  it was one of those suppers for which the south is renowned and when at length he could induce stephen to eat no more colonel carvel reached for his broadbrimmed felt hat and sat smoking with his feet against the mantle virginia who had talked but little disappeared with a tray on which she had placed with her own hands some dainties to tempt the judge  the colonel regaled stephen when she was gone with the pedigree and performance of every horse he had had in his stable and this was a relief as it gave him an opportunity to think without interruption upon virginias pronounced attitude of dislike to him it was inconceivable that a young woman of such qualities as she appeared to have should assail him so persistently for freeing a negress and so depriving her of a maid she had set her heart upon there were other new england young men in society mr weston and mr carpenter and more they were not her particular friends to be sure but they called on her and danced with her and she had shown them not the least antipathy but it was to stephens credit that he did not analyze her further  he was reflecting on these things when he got to his room when there came a knock at the door it was mammy easter in bright turban and apronwas hospitality and comfort in the flesh  is you got all you need suh she inquired  stephen replied that he had but mammy showed no inclination to go and he was too polite to shut the door  how you like glencoe mistah bride  he was charmed with it  we has some of de fust famlies out heah in de summer said she but de colonel he ant much on a gran place laik in kaintuck shucks no suh dis aint much of a stablishment young massa wont have no lawns no greenhouses no nothin he say he laik it wil and simple he ony come out fo two months mebbe but miss jinny she make it lively las week until the jedge come we hab dis house chuck full twothree young ladies in a room an five young gemmen on trunnle beds  until the judge came echoed stephen  yassuh den miss jinny low dey all hatter go she say she ant gwineter have em noun sturbin a sick man de colonel monstrated he done give the judge his big room and he say he and de young men gwine ober to mista catherwoods you ant never seen miss jinny rise up suh she des swep em all out mammy emphasized this by rolling her hands an declah she gwine ten to the jedge herself she ant never let me bring up one of his meals suh and so she left stephen with some food for reflection  virginia was very gay at breakfast and said that the judge would see stephen so he and the colonel that gentleman with his hat on went up to his room the shutters were thrown open and the morning sunlight filtered through the leaves and fell on the fourposter where the judge sat up gaunt and grizzled as ever he smiled at his host and then tried to destroy immediately the effect of the smile  well judge cried the colonel taking his hand i reckon we talked too much  no such thing carvel said the judge forcibly if you hadnt left the room your popular sovereignty would have been in rags in two minutes  stephen sat down in a corner unobserved in expectation of a renewal but at this moment miss virginia swept into the room very cool in a pink muslin  colonel carvel said she sternly i am the doctors deputy here i was told to keep the peace at any cost and if you answer back out you go like that and she snapped her fingers  the colonel laughed but the judge whose mind was on the argument continued to mutter defiantly until his eye fell upon stephen  well sir well sir he said youve turned up at last have you i send you off with papers for a man and i get back a piece of yellow paper saying that hes borrowed you what did he do with you mr brice  he took me to freeport sir where i listened to the most remarkable speech i ever expect to hear  what cried the judge so far from boston  stephen hesitated uncertain whether to laugh until he chanced to look at virginia she had pursed her lips  i was very much surprised sir he said  humph grunted mr whipple and what did you chink of that ruffian lincoln  he is the most remarkable man that i have ever met sir answered stephen with emphasis  humph  it seemed as if the grunt this time had in it something of approval stephen had doubt as to the propriety of discussing mr lincoln there and he reddened virginias expression bore a trace of defiance and mr carvel stood with his feet apart thoughtfully stroking his goatee but mr whipple seemed to have no scruples  so you admired lincoln mr brice he went on you must agree with that laudatory estimation of him which i read in the missouri democrat  stephen fidgeted  i do sir most decidedly he answered  i should hardly expect a conservative bostonian of the class which respects property to have said that it might possibly be a good thing if more from your town could hear those debates  they will read them sir i feel confident of it  at this point the colonel could contain himself no longer  i reckon i might tell the man who wrote that democrat article a few things if i could find out who he is said he  pa said virginia warningly  but stephen had turned a fiery red i wrote it colonel carvel he said  for a dubious instant of silence colonel carvel stared thenthen he slapped his knees broke into a storm of laughter and went out of the room he left stephen in a moist state of discomfiture  the judge had bolted upright from the pillows  you have been neglecting your law sir he cried  i wrote the article at night said stephen indignantly  then it must have been sunday night mr brice  at this point virginia hid her face in her handkerchief which trembled visibly being a woman whose ways are unaccountable the older man took no notice of her but being a young woman and a pretty one stephen was angry  i dont see what right you have to ask me that sir he said  the question is withdrawn mr brice said the judge virginia you may strike it from the records and now sir tell me something about your trip  virginia departed  an hour later stephen descended to the veranda and it was with apprehension that he discerned mr carvel seated under the vines at the far end virginia was perched on the railing  to stephens surprise the colonel rose and coming toward him laid a kindly hand on his shoulder  stephen said he there will be no law until monday you must stay with us until then a little rest will do you good  stephen was greatly touched  thank you sir he said i should like to very much but i cant  nonsense said the colonel i wont let the judge interfere  it isnt that sir i shall have to go by the two oclock train i fear  the colonel turned to virginia who meanwhile had sat silently by  jinny he said we must contrive to keep him  she slid off the railing  im afraid he is determined pa she answered but perhaps mr brice would like to see a little of the place before he goes it is very primitive she explained not much like yours in the east  stephen thanked her and bowed to the colonel and so she led him past the low crooked outbuildings at the back where he saw old uncle ben busy over the preparation of his dinner and frisky rosetta his daughter playing with one of the colonels setters then virginia took a wellworn path on each side of which the high grass bent with its load of seed which entered the wood oaks and hickories and walnuts and persimmons spread out in a glade and the wild grape twisted fantastically around the trunks all this beauty seemed but a fit setting to the strong girlish figure in the pink frock before him so absorbed was he in contemplation of this and in wondering whether indeed she were to marry her cousin clarence colfax that he did not see the wonders of view unrolling in front of him she stopped at length beside a great patch of wild race bushes they were on the edge of the bluff and in front of them a little rustic summerhouse with seats on its five sides here virginia sat down but stephen going to the edge stood and marvelled far far below him down the wooded steep shot the crystal meramec chafing over the shallow gravel beds and tearing headlong at the deep passes  beyond the dimpled green hills rose and fell and the stream ran indigo and silver a hawk soared over the water the only living creature in all that wilderness  the glory of the place stirred his blood and when at length he turned he saw that the girl was watching him  it is very beautiful he said  virginia had taken other young men here and they had looked only upon her and yet she was not offended this sincerity now was as new to her as that with which he had surprised her in the judges room  and she was not quite at her ease a reply to those simple words of his was impossible at honest tom catherwood in the same situation she would have laughed clarence never so much as glanced at scenery her replies to him were either flippant or else maternal as to a child  a breeze laden with the sweet abundance of that valley stirred her hair and with that womanly gesture which has been the same through the ages she put up her hand deftly tucking in the stray wisp behind  she glanced at the new englander against whom she had been in strange rebellion since she had first seen him his face thinned by the summer in town was of the sternness of the puritan stephens features were sharply marked for his age the will to conquer was there yet justice was in the mouth and greatness of heart conscience was graven on the broad forehead the eyes were the blue gray of the flint kindly yet imperishable the face was not handsome  struggling then yielding to the impulse virginia let herself be led on into the years sanity was the word that best described him she saw him trusted of men honored of women feared by the false she saw him in high places simple reserved poised evenly as he was now  why do you go in this afternoon she asked abruptly  he started at the change in her tone  i wish that i might stay he said regretfully but i cannot miss carvel  he gave no reason and she was too proud to ask it never before had she stooped to urge young men to stay the difficulty had always been to get them to go it was natural perhaps that her vanity was wounded but it hurt her to think that she had made the overture had tried to conquer whatever it was that set her against him and had failed through him  you must find the city attractive perhaps she added with a little laugh perhaps it is bellefontaine road  no he answered smiling  then with a touch of derision then it is because you cannot miss an afternoons work you are that kind  i was not always that kind he answered i did not work at harvard but now i have to oror starve he said  for the second time his complete simplicity had disarmed her he had not appealed to her sympathy nor had he hinted at the luxury in which he was brought up she would have liked to question stephen on this former life but she changed the subject suddenly  what did you really think of mr lincoln she asked  i thought him the ugliest man i ever saw and the handsomest as well  but you admired him  yes said stephen gravely  you believe with him that this government cannot exist half slave and half free then a day will come mr brice when you and i shall be foreigners one to the other  you have forgotten he said eagerly you have forgotten the rest of the quotation i do not expect the union to be dissolvedi do not expect the house to fallbut cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other  virginia laughed that seemed to me very equivocal said she your railsputter is well named  will you read the rest of that speech he asked  judge whipple is very clever he has made a convert of you she answered  the judge has had nothing to do with it cried stephen he is not given to discussion with me and until i went to springfield had never mentioned lincolns name to me  glancing at her he surprised a sparkle of amusement in her eyes then she laughed openly  why do you suppose that you were sent to springfield she asked  with an important communication for mr lincoln he answered  and that most important communication wasyour self there now i have told you said virginia  was myself i dont understand  virginia puckered her lips  then you havent the sense i thought you had she replied impatiently do you know what was in that note no well a year ago last june this black republican lawyer whom you are all talking of made a speech before a convention in illinois judge whipple has been crazy on the subject ever sincehe talks of lincoln in his sleep he went to springfield and spent two days with him and now he cant rest until you have seen and known and heard him so he writes a note to lincoln and asks him to take you to the debate  she paused again to laugh at his amazement  but he told me to go to springfield he exclaimed  he told you to find lincoln he knew that you would obey his orders i suppose  but i didnt know stephen began trying to come pass within an instant the memory of his years experience with mr whipple  you didnt know that he thought anything about you said virginia that is his way mr brice he has more private charities on his list than any man in the city except mr brinsmade very few know it he thinks a great deal of you but there she added suddenly blushing crimson i am sorry i told you  why he asked  she did not answer but sat tapping the seat with her fingers and when she ventured to look at him he had fallen into thought  i think it must be time for dinner said virginia if you really wish to catch the train  the coldness in her voice rather than her words aroused him he rose took one lingering look at the river and followed her to the house  at dinner when not talking about his mare the colonel was trying to persuade stephen to remain virginia did not join in this and her father thought the young mans refusal sprang from her lack of cordiality colonel carvel himself drove to the station  when he returned he found his daughter sitting idly on the porch  i like that young man if he is a yankee he declared  i dont said virginia promptly  my dear said her father voicing the hospitality of the carvels i am surprised at you one should never show ones feelings toward a guest as mistress of this house it was your duty to press him to stay  he did not want to stay  do you know why he went my dear asked the colonel  no said virginia  i asked him said the colonel  pa i did not think it of you she cried and then what was it she demanded  he said that his mother was alone in town and needed him  virginia got up without a word and went into judge whipples room and there the colonel found her some hours later reading aloud from a scrapbook certain speeches of mr lincolns which judge whipple had cut from newspapers and the judge lying back with his eyes half closed was listening in pure delight little did he guess at virginias penance     volume 4     chapter vii an excursion  i am going ahead two years two years during which a nation struggled in agony with sickness and even the great strength with which she was endowed at birth was not equal to the task of throwing it off in 1620 a dutch ship had brought from guinea to his majestys colony of virginia the germs of that disease for which the nations blood was to be let so freely during these years signs of dissolution of death were not wanting  in the city by the father of waters where the races met men and women were born into the world who were to die in ancient cuba who were to be left fatherless in the struggle soon to come who were to live to see new monsters rise to gnaw at the vitals of the republic and to hear again the cynical laugh of europe but they were also to see their country a power in the world perchance the greatest power while europe had wrangled the child of the west had grown into manhood and taken a seat among the highest to share with them the responsibilities of manhood  meanwhile stephen brice had been given permission to practise law in the sovereign state of missouri stephen understood judge whipple better it cannot be said that he was intimate with that rather formidable personage although the judge being a man of habits had formed that of taking tea at least once a week with mrs brice stephen had learned to love the judge and he had never ceased to be grateful to him for a knowledge of that man who had had the most influence upon his lifeabraham lincoln  for the seed sowed in wisdom and selfdenial was bearing fruit the sound of gathering conventions was in the land and the freeport heresy was not for gotten  we shall not mention the number of clients thronging to mr whipples office to consult mr brice these things are humiliating some of stephens income came from articles in the newspapers of that day what funny newspapers they were the size of a blanket no startling headlines such as we see now but a continued novel among the advertisements on the front page and verses from some gifted lady of the town signed electra and often a story of pure love but more frequently of ghosts or other eerie phenomena taken from a magazine or an anecdote of a cat or a chicken there were letters from citizens who had the mania of print bulletins of different ages from all parts of the union clippings out of daybeforeyesterdays newspaper of chicago or cincinnati to threeweeks letters from san francisco come by the pony post to lexington and then down the swift missouri of course there was news by telegraph but that was precious as fine goldnot to be lightly read and cast aside  in the autumn of 59 through the kindness of mr brinsmade stephen had gone on a steamboat up the river to a great convention in iowa on this excursion was much of st louiss bluest blood he widened his circle of acquaintances and spent much of his time walking the guards between miss anne brinsmade and miss puss russell perhaps it is unfair to these young ladies to repeat what they said about stephen in the privacy of their staterooms gentle anne remonstrating that they should not gossip and listening eagerly the while and laughing at miss puss whose mimicry of stephens severe ways brought tears to her eyes  mr clarence colfax was likewise on the boat and passing stephen on the guards bowed distantly but once on the return trip when stephen had a writing pad on his knee the young southerner came up to him in his frankest manner and with an expression of the gray eyes which was not to be withstood  making a case brice he said i hear you are the kind that cannot be idle even on a holiday  not as bad as all that replied stephen smiling at him  reckon you keep a diary then said clarence leaning against the rail he made a remarkably graceful figure stephen thought he was tall and his movements had what might be called a commanding indolence stephen while he smiled could not but admire the tone and gesture with which colfax bade a passing negro to get him a handkerchief from his cabin the alacrity of the black to do the errand was amusing enough stephen well knew it had not been such if he wanted a handkerchief  stephen said it was not a diary mr colfax was too well bred to inquire further so he never found out that mr brice was writing an account of the convention and the speechmaking for the missouri democrat  brice said the southerner i want to apologize for things ive done to you and said about you i hated you for a long time after you beat me out of hester and he hesitated  stephen looked up for the first time he actually liked colfax he had been long enough among colfaxs people to understand how difficult it was for him to say the thing he wished  you may remember a night at my uncles colonel carvels on the occasion of my cousins birthday  yes said stephen in surprise  well blurted clarence boyishly i was rude to you in my uncles house and i have since been sorry  he held out his hand and stephen took it warmly  i was younger then mr colfax he said and i didnt understand your point of view as well as i do now not that i have changed my ideas he added quickly but the notion of the girls going south angered me i was bidding against the dealer rather than against you had i then known miss carvel he stopped abruptly  the winning expression died from the face of the other  he turned away and leaning across the rail stared at the high bluffs redbronzed by the autumn sun a score of miles beyond that precipice was a long low building of stone surrounded by spreading treesthe school for young ladies celebrated throughout the west where our mothers and grandmothers were taughtmonticello hither miss virginia carvel had gone some thirty days since for her second winter  perhaps stephen guessed the thought in the mind of his companion for he stared also the music in the cabin came to an abrupt pause and only the tumbling of waters through the planks of the great wheels broke the silence they were both startled by laughter at their shoulders there stood miss russell the picture of merriment her arm locked in anne brinsmades  it is the hour when all devout worshippers turn towards the east she said the goddess is enshrined at monticello  both young men as they got to their feet were crimson whereupon miss russell laughed again anne however blushed for them but this was not the first time miss russell had gone too far young mr colfax with the excess of manner which was his at such times excused himself and left abruptly this to the further embarrassment of stephen and anne and the keener enjoyment of miss russell  was i not right mr brice she demanded why you are even writing verses to her  i scarcely know miss carvel he said recovering and as for writing verse  you never did such a thing in your life i can well believe it  miss russell made a face in the direction colfax had taken  he always acts like that when you mention her she said  but you are so cruel puss said anne you cant blame him  hairpins said miss russell  isnt she to marry him said stephen in his natural voice  he remembered his pronouns too late  that has been the way of the world ever since adam and eve remarked puss i suppose you meant to ask mr brice whether clarence is to marry virginia carvel  anne nudged her  my dear what will mr brice think of us  listen mr brice puss continued undaunted i shall tell you some gossip virginia was sent to monticello and went with her father to kentucky and pennsylvania this summer that she might be away from clarence colfax  oh puss cried anne  miss russell paid not the slightest heed  colonel carvel is right she went on i should do the same thing they are first cousins and the colonel doesnt like that i am fond of clarence but he isnt good for anything in the world except horse racing andand fighting he wanted to help drive the black republican emigrants out of kansas and his mother had to put a collar and chain on him he wanted to go filibustering with walker and she had to get down on her knees and yet she cried if you yankees push us as far as war mr brice just look out for him  but anne interposed  oh i know what you are going to saythat clarence has money  puss cried anne outraged how dare you  miss russell slipped an arm around her waist  come anne she said we mustnt interrupt the senator any longer he is preparing his maiden speech  that was the way in which stephen got his nickname it is scarcely necessary to add that he wrote no more until he reached his little room in the house on olive street  they had passed alton and the black cloud that hung in the still autumn air over the city was in sight it was dusk when the jackson pushed her nose into the levee and the song of the negro stevedores rose from below as they pulled the gangplank on to the landingstage stephen stood apart on the hurricane deck gazing at the dark line of sooty warehouses how many young men with their way to make have felt the same as he did after some pleasant excursion the presence of a tall form beside him shook him from his revery and he looked up to recognize the benevolent face of mr brinsmade  mrs brice may be anxious stephen at the late hour said he my carriage is here and it will give me great pleasure to convey you to your door  dear mr brinsmade he is in heaven now and knows at last the good he wrought upon earth of the many thoughtful charities which stephen received from him this one sticks firmest in his remembrance a stranger tired and lonely and apart from the gay young men and women who stepped from the boat he had been sought out by this gentleman to whom had been given the divine gift of forgetting none  oh puss cried anne that evening for miss russell had come to spend the night how could you have talked to him so he scarcely spoke on the way up in the carriage you have offended him  why should i set him upon a pedestal said puss with a thread in her mouth why should you all set him upon a pedestal he is only a yankee said puss tossing her head and not so very wonderful  i did not say he was wonderful replied anne with dignity  but you girls think him so emily and eugenie and maude he had better marry belle cluyme a great man he may give some decision to that family anne  yes  shall i tell you a secret  yes said anne she was human and she was feminine  thenvirginia carvel is in love with him  with mr brice cried astonished anne she hates him  she thinks she hates him said miss russell calmly  anne looked up at her companion admiringly her two heroines were puss and virginia both had the same kind of daring but in puss the trait had developed into a somewhat disagreeable outspokenness which made many people dislike her her judgments were usually well founded and her prophecies had so often come to pass that anne often believed in them for no other reason  how do you know said anne incredulously  do you remember that september a year ago when we were all out at glencoe and judge whipple was ill and virginia sent us all away and nursed him herself  yes said anne  and did you know that mr brice had gone out with letters when the judge was better  yes said anne breathless  it was a saturday afternoon that he left although they had begged him to stay over sunday virginia had written for me to come back and i arrived in the evening i asked easter where jinny was and i found her  you found her said anne  sitting alone in the summerhouse over the river easter said she had been there for two hours and i have never known jinny to be such miserable company as she was that night  did she mention stephen asked anne  no  but you did said anne with conviction  miss russells reply was not as direct as usual  you know virginia never confides unless she wants to she said  anne considered  virginia has scarcely seen him since then she said you know that i was her roommate at monticello last year and i think i should have discovered it  did she speak of him demanded miss russell  only when the subject was mentioned i heard her repeat once what judge whipple told her father of him that he had a fine legal mind he was often in my letters from home because they have taken pas house next door and because pa likes them i used to read those letters to jinny said anne but she never expressed any desire to hear them  i too used to write jinny about him confessed puss  did she answer your letter  no replied miss pussbut that was just before the holidays you remember and then the colonel hurried her off to see her pennsylvania relatives and i believe they went to annapolis too where the carvels come from  stephen sitting in the next house writing out his account little dreamed that he was the subject of a conference in the third story front of the brinsmades later when the young ladies were asleep he carried his manuscript to the democrat office and delivered it into the hands of his friend the night editor who was awaiting it  toward the end of that week miss virginia carvel was sitting with her back to one of the great trees at monticello reading a letter every once in a while she tucked it under her cloak and glanced hastily around it was from miss anne brinsmade  i have told you all about the excursion my dear and how we missed you you may remember ah anne the guile there is in the best of us you may remember mr stephen brice whom we used to speak of pa and ma take a great interest in him and pa had him invited on the excursion he is more serious than ever since he has become a fullfledged lawyer but he has a dry humor which comes out when you know him well of which i did not suspect him his mother is the dearest lady i have ever known so quiet so dignified and so well bred they come in to supper very often and the other night mr brice told pa so many things about the people south of market street the germans which he did not know that pa was astonished he told all about german history and how they were persecuted at home and why they came here pa was surprised to hear that many of them were university men and that they were already organizing to defend the union i heard pa say that is what mr blair meant when he assured me that we need not fear for the city  jinny dear i ought not to have written you this because you are for secession and in your heart you think pa a traitor because he comes from a slave state and has slaves of his own but i shall not tear it up  it is sad to think how rich mrs brice lived in boston and what she has had to come to one servant and a little house and no place to go to in the summer when they used to have such a large one i often go in to sew with her but she has never once mentioned her past to me  your father has no doubt sent you the democrat with the account of the convention it is the fullest published by far and was so much admired that pa asked the editor who wrote it who do you think but stephen brice so now pa knows why mr brice hesitated when pa asked him to go up the river and then consented this is not the end yesterday when i went in to see mrs brice a new black silk was on her bed and as long as i live i shall never forget how sweet was her voice when she said it is a surprise from my son my dear i did not expect ever to have another jinny i just know he bought it with the money he got for the article that was what he was writing on the boat when clarence colfax interrupted him puss accused him of writing verses to you  at this point miss virginia carvel stopped reading whether she had read that part before who shall say but she took annes letter between her fingers and tore it into bits and flung the bits into the wind so that they were tossed about and lost among the dead leaves under the great trees and when she reached her room there was the hated missouri democrat lying still open on her table a little later a great black piece of it came tossing out of the chimney above to the affright of little miss brown teacher of literature who was walking in the grounds and who ran to the principals room with the story that the chimney was afire     chapter viii the colonel is warned  it is difficult to refrain from mention of the leavetaking of miss virginia carvel from the monticello female seminary so called in the democrat most young ladies did not graduate in those days there were exercises stephen chanced to read in the republican about these ceremonies which mentioned that miss virginia carvel daughter of colonel comyn carvel was without doubt the beauty of the day she wore but why destroy the picture i have the costumes under my hand the words are meaningless to all males and young women might laugh at a critical time miss emily russell performed upon that most superb of all musical instruments the human voice was it auld robin gray that she sang i am sure it was miss maude catherwood who recited to my mother with such effect miss carvel so stephen learned with alarm was to read a poem by mrs browning but was unavoidably prevented the truth was as he heard afterward from miss puss russell that miss jinny had refused point blank so the lady principal to save her reputation for discipline had been forced to deceive the press  there was another who read the account of the exercises with intense interest a gentleman of whom we have lately forborne to speak this is mr eliphalet hopper eliphalet has prospered it is to be doubted if that somewhat easygoing gentleman colonel carvel realized the full importance of eliphalet to carvel  company mr hood had been superseded ephum still opened the store in the mornings but mr hopper was within the groundglass office before the place was warm and through warerooms and shipping rooms rubbing his hands to see if any were late many of the old force were missed and a new and greater force were come in these feared eliphalet as they did the devil and worked the harder to please him because eliphalet had hired that kind to them the colonel was lifted high above the sordid affairs of the world he was at the store every day in the winter and mr hopper always followed him obsequiously into the groundglass office called in the bookkeeper and showed him the books and the increased earnings  the colonel thought of mr hood and his slovenly management and sighed in spite of his doubled income mr hopper had added to the companys list of customers whole districts in the growing southwest and yet the honest colonel did not like him mr hopper by a gradual process had taken upon his own shoulders and consequently off the colonels responsibility after responsibility there were some painful scenes of course such as the departure of mr hood which never would have occurred had not eliphalet proved without question the incapacity of the ancient manager mr hopper only narrowed his lids when the colonel pensioned mr hood but the colonel had a will before which when roused even mr hopper trembled so that eliphalet was always polite to ephum and careful never to say anything in the darkeys presence against incompetent clerks or favorite customers who by the charity of the colonel remained on his books  one spring day after the sober homecoming of colonel carvel from the democratic convention at charleston ephum accosted his master as he came into the store of a morning ephums face was working with excitement  whats the matter with you ephum asked the colonel kindly you havent been yourself lately  no marsa i aint zactly  ephum put down the duster peered out of the door of the private office and closed it softly  marse comyn  yes  marse comyn i aint got no use fo dat misteh hoppa ise kinder supstitious bout him marsa  the colonel put down his newspaper  has he treated you badly ephum he asked quietly  the faithful negro saw another question in his masters face he well knew that colonel carvel would not descend to ask an inferior concerning the conduct of a superior  oh no suh and i aint sayin nuthin gin his honesty he straight but he powerful sharp marse comyn an he jus mussiless down to a cent  the colonel sighed he realized that which was beyond the grasp of the negros mind new and thriftier methods of trade from new england were fast replacing the old openhandedness of the large houses competition had begun and competition is cruel edwards james  company had taken a yankee into the firm they were now edwards james  doddington and mr edwardss coolness towards the colonel was manifest since the rise of eliphalet they were rivals now instead of friends but colonel carvel did not know until after years that mr hopper had been offered the place which mr doddington filled later  as for mr hopper increase of salary had not changed him he still lived in the same humble way in a single room in miss cranes boardinghouse and he paid very little more for his board than he had that first week in which he swept out colonel carvels store he was superintendent now of mr davitts sunday school and a church officer at night when he came home from business he would read the widows evening paper and the colonels morning paper at the office of true puritan abstemiousness his only indulgence was chewing tobacco it was as early as 1859 that the teller of the boatmans bank began to point out mr hoppers back to casual customers and he was more than once seen to enter the presidents room which had carpet on the floor  eliphalets suavity with certain delinquent customers from the southwest was a wording to scripture when they were profane and invited him into the street he reminded them that the city had a police force and a jail while still a young man he had a manner of folding his hands and smiling which is peculiar to capitalists and he knew the laws concerning mortgages in several different states  but eliphalet was content still to remain in the sphere in which providence had placed him and so to be an example for many of us he did not buy or even hire an evening suit he was pleased to superintend some of the details for a dance at christmastime before virginia left monticello but he sat as usual on the stairlanding there mr jacob cluyme who had been that day in conversation with the teller of the boatmans bank chanced upon him mr cluyme was so charmed at the facility with which eliphalet recounted the rise and fall of sugar and cotton and wheat that he invited mr hopper to dinner and from this meal may be reckoned the first appearance of the family of which eliphalet hopper was the head into polite society if the cluyme household was not polite it was nothing eliphalet sat next to miss belle and heard the private history of many old families which he cherished for future use mrs cluyme apologized for the dinner which if the truth were told needed an apology all of which is significant but sordid and uninteresting jacob cluyme usually bought stocks before a rise  there was only one person who really bothered eliphalet as he rose into prominence and that person was captain elijah brent if upon entering the groundglass office he found eliphalet without the colonel captain lige would walk out again just as if the office were empty the inquiries he made were addressed always to ephum once when mr hopper had bidden him good morning and pushed a chair toward him the honest captain had turned his back and marched straight to the house or tenth street where he found the colonel alone at breakfast the captain sat down opposite  colonel said he without an introduction i dont like this here business of letting hopper run your store hes a fish i tell you  the colonel drank his coffee in silence  lige he said gently hes nearly doubled my income it isnt the old times when we all went our own way and kept our old customers year in and year out you know that  the captain took a deep draught of the coffee which jackson had laid before him  colonel carvel he said emphatically the fellows a damned rascal and will ruin you yet if you dont take advice  the colonel shifted uneasily  the books show that hes honest lige  yes cried lige with his fist on the table honest to a mill but if that fellow ever gets on top of you or any one else hell grind you into dust  he isnt likely to get on top of me lige i know the business and keep watch and now that jinnys coming home from monticello i feel that i can pay more attention to herkind of take her mothers place said the colonel putting on his felt hat and tipping his chair lige i want that girl to have every advantage she ought to go to europe and see the world that trip east last summer did her a heap of good when we were at calvert house dan read her something that my grandfather had written about london and she was regularly fired first i must take her to the eastern shore to see carvel hall dan still owns it now its london and paris  the captain walked over to the window and said nothing he did not see the searching gray eyes of his old friend upon him  lige said the colonel  the captain turned  lige why dont you give up steamboating and come along to europe youre not forty yet and you have a heap of money laid by  the captain shook his head with the vigor that characterized him  this aint no time for me to leave he said colonel i tell you theres a storm comin  the colonel pulled his goatee uneasily here at last was a man in whom there was no guile  lige he said isnt it about time you got married  upon which the captain shook his head again even with more vigor he could not trust himself to speak after the christmas holidays he had driven virginia across the frozen river all the way to monticello in a sleigh it was night when they had reached the school the light of its many windows casting long streaks on the snow under the trees he had helped her out and had taken her hand as she stood on the step  be good jinny he had said remember what a short time it will be until june and your pa will come over to see you  she had seized him by the buttons of his great coat and said tearfully o captain lige i shall be so lonely when you are away arent you going to kiss me  he had put his lips to her forehead driven madly back to alton and spent the night the first thing he did the next day when he reached st louis was to go straight to the colonel and tell him bluntly of the circumstance  lige id hate to give her up mr carvel said but id rather youd marry her than any man i can think of     chapter ix signs of the times  in that spring of 1860 the time was come for the south to make her final stand and as the noise of gathering conventions shook the ground stephen brice was not the only one who thought of the question at freeport the hour was now at hand for it to bear fruit  meanwhile his hero the hewer of rails and forger of homely speech abraham lincoln had made a little tour eastward the year before and had startled cooper union with a new logic and a new eloquence they were the same logic and the same eloquence which had startled stephen  even as he predicted who had given it birth the question destroyed the great democratic party colonel carvel travelled to the convention in historic charleston soberly and fearing god as many another southern gentleman in old saint michaels they knelt to pray for harmony for peace for a front bold and undismayed toward those who wronged them all through the week chosen orators wrestled in vain judge douglas you flattered yourself that you had evaded the question do you see the southern delegates rising in their seats alabama leaves the hall followed by her sister stakes the south has not forgotten your freeport heresy once she loved you now she will have none of you  gloomily indeed did colonel carvel return home he loved the union and the flag for which his grandfather richard had fought so bravely that flag was his inheritance so the judge laying his hand upon the knee of his friend reminded him gravely but the colonel shook his head the very calmness of their argument had been portentous  no whipple said he you are a straightforward man you cant disguise it you of the north are bent upon taking away from us the rights we had when our fathers framed the constitution however the nigger got to this country sir in your bristol and newport traders as well as in our virginia and maryland ships he is here and he was here when the constitution was written he is happier in slavery than are your factory hands in new england and he is no more fit to exercise the solemn rights of citizenship i say than the halfbreeds in the south american states  the judge attempted to interrupt but mr carvel stopped him  suppose you deprive me of my few slaves you do not ruin me yet you do me as great a wrong as you do my friend samuels of louisiana who depends on the labor of five hundred shall i stand by selfishly and see him ruined and thousands of others like him  profoundly depressed colonel carvel did not attend the adjourned convention at baltimore which split once more on mason and dixons line the democrats of the young northwest stood for douglas and johnson and the solid south in another hall nominated breckenridge and lane this of course became the colonels ticket  what a babel of voices was raised that summer each with its cure for existing ills between the extremes of the black republican negro worshippers and the southern rights party of breckenridge your conservative had the choice of two candidatesof judge douglas or senator bell a most respectable but practically extinct body of gentlemen in ruffled shirts the old line whigs had likewise met in baltimore a new name being necessary they called themselves constitutional unionists senator bell was their candidate and they proposed to give the nation soothingsyrup so said judge whipple with a grunt of contempt to mr cluyme who was then a prominent constitutional unionist other and most estimable gentlemen were also constitutional unionists notably mr calvin brinsmade far be it from any one to cast disrespect upon the reputable members of this party whose broad wings sheltered likewise so many weak brethren  one sunday evening in may the judge was taking tea with mrs brice the occasion was memorable for more than one eventwhich was that he addressed stephen by his first name for the first time  youre an admirer of abraham lincoln he had said  stephen used to mr whipples ways smiled quietly at his mother he had never dared mention to the judge his suspicions concerning his journey to springfield and freeport  stephen said the judge here the surprise came in stephen what do you think of mr lincolns chances for the republican nomination  we hear of no name but sewards sir said stephen when he had recovered  the judge grunted  do you think that lincoln would make a good president he added  i have thought so sir ever since you were good enough to give me the opportunity of knowing him  it was a bold speechthe judge drew his great eyebrows together but he spoke to mrs brice  im not as strong as i was once maam said he and yet i am going to that chicago convention  mrs brice remonstrated mildly to the effect that he had done his share of political work he scarcely waited for her to finish  i shall take a younger man with me in case anything happens in fact maam i had thought of taking your son if you can spare him  and so it was that stephen went to that most dramatic of political gatheringsin the historic wigwam it was so that his eyes were opened to the view of the monster which maims the vitality of the republicthe political machine mr seward had brought his machine from new yorka legion prepared to fill the wigwam with their bodies and to drown with their cries all names save that of their master  stephen indeed had his eyes opened through the kindness of judge whipple he heard many quiet talks between that gentleman and delegates from other statespennsylvania and illinois and indiana and elsewhere he perceived that the judge was no nonentity in this new party mr whipple sat in his own room and the delegates came and ranged themselves along the bed late one night when the delegates were gone stephen ventured to speak what was in his mind  mr lincoln did not strike me as the kind of man sir who would permit a bargain  mr lincolns at home playing barnball said the judge curtly he doesnt expect the nomination  then said stephen rather hotly i think you are unfair to him  you are expecting the judge to thunder sometimes he liked this kind of speech  stephen i hope that politics may be a little cleaner when you become a delegate he answered with just the suspicion of a smile supposing you are convinced that abraham lincoln is the only man who can save the union and supposing that the one way to get him nominated is to meet sewards gang with their own methods what would you do sir i want a practical proposition sir said mr whipple one that we can use tonight it is now one clock  as stephen was silent the judge advised him to go to bed and the next morning while mr sewards henchmen confident and uproarious were parading the streets of chicago with their bands and their bunting the vast wigwam was quietly filling up with bony westerners whose ally was none other than the state of pennsylvania these gentlemen possessed wind which they had not wasted in processions and the lord delivered seward and all that was his into their hands  how the light of mr sewards hope went out after the first ballot and how some of the gentlemen attached to his person wept and how the voices shook the wigwam and the thunder of the guns rolled over the tossing water of the lake many now living remember that day a name was delivered to the world through the mouths political schemers which was destined to enter history that of the saviour of the nation  down in little springfield on a vacant lot near the station a tall man in his shirt sleeves was playing barnball with some boys the game finished he had put on his black coat and was starting homeward under the treewhen a fleet youngster darted after him with a telegram the tall man read it and continued on his walk his head bent and his feet taking long strides later in the day he was met by a friend  abe said the friend im almighty glad there somebody in this towns got notorious at last  in the early morning of their return from chicago judge whipple and stephen were standing in the front of a ferryboat crossing the mississippi the sun was behind them the judge had taken off his hat and his gray hair was stirred by the river breeze illness had set a yellow seal on the face but the younger man remarked it not for stephen staring at the black blur of the city outline was filled with a strange exaltation which might have belonged to his puritan forefathers now at length was come his chance to be of use in lifeto dedicate the labor of his hands and of his brains to abraham lincoln uncouth prophet of the west with all his might he would work to save the city for the man who was the hope of the union  the bell rang the great paddles scattered the brow waters with white foam and the judge voiced his thoughts  stephen said he i guess well have to put on shoulders to the wheel this summer if lincoln is not elected i have lived my sixtyfive years for nothing  as he descended the plank he laid a hand on stephens arm and tottered the big louisiana captain brents boat just in from new orleans was blowing off her steam as with slow steps they climbed the levee and the steep pitch of the street beyond it the clatter of hooves and the crack of whips reached their ears and like many others before them and since they stepped into carvel  companys on the inside of the glass partition of the private office a voice of great suavity was heard it was eliphalet hoppers  if you will give me the numbers of the bales captain brent ill send a dray down to your boat and get them  it was a very decisive voice that answered  no sir i prefer to do business with my friend colonel carvel i guess i can wait  i could sell the goods to texas buyers who are here in the store right now  until i get instructions from one of the concern vowed captain lige i shall do as i always have done sir what is your position here mr hopper  i am manager i callate  the captains fist was heard to come down on the desk  you dont manage me he said and i reckon you dont manage the colonel  mr hoppers face was not pleasant to see as he emerged but at sight of judge whipple on the steps his suavity returned  the colonel will be in any minute sir said he  but the judge walked past him without reply and into the office captain brent seeing him sprang to his feet  well well judge said he heartily you fellows have done it now sure ill say this for you youve picked a smart man  better vote for him lige said the judge setting down  the captain smiled at stephen  a mans got a lot of choice this year said he two governments thirtythree governments one government patched up for a year ox two  or no government finished the judge lige youre not such a fool as to vote against the union  judge said the captain instantly im not the only one in this town who will have to decide whether my sympathies are wrong my sympathies are with the south  its not a question of sympathy captain answered the judge dryly abraham lincoln himself was born in kentucky  they had not heard a step without  gentlemen mark my words if abraham lincoln is elected the south leaves this union  the judge started and looked up the speaker was colonel carvel himself  then sir mr whipple cried hotly then you will be chastised and brought back for at last we have chosen a man who is strong enoughwho does not fear your fireeaterswhose electors depend on northern votes alone  stephen rose apprehensively so did captain lige the colonel had taken a step forward and a fire was quick to kindle in his gray eyes it was as quick to die judge whipple deathly pale staggered and fell into stephen arms but it was the colonel who laid him on the horsehair sofa  silas he said silas  nor could the two who listened sound the depth of the pathos the colonel put into those two words  but the judge had not fainted and the brusqueness in his weakened voice was even more pathetic tut tut said he a little heat and no breakfast  the colonel already had a bottle of the famous bourbon day his hand and captain lige brought a glass of muddy iced water mr carvel made an injudicious mixture of the two and held it to the lips of his friend he was pushed away  come silas he said  no cried the judge and with this effort he slipped back again those who stood there thought that the stamp of death was already on judge whipples face  but the lips were firmly closed bidding defiance as ever to the world the colonel stroking his goatee regarded him curiously  silas he said slowly if you wont drink it for me perhaps you will drink itforabrahamlincoln  the two who watched that scene have never forgotten it outside in the great cool store the rattle of the trucks was heard and mr hopper giving commands within was silence the straight figure of the colonel towered above the sofa while he waited a full minute passed once judge whipples bony hand opened and shut and once his features worked then without warning he sat up  colonel said he i reckon i wouldnt be much use to abe if i took that but if youll send ephum after cup of coffee  mr carvel set the glass down in two strides he had reached the door and given the order then he came hack and seated himself on the sofa  stephen found his mother at breakfast he had forgotten the convention he told her what had happened at mr carvels store and how the colonel had tried to persuade judge whipple to take the glencoe house while he was in europe and how the judge had refused tears were in the widows eyes when stephen finished  and he means to stay here in the heat and go through the campaign she asked  he says that he will not stir  it will kill him stephen mrs brice faltered  so the colonel told him and he said that he would die willinglyafter abraham lincoln was elected he had nothing to live for but to fight for that he had never understood the world and had quarrelled with at all his life  he said that to colonel carvel  yes  stephen  he didnt dare to look at his mother nor she at him and when he reached the office half an hour later mr whipple was seated in his chair defiant and unapproachable stephen sighed as he settled down to his work the thought of one who might have accomplished what her father could not was in his head she was at monticello  some three weeks later mr brinsmades buggy drew up at mrs brices door the brinsmade family had been for some time in the country and frequently when that gentleman was detained in town by business he would stop at the little home for tea the secret of the good mans visit came out as he sat with them on the front steps afterward  i fear that it will be a hot summer maam he had said to mrs brice you should go to the country  the heat agrees with me remarkably mr brinsmade said the lady smiling  i have heard that colonel carvel wishes to rent his house at glencoe mr brinsmade continued the figure is not high he mentioned it and it was indeed nominal it struck me that a change of air would do you good mrs brice and stephen knowing that you shared in our uneasiness concerning judge whipple i thought  he stopped and looked at her it was a hard task even for that best and roost tactful of gentlemen mr brinsmade he too had misjudged this calm woman  i understand you mr brinsmade she said she saw as did stephen the kindness behind the offercolonel carvels kindness and his own the gentlemans benevolent face brightened  and my dear madam do not let the thought of this little house trouble you it was never my expectation to have it occupied in the summer if we could induce the judge to go to glencoe with you for the summer i am sure it would be a relief for us all  he did not press the matter but begged stephen to call on him in a day or two at the bank  what do you think stephen asked his mother when mr brinsmade was gone stephen did not reply at once what indeed could he say the vision of that proud figure of miss virginia was before him and he revolted what was kindness from colonel carvel and mr brinsmade was charity from her he could not bear the thought of living in a house haunted by her and yet why should he let his pride and his feelings stand in the way of the healthperhaps of the lifeof judge whipple  it was characteristic of his mothers strength of mind not to mention the subject again that evening stephen did not sleep in the hot night but when he rose in the morning he had made up his mind after breakfast he went straight to the colonels store and fortunately found mr carvel at his desk winding up his affairs  the next morning when the train for the east pulled out of illinoistown miss jinny carvel stood on the plat form tearfully waving goodby to a knot of friends she was leaving for europe presently she went into the sleepingcar to join the colonel who wore a gray liners duster for a long time she sat gazing at the young corn waving on the prairie fingering the bunch of june roses on her lap clarence had picked them only a few hours ago in the dew at bellegarde she saw her cousin standing disconsolate under the train sheds just as she had left him she pictured him riding out the bellefontaine road that afternoon alone now that the ocean was to be between them was it love that she felt for clarence at last she glanced at her father once or twice she had suspected him of wishing to separate them her aunt lillian indeed had said as much and virginia had silenced her but when she had asked the colonel to take clarence to europe he had refused and yet she knew that he had begged captain lige to go  virginia had been at home but a week she had seen the change in clarence and exulted the very first day she had surprised him on the porch at bellegarde with hardees tactics from a boy clarence had suddenly become a man with a purposeand that was the purpose of the south  they have dared to nominate that dirty lincoln he saiddo you think that we will submit to nigger equality rule never never he cried if they elect him i will stand and fight them until my legs are shot from under me and then i will shoot down the yankees from the ground  virginias heart had leaped within her at the words and into her eyes had flashed once more the look for which the boy had waited and hoped in vain he had the carriage of a soldier the animation and endurance of the thoroughbred when roused he was of the stuff that made the resistance of the south the marvel of the world and well we know whatever the sound of it that his speech was not heroics nor was it love for his cousin that inspired it save in this he had apotheosized virginia to him she was the inspired goddess of the southhis country his admiration and affection had of late been laid upon an altar her ambition for him he felt was likewise the souths ambition for him  his mother virginias aunt felt this too and strove against it with her feeble might she never had had power over her son nor over any man save the temporal power of beauty and to her mortification she found herself actually in fear of this girl who might have been her daughter so in virginias presence she became more trivial and petty than ever it was her one defence  it had of course been a foregone conclusion that clarence should join company a few young men of family did not and now he ran to his room to don for virginia that glorious but useless full dressthe high bearskin rat the red pigeontailed coat the light blue trousers and the gorgeous priceless shackle indeed the boy looked stunning he held his big rifle like a veteran and his face was set with a high resolve there was no mistaking the high color of her pride was on the cheek of the girl as he brought his piece to the salute of her his mistress and yet when he was gone and she sat alone amid the roses awaiting him came wilfully before her another face that was relentless determinationthe face of stephen brice as he had stood before her in the summer house at glencoe strive as she might against the thought deny it to herself and others to virginia carvel his way become the face of the north her patriotism and all that was in her of race rebelled to conquer that face she would have given her own soul and clarences angrily she had arisen and paced the garden walks and cried out aloud that it was not inflexible  and now by the car window looking out over the endless roll of the prairie the memory of this was bitter within her  suddenly she turned to her father  did you rent our house at glencoe she asked  no jinny  i suppose mr brice was too proud to accept it at your charitable rent even to save mr whipples life  the colonel turned to his daughter in mild surprise she was leaning back on the seat her eyes half closed  once you dislike a person jinny you never get over it i always had a fancy for the young man and now i have a better opinion of him than ever before it was i who insulted them by naming that rent  what did he do virginia demanded  he came to my office yesterday morning colonel carvel said he i hear you wish to rent your house i said yes you rented it once before sir said he yes said i may i ask you what price you got for it said he  and what did you say she asked leaning forward  i told him said the colonel smiling but i explained that i could not expect to command that price now on short notice he replied that they would pay it or not consider the place  virginia turned her head away and stared out over the fields  how could they afford it she murmured  mr brinsmade tells me that young brice won rather a remarkable case last winter and since then has had some practice and that he writes for the newspapers i believe he declined some sort of an editorial position preferring to remain at the law  and so they are going into the house she asked presently  no said the colonel whipple refused pointblank to go to the country he said that he would be shirking the only work of his life likely to be worth anything so the brices remain in town  colonel carvel sighed but virginia said nothing     chapter x richters scar  this was the summer when mr stephen brice began to make his appearance in public the very first was rather encouraging than otherwise although they were not all so it was at a little town on the outskirts of the city where those who had come to scoff and jeer remained to listen  in writing that speech stephen had striven to bear in mind a piece of advice which mr lincoln had given him speak so that the lowest may understand and the rest will have no trouble and it had worked at the halting lameness of the beginning an egg was thrownfortunately wide of the mark after this incident stephen fairly astonished his audienceespecially an elderly gentleman who sat on a crackerbox in the rear out of sight of the stand this may have been judge whipple although we have no proof of the fact  stephen himself would not have claimed originality for that speech he laughs now when it is spoken of and calls it a boyish effort which it was i have no doubt that many of the masters phrases slipped in as young mr brice could repeat most of the debates and the cooper union speech by heart he had caught more than the phrasing however so imbued was he with the spirit of abraham lincoln that his hearers caught it and that was the end of the rotten eggs and the cabbages the event is to be especially noted because they crowded around him afterward to ask questions for one thing he had not mentioned abolition wasnt it true then that this lincoln wished to tear the negro from his master give him a vote and a subsidy and set him up as the equal of the man that owned him slavery may stay where it is cried the young orator if it is content there so are we content what we say is that it shall not go one step farther no not one inch into a northern territory  on the next occasion mr brice was one of the orators at a much larger meeting in a garden in south st louis the audience was mostly german and this was even a happier event inasmuch as mr brice was able to trace with some skill the history of the fatherland from the napoleonic wars to its revolution incidentally he told them why they had emigrated to this great and free country and when in an inspired moment he coupled the names of abraham lincoln and father jahn the very leaves of the trees above them trembled at their cheers  and afterwards there was a longremembered supper in the moonlit grove with richter and a party of his college friends from jena there was herr tiefel with the little dresdenblue eyes red and round and jolly and hauptmann long and thin and sallow and korner redbearded and ponderous and konig a little cleancut man with a blond mustache that pointed upward they clattered their steins on the table and sang wonderful jena songs while stephen was lifted up and his soul carried off to faraway saxonyto the clean little university town with its towers and crooked streets and when they sang the trolksmelodie bemooster bursche zieh ich ausade a big tear rolled down the scar on richters cheek         fahrt wohl ihr strassen grad and krumm         ich zieh nicht mehr in euch herum         durchton euch nicht mehr mit gesang         mit larm nicht mehr and sporenklang  as the deep tones died away the soft night was steeped in the sadness of that farewell song it was richter who brought the full force of it home to stephen  do you recall the day you left your harvard and your boston my friend he asked  stephen only nodded he had never spoken of the bitterness of that even to his mother and here was the difference between the saxon and the anglosaxon  richter smoked his pipe mid dreamy silence the tear still wet upon his face  tiefel and i were at the university together he said at length he remembers the day i left jena for good and all ah stephen that is the most pathetic thing in life next to leaving the fatherland we dine with our student club for the last time at the burg keller a dingy little tavern under a grim old house but very dear to us we swear for the last time to be clean and honorable and patriotic and to die for the fatherland if god so wills and then we march at the head of a slow procession out of the old west gate two and two old members first then the fox major and the foxes  the foxes stephen interrupted  the youngstersthe freshmen you call them answered richter smiling  and after the foxes said herr tiefel taking up the story after the foxes comes the empty carriage with its gay postilion and four it is like a long funeral and every man is chanting that song and so we go slowly until we come to the oil mill tavern where we have had many a schlagerbout with the aristocrats and the president of our society makes his farewell speech under the vines and we drink to you with all the honors and we drank to you carl renowned swordsman and herr tiefel carried away by the recollection rose to his feet  the others caught fire and stood up with their mugs high in the air shouting  lebe wohl carl lebe wohl salamander salamander salamander ein ist ein zwei ist zwei drei ist drei lebe wohl  and so they toasted every man present even stephen himself whom they complimented on his speech and he soon learned to cry salamander and to rub his mug on the table german fashion he was not long in discovering that richter was not merely a prime favorite with his companions but likewise a person of some political importance in south st louis in the very midst of their merriment an elderly man whom stephen recognized as one of the german leaders he afterwards became a united states general came and stood smiling by the table and joined in the singing but presently he carried richter away with him  what a patriot he would have made had our country been spared to us exclaimed herr konig i think he was the best man with the schlager that jena ever saw even korner likes not to stand against him in mask and fencing hat all padded eh rudolph  herr korner gave a goodnatured growl of assent  i have still a welt that he gave me a month since he said he has left his mark on many an aristocrat  and why did you always fight the aristocrats stephen asked  they all tried to tell him at once but tiefel prevailed  because they were for making our country austrian my friend he cried because they were overbearing and ground the poor because the most of them were immoral like the french and we knew that it must be by morality and pure living that our vaterland was to be rescued and so we formed our guilds in opposition to theirs we swore to live by the standards of the great jahn of whom you spoke we swore to strive for the freedom of germany with manly courage and when we were not duelling with the nobles we had schlagerbouts among ourselves  broadswords exclaimed stephen in amazement  ja wohl answered korner puffing heavily the slit in his nose was plain even in the moonlight to keep our hands in as you would say you americans are a brave peoplewithout the schlager but we fought that we might not become effete  it was then that stephen ventured to ask a question that had been long burning within him  see here mr korner said he how did richter come by that scar he always gets red when i mention it he will never tell me  ah i can well believe that answered korner i will recount that matterif you do not tell carl lieber freund he would not forgive me i was there in berlin at the time it was a famous time tiefel will bear me out  ja ja said tiefel eagerly  mr brice herr korner continued has never heard of the count von kalbach no of course we at jena had and all germany many of us of the burschenschaft will bear to the grave the marks of his schlager von kalbach went to bonn that university of the aristocrats where he was worshipped when he came to berlin with his sister crowds would gather to look at them they were like wodan and freya donner exclaimed herr korner there is something in blood when all is said he was as straight and strong as an oak of the black forest and she as fair as a poplar it is so with the pomeranians  it was in the year 47 when carl richter was gone home to berlin before his last semester to see his father one fine morning von kalbach rode in at the brandenburg gate on a great black stallion he boasted openly that day that none of the despised burschenschaft dare stand before him and carl richter took up the challenge before night all berlin had heard of the temerity of the young liberal of the jena burschenschaft to our shame be it said we who knew and loved carl likewise feared for him  carl chose for his second ebhardt a man of our own germanian club at jena since killed in the breite strasse and if you will believe me my friend i tell you that richter came to the glade at daybreak smoking his pipe the place was filled the nobles on one side and the burschenschaft on the other and the sun coming up over the trees richter would not listen to any of us not even the surgeon he would not have the silk wound on his arm nor the padded breeches nor the neck coveringnothing so ebhardt put on his gauntlets and peaked cap and his apron with the device of the germanians  there stood the count in his white shirt in the pose of a statue and when it was seen that richter likewise had no protection but was calmly smoking the little short pipe with a charred bowl a hush fell upon all at the sight of the pipe von kalbach ground his heel in the turf and when the word was given he rushed at richter like a wild beast you my friend who have never heard the whistle of sharp schlager cannot know the song which a skilled arm draws from the blade it was music that morning you should have seen the nobles mighty strokesprim und second und terz und quart you would have marked how richter met him at every blow von kalbach never once took his eyes from the blue smoke from the bowl he was terrible in his fury and i shiver now to think how we of the burschenschaft trembled when we saw that our champion was driven back a step and then another you must know that it is a lasting disgrace to be forced over ones own line it seemed as if we could not bear the agony and then while we counted out the last seconds of the half came a snap like that of a whips lash and the bowl of richters pipe lay smouldering on the grass the noble had cut the stem as clean as it were sapling twig and there stood richter with the piece still clenched in his teeth his eyes ablaze and his cheek running blood he pushed the surgeon away when he came forward with his needles the count was smiling as he put up his sword his friends crowding around him when ebhardt cried out that his man could fight the second mensurthough the wound was three needles long then kalbach cried aloud that he would kill him but he had not seen carls eyes something was in them that made us think as we washed the cut but when we spoke to him he said nothing nor could we force the pipe stems from his teeth  donner schock exclaimed herr korner but reverently if i live to a hundred i never hope to see such a sight as that mensur the word was given the schlager flew so fast that we only saw the light and heard the ring alone before we of the burschenschaft knew what had happened the count von kalbach was over his line and had flung his schlager into a great tree and was striding from the place with his head hung and the tears streamin down his face  amid a silence herr korner lifted his great mug and emptied it slowly a wind was rising bearing with it song and laughter from distant groupsteutonic song and laughter the moonlight trembled through the shifting leaves and stephen was filled with a sense of the marvelous it was as if this fierce duel so full of national significance to a german had been fought in another existence it was incredible to him that the unassuming lawyer he knew so wholly americanized had been the hero of it strange indeed that the striving life of these leaders of european revolution had been suddenly cut off in its vigor there came to stephen a flash of that worldcomprehension which marks great statesmen was it not with a divine purpose that this measureless force of patriotism and high ideal had been given to this youngest of the nations that its high mission might be fulfilled  miss russell heard of stephens speeches she and her brothers and jack brinsmade used to banter him when he came avisiting in bellefontaine road the time was not yet come when neighbor stared coldly upon neighbor when friends of long standing passed each other with averted looks it was not even a wild dream that whitetrash lincoln would be elected and so mr jack who made speeches for breckenridge in the face of mr brinsmades union leanings laughed at stephen when he came to spend the night he joined forces with puss in making clever fun of the booby dutch which stephen was wise enough to take goodnaturedly but once or twice when he met clarence colfax at these houses he was aware of a decided change in the attitude of that young gentleman this troubled him more than he cared to admit for he liked clarence who reminded him of virginiaat once a pleasure and a pain  it is no harm to admit for the benefit of the society for psychical research that stephen still dreamed of her he would go about his work absently all the morning with the dream still in his head and the girl so vividly near him that he could not believe her to be travelling in england as miss russell said puss and anne were careful to keep him informed as to her whereabouts stephen set this down as a most natural supposition on their part that all young men must have an interest in virginia carvel  how needless to add that virginia in her correspondence never mentioned stephen although puss in her letters took pains to record the fact every time that he addressed a black republican meeting miss carvel paid no attention to this part of the communications her concern for judge whipple virginia did not hide anne wrote of him how he stood the rigors of that campaign were a mystery to friend and foe alike     chapter xi how a prince came  who has not heard of the st louis agricultural fair and what memories of its october days the mere mention of at brings back to us who knew that hallowed place as children there was the vast wooden amphitheatre where mad trotting races were run where stolid cattle walked past the chinese pagoda in the middle circle and shook the blue ribbons on their horns but it was underneath the tiers of seats the whole way around the ring that the chief attractions lay hid these were the church booths where fried oysters and sandwiches and cake and whit candy and icecream were sold by your mothers and sister for charity these ladies wore white aprons as they waited on the burly farmers and toward the close of the day for which they had volunteered they became distracted christ church had a booth and st georges and dr thayers unitarian where mrs brice might be found and mr davitts conducted by mr eliphalet hopper on strictly business principles and the roman catholic cathedral where miss renault and other young ladies of french descent presided and dr posthelwaites presbyterian which we shall come to presently and others the whole way around the ring  there is one fair which old st louisans still delight to recallthat of the autumn of 1860think for a minute you will remember that virginia carvel came back from europe and made quite a stir in a town where all who were worth knowing were intimates stephen caught a glimpse of her an the street received a distant bow and dreamed of her that night mr eliphalet hopper in his sunday suit was at the ferry to pay his respects to the colonel to offer his services and to tell him how the business fared his was the first st louis face that virginia saw captain lige being in new orleans and if she conversed with eliphalet on the ferry with more warmth than ever before there is nothing strange in that mr hopper rode home with them in the carriage and walked to miss cranes with his heart thumping against his breast and wild thoughts whirling in his head  the next morning in virginias sunny front room tears and laughter mingled there was a present for eugenie and anne and emily and puss and maude and a hear kiss from the colonel for each and more tears and laughter and sighs as mammy easter and rosetta unpacked the english trunks and with trembling hands and rolling eyes laid each parisian gown upon the bed  but the fair the fair  at the thought of that glorious year my pen fails me why mention the dread possibility of the negroworshiper lincoln being elected the very next month why listen to the rumblings in the south pompeii had chariotraces to the mutterings of vesuvius st louis was in gala garb to greet a prince  that was the year that miss virginia carvel was given charge of the booth in dr posthelwaites churchthe booth next one of the great arches through which prancing horses and lowing cattle came  now who do you think stopped at the booth for a chat with miss jinny who made her blush as pink as her paris gown who slipped into her hand the contribution for the church and refused to take the cream candy she laughingly offered him as an equivalent  none other than albert edward prince of wales duke of saxony duke of cornwall and rothesay earl of chester and carrick baron renfrew and lord of the isles out of compliment to the republic which he visited he bore the simple title of lord renfrew  bitter tears of envy so it was said were shed in the other booths belle cluyme made a remark which is best suppressed eliphalet hopper in mr davitts booths stared until his eyes watered a great throng peered into the covered way kept clear for his royal highness and suite and for the prominent gentlemen who accompanied them and when the prince was seen to turn to his grace the duke of newcastle and the subscription was forthcoming a great cheer shook the building while virginia and the young ladies with her bowed and blushed and smiled colonel carvel who was a director laid his hand paternally on the blue coat of the young prince reversing all precedent he presented his royal highness to his daughter and to the other young ladies it was done with the easy grace of a southern gentleman whereupon lord renfrew bowed and smiled too and stroked his mustache which was a habit he had and so fell naturally into the ways of democracy  miss puss russell who has another name and whose hair is now white will tell you how virginia carried off the occasion with credit to her country  it is safe to say that the prince forgot silver heels and royal oak although they had been trotted past the pagoda only that morning for his delectation he had forgotten his honor the mayor who had held fast to the young mans arm as the four coalblack horses had pranced through the crowds all the way from barnums hotel to the fair grounds his royal highness forgot himself still further and had at length withdrawn his hands from the pockets of his ample pantaloons and thrust his thumbs into his yellow waistcoat and who shall blame him if miss virginias replies to his sallies enchained him  not the least impressive of those who stood by smiling was the figure of the tall colonel his hat off for once and pride written on his face oh that his dear wife might have lived to see this  what was said in that historic interview with a future sovereign of england far from his royal palaces on democratic sawdust with an american beauty across a board counter was immediately recorded by the colonel together with an exact description of his royal highnesss blue coat and light flowing pantaloons and yellow waistcoat and colored kids even the princes habit of stroking his mustache did not escape the watchful eye it is said that his grace of newcastle smiled twice at miss virginias retorts and lord lyons the british minister has more than two to his credit but suddenly a strange thing happened miss virginia in the very midst of a sentence paused and then stopped her eyes had strayed from the royal countenance and were fixed upon a point in the row of heads outside the promenade her sentence was completedwith some confusion perhaps it is no wonder that my lord renfrew whose intuitions are quick remarked that he had already remained too long thus depriving the booth of the custom it otherwise should have had this was a graceful speech and a kingly followed by his retinue and the prominent citizens he moved on and it was remarked by keen observers that his honor the mayor had taken hold once more of the princes elbow who divided his talk with colonel carver  dear colonel carvel what a true american of the old type you were you nor the mayor nor the rest of the grave and elderly gentlemen were not blinded by the light of a royal presence you saw in him only an amiable and lovable young man who was to succeed the most virtuous and lovable of sovereigns victoria you colonel carvel were not one to cringe to royalty out of respect for the just and lenient sovereign his mother you did honor to the prince but you did not remind him as you might have that your ancestors fought for the king at marston moor and that your grandfather was once an intimate of charles james fox but what shall we say of mr cluyme and of a few others whose wealth alone enabled them to be directors of the fair miss isabel cluyme was duly presented in proper form to his royal highness her father owned a peerage and had been abroad likewise he made no such bull as the colonel and while the celebrated conversation of which we have spoken was in progress mr cluyme stood back and blushed for his countryman and smiled apologetically at the few gentlemen of the royal suite who glanced his way  his royal highness then proceeded to luncheon which is described by a most amiable canadian correspondent who sent to his newspaper an account of it that i cannot forbear to copy you may believe what he says or not just as you choose so interested was his royal highness in the proceedings that he stayed in the ring three and a half hours witnessing these trotting matches he was invited to take lunch in a little wooden shanty prepared for the directors to which he accordingly repaired but whether he got anything to eat or not i cannot tell after much trouble he forced his way to the table which he found surrounded by a lot of ravenous animals and upon some half dozen huge dishes were piled slices of beef mutton and buffalo tongue beside them were great jugs of lager beer rolls of bread and plates of a sort of cabbage cut into thin shreds raw and mixed with vinegar there were neither salt spoons nor mustard spoons the knives the gentlemen were eating with serving in their stead and by the aid of natures forks the slices of beef and mutton were transferred to the plates of those who desired to eat while your correspondent stood looking at the spectacle the duke of newcastle came in and he sat looking too he was evidently trying to look democratic but could not manage it by his side stood a man urging him to try the lager beer and cabbage also i suppose henceforth let the new york aldermen who gave to the turkish ambassador ham sandwiches and bad sherry rest in peace  even that great man whose memory we love and revere charles dickens was not overkind to us and saw our faults rather than our virtues we were a nation of grasshoppers and spat tobacco from early morning until late at night this some of us undoubtedly did to our shame be it said and when mr dickens went down the ohio early in the 40s he complained of the men and women he met who bent with care bolted through silent meals and retired within their cabins mr dickens saw our ancestors bowed in a task that had been too great for other bloodthe task of bringing into civilization in the compass of a century a wilderness three thousand miles it breadth and when his royal highness came to st louis and beheld one hundred thousand people at the fair we are sure that he knew how recently the ground he stood upon had been conquered from the forest  a strange thing had happened indeed for while the prince lingered in front of the booth of dr posthelwaites church and chatted with virginia a crowd had gathered without they stood peering over the barricade into the covered way proud of the selfpossession of their young countrywoman and here by a twist of fate mr stephen brice found himself perched on a barrel beside his friend richter it was richter who discovered her first  himmel it is miss carvel herself stephen he cried impatient at the impassive face of his companion look stephen look there  yes said stephen i see  ach exclaimed the disgusted german will nothing move you i have seen german princesses that are peasant women beside her how she carries it off see the prince is laughing  stephen saw and horror held him in a tremor his one thought was of escape what if she should raise her eyes and amid those vulgar stares discern his own and yet that was within him which told him that she would look up it was only a question of moments and thenand then she would in truth despise him wedged tightly between the people to move was to be betrayed he groaned  suddenly he rallied ashamed of his own false shame this was because of one whom he had known for the short space of a daywhom he was to remember for a lifetime the man he worshipped and she detested abraham lincoln would not have blushed between honest clerks and farmers why should stephen brice and what after all was this girl to him he could not tell almost the first day he had come to st louis the wires of their lives had crossed and since then had crossed many times again always with a spark by the might of generations she was one thing and he another they were separated by a vast and everwidening breach only to be closed by the blood and bodies of a million of their countrymen and yet he dreamed of her  gradually charmed like the simple people about him stephen became lost in the fascination of the scene suddenly confronted at a booth in a public fair with the heir to the english throne who but one of her own kind might have carried it off so well have been so complete a mistress of herself since save for a heightened color virginia gave no sign of excitement undismayed forgetful of the admiring crowd unconscious of their stares untiluntil the very strength of his gaze had compelled her own such had been the prophecy within him nor did he wonder because in that multitude of faces her eyes had flown so straightly homeward to his  with a rough effort that made an angry stir stephen flung the people aside and escaped the astonished richter following in his wake nor could the honest german dissuade him from going back to the office for the rest of the day or discover what had happened  but all through the afternoon that scene was painted on the pages of stephens books the crude booth in the darkened way the free pose of the girl standing in front of her companions a blue wisp of autumn sunlight falling at her feet the young prince laughing at her sallies and the elderly gentleman smiling with benevolence upon the pair     chapter xii into which a potentate comes  virginia danced with the prince by special appointment at the ball that evening so did her aunt mrs addison colfax so likewise was miss belle cluyme among those honored and approved but virginia wore the most beautiful of her paris gowns and seemed a princess to one watching from the gallery stephen was sure that his royal highness made that particular dance longer than the others it was decidedly longer than the one he had with miss cluyme although that young lady had declared she was in heaven  alas that princes cannot abide with us forever his royal highness bade farewell to st louis and presently that same city of alton which bore him northward came back again in like royal state and this time it was in honor of a democrat potentate he is an old friend now senator and judge and presidential candidatestephen arnold douglasfather of the doctrine of local sovereignty which he has come to preach so goes the world we are no sooner rid of one hero than we are ready for another  blow you bandsmen on the hurricane deck let the shores echo with your national airs let the gay bunting wave in the river breeze uniforms flash upon the guards for no campaign is complete without the military here are brave companies of the douglas guards the hickory sprouts and the little giants to do honor to the person of their hero cannon are booming as he steps into his open carriage that evening on the levee where the piles of river freight are covered with people transparencies are dodging in the darkness a fresh band strikes up hail columbia and the four horses prance away followed closely by the independent broom rangers the shouts for douglas remarked a keen observer who was present must have penetrated abrahams bosom at springfield  mr jacob cluyme who had been a bell and everett man until that day was not the only person of prominence converted after the speech he assured the judge that he was now undergoing the greatest pleasure of his life in meeting the popular orator the true representative man of the great west the matured statesman and the able advocate of national principles and although mr douglas looked as if he had heard something of the kind before he pressed mr cluymes hand warmly  so was the author of popular sovereignty the great bulwark of american independence escorted to the court house steps past houses of his stanch supporters which were illuminated in his honor stephen wedged among the people remarked that the judge had lost none of his selfconfidence since that day at freeport who seeing the democratic candidate smiling and bowing to the audience that blocked the wide square would guess that the question troubled him at all or that he missed the votes of the solid south how gravely the judge listened to the eulogy of the prominent citizen who reminded him that his work was not yet finished and that he still was harnessed to the cause of the people and how happy was the choice of that word harnessed  the judge had heard so he said with deep emotion the remarks of the chairman then followed one of those masterful speeches which wove a spell about those who listenedwhich like the most popular of novels moved to laughter and to tears to anger and to pity mr brice and mr richter were not the only black republicans who were depressed that night and they trudged homeward with the wild enthusiasm still ringing in their ears heavy with the thought that the long hot campaign of their own wideawakes might be in vain  they had a grim reproof from judge whipple in the morning  so you too gentlemen took opium last night was all he said  the dreaded possibility of mr lincolns election did not interfere with the gayeties the week after the fair mr clarence colfax gave a great dance at bellegarde in honor of his cousin virginia to which mr stephen brice was not invited a majority of company a was there virginia would have liked to have had them in uniform  it was at this time that anne brinsmade took the notion of having a ball in costume virginia on hearing the news rode over from bellegarde and flinging her reins to nicodemus ran up to annes little dressingroom  whom have you invited anne she demanded  anne ran over the long list of their acquaintance but there was one name she omitted  are you sure that that is all asked virginia searchingly when she had finished  anne looked mystified  i have invited stephen brice jinny she said but  but cried virginia i knew it am i to be confronted with that yankee everywhere i go it is always stephen brice and he is ushered in with a but  anne was quite overcome by this outburst she had dignity however and plenty of it and she was a loyal friend  you have no right to criticise my guests virginia  virginia seated on the arm of a chair tapped her foot on the floor  why couldnt things remain as they were she said we were so happy before these yankees came and they are not content in trying to deprive us of our rights they must spoil our pleasure too  stephen brice is a gentleman answered anne he spoils no ones pleasure and goes no place that he is not asked  he has not behaved according to my idea of a gentleman the few times that i have been unfortunate enough to encounter him virginia retorted  you are the only one who says so then here the feminine got the better of annes prudence and she added i saw you waltz with him once jinny carvel and i am sure you never enjoyed a dance as much in your life  virginia blushed purple  anne brinsmade she cried you may have your ball and your yankees all of them you want but i shant come how i wish i had never seen that horrid stephen brice then you would never have insulted me  virginia rose and snatched her ridingwhip this was too much for anne she threw her arms around her friend without more ado  dont quarrel with me jinny she said tearfully i couldnt bear it hemr brice is not coming i am sure  virginia disengaged herself  he is not coming  no said anne you asked me if he was invited and i was going on to tell you that he could not come  she stopped and stared at virginia in bewilderment that young lady instead of beaming had turned her back she stood flicking her whip at the window gazing out over the trees down the slope to the river miss russell might have interpreted these things simple anne  why isnt he coming said virginia at last  because he is to be one of the speakers at a big meeting that night have you seen him since you got home jinny he is thinner than he was we are much worried about him because he has worked so hard this summer  a black republican meeting exclaimed virginia scornfully ignoring the rest of what was said then ill come anne dear she cried tripping the length of the room ill come as titania who will you be  she cantered off down the drive and out of the gate leaving a very puzzled young woman watching her from the window but when virginia reached the forest at the bend of the road she pulled her horse down to a walk  she bethought herself of the gown which her uncle daniel had sent her from calvert house and of the pearls and she determined to go as her greatgrandmother dorothy carvel  shades of romance how many readers will smile before the rest of this true incident is told  what had happened was this miss anne brinsmade had driven to town in her mothers jenny lind a day or two before and had stopped as she often did to pay a call on mrs brice this lady as may be guessed was not given to discussion of her husbands ancestors nor of her own but on the walls of the little diningroom hung a copley and two stuarts one of the stuarts was a full length of an officer in the buff and blue of the continental army and it was this picture which caught annes eye that day  how like stephen she exclaimed and added only the face is much older who is it mrs brice  colonel wilton brice stephens grandfather there is a marked look about all the brices he was only twenty years of age when the revolution began that picture was painted much later in life after stuart came back to america when the colonel was nearly forty he had kept his uniform and his wife persuaded him to be painted in it  if stephen would only come as colonel wilton brice she cried do you think he would mrs brice  mrs brice laughed and shook her head  i am afraid not anne she said i have a part of the uniform upstairs but i could never induce him even to try it on  as she drove from shop to shop that day anne reflected that it certainly would not be like stephen to wear his grandfathers uniform to a ball but she meant to ask him at any rate and she had driven home immediately to write her invitations it was with keen disappointment that she read his note of regret  however on the very day of the ball anne chanced to be in town again and caught sight of stephen pushing his way among the people on fourth street she waved her hand to him and called to nicodemus to pull up at the sidewalk  we are all so sorry that you are not coming said she impulsively and there she stopped short for anne was a sincere person and remembered virginia that is i am so sorry she added a little hastily stephen i saw the portrait of your grandfather and i wanted you to come in his costume  stephen smiling down on her said nothing and poor anne in her fear that he had perceived the shade in her meaning made another unfortunate remark  if you were not aa republican she said  a black republican he answered and laughed at her discomfiture what then  anne was very red  i only meant that if you were not a republican there would be no meeting to address that night  it does not make any difference to you what my politics are does it he asked a little earnestly  oh stephen she exclaimed in gentle reproof  some people have discarded me he said striving to smile  she wondered whether he meant virginia and whether he cared still further embarrassed she said something which she regretted immediately  couldnt you contrive to come  he considered  i will come after the meeting if it is not too late he said at length but you must not tell any one  he lifted his hat and hurried on leaving anne in a quandary she wanted him but what was she to say to virginia virginia was coming on the condition that he was not to be there and anne was scrupulous  stephen too was almost instantly sorry that he had promised the little costumers shop the only one in the city at that time had been ransacked for the occasion and nothing was left to fit him but when he reached home there was a strong smell of camphor in his mothers room colonel brices cocked hat and sword and spurs lay on the bed and presently hester brought in the blue coat and buff waistcoat from the kitchen where she had been pressing them stephen must needs yield to his mothers persuasions and try them onthey were more than a passable fit but there were the breeches and cavalry boots to be thought of and the ruffled shirt and the powdered wig so before tea he hurried down to the costumers again not quite sure that he was not making a fool of himself and yet at last sufficiently entered into the spirit of the thing the coat was mended and freshened and when after tea he dressed in the character his appearance was so striking that his mother could not refrain from some little admiration as for hester she was in transports stephen was human and young but still the frivolity of it all troubled him he had inherited from colonel wilton brice the puritan other things beside clothes and he felt in his heart as he walked soberly to the hall that this was no time for fancy dress balls all intention of going was banished by the time his turn had come to speak  but mark how certain matters are beyond us not caring to sit out the meeting on the platform he made his way down the side of the crowded hall and ran into of all people big tom catherwood as the southern rights politics of the catherwood family were a matter of note in the city stephen did not attempt to conceal his astonishment tom himself was visibly embarrassed he congratulated stephen on his speech and volunteered the news that he had come in a spirit of fairness to hear what the intelligent leaders of the republican party such as judge whipple had to say after that he fidgeted but the sight of him started in stephen a train of thought that closed his ears for once to the judges words he had had before a huge liking for tom now he admired him for it was no light courage that took one of his position there and stephen remembered that tom was not risking merely the displeasure of his family and his friends but likewise something of greater value than either from childhood tom had been the devoted slave of virginia carvel with as little chance of marrying her as a man ever had and now he was endangering even that little alliance  and so stephen began to think of virginia and to wonder what she would wear at annes party and to speculate how she would have treated him if had gone to speak truth this last matter had no little weight in his decision to stay away but we had best leave motives to those whose business and equipment it is to weigh to a grain since that agonizing moment when her eyes had met his own among the curiously vulgar at the fair stephens fear of meeting virginia had grown to the proportions of a terror and yet there she was in his mind to take possession of it on the slightest occasion  when judge whipple had finished tom rose he awoke mr brice from a trance  stephen said he of course youre going to the brinsmades  stephen shook his head  why not said tom in surprise havent you a costume  yes he answered dubiously  why then youve got to come with me says tom heartily it isnt too late and theyll want you ive a buggy and im going to the russells to change my clothes come along  steven went     chapter xiii at mr brinsmades gate  the eastern side of the brinsmade house is almost wholly taken up by the big drawingroom where anne gave her fancydress ball from the windows might be seen through the trees in the grounds the father of waters below but the room is gloomy now that once was gay and a heavy coat of soot is spread on the porch at the back where the apple blossoms still fall thinly in the spring the huge black town has coiled about the place the garden still struggles on but the giants of the forest are dying and dead bellefontaine road itself once the drive of fashion is no more trucks and cars crowd the streets which follow its once rural windings and gone forever are those comely wooded hills and green pasturessave in the memory of those who have been spared to dream  still the old house stands begrimed but stately rebuking the sordid life around it still come into it the brinsmades to marriage and to death five and sixty years are gone since mr calvin brinsmade took his bride there they sat on the porch in the morning light harking to the whistle of the quail in the corn and watching the frightened deer scamper across the open do you see the bride in her highwaisted gown and mr calvin in his stock and his blue tailcoat and brass buttons  old people will tell you of the royal hospitality then of the famous men and women who promenaded under those chandeliers and sat down to the gameladen table in 1835 general atkinson and his officers thought nothing of the twenty miles from jefferson barracks below nor of dancing all night with the louisville belles who were mrs brinsmades guests thither came miss todd of kentucky long before she thought of taking for a husband that rude man of the people abraham lincoln foreigners of distinction fell in love with the place with its openhearted master and mistress and wrote of it in their journals would that many of our countrymen who think of the west as rough might have known the quality of the brinsmades and their neighbors  an era of charity of golden simplicity was passing on that october night of anne brinsmades ball those who made merry there were soon to be driven and scattered before the winds of war to die at wilsons creek or shiloh or to be spared for heroes of the wilderness some were to eke out a life of widowhood in poverty all were to live soberly chastened by what they had seen a fear knocked at colonel carvels heart as he stood watching the bright figures  brinsmade he said do you remember this room in may 46  mr brinsmade startled turned upon him quickly  why colonel you have read my very thoughts he said some of those who were here then areare still in mexico  and some who came home brinsmade blamed god because they had not fallen said the colonel  hush comyn his will be done he answered he has left a daughter to comfort you  unconsciously their eyes sought virginia in her gown of faded primrose and blue with its quaint stays and short sleeves she seemed to have caught the very air of the decorous century to which it belonged she was standing against one of the pilasters at the side of the room laughing demurely at the antics of becky sharp and sir john falstaffmiss puss russell and mr jack brinsmade respectively  mr tennysons idylls having appeared but the year before anne was dressed as elaine a part which suited her very well it was strange indeed to see her waltzing with daniel boone mr clarence colfax in his indian buckskins eugenie went as marie antoinette tall maude catherwood was most imposing as rebecca and her brother george made a towering friar tuck even little fifteenyearold spencer catherwood the contradiction of the family was there he went as the lieutenant napoleon walking about with his hands behind his back and his brows thoughtfully contracted  the indian summer night was mild it was at tine very height of the festivities that dorothy carvel and mr daniel boone were making their way together to the porch when the giant gatekeeper of kenilworth castle came stalking up the steps out of the darkness brandishing his club in their faces dorothy screamed and even the doughty daniel gave back a step  tom catherwood how dare you you frightened me nearly to death  im sorry jinny indeed i am said the giant repentant and holding her hand in his  where have you been demanded virginia a little mollified what makes you so late  ive been to a lincoln meeting said honest tom where i heard a very fine speech from a friend of yours  virginia tossed her head  you might have been better employed said she and added with dignity i have no friends who speak at black republican meetings  how about judge whipple said tom  she stopped did you mean the judge she asked over her shoulder  no said tom i meant  he got no further virginia slipped her arm through clarences and they went off together to the end of the veranda poor tom he passed on into the gay drawingroom but the zest had been taken out of his antics for that night  whom did he mean jinny said clarence when they were on the seat under the vines  he meant that yankee stephen brice answered virginia languidly i am so tired of hearing about him  so am i said clarence with a fervor by no means false by george i think he will make a black republican out of tom if he keeps on puss and jack have been talking about him all summer until i am out of patience i reckon he has brains but suppose he has addressed fifty lincoln meetings as they say is that any reason for making much of him i should not have him at bellegarde i am surprised that mr russell allows him in his house i can see why anne likes him  why  he is on the brinsmade charity list  he is not on their charity list nor on any other said virginia quickly stephen brice is the last person who would submit to charity  and you are the last person who i supposed would stand up for him cried her cousin surprised and nettled  there was an instants silence  i want to be fair max she said quietly pa offered them our glencoe house last summer at a low price and they insisted on paying what mr edwards gave five years agoor nothing you know that i detest a yankee as much as you do she continued indignation growing in her voice i did not come out here with you to be insulted  with her hand on the rail she made as if to rise clarence was perforce mollified  dont go jinny he said beseechingly i didnt mean to make you angry  i cant see why you should always be dragging in this mr brice she said almost tearfully it will not do to pause now and inquire into virginias logic i came out to hear what you had to tell me  jinny i have been made second lieutenant of company a  oh max i am so glad i am so proud of you  i suppose that you have heard the result of the october elections jinny  pa said something about them tonight she answered why  it looks now as if there were a chance of the republicans winning he answered but it was elation that caught his voice not gloom  you mean that this white trash lincoln may be president she exclaimed seizing his arm  never he cried the south will not submit to that until every man who can bear arms is shot down he paused the strains of a waltz mingled with talk and laughter floated out of the open window his voice dropped to a low intensity we are getting ready in company a he said the traitors will be dropped we are getting ready to fight for missouri and for the south  the girl felt his excitement his exaltation  and if you were not max i should disown you she whispered  he leaned forward until his face was close to hers  and now he said  i am ready to work to starve to go to prison to help  he sank back heavily into the corner  is that all jinny  all she repeated oh if a woman could only do more  and is there nothingfor me  virginia straightened  are you doing this for a reward she demanded  no he answered passionately you know that i am not do you remember when you told me that i was good for nothing that i lacked purpose  yes max  i have thought it over since he went on rapidly you were right i cannot workit is not in me but i have always felt that i could make a name for myselffor youin the army i am sure that i could command a regiment and now the time is coming  she did not answer him but absently twisted the fringe of his buckskins in her fingers  ever since i have known what love is i have loved you jinny it was so when we climbed the cherry trees at bellegarde and you loved me theni know you did you loved me when i went east to school at the military institute but it has not been the same of late he faltered something has happened i felt it first on that day you rode out to bellegarde when you said that my life was of no use jinny i dont ask much i am content to prove myself war is coming and we shall have to free ourselves from yankee insolence it is what we have both wished for when i am a general will you marry me  for a wavering instant she might have thrown herself into his outstretched arms why not and have done with sickening doubts perhaps her hesitation hung on the very boyishness of his proposal perhaps the revelation that she did not then fathom was that he had not developed since those childish days but even while she held back came the beat of hoofs on the gravel below them and one of the bellegarde servants rode into the light pouring through the open door he called for his master  clarence muttered his dismay as he followed his cousin to the steps  what is it asked virginia alarmed  nothing i forgot to sign the deed to the elleardsville property and worington wants it tonight cutting short sambos explanations clarence vaulted on the horse virginia was at his stirrup leaning over in the saddle he whispered ill be back in a quarter of an hour will you wait  yes she said so that he barely heard  here  she nodded  he was away at a gallop leaving virginia standing bareheaded to the night alone a spring of pity of affection for clarence suddenly welled up within her there came again something of her old admiration for a boy impetuous and lovable who had tormented and defended her with the same hand  patriotism stronger in virginia than many of us now can conceive was on clarences side ambition was strong in her likewise now was she all afire with the thought that she a woman might by a single word give the south a leader that word would steady him for there was no question of her influence she trembled at the reckless lengths he might go in his dejection and a memory returned to her of a day at glencoe before he had gone off to school when she had refused to drive with him colonel carvel had been away from home she had pretended not to care in spite of neds beseechings clarence had ridden off on a wild thoroughbred colt and had left her to an afternoon of agony vividly she recalled his homecoming in the twilight his coat torn and muddy a bleeding cut on his forehead and the colt quivering tame  in those days she had thought of herself unreservedly as meant for him dash and courage and generosity had been the beacon lights on her horizon but now were there not other qualities yes and clarence should have these too she would put them into him she also had been at fault and perhaps it was because of her wavering loyalty to him that he had not gained them  her name spoken within the hall startled virginia from her reverie and she began to walk rapidly down the winding drive a fragment of the air to which they were dancing brought her to a stop it was the jenny lind waltz and with it came clear and persistent the image she had sought to shut out and failed as if to escape it now she fairly ran all the way to the light at the entrance and hid in the magnolias clustered beside the gateway it was her cousins name she whispered over and over to herself as she waited vibrant with a strange excitement it was as though the very elements might thwart her wail clarence would be delayed or they would miss her at the house and search it seemed an eternity before she heard the muffled thud of a horse cantering in the clay road  virginia stood out in the light fairly between the gate posts too late she saw the horse rear as the rider flew back in his seat for she had seized the bridle the beams from the lamp fell upon a revolutionary horseman with cooked hat and sword and high ridingboots for her his profile was in silhouette and the bold nose and chin belonged to but one man she knew he was stephen brice she gave a cry of astonishment and dropped the rein in dismay hot shame was surging in her face her impulse was to fly nor could she tell what force that stayed her feet  as for stephen he stood high in his stirrups and stared down at the girl she was standing full in the lighther lashes fallen her face crimson but no sound of surprise escaped him because it was she nor did he wonder at her gown of a goneby century her words came first and they were low she did not address him by name  ii thought that you were my cousin she said what must you think of me  stephen was calm  i expected it he answered  she gave a step backward and raised her frightened eyes to his  you expected it she faltered  i cant say why he said quickly but it seems to me as if this had happened before i know that i am talking nonsense  virginia was trembling now and her answer was not of her own choosing  it has happened before she cried but where and when  it may have been in a dream he answered her that i saw you as you stand there by my bridle i even know the gown you wear  she put her hand to her forehead had it been a dream and what mystery was it that sent him here this night of all nights she could not even have said that it was her own voice making reply  and ii have seen you with the sword and the powdered hair and the blue coat and the buff waistcoat it is a buff waistcoat like that my greatgrandfather wears in his pictures  it is a buff waistcoat he said all sense of strangeness gone  the roses she held dropped on the gravel and she put out her hand against his horses flank in an instant he had leaped from his saddle and his arm was holding her she did not resist marvelling rather at his own steadiness nor did she then resent a tenderness in his voice  i hope you will forgive mevirginia he said i should not have mentioned this and yet i could not help it  she looked up at him rather wildly  it was i who stopped you she said i was waiting for  for whom  the interruption brought remembrance  for my cousin mr colfax she answered in another tone and as she spoke she drew away from him up the driveway but she had scarcely taken five steps whey she turned again her face burning defiance they told me you were not coming she said almost fiercely why did you come  it was a mad joy that stephen felt  you did not wish me to come he demanded  oh why do you ask that she cried you know i would not have been here had i thought you were coming anne promised me that you would not come  what would she not have given for those words back again  stephen took astride toward her and to the girl that stride betokened a thousand things that went to the mans character within its compass the comparison in her mind was all complete he was master of himself when he spoke  you dislike me miss carvel he said steadily i do not blame you nor do i flatter myself that it is only because you believe one thing and i another but i assure you that it is my misfortune rather than my fault that i have not pleased youthat i have met you only to anger you  he paused for she did not seem to hear him she was gazing at the distant lights moving on the river had he come one step fartherbut he did not presently she knew that he was speaking again in the same measured tone  had miss brinsmade told me that my presence here would cause you annoyance i should have stayed away i hope that you will think nothing of thethe mistake at the gate you may be sure that i shall not mention it good night miss carvel  he lifted his hat mounted his horse and was gone she had not even known that he could ridethat was strangely the first thought the second discovered herself intent upon the rhythm of his canter as it died southward upon the road there was shame in this mingled with a thankfulness that he would not meet clarence she hurried a few steps toward the house and stopped again what should she say to clarence now what could she say to him  but clarence was not in her head ringing there was her talk with stephen brice as though it were still rapidly going on his questions and her repliesover and over again each trivial incident of an encounter real and yet unreal his transformation in the uniform which had seemed so natural though she strove to make it so nothing of all this was unbearable now nor the remembrance of the firm torch of his arm about her nor yet again his calling her by her name  absently she took her way again up the drive now pausing now going on forgetful first it was alarm she felt when her cousin leaped down at her sidethen dread  i thought i should never get back he cried breathlessly as he threw his reins to sambo i ought not to have asked you to wait outside did it seem long jinny  she answered something there was a seat near by under the trees to lead her to it he seized her hand but it was limp and cold and a sudden fear came into his voice  jinny  yes  she resisted and he dropped her fingers she remembered long how he stood in the scattered light from the bright windows a tall black figure of dismay she felt the yearning in his eyes but her own response warm half an hour since was lifeless  jinny he said what is the matter  nothing max only i was very foolish to say i would wait for you  thenthen you wont marry me  oh max she cried it is no time to talk of that now i feel tonight as if something dreadful were to happen  do you mean war he asked  yes she said yes  but war is what we want he cried what we have prayed for what we have both been longing for tonight jinny war alone will give us our rights  he stopped short virginia had bowed her head an her hands and he saw her shoulders shaken by a sob clarence bent over her in bewilderment and anxiety  you are not well jinny he said  i am not well she answered take me into the house  but when they went in at the door he saw that her eyes were dry  those were the days when a dozen young ladies were in the habit of staying all night after a dance in the country of long whispered talks nay not always whispered until early morning and of late breakfasts miss russell had not been the only one who remarked virginias long absence with her cousin but puss found her friend in one of those moods which even she dared not disturb accordingly miss russell stayed all night with anne  and the two spent most of the dark hours remaining in unprofitable discussion as to whether virginia were at last engaged to her cousin and in vain queried over another unsolved mystery this mystery was taken up at the breakfast table the next morning when miss carvel surprised mrs brinsmade and the male household by appearing at halfpast seven  why jinny cried mr brinsmade what does this mean i always thought that young ladies did not get up after a ball until noon  virginia smiled a little nervously  i am going to ask you to take me to town when you go mr brinsmade  why certainly my dear he said but i under stood that your aunt was to send for you this afternoon from bellegarde  virginia shook her head there is something i wish to do in town  ill drive her in pa said jack youre too old will you go with me jinny  of course jack  but you must eat some breakfast jinny said mrs brinsmade glancing anxiously at the girl  mr brinsmade put down his newspaper  where was stephen brice last night jack he asked i understood anne to say that he had spoke of coming late  why sir said jack thats what we cant make out tom catherwood who is always doing queer things you know went to a black republican meeting last night and met stephen there they came out in toms buggy to the russells and tom got into his clothes first and rode over stephen was to have followed on puss russells horse but he never got here at least i can find no one who saw him did you jinny  but virginia did not raise her eyes from her plate a miraculous intervention came through mrs brinsmade  there might have been an accident jack said that lady with concern send nicodemus over to mrs russells at once to inquire you know that mr brice is a northerner and may not be able to ride  jack laughed  he rides like a dragoon mother said he i dont know where he picked it up  the reason i mentioned him said mr brinsmade lifting the blanket sheet and adjusting his spectacles was because his name caught my eye in this paper his speech last night at the library hall is one of the few sensible republican speeches i have read i think it very remarkable for a man as young as he mr brinsmade began to read while waiting for the speaker of the evening who was half an hour late mr tiefel rose in the audience and called loudly for mr brice many citizens in the hall were astonished at the cheering which followed the mention of this name mr brice is a young lawyer with a quiet manner and a determined face who has sacrificed much to the partys cause this summer he was introduced by judge whipple in whose office he is he had hardly begun to speak before he had the ear of everyone in the house mr brices personality is prepossessing his words are spoken sharply and he has a singular emphasis at times which seems to drive his arguments into the minds of his hearers we venture to say that if party orators here and elsewhere were as logical and temperate as mr brice if like him they appealed to reason rather than to passion those bitter and lamentable differences which threaten our countrys peace might be amicably adjusted let me read what he said  but he was interrupted by the rising of virginia a high color was on the girls face as she said  please excuse me mrs brinsmade i must go and get ready  but youve eaten nothing my dear  virginia did not reply she was already on the stairs  you ought not have read that pa mr jack remonstrated you know that she detests yankees     chapter xiv the breach becomes too wide abraham lincoln  at the foot of breeds hill in charlestown an american had been born into the world by the might of whose genius that fateful name was sped to the uttermost parts of the nation abraham lincoln was elected president of the united states and the moan of the storm gathering in the south grew suddenly loud and louder  stephen brice read the news in the black headlines and laid down the newspaper a sense of the miraculous upon him

story in the vernacular he reflected that it might well seem strange yea and intolerableto many that this comedian of the country store this crude lawyer and politician should inherit the seat dignified by washington and the adamses  and yet stephen believed for to him had been vouchsafed the glimpse beyond  that was a dark winter that followed the darkest in our history gloom and despondency came fast upon the heels of republican exultation men rose early for tidings from charleston the storm centre the union was cracking here and there would it crumble in pieces before abraham lincoln got to washington  one smoky morning early in december stephen arrived late at the office to find richter sitting idle on his stool concern graven on his face  the judge has had no breakfast stephen he whispered listen shadrach tells me he has been doing that since six this morning when he got his newspaper  stephen listened and he heard the judge pacing and pacing in his room presently the door was flung open and they saw mr whipple standing in the threshold stern and dishevelled astonishment did not pause here he came out and sat down in stephens chair striking the newspaper in his hand and they feared at first that his mind had wandered  propitiate he cried propitiate propitiate and again propitiate how long o lord suddenly he turned upon stephen who was frightened but now his voice was natural and he thrust the paper into the young mans lap have you read the presidents message to congress sir god help me that i am spared to call that wobbling buchanan president read it read it sir you have a legal brain perhaps you can tell me why if a man admits that it is wrong for a state to abandon this union he cannot call upon congress for men and money to bring her back no this weakling lets floyd stock the southern arsenals he pays tribute to barbary he is for bribing them not to be angry take cuba from spain says he and steal the rest of mexico that the maw of slavery may be filled and the demon propitiated  they dared not answer him and so he went back into his room shutting the door that day no clients saw him even those poor ones dependent on his charity whom had never before denied richter and stephen took counsel together and sent shadrach out for his dinner  three weeks passed there arrived a sparkling sunday brought down the valley of the missouri from the frozen northwest the saturday had been soggy and warm  thursday had seen south carolina leave that union into which she was born amid prayers and the ringing of bells tuesday was to be christmas day a young lady who had listened to a solemn sermon of dr posthelwaites slipped out of church before the prayers were ended and hurried into that deserted portion of the town about the court house where on week days business held its sway  she stopped once at the bottom of the grimy flight of steps leading to judge whipples office at the top she paused again and for a short space stood alert her glance resting on the little table in the corner on top of which a few thumbed law books lay neatly piled once she made a hesitating step in this direction then as if by a resolution quickly taken she turned her back and softly opened the door of the judges room he was sitting upright in his chair a book was open in his lap but it did not seem to virginia that he was reading it  uncle silas she said arent you coming to dinner any more  he looked up swiftly from under his shaggy brows the book fell to the floor  uncle silas said virginia bravely i came to get you today  never before had she known him to turn away from man or woman but now judge whipple drew his handkerchief from his pocket and blew his nose violently a womans intuition told her that locked tight in his heart was what he longed to say and could not the shiny black overcoat he wore was on the bed virginia picked it up and held it out to him an appeal in her eyes  he got into it then she handed him his hat many people walking home from church that morning marvelled as they saw these two on locust street together the young girl supporting the elderly man over the slippery places at the crossings for neighbor had begun to look coldly upon neighbor  colonel carvel beheld them from his armchair by the sittingroom window and leaned forward with a start his lips moved as he closed his bible reverently and marked his place at the foot of the stairs he surprised jackson by waving him aside for the colonel himself flung open the door and held out his hand to his friend the judge released virginias arm and his own trembled as he gave it  silas said the colonel silas weve missed you  virginia stood by smiling but her breath came deeply had she done right could any good come of it all judge whipple did not go in at the doorhe stood uncompromisingly planted on the threshold his head flung back and actual fierceness in his stare  do you guess we can keep off the subject comyn he demanded  even mr carvel so used to the judges ways was a bit taken aback by this question it set him tugging at his goatee and his voice was not quite steady as he answered  god knows silas we are human and we can only try  then mr whipple marched in it lacked a quarter of an hour of dinnera crucial period to tax the resources of any woman virginia led the talk but oh the pathetic lameness of it her own mind was wandering when it should not and recollections she had tried to strangle had sprung up once more only that morning in church she had lived over again the scene by mr brinsmades gate and it was then that a wayward but resistless impulse to go to the judges office had seized her the thought of the old man lonely and bitter in his room decided her on her knees she prayed that she might save the bond between him and her father for the colonel had been morose on sundays and had taken to reading the bible a custom he had not had since she was a child  in the diningroom jackson bowing and smiling pulled out the judges chair and got his customary curt nod as a reward virginia carved  oh uncle silas she cried i am so glad that we have a wild turkey and you shall have your sidebone the girl carved deftly feverishly talking the while aided by that most kind and accomplished of hosts her father in the corner the dreaded skeleton of the subject grinned sardonically were they going to be able to keep it off there was to be no help from judge whipple who sat in grim silence a man who feels his soul burning is not given to small talk virginia alone had ever possessed the power to make him forget  uncle silas i am sure there are some things about our trip that we never told you how we saw napoleon and his beautiful empress driving in the bois and how eugenie smiled and bowed at the people i never saw such enthusiasm in my life and oh i learned such a lot of french history all about francis the first and pa took me to see his chateaus along the loire very few tourists go there you really ought to have gone with us  take care virginia  i had other work to do jinny said the judge  virginia rattled on  i told you that we stayed with a real lord in england didnt i said she he wasnt half as nice as the prince but he had a beautiful house in surrey all windows which was built in elizabeths time they called the architecture tudor didnt they pa  yes dear said the colonel smiling  the countess was nice to me continued the girl and took me to garden parties but lord jermyn was always talking politics  the colonel was stroking his goatee  tell silas about the house jinnyjackson help the judge again  no said virginia drawing a breath im going to tell him about that queer club where my greatgrandfather used to bet with charles fox we saw a great many places where richard carvel had been in england that was before the revolution uncle daniel read me some of his memoirs when we were at calvert house i know that you would be interested in them uncle silas he sailed under paul jones  and fought for his country and for his flag virginia said the judge who had scarcely spoken until then no i could not bear to read them now when those who should love that country are leaving it in passion  there was a heavy silence virginia did not dare to look at her father but the colonel said gently  not in passion silas but in sorrow  the judge tightened his lips but the effort was beyond him and the flood within him broke loose  colonel carvel he cried south carolina is madshe is departing in sin in order that a fiendish practice may be perpetuated if her people stopped to think they would know that slavery cannot exist except by means of this union but let this milksop of a president do his worst we have chosen a man who has the strength to say you shall not go  it was an awful moment the saving grace of it was that respect and love for her father filled virginias heart in his just anger colonel carvel remembered that he was the host and strove to think only of his affection for his old friend  to invade a sovereign state sir is a crime against the sacred spirit of this government he said  there is no such thing as a sovereign state sir exclaimed the judge hotly i am an american and not a missourian  when the time comes sir said the colonel with dignity missouri will join with her sister sovereign states against oppression  missouri will not secede sir  why not sir demanded the colonel  because sir when the worst comes the soothing syrup men will rally for the union and there are enough loyal people here to keep her straight  dutchmen sir hessians foreign republican hirelings sir exclaimed the colonel standing up we shall drive them like sheep if they oppose us you are drilling them now that they may murder your own blood when you think the time is ripe  the colonel did not hear virginia leave the room so softly had she gone he made a grand figure of a man as he stood up straight and tall those gray eyes akindle at last but the fire died as quickly as it had flared pity had come and quenched itpity that an unselfish life of suffering and loneliness should be crowned with these the colonel longed then to clasp his friend in his arms quarrels they had had by the hundred never yet a misunderstanding god had given to silas whipple a nature stern and harsh that repelled all save the charitable few whose gift it was to see below the surface and colonel carvel had been the chief of them but now the judges vision was clouded  steadying himself by his chair he had risen glaring the loose skin twitching on his sallow face he began firmly but his voice shook ere he had finished  colonel carvel said he i expect that the day has come when you go your way and i go mine it will be better ifwe do not meet again sir  and so he turned from the man whose friendship had stayed him for the score of years he had battled with his enemies from that house which had been for so long his only home for the last time jackson came forward to help him with his coat the judge did not see him nor did he see the tearful face of a young girl leaning over the banisters above ice was on the stones and mr whipple blinded by a moisture strange to his eyes clung to the iron railing as he felt his way down the steps before he reached the bottom a stronger arm had seize his own and was helping him  the judge brushed his eyes with his sleeve and turned a defiant face upon captain elijah brentthen his voice broke his anger was suddenly gone and his thought had flown back to the colonels thousand charities  lige he said lige it has come  in answer the captain pressed the judges hand nodding vigorously to hide his rising emotion there was a pause  and you lige said mr whipple presently  my god cried the captain i wish i knew  lige said the judge gravely youre too good a man to be for soothing syrup  the captain choked  youre too smart to be fooled lige he said with a note near to pleading the time has come when you bell people and the douglas people have got to decide never in my life did i know it to do good to dodge a question weve got to be white or black lige nobodys got much use for the grays and dont let yourself be fooled with constitutional union meetings and compromises the time is almost here lige when it will take a rascal to steer a middle course  captain lige listened and he shifted from one foot to the other and rubbed his hands which were red some odd trick of the mind had put into his head two peopleeliphalet hopper and jacob cluyme was he like them  lige youve got to decide do you love your country sir can you look on while our own states defy us and not lift a hand can you sit still while the governor and all the secessionists in this state are plotting to take missouri too out of the union the militia is riddled with rebels and the rest are forming companies of minute men  and you black republicans the captain cried have organized your dutch wideawakes and are arming them to resist americans born  they are americans by our constitution sir which the south pretends to revere cried the judge and they are showing themselves better americans than many who have been on the soil for generations  my sympathies are with the south said the captain doggedly and my love is for the south  and your conscience said the judge  there was no answer both men raised their eyes to the house of him whose loving hospitality had been a light in the lives of both when at last the captain spoke his voice was rent with feeling  judge he began when i was a poor young man on the old vicksburg second officer under old stetson colonel carvel used to take me up to his house on fourth street to dinner and he gave me the clothes on my back so that i might not be ashamed before the fashion which came there he treated me like a son sir one day the sheriff sold the vicksburg you remember it that left me high and dry in the mud who bought her sir colonel carvel and he says to me lige youre captain now the youngest captain on the river and shes your boat you can pay me principal and interest when you get ready  judge whipple i never had any other home than right in this house i never had any other pleasure than bringing jinny presents and tryin to show em gratitude he took me into his house and cared for me at a time when i wanted to go to the devil along with the stevedores when i was a wanderer he kept me out of the streets and out of temptation judge id a heap rather go down and jump off the stern of my boat than step in here and tell him id fight for the north  the judge steadied himself on his hickory stick and walked off without a word for a while captain lige stood staring after him then he slowly climbed the steps and disappeared     chapter xv mutterings  early in the next year 1861that red year in the calendar of our historyseveral gentlemen met secretly in the dingy countingroom of a prominent citizen to consider how the state of missouri might be saved to the union one of these gentlemen was judge whipple another mr brinsmade and another a masterly and fearless lawyer who afterward became a general and who shall be mentioned in these pages as the leader by his dash and boldness and statesmanlike grasp of a black situation st louis was snatched from the very bosom of secession  alas that chronicles may not stretch so as to embrace all great men of a time there is captain nathaniel lyonname with the fateful ring nathaniel lyon with the wild red hair and blue eye born and bred a soldier ordered to st louis and become subordinate to a wavering officer of ordnance lyon was one who brooked no trifling he had the face of a man who knows his mind and intention the quick speech and action which go with this red tape made by the reel to bind him he broke courtsmartial had no terrors for him he proved the ablest of lieutenants to the strong civilian who was the leader both were the men of the occasion if god had willed that the south should win there would have been no occasion  even as judge whipple had said the time was come for all men to decide out of the way all hopes of compromises that benumbed washington no constitutional unionists no douglas democrats no republicans now  all must work to save the ship the speechmaking was not done with yet partisanship must be overcome and patriotism instilled in its place one day stephen brice saw the leader go into judge whipples room and presently he was sent for after that he was heard of in various outoftheway neighborhoods exhorting all men to forget their quarrels and uphold the flag  the leader himself knew not night from day in his toilin organizing conciliating compelling when necessary letters passed between him and springfield and after that solemn inauguration between him and washington it was an open secret that the governor of missouri held out his arms to jefferson davis just elected president of the new southern confederacy it soon became plain to the feeblest brain what the leader and his friends had perceived long before that the governor intended to use the militia purged of yankee sympathizers to save the state for the south  the government arsenal with its stores of arms and ammunition was the prize this building and its grounds lay to the south of the city overlooking the river it was in command of a doubting major of ordnance the corps of officers of jefferson barracks hard by was mottled with secession trade was still the mississippi below was practically closed in all the south pickens and sumter alone stood stanch to the flag a general wearing the uniform of the army of the united states surrendered the whole state of texas  the st louis arsenal was next in succession and the little band of regulars at the barracks was powerless to save it what could the leader and captain lyon do without troops that was the question that rang in stephens head and in the heads of many others for if president lincoln sent troops to st louis that would precipitate the trouble and the president had other uses for the handful in the army  there came a rainsodden night when a mysterious message arrived at the little house in olive street both anxiety and pride were in mrs brices eyes as they followed her son out of the door at twelfth street two men were lounging on the corners each of whom glanced at him listessly as he passed he went up a dark and narrow stair into a lighted hall with shrouded windows men with sober faces were forming line on the sawdust of the floors the leader was there giving military orders in a low voice that marked the beginning of the aggressive union movement  stephen standing apart at the entrance remarked that many of the men were germans indeed he spied his friend tiefel there and presently richter came from the ranks to greet him  my friend he said you are made second lieutenant of our company the black jaegers  but i have never drilled in my life said stephen  never mind come and see the leader  the leader smiling a little put a vigorous stop to his protestations and told him to buy a tactics the next man stephen saw was big tom catherwood who blushed to the line of his hair as he returned stephens grip  tom what does this mean he asked  well said tom embarrassed a fellow has got to do what he thinks right  and your family asked stephen  a spasm crossed toms face  i reckon theyll disown me stephen when they find it out  richter walked home as far as stephens house he was to take the fifth street car for south st louis and they talked of toms courage and of the broad and secret military organization the leader had planned that night but stephen did not sleep till the dawn was he doing right could he afford to risk his life in the war that was coming and leave his mother dependent upon charity  it was shortly after this that stephen paid his last visit for many a long day upon miss puss russell it was a sunday afternoon and puss was entertaining as usual a whole parlorfull of young men whose leanings and sympathies stephen divined while taking off his coat in the hall then he heard miss russell cry  i believe that they are drilling those nasty dutch hirelings in secret  i am sure they are said george catherwood one of the halls is on twelfth street and they have sentries posted out so that you cant get near them pa has an idea that tom goes there and he told him that if he ever got evidence of it hed show him the door  do you really think that tom is with the yankees asked jack brinsmade  toms a fool said george with emphasis but he isnt a coward hed just as soon tell pa tomorrow that he was drilling if the yankee leaders wished it known  virginia will never speak to him again said eugenie in an awed voice  pooh said puss tom never had a chance with jinny did he george clarence is in high favor now did you ever know any one to change so since this military business has begun he acts like a colonel i hear that they are thinking of making him captain of a company of dragoons  they are george answered and that is the company i intend to join  well began puss with her usual recklessness its a good thing for clarence that all this is happening i know somebody else  poor stephen in the hall knew not whether to stay or fly an accident decided the question emily russell came down the stairs at that instant and spoke to him as the two entered the parlor there was a hush pregnant with many things unsaid pusss face was scarlet but her hand was cold as she held it out to him for the first time in that house he felt like an intruder jack brinsmade bowed with great ceremony and took his departure there was scarcely a distant cordiality in the greeting of the other young men and puss whose tongue was loosed again talked rapidly of entertainments to which stephen either had not been invited or from which he had stayed away the rest of the company were almost moodily silent  profoundly depressed stephen sat straight in the velvet chair awaiting a seasonable time to bring his visit to a close  this was to be the last then of his intercourse with a warmhearted and lovable people this was to be the end of his friendship with this impetuous and generous girl who had done so much to brighten his life since he had come to st louis henceforth this house would be shut to him and all others save mr brinsmades  presently in one of the intervals of miss russells feverish talk he rose to go dusk was gathering and a deep and ominous silence penetrated like the shadows into the tall room no words came to him impulsively almost tearfully puss put her hand in his then she pressed it unexpectedly so that he had to gulp down a lump that was in his throat just then a loud cry was heard from without the men jumped from their chairs and something heavy dropped on the carpet  some ran to the window others to the door directly across the street was the house of mr harmsworth a noted union man one of the third story windows was open and out of it was pouring a mass of gray wood smoke george catherwood was the first to speak  i hope it will burn down he cried  stephen picked up the object on the floor which had dropped from his pocket and handed it to him  it was a revolver     volume 5     chapter xvi the guns of sumter  winter had vanished spring was come with a hush toward a little island set in the blue waters of charleston harbor anxious eyes were strained  was the flag still there  god alone may count the wives and mothers who listened in the still hours of the night for the guns of sumter one sultry night in april stephens mother awoke with fear in her heart for she had heard them hark that is the roar now faint but sullen that is the red flash far across the black southern sky for in our beds are the terrors and cruelties of life revealed to us there is a demon to be faced and nought alone  mrs brice was a brave woman she walked that night with god  stephen too awoke the lightning revealed her as she bent over him on the wings of memory be flew back to his childhood in the great boston house with the rounded front and he saw the nursery with its high windows looking out across the common often in the dark had she come to him thus her gentle hand passing over aim to feel if he were covered  what is it mother he said  she said stephen i am afraid that the war has come  he sat up blindly even he did not guess the agony in her heart  you will have to go stephen  it was long before his answer came  you know that i cannot mother we have nothing left but the little i earn and if i were he did not finish the sentence for he felt her trembling but she said again with that courage which seems womans alone  remember wilton brice stepheni can get along i can sew  it was the hour he had dreaded stolen suddenly upon him out of the night how many times had he rehearsed this scene to himself he stephen brice who had preached and slaved and drilled for the union a renegade to be shunned by friend and foe alike he had talked for his country but he would not risk his life for it he heard them repeating the charge he saw them passing him silently on the street shamefully he remembered the time five months agone when he had worn the very uniform of his revolutionary ancestor and high above the tier of his accusers he saw one face and the look of it stung to the very quick of his soul  before the storm he had fallen asleep in sheer weariness of the struggle that face shining through the black veil of the darkness if he were to march away in the blue of his country alas not of hers she would respect him for risking life for conviction if he stayed at home she would not understand it was his plain duty to his mother and yet he knew that virginia carvel and the women like her were ready to follow with bare feet the march of the soldiers of the south  the rain was come now in a flood stephens mother could not see in the blackness the bitterness on his face above the roar of the waters she listened for his voice  i will not go mother he said if at length every man is needed that will be different  it is for you to decide my son she answered there are many ways in which you can serve your country here but remember that you may have to face hard things  i have had to do that before mother he replied calmly i cannot leave you dependent upon charity  she went back into her room to pray for she knew that he had laid his ambition at her feet  it was not until a week later that the dreaded news came all through the friday shells had rained on the little fort while charleston looked on no surrender yet through a wide land was that numbness which precedes action force of habit sent men to their places of business to sit idle a prayerful sunday intervened sumter had fallen south carolina had shot to bits the flag she had once revered  on the monday came the call of president lincoln for volunteers missouri was asked for her quota the outraged reply of her governor went backnever would she furnish troops to invade her sister states little did governor jackson foresee that missouri was to stand fifth of all the union in the number of men she was to give to her was credited in the end even more men than stanch massachusetts  the noise of preparation was in the cityin the land on the monday morning when stephen went wearily to the office he was met by richter at the top of the stairs who seized his shoulders and looked into his face the light of the zealot was on richters own  we shall drill every night now my friend until further orders it is the leaders word until we go to the front stephen to put down rebellion stephen sank into a chair and bowed his head what would he thinkthis man who had fought and suffered and renounced his native land for his convictions who in this nobler allegiance was ready to die for them how was he to confess to richter of all men  carl he said at length ii cannot go  youyou cannot go you who have done so much already and why  stephen did not answer but richter suddenly divining laid his hands impulsively on stephens shoulders  ach i see he said stephen i have saved some money it shall be for your mother while you are away  at first stephen was too surprised for speech then in spite of his feelings he stared at the german with a new appreciation of his character then he could merely shake his head  is it not for the union implored richter i would give a fortune if i had it ah my friend that would please me so and i do not need the money now i havenobody  spring was in the air the first faint smell of verdure wafted across the river on the wind stephen turned to the open window tears of intense agony in his eyes in that instant he saw the regiment marching and the flag flying at its head  it is my duty to stay here carl he said brokenly  richter took an appealing step toward him and stopped he realized that with this young new englander a decision once made was unalterable in all his knowledge of stephen he never remembered him to change with the demonstrative sympathy of his race he yearned to comfort him and knew not how two hundred years of puritanism had reared barriers not to be broken down  at the end of the office the stern figure of the judge appeared  mr brice he said sharply  stephen followed him into the littered room behind the ground glass door scarce knowing what to expectand scarce caring as on that first day he had gone in there mr whipple himself closed the door and then the transom stephen felt those keen eyes searching him from their hidingplace  mr brice he said at last the president has called for seventyfive thousand volunteers to crush this rebellion they will go and be swallowed up and more will go to fill their places mr brice people will tell you that the war will be over in ninety days but i tell you sir that it will not be over in seven times ninety days he brought down his fist heavily upon the table this sir will be a war to the death one side or the other will fight until their blood is all let and until their homes are all ruins he darted at stephen one look from under those fierce eyebrows do you intend to go sir  stephen met the look squarely no sir he answered steadily not now  humph said the judge then he began what seemed a neverending search among the papers on his desk at length he drew out a letter put on his spectacles and read it and finally put it down again  stephen said mr whipple you are doing a courageous thing but if we elect to follow our conscience in this world we must not expect to escape persecution sir two weeks ago he continued slowly two weeks ago i had a letter from mr lincoln about matters here he mentions you  he remembers me cried stephen  the judge smiled a little mr lincoln never forgets any one said he he wishes me to extend to you his thanks for your services to the republican party and sends you his kindest regards  this was the first and only time that mr whipple spoke to him of his labors stephen has often laughed at this since and said that he would not have heard of them at all had not the judges sense of duty compelled him to convey the message and it was with a lighter heart than he had felt for many a day that he went out of the door  some weeks later five regiments were mustered into the service of the united states the leader was in command of one and in response to his appeals despite the presence of officers of higher rank the president had given captain nathaniel lyon supreme command in missouri  stephen stood among the angry jeering crowd that lined the streets as the regiments marched past here were the black jaegers no wonder the crowd laughed their step was not as steady nor their files as straight as company a there was richter his head high his blue eyes defiant and there was little tiefel marching in that place of second lieutenant that stephen himself should have filled here was another company and at the end of the first four big tom catherwood his father had disowned him the day before his two brothers george and little spencer were in a house not far awaya house from which a strange flag drooped  clouds were lowering over the city and big drops falling as stephen threaded his way homeward the damp anal gloom of the weather in his very soul he went past the house where the strange flag hung against its staff in that big city it flaunted all unchallenged the house was thrown wide open that day and in its window lounged young men of honored families and while they joked of german boorishness and yankee cowardice they held rifles across their knees to avenge any insult to the strange banner that they had set up in the hall through the open doorway the mouth of a shotted field gun could be seen the guardians were the minute men organized to maintain the honor and dignity of the state of missouri  across the street from the house was gathered a knot of curious people and among these stephen paused two young men were standing on the steps and one was clarence colfax his hands were in his pockets and a careless scornful smile was on his face when he glanced down into the street stephen caught that smile anger swept over him in a hot flame as at the slave auction years agone that was the unquenchable fire of the war the blood throbbed in his temples as his feet obeyedand yet he stopped  what right had he to pull down that flag to die on the pavement before that house     chapter xvii camp jackson  what enthusiasm on that gusty monday morning the sixth of may 1861 twelfth street to the north of the market house is full three hundred feet across and the militia of the sovereign state of missouri is gathering there thence by order of her governor they are to march to camp jackson for a week of drill and instruction  half a mile nearer the river on the house of the minute men the strange flag leaps wildly in the wind this day  on twelfth street the sun is shining drums are beating and bands are playing and bright aides dashing hither and thither on spirited chargers one by one the companies are marching up and taking place in line the city companies in natty gray fatigue the country companies often in their sunday clothes but they walk with heads erect and chests out and the ladies wave their gay parasols and cheer them here are the aristocratic st louis grays company a there come the washington guards and washington blues and laclede guards and missouri guards and davis guards yes this is secession day this monday and the colors are the stars and stripes and the arms of missouri crossed  what are they waiting for why dont they move hark a clatter and a cloud of dust by the market place an ecstasy of cheers running in waves the length of the crowd make way for the dragoons here they come at last four and four the horses prancing and dancing and pointing quivering ears at the tossing sea of hats and parasols and ribbons maude catherwood squeezes virginias arm there riding in front erect and firm in the saddle is captain clarence colfax virginia is red and white and red againtrue colors of the confederacy how proud she was of him now how ashamed that she even doubted him oh that was his true calling a soldiers life in that moment she saw him at the head of armies from the south driving the yankee hordes northward and still northward until the roar of the lakes warns them of annihilation she saw his chivalry sparing them yes this is secession monday  down to a trot they slow clarences black thoroughbred arching his long neck proud as his master of the squadron which follows four and four the square young man of bone and sinew in the first four whose horse is built like a crusaders is george catherwood and eugenie gives a cry and points to the rear where maurice is riding  whose will be the arsenal now can the yankee regiments with their slouchy dutchmen hope to capture it if there are any yankees in twelfth street that day they are silent yes there are some and there are some even in the ranks of this militiawho will fight for the union these are sad indeed  there is another wait the companies standing at ease some of the dragoons dismount but not the handsome young captain who rides straight to the bright group which has caught his eye colonel carvel wrings his gauntleted hand  clarence we are proud of you sir he says  and virginia repeats his words her eyes sparkling her fingers caressing the silken curve of jeffersons neck  clarence you will drive captain lyon and his hessians into the river  hush jinny he answered we are merely going into camp to learn to drill that we may be ready to defend the state when the time comes  virginia laughed i had forgotten she said  you will have your cousin courtmartialed my dear said the colonel  just then the call is sounded but he must needs press virginias hand first and allow admiring maude and eugenie to press his then he goes off at a slow canter to join his dragoons waving his glove at them and turning to give the sharp order attention to his squadron  virginia is deliriously happy once more she has swept from her heart every vestige of doubt now is clarence the man she can admire chosen unanimously captain of the squadron but a few days since clarence had taken command like a veteran george catherwood and maurice had told the story  and now at last the city is to shake off the dust of the north on to camp jackson was the cry the bands are started the general and staff begin to move and the column swings into the olive street road followed by a concourse of citizens awheel and afoot the horse cars crowded virginia and maude and the colonel in the carvel carriage and behind ned on the box is their luncheon in a hamper standing up the girls can just see the nodding plumes of the dragoons far to the front  olive street now paved with hot granite and disfigured by trolley wires was a country road then green trees took the place of crowded rows of houses and stores and little bobtail yellow cars were drawn by plodding mules to an inclosure in a timbered valley surrounded by a board fence known as lindell grove it was then a resort a picnic ground what is now covered by close residences which have long shown the wear of time  into lindell grove flocked the crowd the rich and the poor the proprietor and the salesmen to watch the soldiers pitch their tents under the spreading trees the gallant dragoons were off to the west across a little stream which trickled through the grounds by the side of it virginia and maude enchanted beheld captain colfax shouting his orders while his troopers dragged the canvas from the wagons and staggered under it to the line alas that the girls were there the captain lost his temper his troopers perspiring over gordian knots in the ropes uttered strange soldier oaths while the mad wind which blew that day played a hundred pranks  to the discomfiture of the young ladies colonel carvel pulled his goatee and guffawed virginia was for moving away  how mean pa she said indignantly how car you expect them to do it right the first day and in this wind  oh jinny look at maurice exclaimed maude giggling he is pulled over on his head  the colonel roared and the gentlemen and ladies who were standing by laughed too virginia did not laugh it was all too serious for her  you will see that they can fight she said they can beat the yankees and dutch  this speech made the colonel glance around him then he smiledin response to other smiles  my dear he said you must remember that this is a peaceable camp of instruction of the state militia there fly the stars and stripes from the generals tent do you see that they are above the state flag jinny you forget yourself  jinny stamped her foot  oh i hate dissimulation she cried why cant we say outright that we are going to run that detestable captain lyon and his yankees and hessians out of the arsenal  why not colonel carvel cried maude she had forgotten that one of her brothers was with the yankees and hessians  why arent women made generals and governors said the colonel  if we were answered virginia something might be accomplished  isnt clarence enough of a fireeater to suit you asked her father  but the tents were pitched and at that moment the young captain was seen to hand over his horse to an orderly and to come toward them he was followed by george catherwood  come jinny cried her cousin let us go over to the main camp  and walk on davis avenue said virginia flushing with pride isnt there a davis avenue  yes and a lee avenue and a beauregard avenue said george taking his sisters arm  we shall walk in them all said virginia  what a scene of animation it was the rustling trees and the young grass of early may and the two hundred and forty tents in lines of military precision up and down the grassy streets flowed the promenade proud fathers and mothers and sweethearts and sisters and wives in gala dress wear your bright gowns now you devoted women the day is coming when you will make them over and over again or tear them to lint to stanch the blood of these young men who wear their new gray so well  every afternoon virginia drove with her father and her aunt to camp jackson all the fashion and beauty of the city were there the bands played the black coachmen flecked the backs of their shining horses and walking in the avenues or seated under the trees were natty young gentlemen in white trousers and brassbuttoned jackets all was not soldier fare at the regimental messes cakes and jellies and even ices and more substantial dainties were laid beneath those tents dress parade was one long sigh of delight better not to have been born than to have been a young man in st louis early in camp jackson week and not be a militiaman  one young man whom we know however had little of pomp and vanity about himnone other than the young manager some whispered silent partner of carvel  company if mr eliphalet had had political ambition or political leanings during the halfyear which had just passed he had not shown them mr cluyme no mean business man himself had pronounced eliphalet a conservative young gentleman who attended to his own affairs and let the mad country take care of itself this is precisely the wise course mr hopper chose seeing a regiment of missouri volunteers slouching down fifth street in citizens clothes he had been remarked to smile cynically but he kept his opinions so close that he was supposed not to have any  on thursday of camp jackson week an event occurred in mr carvels store which excited a buzz of comment mr hopper announced to mr barbo the bookkeeper that he should not be there after four oclock to be sure times were more than dull the colonel that morning had read over some two dozen letters from texas and the southwest telling of the impossibility of meeting certain obligations in the present state of the country the colonel had gone home to dinner with his brow furrowed on the other hand mr hoppers equanimity was spoken of at the widows table  at four oclock mr hopper took an olive street car tucking himself into the far corner where he would not be disturbed by any ladies who might enter in the course of an hour or so he alighted at the western gate of the camp on the olive street road refreshing himself with a little tobacco he let himself be carried leisurely by the crowd between the rows of tents a philosophy of his own which many men before and since have adopted permitted him to stare with a superior good nature at the open lovemaking around him he imagined his own figurewhich was already growing a little stoutin a light gray jacket and duck trousers and laughed eliphalet was not burdened with illusions of that kind these heroes might have their heroworship life held something dearer for him  as he was sauntering toward a deserted seat at the foot of a tree it so chanced that he was overtaken by mr cluyme and his daughter belle only that morning this gentleman in glancing through the real estate column of his newspaper had fallen upon a deed of sale which made him wink he reminded his wife that mr hopper had not been to supper of late so now mr cluyme held out his hand with more than common cordiality when mr hopper took it the fingers did not close any too tightly over his own but it may be well to remark that mr hopper himself did not do any squeezing he took off his hat grudgingly to miss belle he had never liked the custom  i hope you will take pot luck with us soon again mr hopper said the elder gentleman we only have plain and simple things but they are wholesome sir dainties are poor things to work on i told that to his royal highness when he was here last fall he was speaking to me on the merits of roast beef  its a fine day said mr hopper  so it is mr cluyme assented letting his gaze wander over the camp he added casually i see that they have got a few mortars and howitzers since yesterday i suppose that is the stuff we heard so much about which came on the swon marked marble they say jeff davis sent the stuff to em from the government arsenal the secesh captured at baton rouge theyre pretty near ready to move on our arsenal now  mr hopper listened with composure he was not greatly interested in this matter which had stirred the city to the quick neither had mr cluyme spoken as one who was deeply moved just then as if to spare the pains of a reply a jenny lind passed them miss belle recognized the carriage immediately as belonging to an elderly lady who was well known in st louis every day she drove out dressed in black bombazine and heavily veiled but she was blind as the motherinlaw of the stalwart union leader of the city miss belles comment about her appearance in camp jackson was not out of place  well she exclaimed id like to know what shes doing here  mr hoppers answer revealed a keenness which in the course of a few days engendered in mr cluyme as lusty a respect as he was capable of  i dont know said eliphalet but i callate shes got stouter  what do you mean by that miss belle demanded  that union principles must be healthy said he and laughed  miss cluyme was prevented from following up this enigma the appearance of two people on davis avenue drove the veiled lady from her mind eliphalet too had seen them one was the tall young captain of dragoons in cavalry boots and the other a young lady with dark brown hair in a lawn dress  just look at them cried miss belle they think they are alone in the garden of eden virginia didnt use to care for him but since hes a captain and has got a uniform shes come round pretty quick im thankful i never had any silly notions about uniforms  she glanced at eliphalet to find that his eyes were fixed on the approaching couple  clarence is handsome but worthless she continued in her sprightly way i believe jinny will be fool enough to marry him do you think shes so very pretty mr hopper  mr hopper lied  neither do i miss belle assented and upon that greatly to the astonishment of eliphalet she left him and ran towards them virginia she cried jinny i have something so interesting to tell you  virginia turned impatiently the look she bestowed upon miss cluyme was not one of welcome but belle was not sensitive putting her arm through virginias she sauntered off with the pair toward the parade grounds clarence maintaining now a distance of three feet and not caring to hide his annoyance  eliphalets eyes smouldered following the three until they were lost in the crowd that expression of virginias had reminded him of a time years gone when she had come into the store on her return from kentucky and had ordered him to tell her father of her arrival he had smarted then and eliphalet was not the sort to get over smarts  a beautiful young lady remarked mr cluyme and a deserving one mr hopper now she is my notion of quality she has wealth and manners and looks and her father is a good man too bad he holds such views on secession i have always thought sir that you were singularly fortunate in your connection with him  there was a point of light now in each of mr hoppers green eyes but mr cluyme continued  what a pity i say that he should run the risk of crippling himself by his opinions times are getting hard  yes said mr hopper  and southwestern notes are not worth the paper they are written on  but mr cluyme has misjudged his man if he had come to eliphalet for information of colonel carvels affairs or of any one elses affairs he was not likely to get it it is not meet to repeat here the long business conversation which followed suffice it to say that mr cluyme who was in dry goods himself was as ignorant when he left eliphalet as when he met him but he had a greater respect than ever for the shrewdness of the business manager of carvel  company           that same thursday when the first families of the city were whispering jubilantly in each others ears of the safe arrival of the artillery and stands of arms at camp jackson something of significance was happening within the green inclosure of the walls of the united states arsenal far to the southward  the days had become alike in sadness to stephen richter gone and the judge often away in mysterious conference he was left for hours at a spell the sole tenant of the office fortunately there was work of richters and of mr whipples left undone that kept him busy this thursday morning however he found the judge getting into that best black coat which he wore on occasions his manner had recently lost much of its gruffness  stephen said he they are serving out cartridges and uniforms to the regiments at the arsenal would you like to go down with me  does that mean camp jackson asked stephen when they had reached the street  captain lyon is not the man to sit still and let the governor take the first trick sir said the judge  as they got on the fifth street car stephens attention was at once attracted to a gentleman who sat in a corner with his children about him he was lean and he had a face of great keenness and animation he had no sooner spied judge whipple than he beckoned to him with a kind of military abruptness  that is major william t sherman said the judge to stephen he used to be in the army and fought in the mexican war he came here two months ago to be the president of this fifth street car line  they crossed over to him the judge introducing stephen to major sherman who looked at him very hard and then decided to bestow on him a vigorous nod  well whipple he said this nation is going to the devil eh  stephen could not resist a smile for it was a bold man who expressed radical opinions provided they were not southern opinions in a st louis street car early in 61  the judge shook his head we may pull out he said  pull out exclaimed mr sherman whos man enough in washington to shake his fist in a rebels face our leniencyour timidityhas paralyzed us sir  by this time those in the car began to manifest considerable interest in the conversation major sherman paid them no attention and the judge once launched in an argument forgot his surroundings  i have faith in mr lincoln he is calling out volunteers  seventyfive thousand for three months said the major vehemently a bucketful on a conflagration i tell you whipple well need all the water weve got in the north  the judge expressed his belief in this and also that mr lincoln would draw all the water before he got through  upon my soul said mr sherman im disgusted nows the time to stop em the longer we let em rear and kick the harder to break em you dont catch me going back to the army for three months if they want me theyve got to guarantee me three years thats more like it turning to stephen he added dont you sign any three months contract young man  stephen grew red by this time the car was full and silent no one had offered to quarrel with the major nor did it seem likely that any one would  im afraid i cant go sir  why not demanded mr sherman  because sir said the judge bluntly his mothers a widow and they have no money he was a lieutenant in one of blairs companies before the call came  the major looked at stephen and his expression changed  find it pretty hard he asked  stephens expression must have satisfied him but he nodded again more vigorously than before  just you wait mr brice he said it wont hurt you any  stephen was grateful but he hoped to fall out of the talk much to his discomfiture the major gave him another of those queer looks his whole manner and even his appearance reminded stephen strangely of captain elijah brent  arent you the young man who made the union speech in mercantile library hall  yes sir said the judge he is  at that the major put out his hand impulsively and gripped stephens  well sir he said i have yet to read a more sensible speech except some of abraham lincolns brinsmade gave it to me to read whipple that speech reminded me of lincoln it was his style where did you get it mr brice he demanded  i heard mr lincolns debate with judge douglas at freeport said stephen beginning to be amused  the major laughed  i admire your frankness sir he said i meant to say that its logic rather than its substance reminded one of lincoln  i tried to learn what i could from him major sherman  at length the car stopped and they passed into the arsenal grounds drawn up in lines on the green grass were four regiments all at last in the blue of their countrys service old soldiers with baskets of cartridges were stepping from file to file giving handfuls to the recruits many of these thrust them in their pockets for there were not enough belts to go around the men were standing at ease and as stephen saw them laughing and joking lightheartedly his depression returned it was driven away again by major shermans vivacious comments for suddenly captain lyon the man of the hour came into view  look at him cried the major hes a man after my own heart just look at him running about with his hair flying in the wind and the papers bulging from his pockets not dignified eh whipple but this isnt the time to be dignified if there were some like lyon in washington our troops would be halfway to new orleans by this time dont talk to me of washington just look at him  the gallant captain was a sight indeed and vividly described by major shermans picturesque words as he raced from regiment to regiment and from company to company with his sandy hair awry pointing gesticulating commanding in him stephen recognized the force that had swept aside stubborn army veterans of wavering faith that snapped the tape with which they had tied him  would he be duped by the governors ruse of establishing a state camp at this time stephen as he gazed at him was sure that he would not this man could see to the bottom through every specious argument little matters of law and precedence did not trouble him nor did he believe elderly men in authority when they told gravely that the state troops were there for peace  after the ranks were broken major sherman and the judge went to talk to captain lyon and the union leader who was now a colonel of one of the volunteer regiments stephen sought richter who told him that the regiments were to assemble the morning of the morrow prepared to march  to camp jackson asked stephen  richter shrugged his shoulders  we are not consulted my friend he said will you come into my quarters and have a bottle of beer with tiefel  stephen went it was not their fault that his sense at their comradeship was gone to him it was as if the ties that had bound him to them were asunder and he was become an outcast     chapter xviii the stone that is rejected  that friday morning stephen awoke betimes with a sense that something was to happen for a few moments he lay still in the half comprehension which comes after sleep when suddenly he remembered yesterdays incidents at the arsenal and leaped out of bed  i think that lyon is going to attack camp jackson today he said to his mother after breakfast when hester had left the room  mrs brice dropped her knitting in her lap  why stephen  i went down to the arsenal with the judge yesterday and saw them finishing the equipment of the new regiments something was in the wind any one could see that from the way lyon was flying about i think he must have proof that the camp jackson people have received supplies from the south  mrs brice looked fixedly at her son and then smiled in spite of the apprehension she felt  is that why you were working over that map of the city last night she asked  i was trying to see how lyon would dispose his troops i meant to tell you about a gentleman we met in the street car a major sherman who used to be in the army mr brinsmade knows him and judge whipple and many other prominent men here he came to st louis some months ago to take the position of president of the fifth street line he is the keenest the most original man i have ever met as long as i live i shall never forget his description of lyon  is the major going back into the army said mrs brice stephen did not remark the little falter in her voice he laughed over the recollection of the conversation in the street car  not unless matters in washington change to suit him he said he thinks that things have been very badly managed and does not scruple to say so anywhere i could not have believed it possible that two men could have talked in public as he and judge whipple did yesterday and not be shot down i thought that it was as much as a mans life is worth to mention allegiance to the union here in a crowd and the way mr sherman pitched into the rebels in that car full of people was enough to make your hair stand on end  he must be a bold man murmured mrs brice  does he think that thethe rebellion can be put down  not with seventyfive thousand men nor with ten times that number  mrs brice sighed and furtively wiped her eyes with her handkerchief  i am afraid we shall see great misery stephen she said  he was silent from that peaceful little room war and its horrors seemed very far away the morning sun poured in through the south windows and was scattered by the silver on the sideboard from above on the wall colonel wilton brice gazed soberly down stephens eyes lighted on the portrait and his thoughts flew back to the boyhood days when he used to ply his father with questions about it then the picture had suggested only the glory and honor which illumines the page of history something worthy to look back upon to keep ones head high the hatred and the suffering and the tears the heartrending tearing apart for all time of loving ones who have grown togetherthese were not upon that canvas will war ever be painted with a wart  the sound of feet was heard on the pavement stephen rose glancing at his mother her face was still upon her knitting  i am going to the arsenal he said i must see what as happening  to her as has been said was given wisdom beyond most women she did not try to prevent him as he kissed her goodby but when the door had shut behind him a little cry escaped her and she ran to the window to strain her eyes after him until he had turned the corner below  his steps led him irresistibly past the house of the strange flag ominously quiet at that early hour at sight of it anger made him hot again the car for south st louis stood at the end of the line fast filling with curious people who had read in their papers that morning of the equipment of the new troops there was little talk among them and that little guarded  it was a may morning to rouse a sluggard the night air tingled into life at the touch of the sunshine the trees in the flitting glory of their first green stephen found the shaded street in front of the arsenal already filled with an expectant crowd sharp commands broke the silence and he saw the blue regiments forming on the lawn inside the wall truly events were in the airgreat events in which he had no part  as he stood leaning against a treebox by the curb dragged down once more by that dreaded feeling of detachment he heard familiar voices close beside him leaning forward he saw eliphalet hopper and mr cluyme it was mr cluyme who was speaking  well mr hopper he said in spite of what you say i expect you are dust as eager as i am to see what is going on youve taken an early start this morning for sightseeing  eliphalets equanimity was far from shaken  i dont callate to take a great deal of stock in the military he answered but business is business and a man must keep an eye on what is moving  mr cluyme ran his hand through his chop whiskers and lowered his voice  youre right hopper he assented and if this city is going to be union we ought to know it right away  stephen listening with growing indignation to this talk was unaware of a man who stood on the other side of the tree and who now came forward before mr hopper he presented a somewhat uncompromising front mr cluyme instantly melted away  my friend said the stranger quietly i think we have met before when your actions were not greatly to your credit i do not forget a face even when i see it in the dark now i hear you utter words which are a disgrace to a citizen of the united states i have some respect for a rebel i have none for you sir  as soon as stephen recovered from the shock of his surprise he saw that eliphalet had changed countenance the manner of an important man of affairs which he hay so assiduously cultivated fell away from him he took a step backward and his eyes made an ugly shift stephen rejoiced to see the stranger turn his back on the manager of carvel  company before that dignitary had time to depart and stand unconcernedly there as if nothing had occurred  then stephen stared at him  he was not a man you would look at twice ordinarily he was smoking a great el sol cigar he wore clothes that were anything but new a slouch hat and coarse grained squaretoed boots his trousers were creased at the knees his head fell forward a little from his square shoulders and leaned a bit to one side as if meditatively he had a light brown beard that was reddish in the sun and he was rather short than otherwise  this was all that stephen saw and yet the very plainness of the mans appearance only added to his curiosity who was this stranger his words his action too had been remarkable the art of administering a rebuke like that was not given to many men it was perfectly quiet perfectly final and then when it was over he had turned his back and dismissed it  next stephen began to wonder what he could know about hopper stephen had suspected eliphalet of subordinating principles to business gain and hence the conversation with mr cluyme had given him no shock in the way of a revelation but if hopper were a rogue ought not colonel carvel to hear it ought not he stephen brice to ask this man with the cigar what he knew and tell judge whipple the sudden rattle of drums gave him a start and cruelly reminded him of the gulf of prejudice and hatred fast widening between the friends  all this time the stranger stood impassively chewing his cigar his hand against the treebox a regiment in column came out of the arsenal gate the union leader in his colonels uniform on horseback at its head he pulled up in the street opposite to stephen and sat in his saddle chatting with other officers around him  then the stranger stepped across the limestone gutter and walked up to the colonels horse he was still smoking this move too was surprising enough it argued even more assurance stephen listened intently  colonel blair my name is grant he said briefly  the colonel faced quickly about and held out his gloved hand cordially captain ulysses grant said he of the old army  mr grant nodded  i wanted to wish you luck he said  thank you grant answered the colonel but you where are you living now  i moved to illinois after i left here replied mr grant as quietly as before and have been in galena in the leather business there i went down to springfield with the company they organized in galena to be of any help i could they made me a clerk in the adjutant generals office of the state i ruled blanks and made out forms for a while he paused as if to let the humble character of this position sink into the colonels comprehension then they found out that id been quartermaster and commissary and knew something about military orders now im a state mustering officer i came down to belleville to muster in a regiment which wasnt ready and so i ran over here to see what you fellows were doing  if this humble account had been delivered volubly and in another tone it is probable that the citizencolonel would not have listened since the events of that day were to crown his work of a winter but mr grant possessed a manner of holding attention it was very evident however that colonel blair had other things to think of nevertheless he said kindly  arent you going in grant  i cant afford to go in as a captain of volunteers was the calm reply i served nine years in the regular army and i think i can command a regiment  the colonel whose attention was called away at that moment did not reply mr grant moved off up the street some of the younger officers who were there laughed as they followed his retreating figure  command a regiment cried one a lieutenant whom stephen recognized as having been a bookkeeper at edwards james  doddingtons and whose stiff blue uniform coat creased awkwardly i guess im about as fit to command a regiment as grant is  that mans forty years old if hes a day put in another i remember when he came here to st louis in 54 played out hed resigned from the army on the pacific coast he put up a log cabin down on the gravois road and there he lived in the hardest luck of any man i ever saw until last year you remember him joe  yep said joe i spotted him by the el sol cigar he used to bring a load of wood to the city once in a while and then hed go over to the planters house or somewhere else and smoke one of these long fellows and sit against the wall as silent as a wooden indian after that he came up to the city without his family and went into real estate one winter but he didnt make it go curious it is just a year ago this month than he went over to illinois hes an honest fellow and hard working enough but he dont know how hes just a dead failure  command a regiment laughed the first again as of this in particular had struck his sense of humor i guess he wont get a regiment in a hurry theres lots of those military carpetbaggers hanging around for good jobs now  he might fool you fellows yet said the one caller though his tone was not one of conviction i understand he had a firstrate record an the mexican war  just then an aide rode up and the colonel gave a sharp command which put an end to this desultory talk as the first regiment took up the march the words camp jackson ran from mouth to mouth on the sidewalks catching fire stephen ran with the crowd and leaping on passing street car was borne cityward with the drums of the coming hosts beating in his ears  in the city shutters were going up on the stores the streets were filled with restless citizens seeking news and drays were halted here and there on the corners the white eyes and frenzied calls of the negro drivers betraying their excitement while stephen related to his mother the events of the morning hester burned the dinner it lay still untouched on the table when the throbbing of drums sent them to the front steps sigels regiment had swung into the street drawing in its wake a seething crowd  three persons came out of the big house next door one was anna brinsmade and there was her father his white hairs uncovered the third was jack his sister was cringing to him appealingly and he struggling in her grasp out of his coat pocket hung the curved butt of a pepperbox revolver  let me go anne he cried do you think i can stay here while my people are shot down by a lot of damned dutchman  john said mr brinsmade sternly i cannot let you join a mob i cannot let you shoot at men who carry the union flag  you cannot prevent me sir shouted the young man in a frenzy when foreigners take our flag for them own it is time for us to shoot them down  wrenching himself free he ran down the steps and up the street ahead of the regiment then the soldiers and the noisy crowd were upon them and while these were passing the two stood there as in a dream after that silence fell upon the street and mr brinsmade turned and went back into the house his head bowed as in prayer stephen and his mother drew back but anne saw them  he is a rebel she faltered it will break my fathers heart  she looked at stephen appealingly unashamed of the tears in her eyes then she too went in  i cannot stay here mother he said  as he slammed the gate anne ran down the steps calling his name he paused and she caught his sleeve  i knew you would go she said i knew you would go oh stephen you have a cool head try to keep jackout of mischief  he left her standing on the pavement but when he reached the corner and looked back he saw that she had gone in at his own little gate to meet his mother then he walked rapidly westward now and again he was stopped by feverish questions but at length he reached the top of the second ridge from the river along which crowded eighteenth street now runs there stood the new double mansion mr spencer catherwood had built two years before on the outskirts of the town with the wall at the side and the brick stable and stable yard as stephen approached it the thought came to him how little this worlds goods avail in times of trouble one of the big catherwood boys was in the blue marching regiment that day and had been told by his father never again to darken his doors another was in clarence colfaxs company of dragoons and still another had fled southward the night after sumter  stephen stopped at the crest of the hill in the white dust of the newturned street to gaze westward clouds were gathering in the sky but the sun still shone brightly half way up the rise two blue lines had crawled followed by black splotches and at the southwest was the glint of the sun on rifle barrels directed by a genius in the art of war the regiments were closing about camp jackson  as he stood there meditating and paying no attention to those who hurried past a few familiar notes were struck on a piano they came through the wideshuttered window above his head then a girls voice rose above the notes in tones that were exultant         away down south in de fields of cotton         cinnamon seed and sandy bottom         look away look away look away look away         den i wish i was in dixies land         oh oh oh oh         in dixies land ill take my stand         and live and die in dixies land         away away away         away down south in dixie  the song ceased amid peals of girlish laughter stephen was rooted to the spot  jinny jinny carvel how dare you came through the shutters we shall have a whole regiment of hessians in here  old uncle ben the catherwoods coachman came out of the stable yard the whites of his eyes were rolling half in amusement half in terror seeing stephen standing there he exclaimed  mistah brice if de dutch take camp jackson is we niggers gwinter be free  stephen did not answer for the piano had started again         if ever i consent to be married         and who could refuse a good mate         the man whom i give my hand to         must believe in the rights of the state  more laughter then the blinds were flung aside and a young lady in a dress of white trimmed with crimson stood in the window smiling suddenly she perceived stephen in the road her smile faded for an instant she stared at him and then turned to the girls crowding behind her what she said he did not wait to hear he was striding down the hill     chapter xix the tenth of may  would the sons of the first families surrender never cried a young lady who sat behind the blinds in mrs catherwoods parlor it seemed to her when she stopped to listen for the first guns of the coming battle that the tumult in her heart would drown their roar  but jinny ventured that miss puss russell who never feared to speak her mind it would be folly for them to fight the dutch and yankees outnumber them ten to one and they havent any powder and bullets  and camp jackson is down in a hollow said maude catherwood dejectedly and yet hopefully too for at the thought of bloodshed she was near to fainting  oh exclaimed virginia passionately i believe you want them to surrender i should rather see clarence dead than giving his sword to a yankee  at that the other two were silent again and sat on through an endless afternoon of uncertainty and hope and dread in the darkened room now and anon mr catherwoods heavy step was heard as he paced the hall from time to time they glanced at virginia as if to fathom her thought she and puss russell had come that day to dine with maude mr catherwoods ben reeking of the stable had brought the rumor of the marching on the camp into the diningroom and close upon the heels of this the rumble of the drums and the passing of sigels regiment it was virginia who had the presence of mind to slam the blinds in the faces of the troops and the crowd had cheered her it was virginia who flew to the piano to play dixie ere they could get by to the awe and admiration of the girls and the delight of mr catherwood who applauded her spirit despite the trouble which weighed upon him once more the crowd had cheeredand hesitated but the dutch regiment slouched on impassive and the people followed  virginia remained at the piano her mood exalted patriotism uplifted in spirit by that grand song at first she had played it with all her might then she sang it she laughed in very scorn of the booby soldiers she had seen a million of these with all the firearms in the world could not prevail against the flower of the south then she had begun whimsically to sing a verse of a song she had heard the week before and suddenly her exaltation was fled and her fingers left the keys gaining the window trembling halfexpectant she flung open a blind the troops the people were gone and there alone in the road stoodstephen brice the others close behind her saw him too and puss cried out in her surprise the impression when the room was dark once more was of sternness and sadnessand of strength effaced was the picture of the plodding recruits with their coarse and illfitting uniforms of blue  virginia shut the blinds not a word escaped her nor could they tell whythey did not dare to question her then an hour passed perhaps two before the shrill voice of a boy was heard in the street below  camp jackson has surrendered  they heard the patter of his bare feet on the pavement and the cry repeated  camp jackson has surrendered  and so the war began for virginia bitter before now was she on fire close her lips as tightly as she might the tears forced themselves to her eyes the ignominy of it  how hard it is for us of this age to understand that feeling  i do not believe it she cried i cannot believe it  the girls gathered around her pale and frightened and anxious suddenly courage returned to her the courage which made spartans of southern women she ran to the front door mr catherwood was on the sidewalk talking to a breathless man that man was mr barbo colonel carvels bookkeeper  yes he was saying theythey surrendered there was nothing else for them to do they were surrounded and overpowered  mr catherwood uttered an oath but it did not shock virginia  and not a shot fired he said  and not a shot fired virginia repeated mechanically both men turned mr barbo took off his hat  no maam  oh how could they exclaimed virginia  her words seemed to arouse mr catherwood from a kind of stupor he turned and took her hand  virginia we shall make them smart for this yet my god he cried what have i done that my son should be a traitor in arms against his own brother fighting for his people to think that a catherwood should be with the yankees you ben he shouted suddenly perceiving an object for his anger what do you mean by coming out of the yard by gd ill have you whipped ill show you niggers whether youre to be free or not  and mr catherwood was a good man who treated his servants well suddenly he dropped virginias hand and ran westward down the hill well that she could not see beyond the second rise  let us go thereto the camp let us stand on the little mound at the northeast of it on the olive street road whence captain lyons artillery commands it what a change from yesterday davis avenue is no longer a fashionable promenade flashing with bright dresses those quiet men in blue who are standing beside the arms of the state troops stacked and surrendered are united states regulars they have been in kansas and are used to scenes of this sort  the five hessian regiments have surrounded the camp each commander has obeyed the master mind of his chief who has calculated the time of marching with precision here at the western gate colonel blairs regiment is in open order see the prisoners taking their places between the ranks some smiling as if to say all is not over yet some with heads hung down in sulky shame still others who are true to the union openly relieved but who is this officer breaking his sword to bits against the fence rather than surrender it to a yankee listen to the crowd as they cheer him listen to the epithets and vile names which they hurl at the stolid blue line of the victors mudsills negro worshippers  yes the crowd is there seething with conflicting passions men with brows bent and fists clenched yelling excitedly others pushing and eager to seethere in curiosity only and alas women and children by the score as if what they looked upon were not war but a parade a spectacle as the gray uniforms file out of the gate the crowd has become a mob now flowing back into the fields on each side of the road now pressing forward vindictively until stopped by the sergeants and corporals listen to them calling to sons and brothers and husbands in gray see there is a woman who spits in a soldiers face  throughout it all the officers sit their horses unmoved a man on the bank above draws a pistol and aims at a captain a german private steps from the ranks forgetful of discipline and points at the man who is cursing the captains name the captain imperturbable orders his man back to his place and the man does not shootyet  now are the prisoners of that regiment all in place between the two files of it a band one of those which played lightsome music on the birthday of the camp is marched around to the head of the column the regiment with its freight moves on to make place for a battalion of regulars amid imprecations and cries of hurrah for jeff davis and damn the dutch kill the hessians  stephen brice stood among the people in lindells grove looking up at the troops on the road which was on an embankment through the rows of faces he had searched in vain for one his motive he did not attempt to fathomin truth he was not conscious at the time of any motive he heard the name shouted at the gate  here they arethe dragoons three cheers for colfax down with the yankees  a storm of cheers and hisses followed dismounted at the head of his small following the young captain walked erect he did not seem to hear the cheers his face was set and he held his gloved hand over the place where his sword had been as if over a wound on his features in his attitude was stamped the undying determination of the south how those thoroughbreds of the cavaliers showed it pain they took lightly the fire of humiliation burned but could not destroy their indomitable spirit they were the first of their people in the field and the last to leave it historians may say that the classes of the south caused the war they cannot say that they did not take upon themselves the greatest burden of the suffering  twice that day was the future revealed to stephen once as he stood on the hillcrest when he had seen a girl in crimson and white in a windowin her face and now again he read it in the face of her cousin it was as if he had seen unrolled the years of suffering that were to come  in that moment of deep bitterness his reason wavered what if the south should win surely there was no such feeling in the north as these people betrayed that most dangerous of gifts the seeing of two sides of a quarrel had been given him he saw the southern view he sympathized with the southern people they had befriended him in his poverty why had he not been born like clarence colfax the owner of a large plantation the believer in the divine right of his race to rule  then this girl who haunted his thoughts would that his path had been as straight his duty as easy as that of the handsome young captain  presently these thoughts were distracted by the sight of a back strangely familiar the back belonged to a gentleman who was energetically climbing the embankment in front of him on the top of which major sexton a regular army officer sat his horse the gentleman was pulling a small boy after him by one hand and held a newspaper tightly rolled in the other stephen smiled to himself when it came over him that this gentleman was none other than that mr william t sherman he had met in the street car the day before somehow stephen was fascinated by the decision and energy of mr shermans slightest movements he gave major saxton a salute quick and genial then almost with one motion he unrolled the newspaper pointed to a paragraph and handed it to the officer major saxton was still reading when a drunken ruffian clambered up the bank behind them and attempted to pass through the lines the column began to move forward mr sherman slid down the bank with his boy into the grove beside stephen suddenly there was a struggle a corporal pitched the drunkard backwards over the bank and he rolled at mr shermans feet with a curse he picked himself up fumbling in his pocket there was a flash and as the smoke rolled from before his eyes stephen saw a man of a german regiment stagger and fall  it was the signal for a rattle of shots stones and bricks filled the air and were heard striking steel and flesh in the ranks the regiment quiveredthen halted at the loud command of the officers and the ranks faced out with level guns stephen reached for mr shermans boy but a gentleman had already thrown him and was covering his body he contrived to throw down a woman standing beside him before the miniballs swished over their heads and the leaves and branches began to fall between the popping of the shots sounded the shrieks of wounded women and children the groans and curses of men and the stampeding of hundreds  lie down brice for gods sake lie down mr sherman cried  he was about to obey when a young man small and agile ran past him from behind heedless of the panic stopping at the foot of the bank he dropped on one knee resting his revolver in the hollow of his left arm it was jack brinsmade at the same time two of the soldiers above lowered their barrels to cover him then smoke hid the scene when it rolled away brinsmade lay on the ground he staggered to his feet with an oath and confronted a young man who was hatless and upon whose forehead was burned a black powder mark  curse you he cried reaching out wildly curse you you dd yankee ill teach you to fight  maddened he made a rush at stephens throat but stephen seized his hands and bent them down and held them firmly while he kicked and struggled  curse you he panted curse you you let me go and ill kill youyou yankee upstart  but stephen held on brinsmade became more and more frantic one of the officers seeing the struggle started down the bank was reviled and hesitated at that moment major sherman came between them  let him go brice he said in a tone of command stephen did as he was bid whereupon brinsmade made a dash for his pistol on the ground mr sherman was before him  now see here jack he said picking it up i dont want to shoot you but i may have to that young man saved your life at the risk of his own if that fool dutchman had had a ball in his gun instead of a wad mr brice would have been killed  a strange thing happened brinsmade took one long look at stephen turned on his heel and walked off rapidly through the grove and it may be added that for some years after he was not seen in st louis  for a moment the other two stood staring after him then mr sherman took his boy by the hand  mr brice he said ive seen a few things done in my life but nothing better than this perhaps the day may come when you and i may meet in the army they dont seem to think much of us now he added smiling but we may be of use to em later if ever i can serve you mr brice i beg you to call on me  stephen stammered his acknowledgments and mr sherman nodding his head vigorously went away southward through the grove toward market street  the column was moving on the dead were being laid in carriages and the wounded tended by such physicians as chanced to be on the spot stephen dazed at what had happened took up the march to town he strode faster than the regiments with their load of prisoners and presently he found himself abreast the little file of dragoons who were guarded by some of blairs men it was then that he discovered that the prisoners band in front was playing dixie  they are climbing the second hill and are coming now to the fringe of new residences which the rich citizens have built some of them are closed and dark in the windows and on the steps of others women are crying or waving handkerchiefs and calling out to the prisoners some of whom are gay and others sullen a distracted father tries to break through the ranks and rescue his son ah here is the catherwood house that is open mrs catherwood with her hand on her husbands arm with red eyes is scanning those faces for the sight of george  will he ever come back to her will the yankees murder him for treason or send him north to languish the rest of his life no she will not go inside she must see him she will not faint though mrs james has across the street and is even now being carried into the house few of us can see into the hearts of those women that day and speak of the suffering there  near the head of mr blairs regiment is tom his face is cast down as he passes the house from which he is banished nor do father or mother or sister in their agony make any sound or sign george is coming the welcome and the mourning and the tears are all for him  the band is playing dixie once more george is coming and some one else the girls are standing in a knot bend the old people dryeyed their handkerchiefs in their hands some of the prisoners take off their hats and smile at the young lady with the chiselled features and brown hair who wears the red and white of the south as if she were born to them her eyes are searching ah at last she sees him walking erect at the head of his dragoons he gives her one look of entreaty and that smile which should have won her heart long ago as if by common consent the heads of the troopers are uncovered before her how bravely she waves at them until they are gone down the street then only do her eyes fill with tears and she passes into the house  had she waited she might have seen a solitary figure leaving the line of march and striding across to pine street  that night the sluices of the heavens were opened and the blood was washed from the grass in lindell grove the rain descended in floods on the distracted city and the great river rose and flung brush from minnesota forests high up on the stones of the levee down in the long barracks weary recruits who had stood and marched all the day long went supperless to their hard pallets  government fare was hard many a boy prisoner or volunteer sobbed himself to sleep in the darkness all were prisoners alike prisoners of war sobbed themselves to sleep to dream of the dear homes that were here within sight and sound of them and to which they were powerless to go sisters and mothers and wives were there beyond the rain holding out arms to them  is war a thing to stir the blood ay while the day lasts but what of the long nights when husband and wife have lain side by side what of the children who ask piteously where their father is going and who are gathered by a sobbing mother to her breast where is the picture of that last breakfast at home so in the midst of the cheer which is saddest in life comes the thought that just one year ago he who is the staff of the house was wont to sit down just so merrily to his morning meal before going to work in the office why had they not thanked god on their knees for peace while they had it  see the brave little wife waiting on the porch of her home for him to go by the sun shines and the grass is green on the little plot and the geraniums red last spring she was sewing here with a song on her lips watching for him to turn the corner as he came back to dinner but now hark was that the beat of the drums or was it thunder her good neighbors the doctor and his wife come in at the little gate to cheer her she does not hear them why does god mock her with sunlight and with friends  tramp tramp tramp they are here now the band is blaring that is his company and that is his dear face the second from the end will she ever see it again look he is smiling bravely as if to say a thousand tender things will are the flannels in your knapsack you have not forgotten that medicine for your cough what courage sublime is that which lets her wave at him well for you little woman that you cannot see the faces of the good doctor and his wife behind you oh those guns of sumter how they roar in your head ay and will roar again through forty years of widowhood  mrs brice was in the little parlor that friday night listening to the cry of the rain outside some thoughts such as these distracted her why should she be happy and other mothers miserable the day of reckoning for her happiness must surely come when she must kiss stephen a brave farewell and give him to his country for the sins of the fathers are visited on the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him who is the ruler of all things  the bell rang and stephen went to the door he was startled to see mr brinsmade that gentleman was suddenly aged and his clothes were wet and spattered with mud he sank into a chair but refused the spirits and water which mrs brice offered him in her alarm  stephen he said i have been searching the city for john did you see him at camp jacksonwas he hurt  i think not sir stephen answered with clear eyes  i saw him walking southward after the firing was all over  thank god exclaimed mr brinsmade fervently if you will excuse me madam i shall hurry to tell my wife and daughter i have been able to find no one who saw him  as he went out he glanced at stephens forehead but for once in his life mr brinsmade was too much agitated to inquire about the pain of another  stephen you did not tell me that you saw john said his mother when the door was closed     chapter xx in the arsenal  there was a dismal tea at colonel carvels house in locust street that evening virginia did not touch a mouthful and the colonel merely made a pretence of eating about six oclock mrs addison colfax had driven in from bellegarde nor could it rain fast enough or hard enough to wash the foam from her panting horses she did not wait for jackson to come out with an umbrella but rushed through the wet from the carriage to the door in her haste to urge the colonel to go to the arsenal and demand clarences release it was in vain that mr carvel assured her it would do no good in vain that he told her of a more important matter that claimed him could there be a more important matter than his own nephew kept in durance and in danger of being murdered by dutch butchers in the frenzy of their victory mrs colfax shut herself up in her room and through the door virginia heard her sobs as she went down to tea  the colonel made no secret of his uneasiness with his hat on his head and his hands in his pockets he paced up and down the room he let his cigar go outa more serious sign still finally he stood with his face to the black window against which the big drops were beating in a fury  virginia sat expressionless at the head of the table still in that gown of white and crimson which she had worn in honor of the defenders of the state expressionless save for a glance of solicitation at her fathers back if resolve were feminine virginia might have sat for that portrait there was a light in her dark blue eyes underneath there were traces of the days fatigue when she spoke there was little life in her voice  arent you going to the planters house pa the colonel turned and tried to smile  i reckon not tonight jinny why  to find out what they are going to do with clarence she said indignantly  i reckon they dont know at the planters house he said  then began virginia and stopped  then what he asked stroking her hair  then why not go to the barracks order the carriage and i will go with you  his smile faded he stood looking down at her fixedly as was sometimes his habit grave tenderness was in his tone  jinny he said slowly jinny do you mean to marry clarence  the suddenness of the question took her breath but she answered steadily  yes  do you love him  yes she answered but her lashes fell  still he stood and it seemed to her that her fathers gaze pierced to her secret soul  come here my dear he said  he held out his arms and she fluttered into them the tears were come at last it was not the first time she had cried out her troubles against that great heart which had ever been her strong refuge from childhood she had been comforted there had she broken her doll had mammy easter been cross had lessons gone wrong at school was she ill or weary with that heaviness of spirit which is womans inevitable lotthis was her sanctuary but now this burden god himself had sent and none save her heavenly father might cure it through his great love for her it was given to colonel carvel to divine itonly vaguely  many times he strove to speak and could not but presently as if ashamed of her tears she drew back from him and took her old seat on the arm of his chair  by the light of his intuition the colonel chose tins words well what he had to speak of was another sorrow yet a healing one  you must not think of marriage now my dear when the bread we eat may fail us jinny we are not as rich as we used to be our trade was in the south and west and now the south and west cannot pay i had a conference with mr hopper yesterday and he tells me that we must be prepared  she laid her hand upon his  and did you think i would care dear she asked gently i can bear with poverty and rags to win this war  his own eyes were dim but pride shone in them jackson came in on tiptoe and hesitated at the colonels motion he took away the china and the silver and removed the white cloth and turned low the lights in the chandelier he went out softly and closed the door  pa said virginia presently do you trust mr hopper  the colonel gave a start  why yes jinny he improved the business greatly before this trouble came and even now we are not in such straits as some other houses  captain lige doesnt like him  lige has prejudices  so have i said virginia eliphalet hopper will serve you so long as he serves himself no longer  i think you do him an injustice my dear answered the colonel but uneasiness was in his voice hopper is hard working scrupulous to a cent he owns two slaves now who are running the river he keeps out of politics and he has none of the yankee faults  i wish he had said virginia  the colonel made no answer to this getting up he went over to the bellcord at the door and pulled it jackson came in hurriedly  is my bag packed  yes marsa  where are you going cried virginia in alarm  to jefferson city dear to see the governor i got word this afternoon  in the rain  he smiled and stooped to kiss her  yes he answered in the rain as far as the depot i can trust you jinny and liges boat will be back from new orleans tomorrow or sunday  the next morning the city awoke benumbed her heart beating but feebly her commerce had nearly ceased to flow a long line of boats lay idle with noses to the levee men stood on the street corners in the rain reading of the capture of camp jackson and of the riot and thousands lifted up their voices to execrate the foreign city below market street a vague terror maliciously born subtly spread the dutch had broken up the camp a peaceable state institution they had shot down innocent women and children what might they not do to the defenceless city under their victorious hand whose citizens were nobly loyal to the south sack it yes and burn and loot it ladies who ventured out that day crossed the street to avoid union gentlemen of their acquaintance  it was early when mammy easter brought the news paper to her mistress virginia read the news and ran joyfully to her aunts room three times she knocked and then she heard a cry within then the key was turned and the bolt cautiously withdrawn and a crack of six inches disclosed her aunt  oh how you frightened me jinny she cried i thought it was the dutch coming to murder us all what have they done to clarence  we shall see him today aunt lillian was the joyful answer the newspaper says that all the camp jackson prisoners are to be set free today on parole oh i knew they would not dare to hold them the whole state would have risen to their rescue  mrs colfax did not receive these tidings with transports she permitted her niece to come into her room and then sank into a chair before the mirror of her dressingtable and scanned her face there  i could not sleep a wink jinny all night long i look wretchedly i am afraid i am going to have another of my attacks how it is raining what does the newspaper say  ill get it for you said virginia used to her aunts vagaries  no no tell me i am much too nervous to read it  it says that they will be paroled today and that they passed a comfortable night  it must be a yankee lie said the lady oh what a night i saw them torturing him in a thousand ways the barbarians i know he had to sleep on a dirty floor with lowdown trash  but we shall have him here tonight aunt lillian cried virginia mammy tell uncle ben that mr clarence will be here for tea we must have a feast for him pa said that they could not hold them  where is comyn inquired mrs colfax has he gone down to see clarence  he went to jefferson city last night replied virginia the governor sent for him  mrs colfax exclaimed in horror at this news  do you mean that he has deserted us she cried that he has left us here defencelessat the mercy of the dutch that they may wreak their vengeance upon us women how can you sit still virginia if i were your age and able to drag myself to the street i should be at the arsenal now i should be on my knees before that detestable captain lyon even if he is a yankee virginia kept her temper  i do not go on my knees to any man she said rosetta tell ned i wish the carriage at once  her aunt seized her convulsively by the arm  where are you going jinny she demanded your pa would never forgive me if anything happened to you  a smile half pity crossed the girls anxious face  i am afraid that i must risk adding to your misfortune aunt lillian she said and left the room  virginia drove to mr brinsmades his was one of the union houses which she might visit and not lose her self respect like many southerners when it became a question of go or stay mr brinsmades unfaltering love for the union had kept him in he had voted for mr bell and later had presided at crittenden compromise meetings in short as a man of peace he would have been willing to sacrifice much for peace and now that it was to be war and he had taken his stand uncompromisingly with the union the neighbors whom he had befriended for so many years could not bring themselves to regard him as an enemy he never hurt their feelings and almost as soon as the war began he set about that work which has been done by selfdenying christians of all agesthe relief of suffering he visited with comfort the widow and the fatherless and many a night in the hospital he sat through beside the dying yankee and rebel alike and wrote their last letters home  and yankee and rebel alike sought his help and counsel in time of perplexity or trouble rather than hotheaded advice from their own leaders  mr brinsmades own carriage was drawn up at his door and that gentleman himself standing on the threshold he came down his steps bareheaded in the wet to hand virginia from her carriage  courteous and kind as ever he asked for her father and her aunt as he led her into the house however such men may try to hide their own trials under a cheerful mien they do not succeed with spirits of a kindred nature with the others who are less generous it matters not virginia was not so thoughtless nor so selfish that she could not perceive that a trouble had come to this good man absorbed as she was in her own affairs she forgot some of them in his presence the fire left her tongue and to him she could not have spoken harshly even of an enemy such was her state of mind when she was led into the drawingroom from the corner of it anne arose and came forward to throw her arms around her friend  jinny it was so good of you to come you dont hate me  hate you anne dear  because we are union said honest anne wishing to have no shadow of doubt  virginia was touched anne she cried if you were german i believe i should love you  how good of you to come i should not have dared go to your house because i know that you feel so deeply youyou heard  heard what asked virginia alarmed  that jack has run awayhas gone south we think perhaps she cried perhaps he may be dead and tears came into the girls eyes  it was then that virginia forgot clarence she drew anne to the sofa and kissed her  no he is not dead she said gently but with a confidence in her voice of rare quality he is not dead anne dear or you would have heard  had she glanced up she would have seen mr brinsmades eye upon her he looked kindly at all people but this expression he reserved for those whom he honored a life of service to others had made him guess that in the absence of her father this girl had come to him for help of some kind  virginia is right anne he said john has gone to fight for his principles as every gentleman who is free should we must remember that this is his home and that we must not quarrel with him because we think differently he paused and came over to virginia there is something i can do for you my dear said he  she rose oh no mr brinsmade she cried and yet her honesty was as great as annes she would not have it thought that she came for other reasons my aunt is in such a state of worry over clarence that i came to ask you if you thought the news true that the prisoners are to be paroled she thinks it is a virginia flushed and bit a rebellious tongue she does not believe it  even good mr brinsmade smiled at the slip she had nearly made he understood the girl and admired her he also understood mrs colfax  ill drive to the arsenal with you jinny he answered i know captain lyon and we shall find out certainly  you will do nothing of the kind sir said virginia with emphasis had i known thisabout john i should not have come  he checked her with a gesture what a gentleman of the old school he was with his white ruffled shirt and his black stock and his eye kindling with charity  my dear he answered nicodemus is waiting i was just going myself to ask captain lyon about john virginias further objections were cut short by the violent clanging of the doorbell and the entrance of a tall energetic gentleman whom virginia had introduced to her as major sherman late of the army and now president of the fifth street railroad the major bowed and shook hands he then proceeded as was evidently his habit directly to the business on which he was come  mr brinsmade he said i heard accidentally half an hour ago that you were seeking news of your son i regret to say sir that the news i have will not lead to a knowledge of his whereabouts but in justice to a young gentleman of this city i think i ought to tell you what happened at camp jackson  i shall be most grateful major sit down sir  but the major did not sit down he stood in the middle of the room with some gesticulation which added greatly to the force of the story he gave a most terse and vivid account of mr johns arrival at the embankment by the groveof his charging a whole regiment of union volunteers here was honesty again mr sherman did not believe in mincing matters even to a father and sister  and sir said he you may thank the young man who lives next door to youmr brice i believefor saving your sons life  stephen brice exclaimed mr brinsmade in astonishment  virginia felt annes hand tighten but her own was limp a hot wave swept over her was she never to hear the end of this man  yes sir stephen brice answered mr sherman and i never in my life saw a finer thing done in the mexican war or out of it  mr brinsmade grew a little excited are you sure that you know him  as sure as i know you said the major with excessive conviction  but said mr brinsmade i was in there last night i knew the young man had been at the camp i asked him if he had seen jack he told me that he had by the embankment but he never mentioned a word about saving his life  he didnt cried the major by glory but hes even better than i thought him did you see a black powder mark on his face  why yes sir i saw a bad burn of some kind on his forehead  well sir if one of the dutchmen who shot at jack had known enough to put a ball in his musket he would have killed mr brice who was only ten feet away standing before your son  anne gave a little cryvirginia was silenther lips were parted though she realized it not she was thirsting a hear the whole of the story  the major told it soldier fashion but well how john rushed up to the line how he mr sherman had seen brice throw the woman down and had cried to him to lie down himself how the fire was darting down the regiment and how men and women were falling all about them and how stephen had flung jack and covered him with his body  it was all vividly before virginias eyes had she any right to treat such a man with contempt she remembered hour he had looked at her when he stood on the corner by the catherwoods house and worst of all she remembered many spiteful remarks she had made even to anne the gist of which had been that mr brice was better at preaching than at fighting she knew nowand she had known in her heart beforethat this was the greatest injustice she could have done him  but jack what did jack do  it was anne who tremblingly asked the major but mr sherman apparently was not the man to say that jack would have shot stephen had he not interfered that was the ugly part of the story john would have shot the man who saved his life to the day of his death neither mr brinsmade nor his wife knew this but while mr brinsmade and anne had gone upstairs to the sickbed these were the tidings the major told virginia who kept it in her heart the reason he told her was because she had guessed a part of it  nevertheless mr brinsmade drove to the arsenal with her that saturday in his own carriage forgetful of his own grief long habit came to him to talk cheerily with her he told her many little anecdotes of his travel but not one of them did she hear again at the moment when she thought her belief in clarence and her love for him at last secure she found herself drawing searching comparisons between him and the quieter young bostonian in spite of herself she had to admit that stephens deed was splendid was this disloyal she flushed at the thought clarence had been capable of the deedeven to the rescue of an enemy butalas that she should carry it out to a remorseless endwould clarence have been equal to keeping silence when mr brinsmade came to him stephen brice had not even told his mother so mr brinsmade believed  as if to aggravate her torture mr brinsmades talk drifted to the subject of young mr brice this was but natural he told her of the brave struggle stephen had made and how he had earned luxuries and often necessities for his mother by writing for the newspapers  often said mr brinsmade often i have been unable to sleep and have seen the light in stephens room until the small hours of the morning  oh mr brinsmade cried virginia cant you tell me something bad about him just once  the good gentleman started and looked searchingly at the girl by his side flushed and confused perhaps he thoughtbut how can we tell what he thought how can we guess that our teachers laugh at our pranks after they have caned us for them we do not remember that our parents have once been young themselves and that some word or look of our own brings a part of their past vividly before them mr brinsmade was silent but he looked out of the carriage window away from virginia and presently as they splashed through the mud near the arsenal they met a knot of gentlemen in state uniforms on their way to the city nicodemus stopped at his masters signal here was george catherwood and his father was with him  they have released us on parole said george yes we had a fearful night of it they could not have kept usthey had no quarters  how changed he was from the gay trooper of yesterday his bright uniform was creased and soiled and muddy his face unshaven and dark rings of weariness under his eyes  do you know if clarence colfax has gone home mr brinsmade inquired  clarence is an idiot cried george illnaturedly mr brinsmade of all the prisoners here he refused to take the parole or the oath of allegiance he swears he will remain a prisoner until he is exchanged  the young man is quixotic declared the elder catherwood who was not himself in the best of humors  sir said mr brinsmade with as much severity as he was ever known to use sir i honor that young man for this more than i can tell you nicodemus you may drive on and he slammed the door  perhaps george had caught sight of a face in the depths of the carriage for he turned purple and stood staring on the pavement after his choleric parent had gone on  it was done of all the thousand and more young men who had upheld the honor of their state that week there was but the one who chose to remain in durance vile within the arsenal wallcaptain clarence colfax late of the dragoons  mr brinsmade was rapidly admitted to the arsenal and treated with the respect which his long service to the city deserved he and virginia were shown into the bare military room of the commanding officer and thither presently came captain lyon himself virginia tingled with antagonism when she saw this man who had made the city tremble who had set an iron heel on the flaming brand of her cause he too showed the marks of his herculean labors but only on his clothes and person his long red hair was unbrushed his boots covered with black mud and his coat unbuttoned his face was ruddy and his eye as clear as though he had arisen from twelve hours sleep he bowed to virginia not too politely to be sure her own nod of are recognition did not seem to trouble him  yes sir he said incisively in response to mr brinsmades question we are forced to retain captain colfax he prefers to remain a prisoner until he is exchanged he refuses to take the oath of allegiance to the united states  and why should he be made to captain lyon in what way has he opposed the united states troops  it was virginia who spoke both looked at her in astonishment  you will pardon me miss carvel said captain lyon gravely if i refuse to discuss that question with you virginia bit her tongue  i understand that mr colfax is a near relative of yours miss carvel the captain continued his friends may come here to see him during the day and i believe it is not out of place for me to express my admiration of the captains conduct you may care to see him now  thank you said virginia curtly  orderly my respects to captain colfax and ask him if a he will be kind enough to come in here mr brinsmade said the captain i should like a few words with you sir and so thanks to the captains delicacy when clarence arrived he found virginia alone she was much agitated she ran toward him as he entered the door calling his name  max you are going to stay here  yes until i am exchanged  aglow with admiration she threw herself into his arms now indeed was she proud of him of all the thousand defenders of the state he alone was true to his principlesto the south within sight of home he alone had chosen privation  she looked up into his face which showed marks of excitement and fatigue but above all excitement she knew that he could live on excitement the thought came to herwas it that which sustained him now she put it away as treason surely the touch of this experience would transform the boy into the man this was the weak point in the armor which she wore so bravely for her cousin  he had grown up to idleness he had known neither care nor responsibility his one longing from a child had been that love of fighting and adventure which is born in the race until this gloomy day in the arsenal virginia had never characterized it as a love of excitementas any thing which contained a selfish element she looked up into his face i say and saw that which it is given to a woman only to see his eyes burned with a light that was far away even with his arms around her he seemed to have forgotten her presence and that she had come all the way to the arsenal to see him her hands dropped limply from his shoulders she drew away as he did not seem to notice  so it is with men above and beyond the sacrifice of a womans life the joy of possessing her soul and affection is something more desirable stillfame and glorypersonal fame and glory the woman may share them of course and be content with the radiance when the governor in making his inauguration speech does he always think of the help the little wife has given him and so in moments of excitement when we see far ahead into a glorious future we do not feel the arms about us or value the sweets which in more humdrum days we labored so hard to attain  virginia drew away and the one searching glance she gave him he did not see he was staring far beyond tears started in her eyes and she turned from him to look out over the arsenal grounds still wet and heavy with the nights storm the day itself was dark and damp she thought of the supper cooking at home it would not be eaten now  and yet in that moment of bitterness virginia loved him such are the ways of women even of the proudest who love their country too it was but right that he should not think of her when the honor of the south was at stake and the anger that rose within her was against those nine hundred and ninetynine who had weakly accepted the parole  why did uncle comyn not come asked clarence  he has gone to jefferson city to see the governor  and you came alone  no mr brinsmade brought me  and mother  she was waiting for that question what a relief that should have come among the first  aunt lillian feels very badly she was in her room when i left she was afraid virginia had to smile she was afraid the yankees would kill you  they have behaved very well for yankees replied he no luxury and they will not hear of my having a servant they are used to doing their own work but they have treated me much better since i refused to take their abominable oath  and you will be honored for it when the news reaches town  do you think so jinny clarence asked eagerly i reckon they will think me a fool  i should like to hear any one say so she flashed out  no said virginia our friends will force them to release you i do not know much about law but you have done nothing to be imprisoned for  clarence did not answer at once finally he said i do not want to be released  you do not want to be released she repeated  no he said they can exchange me if i remain a prisoner it will have a greater effectfor the south  she smiled again this time at the boyish touch of heroics experience responsibility and he would get over that she remembered once long ago when his mother had shut him up in his room for a punishment and he had tortured her by remaining there for two whole days  it was well on in the afternoon when she drove back to the city with mr brinsmade neither of them had eaten since morning nor had they even thought of hunger mr brinsmade was silent leaning back in the corner of the carriage and virginia absorbed in her own thoughts drawing near the city that dreaded sound the rumble of drums roused them a shot rang out and they were jerked violently by the starting of the horses as they dashed across walnut at seventh came the fusillade virginia leaned out of the window down the vista of the street was a mass of blue uniforms and a film of white smoke hanging about the columns of the old presbyterian church mr brinsmade quietly drew her back into the carriage  the shots ceased giving place to an angry roar that struck terror to her heart that wet and lowering afternoon the powerful black horses galloped on nicodemus tugging at the reins and great splotches of mud flying in at the windows the roar of the crowd died to an ominous moaning behind them then she knew that mr brinsmade was speaking from battle and murder and from sudden deathfrom all sedition privy conspiracy and rebelliongood lord deliver us  he was repeating the litanythat litany which had come down through the ages they had chanted it in cromwells time when homes were ruined and laid waste and innocents slaughtered they had chanted it on the dark barricaded stairways of mediaeval paris through st bartholomews night when the narrow and twisted streets ran with blood they had chanted it in ancient india and now it was heard again in the new world and the new republic of peace and good will  rebellion the girl flinched at the word which the good gentleman had uttered in his prayers was she a traitor to that flag for which her people had fought in three wars rebellion she burned to blot it forever from the book oh the bitterness of that day which was prophecy of the bitterness to come  rain was dropping as mr brinsmade escorted her up her own steps he held her hand a little at parting and bade her be of good cheer perhaps he guessed something of the trial she was to go through that night alone with her aunt clarences mother mr brinsmade did not go directly home he went first to the little house next door to his mrs brice and judge whipple were in the parlor what passed between them there has not been told but presently the judge and mr brinsmade came out together and stood along time in the yard conversing heedless of the rain     chapter xxi the stampede  sunday dawned and the people flocked to the churches but even in the house of god were dissension and strife from the carvel pew at dr posthelwaites virginia saw men and women rise from their knees and walk outtheir faces pale with anger at st marks the prayer for the president of the united states was omitted mr russell and mr catherwood nodded approvingly over the sermon in which the south was justified and the sanction of holy writ laid upon her institution with not indifferent elation these gentlemen watched the departure of brethren with whom they had labored for many years save only when mr brinsmade walked down the aisle never to return so it is that war like a devastating flood creeps insistent into the most sacred places and will not be denied mr davitt at least preached that day to an united congregationwhich is to say that none of them went out mr hopper who now shared a pew with miss crane listened as usual with a most reverent attention the clouds were low and the streets wet as people walked home to dinner to discuss many in passion and some in sorrow the doings of the morning a certain clergyman had prayed to be delivered from the irish the dutch and the devil was it he who started the old rumor which made such havoc that afternoon those barbarians of the foreign city to the south drunk with power were to sack and loot the city how it flew across street and alley from yard to yard and from house to house privileged ned ran into the diningroom where virginia and her aunt were sitting his eyes rolling and his face ashen with terror crying out that the dutch were marching on the city firebrands in hand and murder in their hearts  de genral done gib out er proclmation miss jinny he cried de genral done say in dat proclmation dat he aint got no control ober de dutch soldiers  mrs colfax fainted  oh miss jinny aint

out doant you hear de carridges arattlin off to de country  virginia rose in agitation yet trying to be calm and to remember that the safety of the household depended upon her alone that was her thoughtbred into her by generationsthe safety of the household of the humblest slave whose happiness and welfare depended upon her fathers bounty how she longed in that instant for her father or captain lige for some mans strength to depend upon would there be wisdom in flight  do you want to go ned she asked she has seen her aunt swoon before and her maid susan knows well what to do do you want to go ned  laws mussy no miss jinny one nigger laik me doant make no difference my marsa he say whaffor you leave ma house to be ramsacked by de dutch  what i gwineter answer oh miss jinny you an miss lill an mammy easter an susans gwine with jackson an de othah niggahs can walk ephum an mell jes put up de shutters an load de colonels gun  by this time the room was filled with excited negroes some crying and some laughing hysterically uncle ben had come in from the kitchen jackson was there and the women were a wailing bunch in the corner by the sideboard old ephum impassive and ned stood together virginias eye rested upon them and the light of love and affection was in it she went to the window yes carriages were indeed rattling outside though a sharp shower was falling across the street alphonse m renaults butler was depositing bags and bundles on the steps m renault himself bustled out into the rain gesticulating excitedly spying her at the window he put his hands to his mouth cried out something and ran in again virginia flung open the sash and listened for the dreaded sound of drums then she crossed quickly over to where her aunt was lying on the lounge  o jinny murmured that lady who had revived cant you do something havent you done anything they will be here any moment to burn us to murder ustooh my poor boy why isnt he here to protect his mother why was comyn so senseless so thoughtless as to leave us at such a time  i dont think there is any need to be frightened said virginia with a calmness that made her aunt tremble with anger it is probably only a rumor ned run to mr brinsmades and ask him about it  however loath to go ned departed at once all honor to those oldtime negroes who are now memories whose devotion to their masters was next to their love of god a great fear was in neds heart but he went and he believed devoutly that he would never see his young mistress any more  and while ned is running to mr brinsmades mrs colfax is summoning that courage which comes to persons of her character at such times she gathers her jewels into a bag and her fine dresses into her trunk with trembling hands although she is well enough now the picture of clarence in the diamond frame she puts inside the waist of her gown no she will not go to bellegarde that is too near the city with frantic haste she closes the trunk which ephum and jackson carry downstairs and place between the seats of the carriage ned had had the horses in it since church time it is not safe outside but where to go  to glencoe it is three in the afternoon and jackson explains that with the load they would not reach there until midnight if at all to kirkwood or webster yes many of the first families live there and would take them in for the night equipages of all sorts are passingprivate carriages and public and cornerstand hacks the black drivers are cracking whips over galloping horses  pedestrians are hurrying by with bundles under their arms some running east and some west and some stopping to discuss excitedly the chances of each direction from the river comes the hoarse whistle of the boats breaking the sabbath stillness there it is a panic to be remembered  virginia leaned against the iron railing of the steps watching the scene and waiting for ned to return from mr brinsmades her face was troubled as well it might be the most alarming reports were cried up to her from the street and she looked every moment for the black smoke of destruction to appear to the southward around her were gathered the carvel servants most of them crying and imploring her not to leave them and when mrs colfaxs trunk was brought down and placed in the carriage where three of them might have ridden to safety a groan of despair and entreaty rose from the faithful group that went to her heart  miss jinny you aint gwineter leave yo ol mammy  hush mammy she said no you shall all go if i have to stay myself ephum go to the livery stable and get another carriage  she went up into her own deserted room to gather the few things she would take with herthe little jewellery case with the necklace of pearls which her greatgrandmother had worn at her wedding rosetta and mammy easter were of no use and she had sent them downstairs again with a flutter she opened her wardrobe door to take one last look at the gowns there you will pardon her they were part of happier days gone by she fell down on her knees and opened the great drawer at the bottom and there on the top lay the dainty gown which had belonged to dorothy manners a tear fell upon one of the flowers of the stays irresistibly pressed into her mind the memory of annes fancy dress ballof the episode by the gate upon which she had thought so often with burning face  the voices below grow louder but she does not hear she is folding the gown hurriedly into a little package it was her greatgrandmothers her chief heirloom after the pearls silk and satin from paris are left behind with one glance at the bed in which she had slept since childhood and at the picture over it which had been her mothers she hurries downstairs and dorothy mannerss gown is under her arm on the landing she stops to brush her eyes with her handkerchief if only her father were here  ah here is ned back again has mr brinsmade come  what did he say ned simply pointed out a young man standing on the steps behind the negroes crimson stains were on virginias cheeks and the package she carried under her arm was like lead the young man although he showed no signs of excitement reddened too as he came forward and took off his hat but the sight of him had acurious effect upon virginia of which she was at first unconscious a sense of security came upon her as she looked at his face and listened to his voice  mr brinsmade has gone to the hospital miss carvel he said mrs brinsmade asked me to come here with your man in the hope that i might persuade you to stay where you are  then the germans are not moving on the city she said  in spite of himself stephen smiled it was that smile that angered her that made her rebel against the advice he had to offer that made her forget the insult he had risked at her hands by coming there for she believed him utterly without reservation the moment he had spoken she was convinced that the panic was a silly scare which would be food for merriment in future years and yetwas not that smile in derision of herselfof her friends who were running away was it not an assumption of northern superiority to be resented  it is only a malicious rumor miss carvel he answered you have been told so upon good authority i suppose she said dryly and at the change in her tone she saw his face fall  i have not he replied honestly but i will submit it to your own judgment yesterday general harney superseded captain lyon in command in st louis some citizens of prominence begged the general to send the troops away to avoid further illfeeling and perhapsbloodshed they both winced at the word colonel blair represented to the general that the troops could not be sent away as they had been enlisted to serve only in st louis whereupon the general in his proclamation states that he has no control over these home guards that sentence has been twisted by some rascal into a confession that the home guards are not to be controlled i can assure you miss carvel added stephen speaking with a force which made her start and thrill i can assure you from a personal knowledge of the german troops that they are not a riotous lot and that they are under perfect control if they were not there are enough regulars in the city to repress them  he paused and she was silent forgetful of the hubbub around her it was then that her aunt called out to her with distressing shrillness from the carriage jinny jinny how can you stand there talking to young men when our lives are in danger  she glanced hurriedly at stephen who said gently i do not wish to delay you miss carvel if you are bent upon going  she wavered his tone was not resentful simply quiet ephum turned the corner of the street the perspiration running on his black face  miss jinny dey aint no carridges to be had in this town nom not for fifty dollars  this was the occasion for another groan from the negroes and they began once more to beseech her not to leave them in the midst of their cries she heard her aunt calling from the carriage where beside the trunk there was just room for her to squeeze in  jinny cried that lady frantically are you to go or stay the hessians will be here at any moment oh i cannot stay here to be murdered  unconsciously the girl glanced again at stephen he had not gone but was still standing in the rain on the steps the one figure of strength and coolness she had seen this afternoon distracted she blamed the fate which had made this man an enemy how willingly would she have leaned upon such as he and submitted to his guidance unluckily at that moment came down the street a group which had been ludicrous on any other day and was in truth ludicrous to stephen then at the head of it was a little gentleman with red muttonchop whiskers hatless in spite of the rain beginning to fall his face was the very caricature of terror his clothes usually neat were awry and his arms were full of various things not the least conspicuous of which was a magnificent bronze clock it was this object that caught virginias eye but years passed before she laughed over it behind mr cluyme for it was he trotted his family mrs cluyme in a pink wrapper carried an armful of the family silver then came belle with certain articles of feminine apparel which need not be enumerated and the three small cluymes of various ages brought up the rear  mr cluyme at the top of his speed was come opposite to the carriage when the lady occupant got out of it clutching at his sleeve she demanded where he was going the bronze clock had a narrow escape  to the river he gasped to the river madame his wife coming after him had a narrower escape still mrs colfax retained a handful of lace from the wrapper the owner of which emitted a shriek of fright  virginia i am going to the river said mrs colfax you may go where you choose i shall send the carriage back for you ned to the levee ned did not lift a rein  what you black rascal you wont obey me  ned swung on his seat no indeedy miss lilly i aint agwine thout young miss the dutch kin cotch me an hang me but i aint agwine thout miss jinny  mrs colfax drew her shawl about her shoulders with dignity  very well virginia she said ill as i am i shall walk bear witness that i have spent a precious hour trying to save you if i live to see your father again i shall tell him that you preferred to stay here and carry on disgracefully with a yankee that you let your own aunt risk her life alone in the rain come susan  virginia was very pale she did not run down the steps but she caught her aunt by the arm ere that lady had taken six paces the girls face frightened mrs colfax into submission and she let herself be led back into the carriage beside the trunk those words of mrs colfaxs stung stephen to righteous anger and resentmentfor virginia  as to himself he had looked for insult he turned to go that he might not look upon her confusion and hanging on the resolution swung on his heel again his eyes blazeing he saw in hers the deep blue light of the skies after an evenings storm she was calm and save for a little quiver of the voice mistress of herself as she spoke to the group of cowering servants  mammy she said get up on the box with ned and ned walk the horses to the levee so that the rest may follow ephum you stay here with the house and i will send ned back to keep you company  with these words clasping tightly the precious little bundle under her arm she stepped into the carriage heedless of the risk he ran sheer admiration sent stephen to the carriage door  if i can be of any service miss carvel he said i shall be happy  she glanced at him wildly  no she cried no drive on ned  and as the horses slipped and started she slammed the door in his face  down on the levee wheels rattled over the white stones washed clean by the driving rain the drops pelted the chocolate water into froth and a blue veil hid the distant bluffs beyond the illinois bottomlands down on the levee rich and poor battled for places on the landingstages and would have thrown themselves into the flood had there been no boats to save them from the dreaded dutch attila and his huns were not more feared oh the mystery of that foreign city what might not its barbarians do when roused the rich and poor struggled together but money was a power that day and many were pitilessly turned off because they did not have the high price to carry themwho knew where  boats which screamed and boats which had a dragons roar were backing out of the close ranks where they had stood wheelhouse to wheelhouse and were dodging and bumping in the channel see their guards are black with people mrs colfax when they are come out of the narrow street into the great open space remarks this with alarm all the boats will be gone before they can get near one but virginia does not answer she is thinking of other things than the steamboats and wondering whether it had not been preferable to be killed by hessians  ned spies the barbara lane he knows that her captain mr vance is a friend of the family what a mighty contempt did ned and his kind have for foot passengers laying about him with his whip and shouting at the top of his voice to make himself heard he sent the colonels kentucky bays through the crowd down to the barbaras landing stage the people scampering to the right and left and the carvel servants headed by uncle ben hanging on to the carriage springs trailing behind  here was a triumph for ned indeed he will tell you to this day how mr catherwoods carriage was pocketed by drays and bales and how mrs jamess horses were seized by the bridles and turned back ned had a head on his shoulders and eyes in his head he spied captain vance himself on the stage and bade uncle ben hold to the horses while he shouldered his way to that gentleman the result was that the captain came bowing to the carriage door and offered his own cabin to the ladies but the niggershe would take no niggers except a maid for each and he begged mrs colfaxs pardonhe could not carry her trunk  so virginia chose mammy easter whose red and yellow turban was awry from fear lest she be left behind and ned was instructed to drive the rest with all haste to bellegarde captain vance gave mrs colfax his arm and virginia his eyes he escorted the ladies to quarters in the texas and presently was heard swearing prodigiously as the boat was cast off it was said of him that he could turn an oath better than any man on the river which was no mean reputation  mrs colfax was assisted to bed by susan virginia stood by the little window of the cabin and as the barbara paddled and floated down the river she looked anxiously for signals of a conflagration nay in that hour she wished that the city might burn so it is that the best of us may at times desire misery to thousands that our own malice may be fed virginia longed to see the yellow flame creep along the wet gray clouds passionate tears came to her eyes at the thought of the humiliation she had sufferedand before him of all men could she ever live with her aunt after what she had said carrying on with that yankee the horrible injustice of it  her anger too was still against stephen once more he had been sent by circumstances to mock her and her people if the city would only burn that his cocksure judgment might for once be mistaken his calmness for once broken  the rain ceased the clouds parted and the sun turned the muddy river to gold the bluffs shone maygreen in the western flood of light and a haze hung over the bottomlands not a sound disturbed the quiet of the city receding to the northward and the rain had washed the pall of smoke from over it on the boat excited voices died down to natural tones men smoked on the guards and promenaded on the hurricane deck as if this were some pleasant excursion women waved to the other boats flocking after laughter was heard and joking mrs colfax stirred in her berth and began to talk  virginia where are we going virginia did not move  jinny  she turned in that hour she remembered that great goodnatured man her mothers brother and for his sake colonel carvel had put up with much from his wifes sister inlaw she could pass over but never forgive what her aunt had said to her that afternoon mrs colfax had often been cruel before and inconsiderate but as the girl thought of the speech staring out on the waters it suddenly occurred to her that no lady would have uttered it in all her life she had never realized till now that her aunt was not a lady from that time forth virginias attitude toward her aunt was changed  she controlled herself however and answered something and went out listlessly to find the captain and inquire the destination of the boat not that this mattered much to her at the foot of the companionway leading to the saloon deck she saw of all people mr eliphalet hopper leaning on the rail and pensively expectorating on the roof of the wheelhouse in another mood virginia would have laughed for at sight of her he straightened convulsively thrust his quid into his cheek and removed his hat with more zeal than the grudging deference he usually accorded to the sex clearly eliphalet would not have chosen the situation  i callate we didnt get out any too soon miss carvel he remarked with a sad attempt at jocoseness there wont be a great deal in that town when the dutch get through with it  i think that there are enough men left in it to save it said virginia  apparently mr hopper found no suitable answer to this for he made none he continued to glance at her uneasily there was an impudent tribute in his look which she resented strongly  where is the captain she demanded  hes down belowmaam he replied cancan i do anything  yes she said with abrupt maliciousness you may tell me where you are going  i callate up the cumberland river thats where shes bound for if she dont stop before she gets there guess there aint many of em inquired where she was goin or cared much he added with a ghastly effort to be genial  do you care she demanded curiously eliphalet grinned  not a great deal he said then he felt called upon to defend himself i didnt see any use in gettin murdered when i couldnt do anything  she left him he stared after her up the companionway bit off a generous piece of tobacco and ruminated if to be a genius is to possess an infinite stock of patience mr hopper was a genius there was patience in his smile but it was not a pleasant smile to look upon  virginia did not see it she had told her aunt the news and stood in the breeze on the hurricane deck looking southward with her hand shading her eyes the barbara lane happened to be a boat with a record and her name was often in the papers she had already caught up with and distanced others which had had half an hours start of her and was near the head of the procession  virginia presently became aware that people were gathering around her in knots gazing at a boat coming toward them others had been met which on learning the dread news turned back but this one kept her bow steadily up the current although she had passed within a biscuittoss of the leader of the line of refugees it was then that captain vances hairy head appeared above the deck  dang me he said if here aint pigheaded brent steaming the jewanita straight to destruction  oh are you sure its captain brent cried virginia the captain looked around in surprise  if that there was shreves old enterprise come to life again id lay cotton to sawdust that brent had her danged if he wouldnt take her right into the jaws of the dutch  the captains words spread and caused considerable excitement on board the barbara lane were many gentlemen who had begun to be shamefaced over their panic and these went in a body to the captain and asked him to communicate with the juanita whereupon a certain number of whistles were sounded and the barbaras bows headed for the other side of the channel  as the juanita drew near virginia saw the square figure and clean smoothshaven face of captain lige standing in front of his wheelhouse peace crept back into her soul and she tingled with joy as the bells clanged and the bucketplanks churned and the great new orleans packet crept slowly to the barbaras side  you aint goin in brent shouted the barbaras captain  why not responded mr brent at the sound of his voice virginia could have wept  the dutch are sacking the city said vance didnt they tell you  the dutchhell said mr brent calmly whos afraid of the dutch  a general titter went along the guards and virginia blushed why could not the captain see her  im on my reglar trip of course said vance out there on the sunlit river the situation seemed to call for an apology  seems to be a little more loaded than common remarked captain lige dryly at which there was another general laugh  if youre really goin up said captain vance i reckon theres a few here would like to be massacred if youll take em  certainly answered mr brent im bound for the barbecue and he gave a command  while the two great boats were manoeuvring and slashing with one wheel and the other the gongs sounding virginia ran into the cabin  oh aunt lillian she exclaimed here is captain lige and the juanita and he is going to take us back with him he says there is no danger  it its unnecessary here to repeat the moral persuasion which virginia used to get her aunt up and dressed that lady when she had heard the whistle and the gongs had let her imagination loose turning her face to the wall she was in the act of repeating her prayers as her niece entered  a big stevedore carried her down two decks to where the gangplank was thrown across captain lige himself was at the other end his face lighted pushing the people aside he rushed across snatched the lady from the negros arms crying  jinny jinny carvel well if this aint fortunate the stevedores services were required for mammy easter and behind the burly shield thus formed a stoutish gentleman slipped over all unnoticed with a carpetbag in his hand it bore the initials e h  the plank was drawn in the great wheels began to turn and hiss the barbaras passengers waved goodby to the foolhardy lunatics who had elected to go back into the jaws of destruction mrs colfax was put into a cabin and virginia in a glow climbed with captain lige to the hurricane deck there they stood for a while in silence watching the broad stern of the barbara growing smaller just to think miss carvel remarked with a little hysterical sigh just to think that some of those people brought bronze clocks instead of toothbrushes  and what did you bring my girl asked the captain glancing at the parcel she held so tightly under her arm  he never knew why she blushed so furiously     chapter xxii the straining of another friendship  captain lige asked but two questions where was the colonel and was it true that clarence had refused to be paroled though not possessing overfine susceptibilities the captain knew a muddrum from a ladys watch as he himself said in his solicitude for virginia he saw that she was in no state of mind to talk of the occurrences of the last few days so he helped her to climb the little stair that winds to the top of the texasthat sanctified roof where the pilothouse squats the girl clung to her bonnet will you like her any the less when you know that it was a shovel bonnet with long red ribbons that tied under her chin it became her wonderfully captain lige she said almost tearfully as she took his arm how i thank heaven that you came up the river this afternoon  jinny said the captain did you ever know why cabins are called staterooms  why no answered she puzzled  there was an old fellow named shreve who ran steamboats before jackson fought the redcoats at new orleans in shreves time the cabins were curtained off just like these newfangled sleepingcar berths the old man built wooden rooms and he named them after the different states kentuck and illinois and pennsylvania so that when a fellow came aboard hed say what state am i in cap and from this river has the name spread all over the worldstateroom thats mighty interesting said captain lige  yea said virginia why didnt you tell me long ago  and ill bet you cant say the captain continued why this house were standing on is called the texas  because it is annexed to the states she replied quick a flash  well youre bright said he old tufts got that notion when texas came in like to see bill jenks  of course said virginia  bill jenks was captain brents senior pilot his skin hung on his face in folds like that of a rhinoceros it was very much the same color his grizzled hair was all lengths like a wornout mop his hand reminded one of an eagles claw and his teeth were a pine yellow he greeted only such people as he deemed worthy of notice but he had held virginia in his arms  william said the young lady roguishly how is the eye location and memory  william abandoned himself to a laugh when this happened it was put in the juanitas log  so the capn be still harpin on that he said miss jinny hes just plumb crazy on a pilots qualifications  he says that you are the best pilot on the river but i dont believe it said virginia  william cackled again he made a place for her on the leatherpadded seat at the back of the pilot house where for a long time she sat staring at the flag trembling on the jackstaff between the great sombre pipes the sun fell down but his light lingered in the air above as the big boat forged abreast the foreign city of south st louis there was the arsenalgrim despite its dress of green where clarence was confined alone  captain lige came in from his duties below well jinny well soon be at home he said weve made a quick trip against the rains  andand do you think the city is safe  safe he cried as safe as london he checked himself jinny would you like to blow the whistle  i should just love to said virginia and following mr jenkss directions she put her toe on the tread and shrank back when the monster responded with a snort and a roar river men along the levee heard that signal and laughed the joke was certainly not on sturdy elijah brent  an hour later virginia and her aunt and the captain followed by mammy aster and rosetta and susan were walking through the streets of the stillest city in the union all that they met was a provosts guard for st louis was under martial law once in a while they saw the light of some contemptuous citizen of the residence district who had stayed to laugh out in the suburbs at the country houses of the first families people of distinction slept five and six in a roommany with only a quilt between body and matting little wonder that these dreamed of hessians and destruction in town they slept with their doors open those who remained and had faith martial law means passes and explanations and walking generally in the light of day martial law means that the commanderinchief if he be an artist in well doing may use his boot freely on politicians bland or beetlebrowed no police force ever gave the sense of security inspired by a provosts guard  captain lige sat on the steps of colonel carvels house that night long after the ladies were gone to bed the only sounds breaking the silence of the city were the beat of the feet of the marching squads and the call of the corporals relief but the captain smoked in agony until the clouds of two days slipped away from under the stars for he was trying to decide a question then he went up to a room in the house which had been known as his since the rafters were put down on that floor  the next morning as the captain and virginia sit at breakfast together with only mammy easter to cook and rosetta to wait on them the colonel bursts in he is dusty and travelstained from his night on the train but his gray eyes light with affection as he sees his friend beside his daughter  jinny he cries as he kisses her jinny im proud oil you my girl you didnt let the yankees frighten youbut where is jackson  and so the whole miserable tale has to be told over again between laughter and tears on virginias part and laughter and strong language on colonel carvels whatblessing that lige met them else the colonel might now be starting for the cumberland river in search of his daughter the captain does not take much part in the conversation and he refuses the cigar which is offered him mr carvel draws back in surprise  lige he says this is the first time to my knowledge  i smoked too many last night says the captain the colonel sat down with his feet against the mantel too full of affairs to take much notice of mr brents apathy  the yanks have taken the first trickthats sure he said but i think well laugh last jinny jefferson city isnt precisely quiet the state has got more militia or will have more militia in a day or two we wont miss the thousand they stole in camp jackson theyre organizing up there and ive got a few commissions right here and he tapped his pocket  pa said virginia did you volunteer  the colonel laughed  the governor wouldnt have me he answered he said i was more good here in st louis ill go later whats this i hear about clarence  virginia related the occurrences of saturday the colonel listened with many exclamations slapping his knee from time to time as she proceeded  by gum he cried when she had finished the boy has it in him after all they cant hold him a daycan they lige no answer from the captain who is eating his breakfast in silence all that we have to do is to go for worington and get a habeas corpus from the united states district court come on lige the captain got up excitedly his face purple  i reckon youll have to excuse me colonel he said theres a cargo on my boat which has got to come off and without more ado he left the room in consternation they heard the front door close behind him and yet neither father nor daughter dared in that hour add to the trial of the other by speaking out the dread that was in their hearts the colonel smoked for a while not a word escaping him and then he patted virginias cheek  i reckon ill run over and see russell jinny he said striving to be cheerful we must get the boy out ill see a lawyer he stopped abruptly in the hall and pressed his hand to his forehead my god he whispered to himself if i could only go to silas  the good colonel got mr russell and they went to mr worington mrs colfaxs lawyer of whose politics it is not necessary to speak there was plenty of excitement around the government building where his honor issued the writ there lacked not gentlemen of influence who went with mr russell and colonel carvel and the lawyer and the commissioner to the arsenal they were admitted to the presence of the indomitable lyon who informed them that captain colfax was a prisoner of war and since the arsenal was government property not in the state the commissioner thereupon attested the affidavit to colonel carvel and thus the application for the writ was made legal  these things the colonel reported to virginia and to mrs colfax who received them with red eyes and a thousand queries as to whether that yankee ruffian would pay any attention to the sovereign law which he pretended to uphold whether the marshal would not be cast over the arsenal wall by the slack of his raiment when he went to serve the writ this was not the language but the purport of the ladys questions colonel carvel had made but a light breakfast he had had no dinner and little rest on the train but he answered his sisterinlaw with unfailing courtesy he was too honest to express a hope which he did not feel he had returned that evening to a dreary household during the day the servants had straggled in from bellegarde and virginia had had prepared those dishes which her father loved mrs colfax chose to keep her room for which the two were silently thankful jackson announced supper the colonel was humming a tune as he went down the stairs but virginia was not deceived he would not see the yearning in her eyes as he took his chair he would not glance at captain liges empty seat it was because he did not dare she caught her breath when she saw that the food on his plate lay untouched  pa are you ill she faltered  he pushed his chair away such suffering in his look as she had never seen  jinny he said i reckon lige is for the yankees  i have known it all along she said but faintly  did he tell you her father demanded no  my god cried the colonel in agony to think that he kept it from me i to think that lige kept it from me  it is because he loves you pa answered the girl gently it is because he loves us  he said nothing to that virginia got up and went softly around the table she leaned over his shoulder pa  yes he said his voice lifeless  but her courage was not to be lightly shaken pa will you forbid him to come herenow  a long while she waited for his answer while the big clock ticked out the slow seconds in the hall and her heart beat wildly  no said the colonel as long as i have a roof lige may come under it  he rose abruptly and seized his hat she did not ask him where he was going but ordered jackson to keep the supper warm and went into the drawingroom the lights were out then but the great piano that was her mothers lay open her fingers fell upon the keys that wondrous hymn which judge whipple loved which for years has been the comfort of those in distress floated softly with the night air out of the open window it was lead kindly light colonel carvel heard it and paused  shall we follow him  he did not stop again until he reached the narrow street at the top of the levee bank where the quaint stone houses of the old french residents were being loaded with wares he took a few steps backup the hill then he wheeled about walked swiftly down the levee and on to the landingstage beside which the big juanita loomed in the night on her bows was set fantastically a yellow streetcar  the colonel stopped mechanically its unexpected appearance there had served to break the current of his meditations he stood staring at it while the roustabouts passed and repassed noisily carrying great logs of wood on shoulders padded by their woollen caps  thatll be the first streetcar used in the city of new orleans if it ever gets there colonel  the colonel jumped captain lige was standing beside him  lige is that you we waited supper for you  reckon ill have to stay here and boss the cargo all night want to get in as many trips as i can beforenavigation closes the captain concluded significantly  colonel carvel shook his head you were never too busy to come for supper lige i reckon the cargo isnt all  captain lige shot at him a swift look he gulped  come over here on the levee said the colonel sternly they walked out together and for some distance in silence  lige said the elder gentleman striking his stick on the stones if there ever was a straight goer thats you youve always dealt squarely with me and now im going to ask you a plain question are you north or south  im north i reckon answered the captain bluntly the colonel bowed his head it was a long time before he spoke again the captain waited like a man who expects and deserve the severest verdict but there was no anger in mr carvels voiceonly reproach  and you wouldnt tell me lige you kept it from me  my god colonel exclaimed the other passionately how could i i owe what i have to your charity but for you andand jinny i should have gone to the devil if you and she are taken away what have i left in life i was a coward sir not to tell you you must have guessed it and yetgod help mei cant stand by and see the nation go to pieces your nation as well as mine colonel your fathers fought that we americans might inherit the earth he stopped abruptly then he continued haltingly colonel i know youre a man of strong feelings and convictions all i ask is that you and jinny will think of me as a friend  he choked and turned away not heeding the direction of his feet the colonel his stick raised stood looking after him he was folded in the near darkness before he called his name  lige  yes colonel  he came back wondering across the rough stones until he stood beside the tall figure below them the lights glided along the dark water  lige didnt i raise you havent i taught you that my house was your home come back lige butbut never speak to me again of this night jinny is waiting for us  not a word passed between them as they went up the quiet street at the sound of their feet in the entry the door was flung open and virginia with her hands out stretched stood under the hall light  oh pa i knew you would bring him back she said     chapter xxiii of clarence  captain clarence colfax late of the state dragoons awoke on sunday morning the chief of the many topics of the conversation of a big city his conduct drew forth enthusiastic praise from the gentlemen and ladies who had thronged beauregard and davis avenues and honest admiration from the party which had broken up the camp the boy had behaved well there were many doting parents like mr catherwood whose boys had accepted the parole whose praise was a trifle lukewarm to be sure but popular opinion when once aroused will draw a grunt from the most grudging  we are not permitted alas to go behind these stern walls and discover how captain colfax passed that eventful sunday of the exodus we know that in his loneliness he hoped for a visit from his cousin and took to pacing his room in the afternoon when a smarting sense of injustice crept upon him clarence was young and how was he to guess as he looked out in astonishment upon the frightened flock of white boats swimming southward that his mother and his sweetheart were there  on monday while the colonel and many prominent citizens were busying themselves about procuring the legal writ which was at once to release mr colfax and so cleanse the whole body of camp jacksons defenders from any veiled intentions toward the government many well known carriages drew up before the carvel house in locust street to congratulate the widow and the colonel upon the possession of such a son and nephew there were some who slyly congratulated virginia whose martyrdom it was to sit up with people all the day long for mrs colfax kept her room and admitted only a few of her bosom friends to cry with her when the last of the callers was gone virginia was admitted to her aunts presence  aunt lillian tomorrow morning pa and i are going to the arsenal with a basket for max pa seems to think there is a chance that he may come back with us you will go of course  the lady smiled wearily at the proposal and raised her hands in protest the lace on the sleeves of her dressing gown falling away from her white arms  go my dear she exclaimed when i cant walk to my bureau after that terrible sunday you are crazy jinny no she added with conviction i never again expect to see him alive comyn says they may release him does he is he turning yankee too  the girl went away not in anger or impatience but in sadness brought up to reverence her elders she had ignored the shallowness of her aunts character in happier days but now mrs colfaxs conduct carried a prophecy with it virginia sat down on the landing to ponder on the years to comeon the pain they were likely to bring with them from this sourceclarence gone to the war her father gone for she felt that he would go in the end virginia foresaw the lonely days of trial in company with this vain woman whom accident made her cousins mother ay and more fate had made her the mother of the man she was to marry the girl could scarcely bear the thoughtthrough the hurry and swing of the events of two days she had kept it from her mind  but now clarence was to be released tomorrow he would be coming home to her joyfully for his reward and she did not love him she was bound to face that again and again she had cheated herself again and again with other feelings she had set up intense love of country in the shrine where it did not belong and it had answeredfor a while she saw clarence in a heros lightuntil a fatal intimate knowledge made her shudder and draw back and yet her resolution should not be water she would carry it through  captain liges cheery voice roused her from belowand her fathers laugh and as she went down to them she thanked god that this friend had been spared to him never had the captains river yarns been better told than at the table that evening virginia did not see him glance at the colonel when at last he had brought a smile to her face  im going to leave jinny with you lige said mr carvel presently worington has some notion that the marshal may go to the arsenal tonight with the writ i mustnt neglect the boy  virginia stood in front of him wont you let me go she pleaded  the colonel was taken aback he stood looking down at her stroking his goatee and marvelling at the ways of woman  the horses have been out all day jinny he said i am going in the cars  i can go in the cars too  the colonel looked at captain lige  there is only a chance that we shall see clarence he went on uneasily  it is better than sitting still cried virginia as she ran away to get the bonnet with the red strings  lige said the colonel as the two stood awaiting her in the hall i cant make her out can you  the captain did not answer  it was a long journey in a bumping car with had springs that rattled unceasingly past the string of provost guards the colonel sat in the corner with his head bent down over his stick at length cramped and weary they got out and made their way along the arsenal wall past the sentries to the entrance the sergeant brought his rifle to a port  commandants orders sir no one admitted he said  is captain colfax here asked mr carver  captain colfax was taken to illinois in a skiff quarter of an hour since  captain lige gave vent to a long low whistle  a skiff he exclaimed and the river this high a skiff  virginia clasped his arm in terror is there danger  before he could answer came the noise of steps from the direction of the river and a number of people hurried up excitedly colonel carvel recognized mr worington the lawyer and caught him by the sleeve  anything happened he demanded  worington glanced at the sentry and pulled the colonel past the entrance and into the street virginia and captain lige followed  they have started across with him in a light skifffour men and a captain the young fool we had him rescued  rescued  yes there were but five in the guard and a lot of us who suspected what they were up to were standing around when we saw em come down we made a rush and had the guard overpowered but colfax called out to stand back  well sir  cuss me if i understand him said mr worington he told us to disperse and that he proposed to remain a prisoner and go where they sent him  there was a silence thenmove on please gentlemen said the sentry and they started to walk toward the car line the lawyer and the colonel together virginia put her hand through the captains arm in the darkness he laid his big one over it  dont you be frightened jinny at what i said i reckon theyll fetch up in illinois all right if i know lyon there there said captain lige soothingly virginia was crying softly she had endured more in the past few days than often falls to the lot of oneandtwenty  there there jinny he felt like crying himself he thought of the many many times he had taken her on his knee and kissed her tears he might do that no more now there was the young captain a prisoner on the great black river who had a better right elijah brent wondered as they waited in the silent street for the lonely car if clarence loved her as well as he  it was vary late when they reached home and virginia went silently up to her room colonel carvel stared grimly after her then glanced at his friend as he turned down the lights the eyes of the two met as of old in true understanding  the sun was still slanting over the tops of the houses the next morning when virginia a ghostly figure crept down the stairs and withdrew the lock and bolt on the front door the street was still save for the twittering of birds and the distant rumble of a cart in its early rounds the chill air of the morning made her shiver as she scanned the entry for the newspaper dismayed she turned to the clock in the hall its hands were at quarter past five  she sat long behind the curtains in her fathers little library the thoughts whirling in her brain as she watched the growing life of another day what would it bring forth once she stole softly back to the entry selfindulgent and ashamed to rehearse again the bitter and the sweet of that scene of the sunday before she summoned up the image of the young man who had stood on these steps in front of the frightened servants she seemed to feel again the calm power and earnestness of his face to hear again the clearcut tones of his voice as he advised her then she drew back frightened into the sombre library consciencestricken that she should have yielded to this temptation then when clarenceshe dared not follow the thought but she saw the light skiff at the mercy of the angry river and the dark night  this had haunted her if he were spared she prayed for strength to consecrate herself to him a book lay on the table and virginia took refuge in it and her eyes glancing over the pages rested on this verse         thy voice is heard thro rolling drums         that beat to battle where he stands         thy face across his fancy comes         and gives the battle to his hands  the paper brought no news nor mentioned the ruse to which captain lyon had resorted to elude the writ by transporting his prisoner to illinois newspapers were not as alert then as now colonel carvel was off early to the arsenal in search of tidings he would not hear of virginias going with him captain lige with a surer instinct went to the river what a morning of suspense twice virginia was summoned to her aunt and twice she made excuse it was the captain who returned first and she met him at the door  oh what have you heard she cried  he is alive said the captain tremulously alive and well and escaped south  she took a step toward him and swayed the captain caught her for a brief instant he held her in his arms and then he led her to the great armchair that was the colonels  lige she said are you sure that this is nota kindness  no jinny he answered quickly but things were mighty close i was afraid last night the river was roarin they struck out straight across but they drifted and drifted like logwood and then she began to fill and all five of em to bail thenthen she went down the five soldiers came up on that bit of an island below the arsenal they hunted all night but they didnt find clarence and they got taken off to the arsenal this morning  and how do you know she faltered  i knew that much this morning he continued and so did your pa but the andrew jackson is just in from memphis and the captain tells me that he spoke the memphis packet off cape girardeau and that clarence was aboard she picked him up by a miracle after he had just missed a round trip through her wheelhouse     book iii   volume 6     chapter i introducing a capitalist  a cordon of blue regiments surrounded the city at first from carondelet to north st louis like an open fan the crowds liked best to go to compton heights where the tents of the german citizensoldiers were spread out like so many slices of white cake on the green beside the citys reservoir thence the eye stretched across the town catching the dome of the court house and the spire of st johns away to the west on the line of the pacific railroad that led halfway across the state was another camp then another and another on the circle of the fan until the river was reached to the northward far above the bend within was a peace that passed understandingthe peace of martial law  without the city in the great state beyond an irate governor had gathered his forces from the east and from the west letters came and went between jefferson city and jefferson davis their purport being that the governor was to work out his own salvation for a while at least young men of st louis struck in a night by the fever of militarism arose and went to glencoe prying sergeants and commissioned officers mostly of hated german extraction thundered at the door of colonel carvels house and other houses therefor glencoe was a border town they searched the place more than once from garret to cellar muttered guttural oaths and smelled of beer and sauerkraut the haughty appearance of miss carvel did not awe themthey were blind to all manly sensations the colonels house alas was one of many in glencoe written down in red ink in a book at headquarters as a place toward which the feet of the young men strayed good evidence was handed in time and time again that the young men had come and gone and redfaced commanding officers cursed indignant subalterns and implied that beauty had had a hand in it councils of war were held over the advisability of seizing mr carvels house at glencoe but proof was lacking until one rainy night in june a captain and ten men spurred up the drive and swung into a big circle around the house the captain took off his cavalry gauntlet and knocked at the door more gently than usual miss virginia was home so jackson said the captain was given an audience more formal than one with the queen of prussia could have been miss carvel was infinitely more haughty than her majesty was not the captain hired to do a degrading service indeed he thought so as he followed her about the house and he felt like the lowest of criminals as he opened a closet door or looked under a bed he was a beast of the field of the mire how virginia shrank from him if he had occasion to pass her her gown would have been defiled by his touch and yet the captain did not smell of beer nor of sauerkraut nor did he swear in any language he did his duty apologetically but he did it he pulled a man aged seventeen out from under a great hoop skirt in a little closet and the man had a pistol that refused its duty when snapped in the captains face this was little spencer catherwood just home from a military academy  spencer was taken through the rain by the chagrined captain to the headquarters where he caused a little embarrassment no damning evidence was discovered on his person for the pistol had long since ceased to be a firearm and so after a stiff lecture from the colonel he was finally given back into the custody of his father despite the pickets the young men filtered through dailyor rather nightly presently some of them began to come back gaunt and worn and tattered among the grim cargoes that were landed by the thousands and tens of thousands on the levee and they took them oh the pity of it they took them to mr lynchs slave pen turned into a union prison of detention where their fathers and grandfathers had been wont to send their disorderly and insubordinate niggers they were packed away as the miserable slaves had been to taste something of the bitterness of the negros lot so came bert russell to welter in a low room whose walls gave out the stench of years how you cooked for them and schemed for them and cried for them you devoted women of the south you spent the long hot summer in town and every day you went with your baskets to gratiot street where the infected old house stands untiluntil one morning a lady walked out past the guard and down the street she was civilly detained at the corner because she wore army boots after that permits were issued if you were a young lady of the proper principles in those days you climbed a steep pair of stairs in the heat and stood in line until it became your turn to be catechised by an indifferent young officer in blue who sat behind a table and smoked a horrid cigar he had little time to be courteous he was not to be dazzled by a bright gown or a pretty face he was indifferent to a smile which would have won a savage his duty was to look down into your heart and extract therefrom the nefarious scheme you had made to set free the man you loved ere he could be sent north to alton or columbus my dear you wish to rescue him to disguise him send him south by way of colonel carvels house at glencoe then he will be killed at least he will have died for the south  first politics and then war and then more politics in this our country your masterful politician obtains a regiment and goes to war sword in hand he fights well but he is still the politician it was not a case merely of fighting for the union but first of getting permission to fight camp jackson taken and the prisoners exchanged south captain lyon who moved like a whirlwind who loved the union beyond his own life was thrust down again a mutual agreement was entered into between the governor and the old indian fighter in command of the western department to respect each other a trick for the rebels how lyon chafed and paced the arsenal walks while he might have saved the state then two gentlemen went to washington and the next thing that happened was brigadier general lyon commander of the department of the west  would general lyon confer with the governor of missouri yes the general would give the governor a safeconduct into st louis but his excellency must come to the general his excellency came and the general deigned to go with the union leader to the planters house conference five hours result a safeconduct for the governor back and this is how general lyon ended the talk his words generously preserved by a confederate colonel who accompanied his excellency deserve to be writ in gold on the national annals  rather than concede to the state of missouri the right to demand that my government shall not enlist troops within her limits or bring troops into the state whenever it pleases or move its troops at its own will into out of or through the state rather than concede to the state of missouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my government in any matter however unimportant i would rising and pointing in turn to every one in the room see you and you and you and you and every man woman and child in this state dead and buried then turning to the governor he continued this means war in an hour one of my officers will call for you and conduct you out of my lines  and thus without another word without an inclination of the head he turned upon his heel and strode out of the room rattling his spurs and clanking his sabre  it did mean war in less than two months that indomitable leader was lying dead beside wilsons creek among the oaks on bloody hill what he would have been to this union had god spared him we shall never know he saved missouri and won respect and love from the brave men who fought against him  those first fierce battles in the state what prayers rose to heaven and curses sank to hell when the news of them came to the city by the river flags were made by loving fingers and shirts and bandages trembling young ladies of union sympathies presented colors to regiments on the arsenal green or at jefferson barracks or at camp benton to the northwest near the fair grounds and then the regiments marched through the streets with bands playing that march to which the words of the battle hymn were set and those bright ensigns snapping at the front bright now and new and crimson but soon to be stained a darker red and rent into tatters and finally brought back and talked over and cried over and tenderly laid above an inscription in a glass case to be revered by generations of americans to confer what can stir the soul more than the sight of those old flags standing in ranks like the veterans they are whose duty has been nobly done the blood of the colorsergeant is there black now with age but where are the tears of the sad women who stitched the red and the white and the blue together  the regiments marched through the streets and aboard the boats and pushed off before a levee of waving handkerchiefs and nags then heartbreaking suspense latermuch later black headlines and grim lists three columns longthree columns of a blanket sheet the city of alton has arrived with the following union dead and wounded and the following confederate wounded prisoners why does the type run together  in a neverceasing procession they steamed up the river those calm boats which had been wont to carry the white cargoes of commerce now bearing the red cargoes of war and they bore away to new battlefields thousands of freshfaced boys from wisconsin and michigan and minnesota gathered at camp benton some came back with their color gone and their red cheeks sallow and bearded and sunken others came not back at all  stephen brice with a pain over his heart and a lump in his throat walked on the pavement beside his old company but his look avoided their faces he wrung richters hand on the landingstage richter was now a captain the good germans eyes were filled as he said goodby  you will come too my friend when the country needs you he said now and he shrugged his shoulders now have we many with no cares to go i have not even a father and he turned to judge whipple who was standing by holding out a bony hand  god bless you carl said the judge and carl could scarce believe his ears he got aboard the boat her decks already blue with troops and as she backed out with her whistle screaming the last objects he saw were the gaunt old man and the broadshouldered young man side by side on the edge of the landing  stephens chest heaved and as he walked back to the office with the judge he could not trust himself to speak back to the silent office where the shelves mocked them the judge closed the groundglass door behind him and stephen sat until five oclock over a book no it was not whittlesey but hardees tactics he shut it with a slam and went to verandah hall to drill recruits on a dusty floornarrowchested citizens in suspenders who knew not the first motion in right about face for stephen was an adjutant in the home guardswhat was left of them  one we know of regarded the going of the troops and the coming of the wounded with an equanimity truly philosophical when the regiments passed carvel  company on their way riverward to embark mr hopper did not often take the trouble to rise from his chair nor was he ever known to go to the door to bid them godspeed this was all very well because they were union regiments but mr hopper did not contribute a horse nor even a saddleblanket to the young men who went away secretly in the night without fathers or mothers or sisters to wave at them mr hopper had better use for his money  one scorching afternoon in july colonel carvel came into the office too hurried to remark the pain in honest ephums face as he watched his master the sure signs of a harassed man were on the colonel since may he had neglected his business affairs for others which he deemed public and which were so mysterious that even mr hopper could not get wind of them these matters had taken the colonel out of town but now the necessity of a pass made that awkward and he went no farther than glencoe where he spent an occasional sunday today mr hopper rose from his chair when mr carvel entereda most unprecedented action the colonel cleared his throat sitting down at his desk he drummed upon it uneasily  mr hopper he said at length  eliphalet crossed the room quickly and something that was very near a smile was on his face he sat down close to mr carvels chair with a semiconfidential airone wholly new had the colonel given it a thought he did not but began to finger some printed slips of paper which had indorsements on their backs his fine lips were tightly closed as if in pain  mr hopper he said these eastern notes are due this week are they not  yes sir  the colonel glanced up swiftly  there is no use mincing matters hopper you know as well as i that there is no money to pay them said he with a certain pompous attempt at severity which characterized his kind nature you have served me well you have brought this business up to a modern footing and made it as prosperous as any in the town i am sorry sir that those contemptible yankees should have forced us to the use of arms and cut short many promising business careers such as yours sir but we have to face the music we have to suffer for our principles  these notes cannot be met mr hopper and the good gentleman looked out of the window he was thinking of a day before the mexican war when his young wife had sat in the very chair filled by mr hopper now these notes cannot be met he repeated and his voice was near to breaking  the flies droning in the hot office made the only sound outside the partition among the bales was silence  colonel said mr hopper with a remarkable ease i callate these notes can be met  the colonel jumped as if he had heard a shot and one of the notes fell to the floor eliphalet picked it up tenderly and held it  what do you mean sir mr carvel cried there isnt a bank in town that will lend me money ii havent a frienda friend i may ask who can spare it sir  mr hopper lifted up his hand it was a fat hand suavity was come upon it like a new glove and changed the man he was no longer cringing now he had poise such poise as we in these days are accustomed to see in leather and mahogany offices the colonel glared at him uncomfortably  i will take up those notes myself sir  you cried the colonel incredulously you  we must do eliphalet justice there was not a deal of hypocrisy in his nature and now he did not attempt the part of samaritan he did not beam upon the colonel and remind him of the day on which homeless and friendless he had been frightened into his store by a drove of mules no but his daythe day toward which he had striven unknown and unnoticed for so many yearsthe day when he would laugh at the pride of those who had ignored and insulted him was dawning at last when we are thoughtless of our words we do not reckon with that spark in little bosoms that may burst into flame and burn us not that colonel carvel had ever been aught but courteous and kind to all his station in life had been his offence to eliphalet who strove now to hide an exultation that made him tremble  what do you mean sir demanded the colonel again  i callate that i can gather together enough to meet the notes colonel just a little friendly transaction here followed an interval of sheer astonishment to mr carvel  you have this money he said at length mr hopper nodded  and you will take my note for the amount  yes sir  the colonel pulled his goatee and sat back in his chair trying to face the new light in which he saw his manager he knew well enough that the man was not doing this out of charity or even gratitude he reviewed his whole career from that first morning when he had carried bales to the shipping room to his replacement of mr hood and there was nothing with which to accuse him he remembered the warnings of captain lige and virginia he could not in honor ask a cent from the captain now he would not ask his sisterinlaw mrs colfax to let him touch the money he had so ably invested for her that little which virginias mother had left the girl was sacred  night after night mr carvel had lain awake with the agony of those eastern debts not to pay was to tarnish the name of a southern gentleman he could not sell the business his house would bring nothing in these times he rose and began to pace the floor tugging at his chin twice he paused to stare at mr hopper who sat calmly on and the third time stopped abruptly before him  see here he cried where the devil did you get this money sir  mr hopper did not rise  i havent been extravagant colonel since ive worked for you he said it dont cost me much to live ive been fortunate in investments  the furrows in the colonels brow deepened  you offer to lend me five times more than i have ever paid you mr hopper tell me how you have made this money before i accept it  eliphalet had never been able to meet that eye since he had known it he did not meet it now but he went to his desk and drew a long sheet of paper from a pigeonhole  these be some of my investments he answered with just a tinge of surliness i callate theyll stand inspection i aint forcing you to take the money sir he flared up all at once id like to save the business  mr carvel was disarmed he went unsteadily to his desk and none save god knew the shock that his pride received that day to rescue a name which had stood untarnished since he had brought it into the world he drew forth some blank notes and filled them out but before he signed them he spoke  you are a business man mr hopper said he and as a business man you must know that these notes will not legally hold it is martial law the courts are abolished and all transactions here in st louis are invalid  eliphalet was about to speak  one moment sir cried the colonel standing up and towering to his full height law or no law you shall have the money and interest or your security which is this business i need not tell you sir that my word is sacred and binding forever upon me and mine  im not afraid colonel answered mr hopper with a feeble attempt at geniality he was in truth awed at last  you need not be sir said the colonel with equal force if you werethis instant you should leave this place he sat down and continued more calmly it will not be long before a southern army marches into st louis and the yankee government submits he leaned forward do you reckon we can hold the business together until then mr hopper  god forbid that we should smile at the colonels simple faith and if eliphalet hopper had done so his history would have ended here  leave that to me colonel he said soberly  then came the reaction the good colonel sighed as he signed away that business which had been an honor to the city where it was founded i thank heaven that we are not concerned with the details of their talk that day why should we wish to know the rate of interest on those notes or the time it was wartime  mr hopper filled out his check and presently departed it was the signal for the little force which remained to leave outside in the store ephum paced uneasily wondering why his master did not come out presently he crept to the door of the office pushed it open and beheld mr carvel with his head bowed down in his hands  marse comyn he cried marse comyn  the colonel looked up his face was haggard  marse comyn you know what i done promise young miss long time ago befobefo she done left us  yes ephum  he saw the faithful old negro but dimly faintly he heard the pleading voice  marse comyn won you give ephum a pass down river ter fotch capn lige  ephum said the colonel sadly i had a letter from the captain yesterday he is at cairo his boat is a federal transport and he is in yankee pay  ephum took a step forward appealingly but de capns yo friend marse comyn he aint never foget what you done fo him marse comyn he aint in de army suh  and i am the captains friend ephum answered the colonel quietly but i will not ask aid from any man employed by the yankee government nonot from my own brother who is in a pennsylvania regiments  ephum shuffled out and his heart was lead as he closed the store that night  mr hopper has boarded a fifth street car which jangles on with many halts until it comes to bremen a german settlement in the north of the city at bremen great droves of mules fill the street and crowd the entrances of the sale stables there whips are cracking like pistol shots gentlemen with the yellow cavalry stripe of the united states army are pushing to and fro among the drivers and the owners and fingering the frightened animals a herd breaks from the confusion and is driven like a whirlwind down the street dividing at the market house they are going to board the government transportto die on the battlefields of kentucky and missouri  mr hopper alights from the car with complacency he stands for a while on a corner against the hot building surveying the busy scene unnoticed mules was it not a prophecythat drove which sent him into mr carvels store  presently a man with a gnawed yellow mustache and a shifty eye walks out of one of the offices and perceives our friend  howdy mr hopper says he  eliphalet extends a hand to be squeezed and returned got them vouchers he asks he is less careful of his english here  wal i jest reckon is the answer the fellow was interrupted by the appearance of a smart young man in a smart uniform who wore an air of genteel importance he could not have been more than two and twenty and his face and manners were those of a clerk the tan of field service was lacking on his cheek and he was black under the eyes  hullo ford he said jocularly  howdy cap retorted the other wal suh that last lot was an extry fo sure as clean a lot as ever i seed not a lump on em govment aint cheated much on them there at oneeighty a head i reckon  mr ford said this with such an air of conviction and such a sober face that the captain smiled and at the same time he glanced down nervously at the new line of buttons on his chest  i guess i know a mule from a newfoundland dog by this time said he  wal i jest reckon asserted mr ford with a loud laugh capn wentworth allow me to make you acquainted with mr hopper mr hopper capn wentworth  the captain squeezed mr hoppers hand with fervor you interested in mules mr hopper asked the military man  i dont callate to be said mr hopper let us hope that our worthy has not been presented as being wholly without a sense of humor he grinned as he looked upon this lamb in the uniform of mars and added im just naturally patriotic i guess capn ll you have a drink  and a segar added mr ford  just one says the captain its dd tiresome lookin at mules all day in the sun  well for mr davitt that his mission work does not extend to bremen that the good mans charity keeps him at the improvised hospital down town mr hopper has resigned the superintendency of his sunday school it is true but he is still a pillar of the church  the young officer leans against the bar and listens to stories by mr ford which it behooves no church members to hear he smokes mr hoppers cigar and drinks his whiskey and eliphalet understands that the good lord put some fools into the world in order to give the smart people a chance to practise their talents mr hopper neither drinks nor smokes but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere  when at length the captain has marched out with a conscious but manly air mr hopper turns to forddont lose no time in presenting them vouchers at headquarters says he money is worth something now and theres grumbling about this department in the eastern papers if we have an investigation well whistle how much today  three thousand says mr ford he tosses off a pony of bourbon but his face is not a delight to look upon hopper youll be a dd rich man some day  i callate to  i do the dirty work and because i aint got no capital i only get four per cent  dont onetwenty a day suit you  you get blasted near a thousand and youve got horse contracts and blanket contracts besides i know you whats to prevent my goin south when the vouchers is cashed he cried aint it possible  i presume likely said mr hopper quietly then your motherll have to move out of her little place     chapter ii news from clarence  the epithet aristocrat may become odious and fatal on the banks of the mississippi as it was on the banks of the seine let no man deceive himself these are fearful times thousands of our population by the sudden stoppage of business are thrown out of employment when gaunt famine intrudes upon their household it is but natural that they should inquire the cause hunger began the french revolution  virginia did not read this editorial because it appeared in that abhorred organ of the mudsills the missouri democrat the wheels of fortune were turning rapidly that first hot summer of the war time let us be thankful that our flesh and blood are incapable of the fury of the guillotine but when we think calmly of those days can we escape without a little pity for the aristocrats do you think that many of them did not know hunger and want long before that cruel war was over  how bravely they met the grim spectre which crept so insidiously into their homes  virginia child said mrs colfax peevishly one morning as they sat at breakfast why do you persist it wearing that old gown it has gotten on my nerves my dear you really must have something new made even if there are no men here to dress for  aunt lillian you must not say such things i do not think that i ever dressed to please men  tut tut my dear we all do i did even after married your uncle it is natural we must not go shabby in such times as these or be out of fashion did you know that prince napoleon was actually coming here for a visit this autumn we must be ready for him i am having a fitting at miss elders today  virginia was learning patience she did not reply as she poured out her aunts coffee  jinny said that lady come with me to elders and i will give you some gowns if comyn had been as careful of his own money as of mine you could dress decently  i think i do dress decently aunt lillian answered the girl i do not need the gowns give me the money you intend to pay for them and i can use it for a better purpose  mrs colfax arranged her lace pettishly  i am sick and tired of this superiority jinny and in the same breath what would you do with it  virginia lowered her voice hodges goes through the lines tomorrow night i should send it to clarence but you have no idea where clarence is  hodges can find him  pshaw exclaimed her aunt i would not trust him how do you know that he will get through the dutch pickets to prices army wasnt souther captured last week and that rash letter of puss russells to jack brinsmade published in the democrat she laughed at the recollection and virginia was fain to laugh too puss hasnt been around much since i hope that will cure her of saying what she thinks of people  it wont said virginia  ill save my money until price drives the yankees from the state and clarence marches into the city at the head of a regiment mrs colfax went on it wont be long now  virginias eyes flashed  oh you cant have read the papers and dont you remember the letter maude had from george they need the bare necessities of life aunt lillian and half of prices men have no arms at all  jackson said mrs colfax bring me a newspaper is there any news today  no answered virginia quickly all we know is that lyon has left springfield to meet our troops and that a great battle is coming perhapsperhaps it is being fought today  mrs colfax burst into tears oh jinny she cried how can you be so cruel  that very evening a man tall and lean but with the shrewd and kindly eye of a scout came into the sittingroom with the colonel and handed a letter to mrs colfax in the hall he slipped into virginias hand another in a jefferson davis envelope and she thrust it in her gownthe girl was on fire as he whispered in her ear that he had seen clarence and that he was well in two days an answer might be left at mr russells house but she must be careful what she wrote as the yankee scouts were active  clarence indeed had proven himself a man glory and uniform became him well but danger and deprivation better the words he had written careless and frank and boyish made virginias heart leap with pride mrs colfaxs letter began with the adventure below the arsenal when the frail skiff had sunk near the island he told how he had heard the captain of his escort sing out to him in the darkness and how he had floated down the current instead until chilled and weary he had contrived to seize the branches of a huge tree floating by and how by a miracle the moon had risen when the great memphis packet bore down upon him he had been seen from her guards and rescued and made much of and set ashore at the next landing for fear her captain would get into trouble in the morning he had walked into the country first providing himself with butternuts and rawhide boots and a bowieknife virginia would never have recognized her dashing captain of dragoons in this guise  the letter was long for clarence and written under great difficulties from date to date for nearly a month he had tramped over mountains and across river bottoms waiting for news of an organized force of resistance in missouri begging his way from cabin to cabin and living on greasy bacon and corn pone at length he crossed the swift gasconade so named by the french settlers because of its brawling ways where the bridge of the pacific railroad had been blown up by the governors orders then he learned that the untiring lyon had steamed up the missouri and had taken possession of jefferson city without a blow and that the ragged rebel force had fought and lost at booneville footsore but undaunted he pushed on to join the army which he heard was retreating southward along the western tier of counties of the state  on the banks of the osage he fell in with two other young amen in as bad a plight as himself they travelled together until one day some rough farmers with shotguns leaped out of a bunch of willows on the borders of a creek and arrested all three for union spies and they laughed when mr clarence tried to explain that he had not long since been the dapper captain of the state dragoons  his excellency the governor of missouri so acknowledged by all good southerners likewise laughed when mr colfax and the two others were brought before him his excellency sat in a cabin surrounded by a camp which had caused the dogs of war to howl for very shame  colfax cried the governor a colfax of st louis in butternuts and rawhide boots  give me a razor demanded clarence with indignation a razor and a suit of clothes and i will prove it the governor laughed once more  a razor young man a suit of clothes you know not what you ask  are there any gentlemen from st louis here george catherwood was brought inor rather what had once been george now he was a big frontiersman with a huge blond beard and a bowie knife stuck into his trousers in place of a sword he recognized his young captain of dragoons the governor apologized and clarence slept that night in the cabin the next day he was given a horse and a bright new rifle which the governors soldiers had taken from the dutch at cole camp on the way south and presently they made a junction with three thousand more who were their images this was prices army but price had gone ahead into kansas to beg the great mcculloch and his confederates to come to their aid and save the state     dear mother i wish that you and jinny and uncle comyn could have    seen this country rabble how you would have laughed and cried    because we are just like them in the combined army two thousand    have only bowieknives or clubs some have long rifles of daniel    boones time not fired for thirty years and the impedimenta are a    sight open wagons and conestogas and carryalls and buggies and    even barouches weighted down with fryingpans and chairs and    feather beds but weve got spirit and we can whip lyons dutchmen    and yankees just as we are spirit is what counts and the yankees    havent got it i was made today a captain of cavalry under    colonel rives i ride a great rawboned horse like an elephant    he jolts me until i am sorenot quite as easy as my thoroughbred    jefferson tell jinny to care for him and have him ready when we    march into st louis                    cowskin prairie 9th july     we have whipped sigel on the prairie by coon creek and killedwe    dont know how many tell maude that george distinguished himself    in the fight we cavalry did not get a chance     we have at last met mcculloch and his real soldiers we cheered    until we cried when we saw their ranks of gray with the gold    buttons and the gold braid and the gold stars general mcculloch    has taken me on his staff and promised me a uniform but how to    clothe and feed and arm our men we have only a few poor cattle    and no money but our men dont complain we shall whip the    yankees before we starve  for many days mrs colfax did not cease to bewail the hardship which her dear boy was forced to endure he who was used to linen sheets and eider down was without rough blanket or shelter who was used to the best table in the state was reduced to husks  but aunt lillian cried virginia he is fighting for the south if he were fed and clothed like the yankees we should not be half so proud of him  why set down for colder gaze the burning words that clarence wrote to virginia how she pored over that letter and folded it so that even the candledroppings would not be creased and fall away he was happy though wretched because he could not see her it was the life he had longed for at last and most pathetic he was proving his usefulness in this world he was no longer the mere idler whom she had chidden     jinny do you remember saying so many years ago that our ruin would    come of our not being able to work how i wish you could see us    felling trees to make bulletmoulds and forging slugs for canister    and making cartridges at night with our bayonets as candlesticks    jinny dear i know that you will keep up your courage i can see    you sewing for us i can hear you praying for us  it was in truth how virginia learned to sew she had always detested it her fingers were pricked and sore weeks after she began sad to relate her bandages shirts and havelocks never reached the frontthose havelocks to withstand the heat of the tropic sun which were made in thousands by devoted union women that first summer of the war to be ridiculed as nightcaps by the soldiers  why should not our soldiers have them too said virginia to the russell girls they were never so happy as when sewing on them against the arrival of the army of liberation which never came  the long long days of heat dragged slowly with little to cheer those families separated from their dear ones by a great army clarence might die and a monthperhaps a yearpass without news unless he were brought a prisoner to st louis how virginia envied maude because the union lists of dead and wounded would give her tidings of her brother tom at least how she coveted the many union families whose sons and brothers were at the front this privilege  we were speaking of the french revolution when as balzac remarked to be a spy was to be a patriot heads are not so cheap in our anglosaxon countries passions not so fierce and uncontrollable compare with a prominent historian our boston massacre and st bartholomew  they are both massacres compare camp jackson or baltimore where a few people were shot with some paris street scenes after the bastille feelings in each instance never ran higher our own provost marshal was hissed in the street and called robespierre and yet he did not fear the assassins knife our own southern aristocrats were hemmed in in a union city their own city no women were thrown into prison it is true yet one was not permitted to shout for jeff davis on the street corner before the provosts guard once in a while a detachment of the home guards commanded by a lieutenant would march swiftly into a street and stop before a house whose occupants would run to the rear only to encounter another detachment in the alley  one day in great excitement eugenie renault rang the bell of the carvel house and ran past the astounded jackson up the stairs to virginias room the door of which she burst open  oh jinny she cried puss russells house is surrounded by yankees and puss and emily and all the family are prisoners  prisoners what for said virginia dropping in her excitement her last years bonnet which she was trimming with red white and red  because said eugenie sputtering with indignation because they waved at some of our poor fellows who were being taken to the slave pen they were being marched past mr russells house under guardpuss had a small  confederate flag put in virginia smiling in spite of herself  and she waved it between the shutters eugenie continued and some one told the provost marshal he has had the house surrounded and the family have to stay there  but if the food gives out  then said miss renault in a voice of awe then each one of the family is to have just a common army ration they are to be treated as prisoners  oh those yankees are detestable exclaimed virginia but they shall pay for it as soon as our army is organized and equipped they shall pay for it ten times over she tried on the bonnet conspicuous with its red and white ribbons before the glass then she ran to the closet and drew forth the white gown with its red trimmings wait for me genie she said and well go down to pusss house together it may cheer her to see us  but not in that dress said eugenie aghast they will arrest you oh how i wish they would cried virginia and her eyes flashed so that eugenie was frightened how i wish they would  miss renault regarded her friend with something of adoration from beneath her black lashes it was about five in the afternoon when they started out together under virginias white parasol eugenies slimmer courage upheld by her friends bearing we must remember that virginia was young and that her feelings were akin to those our greatgrandmothers experienced when the british held new york it was as if she had been born to wear the red and white of the south elderly gentlemen of northern persuasion paused in their homeward walk to smile in admirationsome sadly as mr brinsmade young gentlemen found an excuse to retrace their steps a block or two but virginia walked on air and saw nothing she was between fierce anger and exaltation she did not deign to drop her eyes as low as the citizen sergeant and guard in front of puss russells house these men were only human after all she did not so much as glance at the curious people standing on the corner who could not resist a murmur of delight the citizen sergeant only smiled and made no move to arrest the young lady in red and white nor did puss fling open the blinds and wave at her  i suppose its because mr russell wont let her said virginia disconsolately genie lets go to headquarters and show this yankee general fremont that we are not afraid of him  eugenies breath was taken away by the very boldness of this proposition she looked up timidly into virginias face and heroworship got the better of prudence  the house which general fremont appropriated for his use when he came back from europe to assume command in the west was not a modest one it still stands a large mansion of brick with a stone front very tall and very wide with an elaborate cornice and plateglass windows both tall and broad and a high basement two stately stone porches capped by elaborate iron railings adorn it in front and on the side the chimneys are generous and proportional in short the house is of that type built by many wealthy gentlemen in the middle of the century which has best stood the test of timethe only type which if repeated today would not clash with the architectural education which we are receiving a spacious yard well above the pavement surrounds it sustained by a wall of dressed stones capped by an iron fence the whole expressed wealth security solidity conservatism alas that the coal deposits under the black mud of our western states should at length have driven the owners of these houses out of them they are now blackened almost buried in soot empty or halftenanted by boarders descendants of the old families pass them on their way to business or to the theatre with a sigh the sons of those who owned them have built westward and westward again until now they are six miles from the river  on that summer evening forty years ago when virginia and eugenie came in sight of the house a scene of great animation was before them talk was rife over the commanding generals pomp and circumstance he had just returned from europe where pomp and circumstance and the military were wedded foreign officers should come to america to teach our army dress and manners a dashing hungarian commanded the generals bodyguard which honorable corps was even then drawn up in the street before the house surrounded at a respectable distance by a crowd that feared to jest they felt like it save when they caught the stern military eye of the hungarian captain virginia gazed at the glittering uniforms resplendent in the sun and at the sleek and wellfed horses and scalding tears came as she thought of the halfstarved rabble of southern patriots on the burning prairies just then a sharp command escaped in broken english from the hungarian the people in the yard of the mansion parted and the general himself walked proudly out of the gate to the curb where his charger was pawing the gutter as he put foot to the stirrup the eye of the great man once candidate and again to be for president caught the glint of red and white on the corner for an instant he stood transfixed to the spot with one leg in the air then he took it down again and spoke to a young officer of his staff who smiled and began to walk toward them little eugenies knees trembled she seized virginias arm and whispered in agony  oh jinny you are to be arrested after all oh i wish you hadnt been so bold  hush said virginia as she prepared to slay the young officer with a look she felt like flying at his throat and choking him for the insolence of that smile how dare he march undaunted to within six paces of those eyes the crowd drew back but did miss carvel retreat not a step oh i hope he will arrest me she said passionately to eugenie he will start a conflagration beyond the power of any yankee to quell  but hush he was speaking you are my prisoners no those were not the words surely the lieutenant had taken off his cap he bowed very low and said  ladies the generals compliments and he begs that this much of the sidewalk may be kept clear for a few moments  what was left for them after that save a retreat but he was not precipitate miss virginia crossed the street with a dignity and bearing which drew even the eyes of the bodyguard to one side and there she stood haughtily until the guard and the general had thundered away a crowd of blackcoated civilians and quartermasters and other officers in uniform poured out of the basement of the house into the yards one civilian a youngish man a little inclined to stoutness stopped at the gate stared then thrust some papers in his pocket and hurried down the side street three blocks thence he appeared abreast of miss carvel more remarkable still he lifted his hat clear of his head virginia drew back mr hopper with his newly acquired equanimity and poise startled her  may i have the pleasure said that gentleman of accompanying you home  eugenie giggled virginia was more annoyed than she showed  you must not come out of your way she said then she added i am sure you must go back to the store it is only six oclock  had virginia but known this occasional tartness in her speech gave eliphalet an infinite delight even while it hurt him his was a nature which liked to gloat over a goal on the horizon he cared not a whit for sweet girls they cloyed but a real lady was something to attain he had revised his vocabulary for just such an occasion and thrown out some of the vernacular  business is not so pressing nowadays miss carvel he answered with a shade of meaning  then existence must be rather heavy for you she said she made no attempt to introduce him to eugenie if we should have any more victories like bull run prosperity will come back with a rush said the son of massachusetts southern confederacy with missouri one of its stars an industrial development of the southfortunes in cotton  virginia turned quickly oh how dare you she cried how dare you speak flippantly of such things his suavity was far from overthrown  flippantly miss carvel said he i assure you that i want to see the south win what he did not know was that words seldom convince women but he added something which reduced her incredulity for the time do you callate said hethat i could work for your father and wish ruin to his country  but you are a yankee born she exclaimed  there be a few sane yankees replied mr hopper dryly a remark which made eugenie laugh outright and virginia could not refrain from a smile  but much against her will he walked home with her she was indignant by the time she reached locust street he had never dared do such a thing before what had got into the man was it because he had become a manager and governed the business during her fathers frequent absences no matter what mr hoppers politics he would always be to her a lowborn yankee a person wholly unworthy of notice  at the corner of olive street a young man walking with long strides almost bumped into them he paused looked back and bowed as if uncertain of an acknowledgment virginia barely returned his bow he had been very close to her and she had had time to notice that his coat was threadbare when she looked again he had covered half the block why should she care if stephen brice had seen her in company with mr hopper eliphalet too had seen stephen and this had added zest to his enjoyment it was part of the fruits of his reward he wished in that short walk that he might meet mr cluyme and belle and every man and woman and child in the city whom he knew from time to time he glanced at the severe profile of the aristocrat beside him he had to look up a bit likewise and that look set him down among the beasts of prey for she was his rightful prey and he meant not to lose one tittle of enjoyment in the progress of the game many and many a night in the bare little back room at miss cranes eliphalet had gloated over the very event which was now come to pass not a step of the way but what he had lived through before  the future is laid open to such men as he since he had first seen the black cloud of war rolling up from the south a hundred times had he rehearsed the scene with colonel carvel which had actually taken place a week before a hundred times had he prepared his speech and manner for this first appearance in public with virginia after he had forced the right to walk in her company the words he had preparedcommonplace to be sure but carefully chosenflowed from his lips in a continual nasal stream the girl answered absently her feminine instinct groping after a reason for it all she brightened when she saw her father at the doors and saying good by to eugenie tripped up the steps bowing to eliphalet coldly  why bless us jinny said the colonel you havent been parading the town in that costume youll have us in lynchs slave pen by tomorrow night my land laughed he patting her under the chin theres no doubt about your sentiments anyhow  ive been over to puss russells house said she breathless theyve closed it up you know he nodded and then we wenteugenie and i to headquarters just to see what the yankees would do  the colonels smile faded he looked grave you must take care honey he said lowering his voice they suspect me now of communicating with the governor and mcculloch jinny its all very well to be brave and to stand by your colors but this sort of thing said he stroking the gown this sort of thing doesnt help the south my dear and only sets spies upon us ned tells me that there was a man in plain clothes standing in the alley last night for three hours  pa cried the girl im so sorry suddenly searching his face with a swift instinct she perceived that these months had made it yellow and lined pa dear you must come to glencoe tomorrow and rest you must not go off on any more trips  the colonel shook his head sadly  it isnt the trips jinny there are duties my dear pleasant dutiesjinny  yes  the colonels eye had suddenly fallen on mr hopper who was still standing at the bottom of the steps he checked himself abruptly as eliphalet pulled off his hat  howdy colonel he said  virginia was motionless with her back to the intruder she was frozen by a presentiment as she saw her father start down the steps she yearned to throw herself in front of himto warn him of something she knew not what then she heard the colonels voice courteous and kindly as ever and yet it broke a little as he greeted his visitor  wontwont you come in mr hopper  virginia started  i dont know but what i will thank you colonel he answered easily i took the liberty of walking home with your daughter  virginia fairly flew into the house and up the stairs gaining her room she shut the door and turned the key as though he might pursue her there the mans face had all at once become a terror she threw herself on the lounge and buried her face in her hands and she saw it still leering at her with a new confidence presently she grew calmer rising she put on the plainest of her scanty wardrobe and went down the stairs all in a strange trepidation new to her she had never been in fear of a man before she hearkened over the banisters for his voice heard it and summoned all her courage how cowardly she had been to leave her father alone with him  eliphalet stayed to tea it mattered little to him that mrs colfax ignored him as completely as if his chair had been vacant he glanced at that lady once and smiled for he was tasting the sweets of victory it was virginia who entertained him and even the colonel never guessed what it cost her eliphalet himself marvelled at her change of manner and gloated over that likewise not a turn or a quiver of the victims pain is missed by your beast of prey the colonel was gravely polite but preoccupied had he wished it he could not have been rude to a guest he offered mr hopper a cigar with the same air that he would have given it to a governor  thankee colonel i dont smoke he said waving the bog away  mrs colfax flung herself out of the room  it was ten oclock when eliphalet reached miss cranes and picked his way up the front steps where the boarders were gathered  the war doesnt seem to make any difference in your business mr hopper his landlady remarked where have you been so late  i happened round at colonel carvels this afternoon and stayed for tea with em he answered striving to speak casually  miss crane lingered in mrs abner reeds room later than usual that night     chapter iii the scourge of war  virginia said mrs colfax the next morning on coming downstairs i am going back to bellegarde today i really cannot put up with such a person as comyn had here to tea last night  very well aunt lillian at what time shall i order the carriage  the lady was surprised it is safe to say that she had never accurately gauged the force which virginias respect for her elders and affection for her aunt through clarence held in check only a moment since mrs colfax had beheld her niece now there had arisen in front of her a tall person of authority before whom she deferred instinctively it was not what virginia said for she would not stoop to tirade mrs colfax sank into a chair seeing only the blurred lines of a newspaper the girl had thrust into her hand  whatwhat is it she gasped i cannot read  there has been a battle at wilsons creek said virginia in an emotionless voice general lyon is killed for which i suppose we should be thankful more than seven hundred of the wounded are on their way here they are bringing them one hundred and twenty miles from springfield to rollo in rough army wagons with scarcely anything to eat or drink  andclarence  his name is not there  thank god exclaimed mrs colfax are the yankees beaten  yes said virginia coldly at what time shall i order the carriage to take you to bellegarde  mrs colfax leaned forward and caught the hem of her nieces gown oh let me stay she cried let me stay clarence may be with them  virginia looked down at her without pity  as you please aunt lillian she answered you know that you may always stay here i only beg of you one thing that when you have anything to complain of you will bring it to me and not mention it before pa he has enough to worry him  oh jinny sobbed the lady in tears again how can you be so cruel at such a time when my nerves are all in pieces  but she did not lift her voice at dinner which was very poor indeed for colonel carvels house all day long virginia assisted by uncle ben and aunt easter toiled in the stifling kitchen preparing dainties which she had long denied herself at evening she went to the station at fourteenth street with her father and stood amongst the people pressed back by the soldiers until the trains came in alas the heavy basket which the colonel carried on his arm was brought home again the first hundred to arrive ten hours in a hot car without food or water were laid groaning on the bottom of great furniture vans and carted to the new house of refuge hospital two miles to the south of the city  the next day many good women went there rebel and union alike to have their hearts wrung the new and cheap building standing in the hot sun reeked with white wash and paint the miserable men lay on the hard floor still in the matted clothes they had worn in battle those were the first days of the war when the wages of our passions first came to appal us many of the wounds had not been tended since they were dressed on the field weeks before  mrs colfax went too with the colonel and her niece although she declared repeatedly that she could not go through with such an ordeal she spoke the truth for mr carvel had to assist her to the waitingroom then he went back to the improvised wards to find virginia busy over a gaunt arkansan of prices army whose pitiful feverglazed eyes were following her every motion his frontiersmans clothes stained with blackened blood hung limp over his wasted body at virginias bidding the colonel ran downstairs for a bucket of fresh water and she washed the caked dust from his face and hands it was mr brinsmade who got the surgeon to dress the mans wound and to prescribe some of the broth from virginias basket for the first time since the war began something of happiness entered her breast  it was mr brinsmade who was everywhere that day answering the questions of distracted mothers and fathers and sisters who thronged the place consulting with the surgeons helping the few who knew how to work in placing mattresses under the worst cases or again he might have been seen seated on the bare floor with a pad on his knee taking down the names of dear ones in distant statesthat he might spend his night writing to them  they put a mattress under the arkansan virginia did not leave him until he had fallen asleep and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken face dismayed at the fearful sights about her awed by the groans that rose on every side she was choosing her way swiftly down the room to join her father and aunt in the carriage below  the panic of flight had seized her she felt that another little while in this heated horrible place would drive her mad she was almost at the door when she came suddenly upon a sight that made her pause  an elderly lady in widows black was kneeling beside a man groaning in mortal agony fanning away the flies already gathering about his face he wore the uniform of a union sergeantdusty and splotched and torn a small testament was clasped convulsively in the fingers of his right band the left sleeve was empty virginia lingered whelmed in pity thrilled by a wonderful womanliness of her who knelt there her face the girl had not even seen for it was bent over the man the sweetness of her voice held virginia as in a spell and the sergeant stopped groaning that he might listen  you have a wife  yes maam  and a child  the answer came so painfully  a boy maamborn the weekbefore i cameaway  i shall write to your wife said the lady so gently that virginia could scarce hear and tell her that you are cared for where does she live  he gave the address faintlysome little town in minnesota then he added god bless you lady  just then the chief surgeon came and stood over them the lady turned her face up to him and tears sparkled in her eyes virginia felt them wet in her own her worship was not given to many nobility character efficiencyall were written on that face nobility spoke in the large features in the generous mouth in the calm gray eyes virginia had seen her often before but not until now was the woman revealed to her  doctor could this mans life be saved if i took him to my home  the surgeon got down beside her and took the mans pulse the eyes closed for a while the doctor knelt there shaking his head he has fainted he said  do you think he can be saved asked the lady again the surgeon smiledsuch a smile as a good man gives after eighteen hours of amputating of bandaging of advisingwork which requires a firm hand a clear eye and brain and a good heart  my dear mrs brice he said i shall be glad to get you permission to take him but we must first make him worth the taking another hour would have been too late he glanced hurriedly about the busy room and then added we must have one more to help us  just then some one touched virginias arm it was her father  i am afraid we must go dear he said your aunt is getting impatient  wont you please go without me pa she asked perhaps i can be of some use  the colonel cast a wondering glance at the limp uniform and went away the surgeon who knew the carvel family gave virginia a look of astonishment it was mrs brices searching gaze that brought the color to the girls face  thank you my dear she said simply  as soon as he could get his sisterinlaw off to locust street in the carriage colonel carvel came back for two reeking hours he stood against the newly plastered wall even he was surprised at the fortitude and skill virginia showed from the very first when she had deftly cut away the stiffened blue cloth and helped to take off the rough bandages at length the fearful operation was finished and the weary surgeon gathering up his box expressed with all the energy left to him his thanks to the two ladies  virginia stood up faint and dizzy the work of her hands had sustained her while it lasted but now the ordeal was come she went down the stairs on her fathers arm and out into the air all at once she knew that mrs brice was beside her and had taken her by the hand  my dear she was saying god will reward you for this act you have taught many of us today a lesson we should have learned in our bibles  virginia trembled with many emotions but she answered nothing the mere presence of this woman had a strange effect upon the girlshe was filled with a longing unutterable it was not because margaret brice was the mother of him whose life had been so strangely blended with herswhom she saw in her dreams and yet now some of stephens traits seemed to come to her understanding as by a revelation virginia had labored through the heat of the day by margaret brices side doing his work which levels all feuds and makes all women sisters one brief second had been needful for the spell  the colonel bowed with that courtesy and respect which distinguished him and mrs brice left them to go back into the room of torment and watch by the sergeants pallet virginias eyes followed her up the stairs and then she and her father walked slowly to the carriage with her foot on the step virginia paused  pa she said do you think it would be possible to get them to let us take that arkansan into our house  why honey ill ask brinsmade if you like said the colonel here he comes now and anne  it was virginia who put the question to him  my dear replied that gentleman patting her i would do anything in the world for you ill see general fremont this very afternoon virginia he added soberly it is such acts as yours today that give us courage to live in these times  anne kissed her friend  oh jinny i saw what you were doing for one of our men what am i saying she cried they are your men too this horrible war cannot last it cannot last it was well that virginia did not see the smile on the face of the commanding general when mr brinsmade at length got to him with her request this was before the days when the wounded arrived by the thousands when the zeal of the southern ladies threatened to throw out of gear the workings of a great system but the general had had his eye on mr carvel from the first therefore he smiled  colonel carvel said mr brinsmade with dignity is a gentleman when he gives his word it is sacred sir  even to an enemy the general put in by george brinsmade unless i knew you i should think that you were half rebel yourself well well he may have his arkansan  mr brinsmade when he conveyed the news to the carvel house did not say that he had wasted a precious afternoon in the attempt to interview his excellency the commander inchief it was like obtaining an audience with the sultan or the czar citizens who had been prominent in affairs for twenty years philanthropists and patrioticspirited men like mr brinsmade the mayor and all the exmayors mopped their brows in one of the generals anterooms of the big mansion and wrangled with beardless youths in bright uniforms who were part of the chain the general might have been a richelieu a marlborough his european notions of uniformed inaccessibility he carried out to the letter he was a royal personage seldom seen who went abroad in the midst of a glittering guard it did not seem to weigh with his excellency that these simple and democratic gentlemen would not put up with this sort of thing that they who had saved the city to the union were more or less in communication with a simple and democratic president that in all their lives they had never been in the habit of sitting idly for two hours to mop their brows  on the other hand once you got beyond the gold lace and the etiquette you discovered a good man and a patriot it was far from being the generals fault that mr hopper and others made money in mules and worthless army blankets such things always have been and always will be unavoidable when this great country of ours rises from the deep sleep of security into which her sons have lulled her to demand her sword we shall never be able to realize that the maintenance of a standing army of comfortable size will save millions in the end so much for democracy when it becomes a catchword  the general was a good man had he done nothing else than encourage the western sanitary commission that glorious army of drilled men and women who gave up all to relieve the suffering which the war was causing would that a novela great novelmight be written setting forth with truth its doings the hero of it could be calvin brinsmade and a nobler hero than he was never under a mans hand for the glory of generals fades beside his glory  it was mr brinsmades carriage that brought mrs brice home from her trying day in the hospital stephen just returned from drill at verandah hall met her at the door she would not listen to his entreaties to rest but in the evening as usual took her sewing to the porch behind the house where there was a little breeze  such a singular thing happened today stephen she said it was while we were trying to save the life of a poor sergeant who had lost his arm i hope we shall be allowed to have him here he is suffering horribly  what happened mother he asked  it was soon after i had come upon this poor fellow she said i saw thethe flies around him and as i got down beside him to fan them away i had such a queer sensation i knew that some one was standing behind me looking at me then dr allerdyce came and i asked him about the man and he said there was a chance of saving him if we could only get help then some one spoke upsuch a sweet voice it was that miss carvel my dear with whom you had such a strange experience when you bought hester and to whose party you once went do you remember that they offered us their house in glencoe when the judge was so ill  yes said stephen  she is a wonderful creature his mother continued such personality such life and wasnt it a remarkable offer for a southern woman to make they feel so bitterly andand i do not blame them the good lady put down on her lap the nightshirt she was making i saw how it happened the girl was carried away by her pity and my dear her capability astonished me one might have thought that she had always been a nurse the experience was a dreadful one for mewhat must it have been for her after the operation was over i followed her downstairs to where she was standing with her father in front of the building waiting for their carriage i felt that i must say something to her for in all my life i have never seen a nobler thing done when i saw her there i scarcely knew what to say words seemed so inadequate it was then three oclock and she had been working steadily in that place since morning i am sure she could not have borne it much longer sheer courage carried her through it i know for her hand trembled so when i took it and she was very pale she usually has color i believe her father the colonel was with her and he bowed to me with such politeness he had stood against the wall all the while we had worked and he brought a mattress for us i have heard that his house is watched and that they have him under suspicion for communicating with the confederate leaders mrs brice sighed he seems such a fine character i hope they will not get into any trouble  i hope not mother said stephen  it was two mornings later that judge whipple and stephen drove to the iron mountain depot where they found a german company of home guards drawn up on the long wooden platform under the sheds stephen caught sight of herr korner and herr hauptmann amid a group of their countrymen little korner came forward to clasp his hands the tears ran on his cheeks and he could not speak for emotion judge whipple grim and silent stood apart but he uncovered his head with the others when the train rolled in reverently they entered a car where the pine boxes were piled one on another and they bore out the earthly remains of captain carl richter  far from the land of his birth among those same oaks on bloody hill where brave lyon fell he had gladly given up his life for the new country and the new cause he had made his own  that afternoon in the cemetery as the smoke of the last salute to a hero hung in the flickering light and drifted upward through the great trees as the still air was yet quivering with the notes of the buglecall which is the soldiers requiem a tall figure gaunt and bent stepped out from behind the blue line of the troops it was that of judge whipple he carried in his hand a wreath of white rosesthe first of many to be laid on richters grave  poor richter how sad his life had been and yet he had not filled it with sadness for many a month and many a year stephen could not look upon his empty place without a pang he missed the cheery songs and the earnest presence even more than he had thought carl richteras his father before himhad lived for others both had sacrificed their bodies for a cause one of them might be pictured as he trudged with father jahn from door to door through the rhine country or shouldering at sixteen a heavy musket in the landwehrs ranks to drive the tyrant napoleon from the beloved fatherland later aged before his time his wife dead of misery decrepit and prisonworn in the service of a thankless country his hopes lived again in carl the swordsman of jena then came the pitiful revolution the sundering of all ties the elder man left to drag out his few weary days before a shattered altar in carl a new aspiration had sprung up a new patriotism stirred his too had been the sacrifice happy in death for he had helped perpetuate that great union which should be for all time the refuge of the oppressed     chapter iv the list of sixty  one chilling day in november when an icy rain was falling on the black mud of the streets virginia looked out of the window her eye was caught by two horses which were just skeletons with the skin stretched over them one had a bad sore on his flank and was lame they were pulling a rattletrap farm wagon with a buckled wheel on the seat a man pallid and bent and scantily clad was holding the reins in his feeble hands while beside him cowered a child of ten wrapped in a ragged blanket in the body of the wagon lying on a mattress pressed down in the midst of broken cheap furniture and filthy kitchen ware lay a gaunt woman in the rain her eyes were closed and a hump on the surface of the dirty quilt beside her showed that a child must be there from such a picture the girl fled in tears but the sight of it and of others like it haunted her for weeks through those last dreary days of november wretched families which a year since had been in health and prosperity came to the city beggars with the wrecks of their homes the history of that hideous pilgrimage across a state has never been written still they came by the hundred those families some brought little corpses to be buried the father of one hale and strong when they started died of pneumonia in the public lodginghouse the walls of that house could tell many tales to wring the heart so could mr brinsmade did he choose to speak of his own charities he found time between his labors at the big hospital newly founded and his correspondence and his journeys of lovebetween early morning and midnightto give some hours a day to the refugees  throughout december they poured in on the afflicted city already overtaxed all the way to springfield the road was lined with remains of articles once deara childs doll a little rockingchair a colored print that has hung in the best room a bible text  anne brinsmade driven by nicodemus went from house to house to solicit old clothes and take them to the crowded place of detention christmas was drawing neara sorry christmas in truth and many of the wanderers were unclothed and unfed  more battles had been fought factions had arisen among union men another general had come to st louis to take charge of the department and the other with his wondrous bodyguard was gone  the most serious problem confronting the new generalwas how to care for the refugees a council of citizens was called at headquarters and the verdict went forth in the nevertobeforgotten orders no 24  inasmuch said the general as the secession army had driven these people from their homes secession sympathizers should be made to support them he added that the city was unquestionably full of these  indignation was rife the day that order was published sixty prominent disloyalists were to be chosen and assessed to make up a sum of ten thousand dollars  they may sell my house over my head before i will pay a cent cried mr russell and he meant it this was the way the others felt who were to be on this mysterious list of sixty that was the allabsorbing question of the town it was an easy matter to pick the conspicuous ones colonel carvel was sure to be there and mr catherwood and mr russell and mr james and mr worington the lawyer mrs addison colfax lived for days in a fermented state of excitement which she declared would break her down and which despite her many cares and worries gave her niece not a little amusement for virginia was human and one morning she went to her aunts room to read this editorial from the newspaper for the relief of many palpitating hearts it may be well to state that we understand only two ladies are on the ten thousand dollar list  jinny she cried how can you be so cruel as to read me that when you know that i am in a state of frenzy now how does that relieve me it makes it an absolute certainty that madame jules and i will have to pay we are the only women of importance in the city  that afternoon she made good her muchuttered threat and drove to bellegarde only the colonel and virginia and mammy easter and ned were left in the big house rosetta and uncle ben and jackson had been hired out and the horses soldall save old dick who was running longhaired in the fields at glencoe  christmas eve was a steelgray day and the sleet froze as it fell since morning colonel carvel had sat poking the sittingroom fire or pacing the floor restlessly his occupation was gone he was observed night and day by federal detectives virginia strove to amuse him to conceal her anxiety as she watched him well she knew that but for her he would long since have fled southward and often in the bitterness of the nighttime she blamed herself for not telling him to go ten years had seemed to pass over him since the war had begun  all day long she had been striving to put away from her the memory of christmas eves past and gone of her fathers early homecoming from the store a mysterious smile on his face of captain lige stamping noisily into the house exchanging uproarious jests with ned and jackson the captain had always carried under his arm a shapeless bundle which he would confide to ned with a knowing wink and then the house would be lighted from top to bottom and mr russell and mr catherwood and mr brinsmade came in for a long evening with mr carvel over great bowls of apple toddy and eggnog and virginia would have her own friends in the big parlor that parlor was shut up now and icy cold  then there was judge whipple the joyous event of whose year was his christmas dinner at colonel carvels house virginia pictured him this year at mrs brices little table and wondered whether he would miss them as much as they missed him war may break friendships but it cannot take away the sacredness of memories  the sombre daylight was drawing to an early close as the two stood looking out of the sittingroom window a mans figure muffled in a greatcoat slanting carefully across the street caught their eyes virginia started it was the same united states deputy marshal she had seen the day before at mr russells house  pa she cried do you think he is coming here  i reckon so honey  the brute are you going to pay  no jinny  then they will take away the furniture  i reckon they will  pa you must promise me to take down the mahogany bed in your room itit was mothers i could not bear to see them take that let me put it in the garret  the colonel was distressed but he spoke without a tremor  no jinny we must leave this house just as it is then he added strangely enough for him gods will be done  the bell rang sharply and ned who was cook and housemaid came in with his apron on  does you want to see folks marse comyn  the colonel rose and went to the door himself he was an imposing figure as he stood in the windy vestibule confronting the deputy virginias first impulse was to shrink under the stairs then she came out and stood beside her father  are you colonel carvel  i reckon i am will you come in  the officer took off his cap he was a young man with a smooth face and a frank brown eye which paid its tribute to virginia he did not appear to relish the duty thrust upon him he fumbled in his coat and drew from his inner pocket a paper  colonel carvel said he by order of major general halleck i serve you with this notice to pay the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars for the benefit of the destitute families which the rebels have driven from their homes in default of payment within a reasonable time such personal articles will be seized and sold at public auction as will satisfy the demand against you  the colonel took the paper very well sir he said you may tell the general that the articles may be seized that i will not while in my right mind be forced to support persons who have no claim upon me  it was said in the tone in which he might have refused an invitation to dinner the deputy marvelled he had gone into many houses that week had seen indignation hysterics frenzy he had even heard men and women whose sons and brothers were in the army of secession proclaim their loyalty to the union but this dignity and the quiet scorn of the girl who had stood silent beside them were new he bowed and casting his eyes to the vestibule was glad to escape from the house  the colonel shut the door then he turned toward virginia thoughtfully pulled his goatee and laughed gently lordy we havent got three hundred and fifty dollars to our names said he  the climate of st louis is capricious that fierce valley of the missouri which belches fitful blizzards from december to march is sometimes quiet then the hot winds come up from the gulf and sleet melts and windows are opened in those days the streets will be fetlock deep in soft mud it is neither summer nor winter nor spring nor anything  it was such a languorous afternoon in january that a furniture van accompanied by certain nondescript persons known as united states police pulled up at the curb in front of mr carvels house eugenie watching at the window across the street ran to tell her father who came out on his steps and reviled the van with all the fluency of his french ancestors  mammy easter opened the door and then stood with her arms akimbo amply filling its place her lips protruded and an expression of defiance hard to describe sat on her honest black face  is this colonel carvels house  yassir i low you knows dat jes as well as me an embarrassed silence and then from mammy whaffor you laffin at  is the colonel at home  now i reckon you knows dat he aint ef he was you aint come here quirin in dat honey voice raising her own voice you tink i dunno whaffor you come you done come heah to rifle an to loot an to steal an to seize what aint yourn you come heah when young marse aint to home ter rob him still louder ned whaffor you hidin yonder ef yo aint man to protect marse comyns propty jes han over marse comyns gun  the marshal and his men had stood half amused more than half baffled by this unexpected resistance mammy easter looked so dangerous that it was evident she was not to be passed without extreme bodily discomfort  is your mistress here  this question was unfortunate in the extreme  youyou white trash cried mammy bursting with indignation who is you to come heah quiring fo her i aint agwine  mammy  yasm yas miss jinny mammy backed out of the door and clutched at her bandanna  mammy what is all this noise about the torrent was loosed once more  these heah men miss jinny was gwine fr t carry away all yo pas blongins i jes tol em dey aint comin in ovah dis heah body  the deputy had his foot on the threshold he caught sight of the face of miss carvel within and stopped abruptly  i have a warrant here from the provost marshal maam to seize personal property to satisfy a claim against colonel carvel  virginia took the order read it and handed it back i do not see how i am to prevent you she said the deputy was plainly abashed  im sorry miss ii cant tell you how sorry i am but its got to be done  virginia nodded coldly and still the man hesitated what are you waiting for she said  the deputy wiped his muddy feet he made his men do likewise then he entered the chill drawingroom threw open the blinds and glanced around him  i expect all that we want is right here he said and at the sight of the great chandelier with its cutglass crystals he whistled then he walked over to the big english rothfield piano and lifted the lid  the man was a musician involuntarily he rested himself on the mahogany stool and ran his fingers over the keys they seemed to virginia standing motionless in the ball to give out the very chords of agony  the piano too had been her mothers it had once stood in the brick house of her grandfather colfax at halcyondale the songs of beatrice lay on the bottom shelf of the whatnot near by no more of an evening when they were alone would virginia quietly take them out and play them over to the colonel as he sat dreaming in the window with his cigardreaming of a field on the borders of a wood of a young girl who held his hand and sang them softly to herself as she walked by his side and when they reached the house in the october twilight she had played them for him on this piano often he had told virginia of those days and walked with her over those paths  the deputy closed the lid and sent out to the van for a truck virginia stirred for the first time she heard the words of mammy easter  come along upstairs wid yo mammy honey dis aint no place for us i reckon her words were the essence of endearment and yet while she pronounced them she glared unceasingly at the intruders oh de good lawdll burn de wicked  the men were removing the carved legs virginia went back into the room and stood before the deputy  isnt there something else you could take some jewellery she flushed i have a necklace  no miss this warrants on your father and there aint nothing quite so salable as pianos  she watched them dryeyed as they carried it away it seemed like a coffin only mammy easter guessed at the pain in virginias breast and that was because there was a pain in her own they took the rosewood whatnot but virginia snatched the songs before the men could touch them and held them in her arms they seized the mahogany velvetbottomed chairs her uncles wedding present to her mother and last of all they ruthlessly tore up the brussels carpet beginning near the spot where clarence had spilled icecream at one of her childrens parties  she could not bear to look into the dismantled room when they had gone it was the embodied wreck of her happiness ned closed the blinds once more and she herself turned the key in the lock and went slowly up the stairs     chapter v the auction  stephen said the judge in his abrupt way there isnt a great deal doing lets go over to the secesh property sales  stephen looked up in surprise the seizures and intended sale of secession property had stirred up immense bitterness and indignation in the city there were unionists lukewarm who denounced the measure as unjust and brutal the feelings of southerners avowed and secret may only be surmised rigid ostracism was to be the price of bidding on any goods displayed and men who bought in handsome furniture on that day because it was cheap have still after forty years cause to remember it  it was not that stephen feared ostracism anne brinsmade was almost the only girl left to him from among his former circle of acquaintances miss carvels conduct is known the misses russell showed him very plainly that they disapproved of his politics the hospitable days at that house were over miss catherwood when they met on the street pretended not to see him and eugenie renault gave him but a timid nod the loyal families to whose houses he now went were mostly southerners in sentiment against forced auctions  however he put on his coat and sallied forth into the sharp air the judge leaning on his arm they walked for some distance in silence  stephen said he presently i guess ill do a little bidding  stephen did not reply but he was astonished he wondered what mr whipple wanted with fine furniture and if he really wished to bid stephen knew likewise that no consideration would stop him  you dont approve of this proceeding sir i suppose said the judge  yes sir on large grounds war makes many harsh things necessary  then said the judge tartly by bidding we help to support starving union families you should not be afraid to bid sir  stephen bit his lip sometimes mr whipple made him very angry  i am not afraid to bid judge whipple he did not see the smile on the judges face  then you will bid in certain things for me said mr whipple here he hesitated and shook free the rest of the sentence with a wrench colonel carvel always had a lot of stuff i wanted now ive got the chance to buy it cheap  there was silence again for the space of a whole block finally stephen managed to say youll have to excuse me sir i do not care to do that  what cried the judge stopping in the middle of a crossstreet so that a wagon nearly ran over his toes  i was once a guest in colonel carvels house sir and  and what  neither the young man nor the old knew all it was costing the other to say these things the judge took a grim pleasure in eating his heart and as for stephen he often went to his office through locust street which was out of his way in the hope that he might catch a glimpse of virginia he had guessed much of the privations she had gone through he knew that the colonel had hired out most of his slaves and he had actually seen the united states police drive across eleventh street with the piano that she had played on  the judge was laughing quietlynot a pleasant laugh to hearas they came to morgans great warerooms a crowd blocked the pavement and hustled and shoved at the doorsroughs and soldiers off duty and ladies and gentlemen whom the judge and stephen knew and some of whom they spoke to all of these were come out of curiosity that they might see for themselves any who had the temerity to bid on a neighbors household goods the long hall which ran from street to street was packed the people surging backward and forward and falling roughly against the mahogany pieces and apologizing and scolding and swearing all in a breath the judge holding tightly to stephen pushed his way fiercely to the stand vowing over and over that the commotion was a secession trick to spoil the furniture and stampede the sale in truth it was at the judges suggestion that a blue provosts guard was called in later to protect the seized property  how many of those mahogany pieces so ruthlessly tumbled about before the public eye meant a heartache wedding presents of long ago dear to many a bride with silvered hair had been torn from the corner where the children had playedchildren who now alas were grown and gone to war yes that was the brussels rug that had lain before the fire and which the little feet had worn in the corner those were the chairs the little hands had harnessed four in a row and fallen on its side was the armchairthe stage coach itself there were the books held up to common gaze that a beloved parent had thumbed with affection yes and here in another part of the hall were the family horses and the family carriage that had gone so often back and forth from church with the happy brood of children now scattered and gone to war  as stephen reached his place beside the judge mr jamess effects were being cried and if glances could have killed many a bidder would have dropped dead the heavy diningroom table which meant so much to the family went for a song to a young man recently come from yankeeland whose open boast it waslike eliphalets secret onethat he would one day grow rich enough to snap his fingers in the face of the southern aristocrats mr james was not there but mr catherwood his face haggard and drawn watched the sideboard he had given his wife on her silver wedding being sold to a pawnbroker  stephen looked in vain for colonel carvelfor virginia he did not want to see them there he knew by heart the list of things which had been taken from their house he understood the feeling which had sent the judge here to bid them in and stephen honored him the more  when the auctioneer came to the carvel list and the wellknown name was shouted out the crowd responded with a stir and pressed closer to the stand and murmurs were plainly heard in more than one direction  now gentlemen and ladies said the seller this here is a genuine english rothfield piano once belonging to colonel carvel and the celebrated judge colfax of kaintucky he lingered fondly over the names that the impression might have time to sink deep this here magnificent instruments worth at the very least another pause twelve hundred dollars what am i bid  he struck a base note of the keys then a treble and they vibrated in the heated air of the big hall had he hit the little c of the top octave the tinkle of that also might have been heard  gentlemen and ladies we have to begin somewheres what am i bid  a menacing murmur gave place to the accusing silence some there were who gazed at the rothfield with longing eyes but who had no intention of committing social suicide suddenly a voice the rasp of which penetrated to st charles street came out with a bid the owner was a seedy man with a strawcolored drunkards mustache he was leaning against the body of mrs russells barouche seized for sale and those about him shrank away as from smallpox his hundreddollar offer was followed by a hiss what followed next stephen will always remember when judge whipple drew himself up to his full six feet that was a warning to those that knew him as he doubled the bid the words came out with the aggressive distinctness of a man who through a long life has been used to opposition he with the gnawed yellow mustache pushed himself clear of the barouche his smouldering cigar butt dropping to the floor but there were no hisses now  and this is how judge whipple braved public opinion once more as he stood there defiant many were the conjectures as to what he could wish to do with the piano of his old friend those who knew the judge and there were few who did not pictured to themselves the dingy little apartment where he lived and smiled whatever his detractors might have said of him no one was ever heard to avow that he had bought or sold anything for gain  a tremor ran through the people could it have been of admiration for the fine old man who towered there glaring defiance at those about him give me a strong and consistent enemy some great personage has said rather than a lukewarm friend three score and five years the judge had lived and now some were beginning to suspect that he had a heart verily he had guarded his secret well but it was let out to many more that day and they went home praising him who had once pronounced his name with bitterness  this is what happened before he of the yellow mustache could pick up his cigar from the floor and make another bid the judge had cried out a sum which was the total of colonel carvels assessment many recall to this day how fiercely he frowned when the applause broke forth of itself and when he turned to go they made a path for him in admiration the length of the hall down which he stalked looking neither to the right nor left stephen followed him thankful for the day which had brought him into the service of such a man  and so it came about that the other articles were returned to colonel carvel with the marshals compliments and put back into the cold parlor where they had stood for many years the men who brought them offered to put down the carpet but by virginias orders the rolls were stood up in the corner and the floor left bare and days passed into weeks and no sign or message came from judge whipple in regard to the piano he had bought virginia did not dare mention it to the colonel  where was it it had been carried by six sweating negroes up the narrow stairs into the judges office stephen and shadrach had by mr whipples orders cleared a corner of his inner office and bedroom of papers and books and rubbish and there the bulky instrument was finally set up it occupied onethird of the space the judge watched the proceeding grimly choking now and again from the dust that was raised yet uttering never a word he locked the lid when the van man handed him the key and thrust that in his pocket  stephen had of late found enough to do in st louis he was the kind of man to whom promotions came unsought and without noise in the autumn he had been made a captain in the halleck guards of the state militia as a reward for his indefatigable work in the armories and his knowledge of tactics twice his company had been called out at night and once they made a campaign as far as the merimec and captured a party of recruits who were destined for jefferson davis some weeks passed before mr brinsmade heard of his promotion and this exploit and yet scarcely a day went by that he did not see the young man at the big hospital for stephen helped in the work of the sanitary commission too and so strove to make up in zeal for the service in the field which he longed to give  after christmas mr and mrs brinsmade moved out to their place on the bellefontaine road this was to force anne to take a rest for the girl was worn out with watching at the hospitals and with tending the destitute mothers and children from the ranks of the refugees the brinsmade place was not far from the fair groundsnow a receiving camp for the crude but eager regiments of the northern states to mr brinsmades when the days duty was done the young union officers used to ride and often there would be half a dozen of them to tea that house and other great houses on the bellefontaine road with which this history has no occasion to deal were as homes to many a poor fellow who would never see home again sometimes anne would gather together such young ladies of her acquaintance from the neighbor hood and the city as their interests and sympathies permitted to waltz with a union officer and there would be a little dance to these dances stephen brice was usually invited  one such occasion occurred on a friday in january and mr brinsmade himself called in his buggy and drove stephen to the country early in the afternoon he and anne went for a walk along the river the surface of which was broken by lumps of yellow ice gray clouds hung low in the sky as they picked their way over the frozen furrows of the ploughed fields the grass was all a yellowbrown but the north wind which swayed the bare trees brought a touch of color to annes cheeks before they realized where they were they had nearly crossed the bellegarde estate and the house itself was come into view standing high on the slope above the withered garden they halted  the shutters are up said stephen i understood that mrs colfax had come out here not long a  she came out for a day just before christina said anne smiling and then she ran off to kentucky i think she was afraid that she was one of the two women on the list of sixty  it must have been a blow to her pride when she found that she was not said stephen who had a keen remembrance of her conduct upon a certain sunday not a year gone  impelled by the same inclination they walked in silence to the house and sat down on the edge of the porch the only motion in the view was the smoke from the slave quarters twisting in the wind and the hurrying ice in the stream  poor jinny said anne with a sigh how she loved to romp what good times we used to have here together  do you think that she is unhappy stephen demanded involuntarily  oh yes said anne how can you ask but you could not make her show it the other morning when she came out to our house i found her sitting at the piano i am sure there were tears in her eyes but she would not let me see them she made some joke about spencer catherwood running away what do you think the judge will do with that piano stephen  he shook his head  the day after they put it in his room he came in with a great black cloth which he spread over it you cannot even see the feet  there was a silence and anne turning to him timidly gave him a long searching look  it is growing late she said i think that we ought to go back  they went out by the long entrance road through the naked woods stephen said little only a little while before he had had one of those vivid dreams of virginia which left their impression but not their substance to haunt him on those rare days following the dreams her spirit had its mastery over his he pictured her then with a glow on her face which was neither sadness nor mirtha glow that ministered to him alone and yet he did not dare to think that he might have won her even if politics and war had not divided them  when the merriment of the dance was at its height that evening stephen stood at the door of the long room meditatively watching the bright gowns and the flash of gold on the uniforms as they flitted past presently the opposite door opened and he heard mr brinsmades voice mingling with another the excitable energy of which recalled some familiar episode almostso it seemedat one motion the owner of the voice had come out of the door and had seized stephens hand in a warm graspa tall and spare figure in the dress of a senior officer the military frock which fitted the mans character rather than the man was carelessly open laying bare a goldbuttoned white waistcoat and an expanse of shirt bosom which ended in a black stock tie the ends of the collar were apart the width of the red clipped beard and the mustache was cropped straight along the line of the upper lip the forehead rose high and was brushed carelessly free of the hair the nose was almost straight but combative a fire fairly burned in the eyes  the boy doesnt remember me said the gentleman in quick tones smiling at mr brinsmade  yes sir i do stephen made haste to answer he glanced at the star on the shoulder strap and said you are general sherman  first rate laughed the general patting him first rate  now in command at camp benton stephen mr brinsmade put in wont you sit down general  no said the general emphatically waving away the chair no rather stand then his keen face suddenly lighted with amusementand mischief stephen thought so youve heard of me since we met sir yes general  humph guess you heard i was crazy said the general in his downright way  stephen was struck dumb  hes been reading the lies in the newspapers too brinsmade the general went on rapidly ill make em eat their newspapers for saying i was crazy thats the secretary of wars doings ever tell you what cameron did brinsmade he and his party were in louisville last fall when i was serving in kentucky and came to my room in the galt house well we locked the door and miller sent us up a good lunch and wine after lunch the secretary lay on my bed and we talked things over he asked me what i thought about things in kentucky i told him i got a map i said now mr secretary here is the whole union line from the potomac to kansas heres mcclellan in the east with one hundred miles of front heres fremont in the west with one hundred miles here we are in kentucky in the centre with three hundred miles to defend mcclellan has a hundred thousand men fremont has sixty thousand you give us fellows with over three hundred miles only eighteen thousand how many do you want says cameron still on the bed two hundred thousand before we get through said i cameron pitched up his hands in the air great god says he where are they to come from the northwest is chuck full of regiments you fellows at washington wont accept said i mark my words mr secretary youll need em all and more before we get done with this rebellion well sir he was very friendly before we finished and i thought the thing was all thrashed out no sir he goes back to washington and gives it out that im crazy and want two hundred thousand men in kentucky then i am ordered to report to halleck in missouri here and he calls me back from sedalia because he believes the lies  stephen who had in truth read the stories in question a month or two before could not conceal his embarrassment he looked at the man in front of himalert masterful intelligent frank to any stranger who took his fancyand wondered how any one who had talked to him could believe them  mr brinsmade smiled they have to print something general he said  ill give em something to print later on answered the general grimly then his expression changed brinsmade you fellows did have a session with fremont didnt you anderson sent me over here last september and the first man i ran across at the planters house was appleton what are you in town for says he to see fremont i said you ought to have heard appleton laugh you dont think fremontll see you do you says he why not well says tom go round to his palace at six tomorrow morning and bribe that hungarian prince who runs his bodyguard to get you a good place in the line of senators and governors and first citizens and before nightfall you may get a sight of him since you come from anderson not one man in a hundred says appleton i not one man in a hundred reaches his chiefofstaff next morning the general continued in a staccato which was often his habit had breakfast before daybreak and went round there place just swarming with californiansarmy contracts the general sniffed saw fremont went back to hotel more californians and by gadold baron steinberger with his nose hanging over the register  fremont was a little difficult to get at general said mr brinsmade things were confused and discouraged when those first contracts were awarded fremont was a good man and it wasnt his fault that the inexperience of his quartermasters permitted some of those men to get rich  no said the general his fault certainly not good man to be sure he wasdidnt get along with blair these courtmartials youre having here now have stirred up the whole country i guess well hear now how those fortunes were made to listen to those witnesses lie about each other on the stand is better than the theatre  stephen laughed at the comical and vivid manner in which the general set this matter forth he himself had been present one day of the sittings of the courtmartial when one of the witnesses on the prices of mules was that same seedy man with the strawcolored mustache who had bid for virginias piano against the judge  come stephen said the general abruptly run and snatch one of those pretty girls from my officers theyre having more than their share  they deserve more sir answered stephen whereupon the general laid his hand impulsively on the young mans shoulder divining what stephen did not say  nonsense said be you are doing the work in this war not we we do the damageyou repair it if it were not for mr brinsmade and you gentlemen who help him where would our western armies be dont you go to the front yet a while young man we need the best we have in reserve he glanced critically at stephen youve had military training of some sort  hes a captain in the halleck guards sir said mr brinsmade generously and the best drillmaster weve had in this city hes seen service too general  stephen reddened furiously and started to protest when the general cried its more than i have in this war come come i knew he was a soldier lets see what kind of a strategist hell make brinsmade have you got such a thing as a map mr brinsmade had and led the way back into the library the general shut the door lighted a cigar with a single vigorous stroke of a match and began to smoke with quick puffs stephen was puzzled how to receive the confidences the general was giving out with such freedom  when the map was laid on the table the general drew a pencil from his pocket and pointed to the state of kentucky then he drew a line from columbus to bowling green through forts donelson and henry  now stephen said he theres the rebel line show me the proper place to break it  stephen hesitated a while and then pointed at the centre  good said the general very good he drew a heavy line across the first and it ran almost in the bed of the tennessee river he swung on mr brinsmade very question halleck asked me the other day and thats how i answered it now gentlemen theres a man named grant down in that part of the country keep your eyes on him ever heard of him brinsmade he used to live here once and a year ago he was less than i was now hes a general  the recollection of the scene in the street by the arsenal that may morning not a year gone came to stephen with a shock  i saw him he cried he was captain grant that lived on the gravois road but surely this cant be the same man who seized paducah and was in that affair at belmont  by gum said the general laughing dont wonder youre surprised grant has stuff in him they kicked him around springfield awhile after the war broke out for a military carpetbagger then they gave him for a regiment the worst lot of ruffians you ever laid eyes on he fixed em he made em walk the plank he made em march halfway across the state instead of taking the cars the governor offered belmont i guess he is the man that chased the rebs out of belmont then his boys broke loose when they got into the town that wasnt grants fault the rebs came back and chased em out into their boats on the river brinsmade you remember hearing about that  grant did the coolest thing you ever saw he sat on his horse at the top of the bluff while the boys fell over each other trying to get on the boat yes sir he sat there disgusted on his horse smoking a cigar with the rebs raising pandemonium all around him and then sir cried the general excitedly what do you think he did hanged if he didnt force his horse right on to his haunches slide down the whole length of the bank and ride him across a teetering plank on to the steamer and the rebs just stood on the bank and stared they were so astonished they didnt even shoot the man you watch grant said the general and now stephen he added just you run off and take hold of the prettiest girl you can find if any of my boys object say i sent you  the next monday stephen had a caller it was little tiefel now a first lieutenant with a bristly beard and tanned face come to town on a few days furlough he had been with lyon at wilsons creek and he had a sad story to tell of how he found poor richter lying stark on that bloody field with a smile of peace upon his face strange that he should at length have been killed by a sabre  it was a sad meeting for those two since each reminded the other of a dear friend they would see no more on earth they went out to sup together in the german style and gradually over his beer tiefel forgot his sorrow stephen listened with an ache to the little mans tales of the campaigns he had been through so that presently tiefel cried out  why my friend you are melancholy as an owl i will tell you a funny story did you ever hear of one general sherman he that they say is crazy  he is no more crazy than i am said stephen warmly  is he not answered tiefel then i will show you a mistake you recall last november he was out to sedalia to inspect the camp there and he sleeps in a little country store where i am quartered now up gets your general sherman in the middle of the nightmidnightand marches up and down between the counters and waves his arms so says he land so says he sterling price will be here and steele here and this column will take that road and soandsos a damned fool is not that crazy so he walks up and down for three eternal hours says he pope has no business to be at osterville and steele here at sedalia with his regiments all over the place they must both go into camp at la mine river and form brigades and divisions that the troops may be handled  if thats insanity cried stephen so strongly as to surprise the little man then i wish we had more insane generals it just shows how a malicious rumor will spread what sherman said about popes and steeles forces is true as gospel and if you ever took the trouble to look into that situation tiefel you would see it and stephen brought down his mug on the table with a crash that made the bystanders jump  himmel exclaimed little tiefel but he spoke in admiration  it was not a month after that that shermans prophecy of the quiet general who had slid down the bluff at belmont came true the whole country bummed with grants praises moving with great swiftness and secrecy up the tennessee in company with the gunboats of commodore foote he had pierced the confederate line at the very point sherman had indicated fort henry had fallen and grant was even then moving to besiege donelson  mr brinsmade prepared to leave at once for the battlefield taking with him too paducah physicians and nurses all day long the boat was loading with sanitary stores and boxes of dainties for the wounded it was muggy and wetcharacteristic of that winteras stephen pushed through the drays on the slippery levee to the landing  he had with him a basket his mother had put up he also bore a message to mr brinsmade from the judge it was while he was picking his way along the crowded decks that he ran into general sherman the general seized him unceremoniously by the shoulder  goodby stephen he said  goodby general said stephen shifting his basket to shake hands are you going away  ordered to paducah said the general he pulled stephen off the guards into an empty cabin brice said he earnestly i havent forgotten how you saved young brinsmade at camp jackson they tell me that you are useful here i say dont go in unless you have to i dont mean force you understand but when you feel that you can go in come to me or write me a letter that is he added seemingly inspecting stephens white teeth with approbation if youre not afraid to serve under a crazy man  it has been said that the general liked the lack of effusiveness of stephens reply     chapter vi eliphalet plays his trumps  summer was come again through interminable days the sun beat down upon the city and at night the tortured bricks flung back angrily the heat with which he had filled them great battles had been fought and vast armies were drawing breath for greater ones to come  jinny said the colonel one day as we dont seem to be much use in town i reckon we may as well go to glencoe  virginia threw her arms around her fathers neck for many months she had seen what the colonel himself was slow to comprehendthat his usefulness was gone the days melted into weeks and sterling price and his army of liberation failed to come the vigilant union general and his aides had long since closed all avenues to the south for one fine morning toward the end of the previous summer when the colonel was contemplating a journey he had read that none might leave the city without a pass whereupon he went hurriedly to the office of the provost marshal there he had found a number of gentlemen in the same plight each waving a pass made out by the provost marshals clerks and waiting for that officers signature the colonel also procured one of these and fell into line the marshal gazed at the crowd pulled off his coat and readily put his name to the passes of several gentlemen going east next came mr bub ballington whom the colonel knew but pretended not to  going to springfield asked the marshal genially  yes said bub  not very profitable to be a minuteman eh in the same tone  the marshal signs his name mr ballington trying not to look indignant as he makes for the door a small silver bell rings on the marshals desk the one word spot breaks the intense silence which is one way of saying that mr ballington is detained and will probably be lodged that night at government expense  well colonel carvel what can i do for you this morning asked the marshal genially  the colonel pushed back his hat and wiped his brow i reckon ill wait till next week captain said mr carvel its pretty hot to travel just now  the provost marshal smiled sweetly there were many in the office who would have liked to laugh but it did not pay to laugh at some people colonel carvel was one of them  in the proclamation of martial law was much to make life less endurable than ever all who were convicted by a courtmartial of being rebels were to have property confiscated and slaves set free then there was a certain oath to be taken by all citizens who did not wish to have guardians appointed over their actions there were many who swallowed this oath and never felt any ill effects mr jacob cluyme was one and came away feeling very virtuous it was not unusual for mr cluyme to feel virtuous mr hopper did not have indigestion after taking it but colonel carvel would sooner have eaten gooseberry pie which he had never tasted but once  that summer had worn away like a monster which turns and gives hot gasps when you think it has expired it took the arkansan just a month under virginias care to become well enough to be sent to a northern prison he was not precisely a southern gentleman and he went to sleep over the idylls of the king but he was admiring and grateful and wept when he went off to the boat with the provosts guard destined for a northern prison virginia wept too he had taken her away from her aunt who would have nothing to do with him and had given her occupation she nor her father never tired of hearing his rough tales of prices rough army  his departure was about the time when suspicions were growing set the favor had caused comment and trouble hence there was no hope of giving another sufferer the same comfort the cordon was drawn tighter one of the mysterious gentlemen who had been seen in the vicinity of colonel carvels house was arrested on the ferry but he had contrived to be rid of the carpetsack in which certain precious letters were carried  throughout the winter mr hoppers visits to locust street had continued at intervals of painful regularity it is not necessary to dwell upon his brilliant powers of conversation nor to repeat the platitudes which he repeated for there was no significance in mr hoppers tales not a particle the colonel had found that out and was thankful his manners were better his english decidedly better  it was for her fathers sake of course that virginia bore with him such is the appointed lot of women she tried to be just and it occurred to her that she had never before been just again and again she repeated to herself that eliphalets devotion to the colonel at this low ebb of his fortunes had something in it of which she did not suspect him she had a class contempt for mr hopper as an uneducated yankee and a person of commercial ideals but now he was showing virtuesif virtues they wereand she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt with his great shrewdness and business ability why did he not take advantage of the many opportunities the war gave to make a fortune for virginia had of late been going to the store with the colonelwho spent his mornings turning over piles of dusty papers and mr hopper had always been at his desk  after this virginia even strove to be kind to him but it was uphill work the front door never closed after one of his visits that suspicion was not left behind antipathy would assert itself could it be that there was a motive under all this plotting he struck her inevitably as the kind who would be content to mine underground to attain an end the worst she could think of him was that he wished to ingratiate himself now in the hope that when the war was ended he might become a partner in mr carvels business she had put even this away as unworthy of her  once she had felt compelled to speak to her father on the subject  i believe i did him an injustice pa she said not that i like him any better now i must be honest about that i simply cant like him but i do think that if he had been as unscrupulous as i thought he would have deserted you long ago for something more profitable he would not be sitting in the office day after day making plans for the business when the war is over  she remembered how sadly he had smiled at her over the top of his paper  you are a good girl jinny he said  toward the end of july of that second summer riots broke out in the city and simultaneously a bright spot appeared on virginias horizon this took the form for northerners of a guerilla scare and an order was promptly issued for the enrollment of all the ablebodied men in the ten wards as militia subject to service in the state to exterminate the roving bands whereupon her britannic majesty became extremely populareven with some who claimed for a birthplace the emerald isle hundreds who heretofore had valued but lightly their british citizenship made haste to renew their allegiance and many sought the office of the english consul whose claims on her majestys protection were vague to say the least broken heads and scandal followed for the first time when virginia walked to the store with her father eliphalet was not there it was strange indeed that virginia defended him  i dont blame him for not wanting to fight for the yankees she said  the colonel could not resist a retort  then why doesnt he fight for the south he asked  fight for the south cried the young lady scornfully mr hopper fight i reckon the south wouldnt have him  i reckon not too said the colonel dryly  for the following week curiosity prompted virginia to take that walk with the colonel mr hopper being still absent she helped him to sort the papersthose grimy reminders of a more prosperous time gone by often mr carvel would run across one which seemed to bring some incident to his mind for he would drop it absently on his desk his hand seeking his chin and remain for half an hour lost in thought virginia would not disturb him  meanwhile there had been inquiries for mr hopper the colonel answered them all truthfullygenerally with that dangerous suavity for which he was noted twice a seedy man with a gnawed yellow mustache had come in to ask eliphalets whereabouts on the second occasion this individual became importunate  you dont know nothin about him you say he demanded  no said the colonel  the man took a shuffle forward  my names ford he said i low i kin lighten you a little  good day sir said the colonel  i guess youll like to hear what ive got to say  ephum said mr carvel in his natural voice show this man out  mr ford slunk out without ephums assistance but he half turned at the door and shot back a look that frightened virginia  oh pa she cried in alarm what did he mean  i couldnt tell you jinny he answered but she noticed that he was very thoughtful as they walked home the next morning eliphalet had not returned but a corporal and guard were waiting to search the store for him the colonel read the order and invited them in with hospitality he even showed them the way upstairs and presently virginia heard them all tramping overhead among the bales her eye fell upon the paper they had brought which lay unfolded on her fathers desk it was signed stephen a brice enrolling officer  that very afternoon they moved to glencoe and ephum was left in sole charge of the store at glencoe far from the hot city and the cruel war began a routine of peace virginia was a child again romping in the woods and fields beside her father the color came back to her cheeks once more and the laughter into her voice the two of them and ned and mammy spent a rollicking hour in the pasture the freedom of which dick had known so long before the old horse was caught and brought back into bondage after that virginia took long drives with her father and coming home they would sit in the summer house high above the merimec listening to the crickets chirp and watching the day fade upon the water the colonel who had always detested pipes learned to smoke a corncob he would sit by the hour with his feet on the rail of the porch and his hat tilted back while virginia read to him poe and wordsworth and scott he liked but tennyson was his favorite such happiness could not last  one afternoon when virginia was sitting in the summer house alone her thoughts wandering back as they sometimes did to another afternoon she had spent thereit seemed so long agowhen she saw mammy easter coming toward her  honey deys compny up to de house mister hoppers done arrived hes on de porch talkin to your pa lawsey look wha he come  in truth the solid figure of eliphalet himself was on the path some twenty yards behind her his hat was in his hand his hair was plastered down more neatly than ever and his coat was a faultless and sober creation of a franklin avenue tailor he carried a cane which was unheard of virginia sat upright and patted her skirts with a gesture of annoyancewhat she felt was anger resentment suddenly she rose swept past mammy and met him ten paces from the summer house  howdydo miss virginia he cried pleasantly your father had a notion you might be here he said fayther  virginia gave him her hand limply her greeting would have frozen a man of ardent temperament but it was not precisely ardor that eliphalet showed the girl paused and examined him swiftly there was something in the mans air today  so you were not caught she said  her words seemed to relieve some tension in him he laughed noiselessly  i just guess i wahnt  how did you escape she asked looking at him curiously  well i did first of all youre considerable smart miss jinny but ill bet you cant tell me where i was now  i do not care to know the place might save you again  he showed his disappointment i callated it might interest you to know how i dodged the sovereign state of missouri general halleck made an order that released a man from enrolling on payment of ten dollars i paid then i was drafted into the abe lincoln volunteers i paid a substitute and so here i be exercising life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness  so you bought yourself free said virginia if your substitute gets killed i suppose you will have cause for congratulation  eliphalet laughed and pulled down his cuffs thats his lookout i callate said he he glanced at the girl in a way that made her vaguely uneasy she turned from him back toward the summer house eliphalets eyes smouldered as they rested upon her figure he took a step forward  miss jinny he said  yes  ive heard considerable about the beauties of this place would you mind showing me round a bit virginia started it was his tone now not since that first evening in locust street had it taken on such assurance and yet she could not be impolite to a guest  certainly not she replied but without looking up eliphalet led the way he came to the summer house glanced around it with apparent satisfaction and put his foot on the mossgrown step virginia did a surprising thing she leaped quickly into the doorway before him and stood facing him framed in the climbing roses  oh mr hopper she cried please not in here he drew back staring in astonishment at the crimson in her face  why not he asked suspiciouslyalmost brutally she had been groping wildly for excuses and found none  because she said because i ask you not to with dignity that should be sufficient  well replied eliphalet with an abortive laugh thats funny now womenkind get queer notions which i callate weve got to respect and put up with all our liveseh  her anger flared at his leer and at his broad way of gratifying her whim and she was more incensed than ever at his air of being at homeit was nothing less  the mans whole manner was an insult she strove still to hide her resentment  there is a walk along the bluff she said coldly where the view is just as good  but she purposely drew him into the righthand path which led after a little back to the house despite her pace he pressed forward to her side  miss jinny said he precipitately did i ever strike you as a marrying man  virginia stopped and put her handkerchief to her face the impulse strong upon her to laugh eliphalet was suddenly transformed again into the common commercial yankee he was in love and had come to ask her advice she might have known it  i never thought of you as of the marrying kind mr hopper she answered her voice quivering  indeed he was irresistibly funny as he stood hot and ill at ease the sunday coat bore witness to his increasing portliness by creasing across from the buttons his face fleshy and perspiring showed purple veins and the little eyes receded comically like a pigs  well ive been thinking serious of late about getting married he continued slashing the rose bushes with his stick i dont callate to be a sentimental critter im not much on highsounding phrases and such things but id give you my word id make a good husband  please be careful of those roses mr hopper  beg pardon said eliphalet he began to lose track of his tensesthat was the only sign he gave of perturbation when i come to st louis without a cent miss jinny i made up my mind id be a rich man before i left it if i was to die now id have kept that promise im not thirtyfour and i callate ive got as much money in a safe place as a good many men you call rich im not saying what ive got mind you all in proper time  im a pretty steady kind ive stopped chewingthere was a time when i done that and i dont drink nor smoke  that is all very commendable mr hopper virginia said stifling a rebellious titter butbut why did you give up chewing  i am informed that the ladies are against it said eliphaletdead against it you wouldnt like it in a husband now would you  this time the laugh was not to be put down i confess i shouldnt she said  thought so he replied as one versed his tones took on a nasal twang well as i was saying ive about got ready to settle down and ive had my eye on the lady this seven years  marvel of constancy said virginia and the lady  the lady said eliphalet bluntly is you he glanced at her bewildered face and went on rapidly you pleased me the first day i set eyes on you in the store i said to myself hopper theres the one for you to marry im plain but my folks was good people i set to work right then to make a fortune for you miss jinny youve just what i need im a plain business man with no frills youll do the frills youre the kind that was raised in the lap of luxury youll need a man with a fortune and a big one youre the sort to show it off ive got the foundations of that fortune and the proof of it right here and i tell youhis jaw was seti tell you that some day eliphalet hopper will be one of the richest men in the west  he had stopped facing her in the middle of the way his voice strong his confidence supreme at first she had stared at him in dumb wonder then as she began to grasp the meaning of his harangue astonishment was still dominantsheer astonishment she scarcely listened but as he finished the thatch of the summer house caught her eye a vision arose of a man beside whom eliphalet was not worthy to crawl she thought of stephen as he had stood that evening in the sunset and this proposal seemed a degradation this brute dared to tempt her with money scalding words rose to her lips but she caught the look on eliphalets face and she knew that he would not understand this was one who rose and fell who lived and loved and hated and died and was buried bymoney  for a second she looked into his face as one who escapes a pit gazes over the precipice and shuddered as for eliphalet let it not be thought that he had no passion this was the moment for which he had lived since the day he had first seen her and been scorned in the store that type of face that airthese were the priceless things he would buy with his money crazed with the very violence of his longpent desire he seized her hand she wrung it free again  howhow dare you she cried  he staggered back and stood for a moment motionless as though stunned then slowly a light crept into his little eyes which haunted her for many a day  youwontmarry me he said  oh how dare you ask me exclaimed virginia her face burning with the shame of it she was standing with her hands behind her her back against a great walnut trunk the crusted branches of which hung over the bluff even as he looked at her eliphalet lost his head and indiscretion entered his soul  you must he said hoarsely you must youve got no notion of my money i say  oh she cried cant you understand if you owned the whole of california i would not marry you suddenly he became very cool he slipped his hand into a pocket as one used to such a motion and drew out some papers  i callate you aint got much idea of the situation miss carvel he said the wheels have been aturning lately youre poor but i guess you dont know how poor you areeh the colonels a man of honor aint he  for her life she could not have answerednor did she even know why she stayed to listen  well he said after all there aint much use in your lookin over them papers a woman wouldnt know ill tell you what they say they say that if i choose i am carvel  company  the little eyes receded and he waited a moment seemingly to prolong a physical delight in the excitement and suffering of a splendid creature the girl was breathing fast and deep  i callate you despise me dont you he went on as if that too gave him pleasure but i tell you the colonels a beggar but for me go and ask him if im lying all youve got to do is to say youll be my wife and i tear these notes in two they go over the bluff he made the motion with his hands carvel  companys an old firma respected firm you wouldnt care to see it go out of the family i callate  he paused again triumphant but she did none of the things he expected she said simplywill you please follow me mr hopper  and he followed herhis shrewdness gone for once  save for the rise and fall of her shoulders she seemed calm the path wound through a jungle of waving sunflowers and led into the shade in front of the house there was the colonel sitting on the porch his pipe lay with its scattered ashes on the boards and his head was bent forward as though listening when he saw the two he rose expectantly and went forward to meet them virginia stopped before him  pa she said is it true that you have borrowed money from this man  eliphalet had seen mr carvel angry once and his soul had quivered terror abject terror seized him now so that his knees smote together as well stare into the sun as into the colonels face in one stride he had a hand in the collar of eliphalets new coat the other pointing down the path  it takes just a minute to walk to that fence sir he said sternly if you are any longer about it i reckon youll never get past it youre a cowardly hound sir mr hoppers gait down the flagstones was an invention of his own it was neither a walk nor a trot nor a run but a sort of sliding amble such as is executed in nightmares singing in his head was the famous example of the eviction of babcock from the storethe only time that the colonels bullet had gone wide and down in the small of his back eliphalet listened for the crack of a pistol and feared that a clean hole might be bored there any minute once outside he took to the white road leaving a trail of dust behind him that a wagon might have raised fear lent him wings but neglected to lift his feet  the colonel passed his arm around his daughter and pulled his goatee thoughtfully and virginia glancing shyly upward saw a smile in the creases about his mouth she smiled too and then the tears hid him from her  strange that the face which in anger withered cowards and made men look grave was capable of such infinite tendernesstenderness and sorrow the colonel took virginia in his arms and she sobbed against his shoulder as of old  jinny did he  yes  lige was right andand you jinnyi should never have trusted him the sneak  virginia raised her head the sun was slanting in yellow bars through the branches of the great trees and a robins note rose above the bass chorus of the frogs in the pauses as she listened it seemed as if she could hear the silver sound of the river over the pebbles far below  honey said the coloneli reckon were just as poor as white trash  virginia smiled through her tears  honey he said again after a pause i must keep my word and let him have the business  she did not reproach him  there is a little left a very little he continued slowly painfully i thank god that it is yours it was left you by beckyby your mother it is in a railroad company in new york and safe jinny  oh pa you know that i do not care she cried it shall be yours and mine together and we shall live out here and be happy  but she glanced anxiously at him nevertheless he was in his familiar posture of thought his legs slightly apart his felt hat pushed back stroking his goatee but his clear gray eyes were troubled as they sought hers and she put her hand to her breast  virginia he said i fought for my country once and i reckon im some use yet awhile it isnt right that i should idle here while the south needs me your uncle daniel is fiftyeight and colonel of a pennsylvania regimentjinny i have to go  virginia said nothing it was in her blood as well as his the colonel had left his young wife to fight in mexico he had come home to lay flowers on her grave she knew that he thought of this and too that his heart was rent at leaving her she put her hands on his shoulders and he stooped to kiss her trembling lips  they walked out together to the summerhouse and stood watching the glory of the light on the western hills jinn said the colonel i reckon you will have to go to your aunt lillian itit will be hard but i know that my girl can take care of herself in casein case i do not come back or occasion should arise find lige let him take you to your uncle daniel he is fond of you and will be all alone in calvert house when the war is over and i reckon that is all i have to say i wont pry into your heart honey if you love clarence marry him i like the boy and i believe he will quiet down into a good man  virginia did not answer but reached out for her fathers hand and held its fingers locked tight in her own from the kitchen the sound of neds voice rose in the still evening air       sposin i was to go to n orleans an take sick and die      laik a bird into de country ma spirit would fly  and after a while down the path the red and yellow of mammy easters bandanna was seen  supper miss jinny laws if i aint ramshacked de premises fo you bof de con breads gittin cold  that evening the colonel and virginia thrust a few things into her little leather bag they had chosen together in london virginia had found a cigar which she hid until they went down to the porch and there she gave it to him when he lighted the match she saw that his hand shook  half an hour later he held her in his arms at the gate and she heard his firm tread die in the dust of the road the south had claimed him at last     volume 7     chapter vii with the armies of the west  we are at memphisfor a whileand the christmas season is approaching once more and yet we must remember that war recognizes no christmas nor sunday nor holiday the brown river excited by rains whirled seaward between his banks of yellow clay now the weather was crisp and cold now hazy and depressing and again a downpour memphis had never seen such activity a spirit possessed the place a restless spirit called william t sherman he prodded memphis and laid violent hold of her she groaned protested turned over and woke up peopled by a new people when these walked they ran and they wore a blue uniform they spoke rapidly and were impatient rain nor heat nor tempest kept them in and yet they joked and memphis laughed what was left of her and recognized a bond of fellowship the general joked and the colonels and the commissary and the doctors down to the sutlers and teamsters and the salt tars under porter who cursed the dishwater mississippi and also a man named eads who had built the newfangled iron boxes officially known as gunboats the like of these had never before been seen in the waters under the earth the loyal citizensloyal to the southhad been given permission to leave the city the general told the assistant quartermaster to hire their houses and slaves for the benefit of the federal government likewise he laid down certain laws to the memphis papers defining treason he gave out his mind freely to that other army of occupation the army of speculation that flocked thither with permits to trade in cotton the speculators gave the confederates gold which they needed most for the bales which they could not use at all  the forefathers of some of these gentlemen were in old egypt under pharaohfor whom they could have had no greater respect and fear than their descendants had in new egypt for grant or sherman yankees were there likewise in abundance and a certain acquaintance of ours materially added to his fortune by selling in boston the cotton which cost him fourteen cents at thirty cents  one day the shouting and the swearing and the running to and fro came to a climax those floating freaks which were all top and drew nothing were loaded down to the guards with army stores and animals and wood and menmen who came from every walk in life  whistles bellowed horses neighed the gunboats chased hither and thither and at length the vast processions paddled down the stream with naval precision under the watchful eyes of a real admiral  residents of memphis from the rivers bank watched the pillar of smoke fade to the southward and ruminated on the fate of vicksburg the general paced the deck in thought a little later he wrote to the commanderinchief at washington the valley of the mississippi is america  vicksburg taken this vast confederacy would be chopped in two  night fell to the music of the paddles to the scent of the officers cigars to the bloodred vomit of the tall stacks and the smoky flame of the torches then christmas day dawned and there was vicksburg lifted two hundred feet above the fever swamps her courthouse shining in the morning sun vicksburg the wellnigh impregnable key to americas highway when old vick made his plantation on the walnut hills he chose a site for a fortress of the future confederacy that vauban would have delighted in  yes there were the walnut hills high bluffs separated from the mississippi by tangled streams and bayous and on their crests the parrotts scowled it was a queer christmas day indeed bright and warm no snow no turkeys nor mince pies no wine but just hardtack and bacon and foaming brown water  on the morrow the illassorted fleet struggled up the sluggish yazoo past impenetrable forests where the cypress clutched at the keels past longdeserted cotton fields until it came at last to the black ruins of a home in due time the great army was landed it spread out by brigade and division and regiment and company the men splashing and paddling through the chickasaw and the swamps toward the bluffs the parrotts began to roar a certain regiment boldly led crossed the bayou at a narrow place and swept resistless across the sodden fields to where the bank was steepest the fire from the battery scorched the hair of their heads but there they stayed scooping out the yellow clay with torn hands while the parrotts with lowered muzzles ploughed the slope with shells there they stayed while the blue lines quivered and fell back through the forests on that short winters afternoon dragging their wounded from the stagnant waters but many were left to die in agony in the solitude  like a tall emblem of energy general sherman stood watching the attack and repulse his eyes ever alert he paid no heed to the shells which tore the limbs from the trees about him or sent the swamp water in thick spray over his staff now and again a sharp word broke from his lips a forceful home thrust at one of the leaders of his columns  what regiment stayed under the bank  sixth missouri general said an aide promptly  the general sat late in the admirals gunboat that night but when he returned to his cabin in the forest queen he called for a list of officers of the sixth missouri his finger slipping down the roll paused at a name among the new second lieutenants  did the boys get back he asked yes general when it fell dark  let me see the casualtiesquick  that night a fog rolled up from the swamps and in the morning jackstaff was hid from pilothouse before the attack could be renewed a political general came down the river with a letter in his pocket from washington by virtue of which he took possession of the three army core and their chief subpoenaed the fleet and the admiral and went off to capture arkansas post  vicksburg had a breathing spell  three weeks later when the army was resting at napoleon arkansas a selfcontained man with a brown beard arrived from memphis and took command this way general u s grant he smoked incessantly in his cabin he listened he spoke but seldom he had look in his face that boded ill to any that might oppose him time and labor be counted as nothing compared with the accomplishment of an object back to vicksburg paddled the fleet and transports across the river from the city on the pasty mud behind the levees bank were dumped shermans regiments condemned to week of ditchdigging that the gunboats might arrive at the bend of the mississippi below by a canal out of reach of the batteries day in and day out they labored officer and men sawing off stumps under the water knocking poisonous snakes by scores from the branches while the river rose and rose and rose and the rain crept by inches under their tent flies and the enemy walked the parapet of vicksburg and laughed two gunboats accomplished the feat of running the batteries that their smiles might be sobered  to the young officers who were soiling their uniform with the grease of saws whose only fighting was against fever and water snakes the news of an expedition into the vicksburg side of the river was hailed with caps in the air to be sure the saw and axe and likewise the levee and the snakes were to be there too but there was likely to be a little fighting the rest of the corps that was to stay watched grimly as the detachment put off in the little diligence and silver wave  all the night the smokepipes were batting against the boughs of oak and cottonwood and snapping the trailing vines some other regiments went by another route the ironclads followed in hot haste by general sherman in a navy tug had gone ahead and were even then shoving with their noses great trunks of trees in their eagerness to get behind the rebels the missouri regiment spread out along the waters and were soon waist deep hewing a path for the heavier transports to come presently the general came back to a plantation half under water where black bayou joins deer creek to hurry the work in cleaning out that bayou the light transports meanwhile were bringing up more troops from a second detachment all through the friday the navy great guns were heard booming in the distance growing quicker and quicker until the quivering air shook the hanging things in that vast jungle saws stopped and axes were poised over shoulders and many times that day the general lifted his head anxiously as he sat down in the evening in a slave cabin redolent with corn pone and bacon the sound still hovered among the trees and rolled along the still waters  the general slept lightly it was three oclock saturday morning when the sharp challenge of a sentry broke the silence a negro white eyed bedraggled and muddy stood in the candle light under the charge of a young lieutenant the officer saluted and handed the general a roll of tobacco  i found this man in the swamp sir he has a message from the admiral  the general tore open the roll and took from it a piece of tissue paper which he spread out and held under the candle he turned to a staff officer who had jumped from his bed and was hurrying into his coat  porters surrounded he said the order came in a flash kilby smith and all men here across creek to relief at once ill take canoe through bayou to hills and hurry reenforcements  the staff officer paused his hand on the latch of the door  but your escort general youre not going through that sewer in a canoe without an escort  i guess they wont look for a needle in that haystack the general answered for a brief second he eyed the lieutenant get back to your regiment brice if you want to go he said  stephen saluted and went out all through the painful march that followed though soaked in swamp water and bruised by cypress knees he thought of sherman in his canoe winding unprotected through the black labyrinth risking his life that more men might be brought to the rescue of the gunboats  the story of that rescue has been told most graphically by sherman himself how he picked up the men at work on the bayou and marched them on a coal barge how he hitched the barge to a navy tug how he met the little transport with a fresh load of troops and captain elijah brents reply when the general asked if he would follow him as long as the boat holds together general and he kept his word the boughs hammered at the smokepipes until they went by the board and the pilothouse fell like a pack of cards on the deck before they had gone three miles and a half then the indomitable sherman disembarked a lighted candle in his hand and led a stiff march through thicket and swamp and breastdeep backwater where the little drummer boys carried their drums on their heads at length when they were come to some indian mounds they found a picket of three companies of the force which had reached the flat the day before and had been sent down to prevent the enemy from obstructing further the stream below the fleet  the admirals in a bad way sir said the colonel who rode up to meet the general hes landlocked those clumsy ironclads of his cant move backward or forward and the rebs have been peppering him for two days  just then a fusillade broke from the thickets nipping the branches from the cottonwoods about them  form your line said the general drive em out  the force swept forward with the three picket companies in the swamp on the right and presently they came in sight of the shapeless ironclads with their funnels belching smoke a most remarkable spectacle how porter had pushed them there was one of the miracles of the war  then followed one of a thousand memorable incidents in the life of a memorable man general sherman jumping on the bare back of a scrawny horse cantered through the fields and the bluejackets at sight of that familiar figure roared out a cheer that might have shaken the drops from the wet boughs the admiral and the general stood together on the deck their hands clasped and the colonel astutely remarked as he rode up in answer to a summons that if porter was the only man whose daring could have pushed a fleet to that position sherman was certainly the only man who could have got him out of it  colonel said the general that move was well executed sir admiral did the rebs put a bullet through your rum casks were just a little tired and now he added wheeling on the colonel when each had a glass in his hand who was in command of that company on the right in the swamp he handled them like a regular  hes a second lieutenant general in the sixth missouri captain wounded at hindman and first lieutenant fell out down below his name is brice i believe  i thought so said the general  some few days afterward when the troops were slopping around again at youngs point opposite vicksburg a gentleman arrived on a boat from st louis he paused on the levee to survey with concern and astonishment the flood of waters behind it and then asked an officer the way to general shermans headquarters the officer who was greatly impressed by the gentlemans looks led him at once to a trestle bridge which spanned the distance from the levee bank over the flood to a house up to its first floor in the backwaters the orderly saluted  who shall i say sir  the officer looked inquiringly at the gentleman who gave his name  the officer could not repress a smile at the next thing that happened out hurried the general himself with both hands outstretched  bless my soul he cried if it isnt brinsmade come right in come right in and take dinner the boys will be glad to see you ill send and tell grant youre here brinsmade if it wasnt for you and your friends on the western sanitary commission wed all have been dead of fever and bad food long ago the general sobered abruptly i guess a good many of the boys are laid up now he added  ive come down to do what i can general responded mr brinsmade gravely i want to go through all the hospitals to see that our nurses are doing their duty and that the stores are properly distributed  you shall sir this minute said the general he dropped instantly the affairs which he had on hand and without waiting for dinner the two gentlemen went together through the wards where the fever raged the general surprised his visitor by recognizing private after private in the cots and he always had a brief word of cheer to brighten their faces to make them follow him with wistful eyes as he passed beyond them thats poor craig he would say corporal third michigan they tell me he cant live and thats olcott eleventh indiana good god cried the general when they were out in the air again how i wish some of these cotton traders could get a taste of this fever they keep wellthe vulturesand by the way brinsmade the man who gave me no peace at all at memphis was from your city why i had to keep a whole corps on duty to watch him  what was his name sir mr brinsmade asked  hopper cried the general with feeling eliphalet hopper as long as i live i shall never forget it how the devil did he get a permit what are they about at washington  you surprise me said mr brinsmade he has always seemed inoffensive and i believe he is a prominent member of one of our churches  i guess thats so answered the general dryly i ever i set eyes on him again hes clapped into the guardhouse he knows it too  speaking of st louis general said mr brinsmade presently have you ever heard of stephen brice joined your army last autumn you may remember talking to him one evening at my house  hes one of my boys cried the general remember him guess i do he paused on the very brink of relating again the incident at camp jackson when stephen had saved the life of mr brinsmades own son brinsmade for three days ive had it on my mind to send for that boy ill have him at headquarters now i like him cried general sherman with tone and gesture there was no mistaking and good mr brinsmade who liked stephen too rejoiced at the story he would have to tell the widow he has spirit brinsmade i told him to let me know when he was ready to go to war no such thing he never came near me the first thing i hear of him is that hes digging holes in the clay of chickasaw bluff and his cap is fanned off by the blast of a parrott six feet above his head next thing he turns up on that little expedition we took to get porter to sea again when we got to the gunboats there was brices company on the flank he handled those men surprisingly sirsurprisingly i shouldnt have blamed the boy if one or two rebs got by him but no he swept the place clean by this time they had come back to the bridge leading to headquarters and the general beckoned quickly to an orderly  my compliments to lieutenant stephen brice sixth missouri and ask him to report here at once at once you understand  yes general  it so happened that mr brices company were swinging axes when the orderly arrived and mr brice had an axe himself and was up to his boot tops in yellow mud  the orderly who had once been an iowa farmer was near grinning when he gave the generals message and saw the lieutenant gazing ruefully at his clothes  entering headquarters stephen paused at the doorway of the big room where the officers of the different staffs were scattered about smoking while the negro servants were removing the dishes from the table the sunlight reflected from the rippling water outside danced on the ceiling at the end of the room sat general sherman his uniform as always a trifle awry his soft felt hat with the gold braid was tilted forward and his feet booted and spurred were crossed small wonder that the englishman who sought the typical american found him in sherman  the sound that had caught stephens attention was the generals voice somewhat highpitched in the key that he used in telling a story these were his closing words  sin gives you a pretty square deal boys after all generally a man says well i can resist but ill have my fun just this once thats the way it happens they tell you that temptation comes irresistibly dont believe it do you mr brice come over here sir heres a friend of yours  stephen made his way to the general whose bright eyes wandered rapidly over him as he added  this is the condition my officers report in brinsmademud from head to heel  stephen had sense enough to say nothing but the staff officers laughed and mr brinsmade smiled as he rose and took stephens hand  i am delighted to see that you are well sir said he with that formal kindliness which endeared him to all your mother will be rejoiced at my news of you you will be glad to hear that i left her well stephen  stephen inquired for mrs brinsmade and anne  they are well sir and took pleasure in adding to a little box which your mother sent judge whipple put in a box of fine cigars although he deplores the use of tobacco  and the judge mr brinsmadehow is he  the good gentlemans face fell  he is ailing sir it grieves me to say he is in bed sir but he is ably looked after your mother desired to have him moved to her house but he is difficult to stir from his ways and he would not leave his little room he is ably nursed we have got old nancy hesters mother to stay with him at night and mrs brice divides the day with miss jinny carvel who comes in from bellegarde every afternoon  miss carvel exclaimed stephen wondering if he heard aright and at the mention of her name he tingled  none other sir answered mr brinsmade she has been much honored for it you may remember that the judge was a close friend of her fathers before the war andwell they quarrelled sir the colonel went south you know  whenwhen was the judge taken ill mr brinsmade stephen asked the thought of virginia and his mother caring for him together was strangely sweet  two days before i left sir dr polk had warned him not to do so much but the doctor tells me that he can see no dangerous symptoms  stephen inquired now of mr brinsmade how long he was to be with them  i am going on to the other camps this afternoon said he but i should like a glimpse of your quarters stephen if you will invite me your mother would like a careful account of you and mr whipple andyour many friends in st louis  you will find my tent a little wet air replied stephen touched  here the general who had been sitting by watching them with a very curious expression spoke up  thats hospitality for you brinsmade  stephen and mr brinsmade made their way across plank and bridge to stephens tent and his mess servant arrived in due time with the package from home but presently while they sat talking of many things the canvas of the fly was thrust back with a quick movement and who should come stooping in but general sherman himself he sat down on a cracker box stephen rose confusedly  well well brice said the general winking at mr brinsmade i think you might have invited me to the feast where are those cigars mr brinsmade was talking about  stephen opened the box with alacrity the general chose one and lighted it  dont smoke eh he inquired why yes sir when i can  then light up sir said the general and sit down ive been thinking lately of courtmartialing you but i decided to come round and talk it over with you first that isnt strictly according to the rules of the service look here mr brice why did you leave st louis  they began to draft sir and i couldnt stand it any longer  but you wouldnt have been drafted you were in the home guards if i remember right and mr brinsmade tells me you were useful in many ways what was your rank in the home guards  lieutenant colonel sir  and what are you here  a second lieutenant in temporary command general you have commanded men  not in action sir i felt that that was different  couldnt they do better for you than a secondlieutenancy  stephen did not reply at once mr brinsmade spoke up they offered him a lieutenantcolonelcy  the general was silent a moment then he said do you remember meeting me on the boat when i was leaving st louis after the capture of fort henry  stephen smiled very well general he replied general sherman leaned forward  and do you remember i said to you brice when you get ready to come into this war let me know why didnt you do it  stephen thought a minute then he said gravely but with just a suspicion of humor about his mouth general if i had done that you wouldnt be here in my tent today  like lightning the general was on his feet his hand on stephens shoulder  by gad sir he cried delighted so i wouldnt     chapter viii a strange meeting  the story of the capture of vicksburg is the old old story of failure turned into success by which man is made immortal it involves the history of a general who never retraced his steps who cared neither for mugwump murmurs nor political cabals who took both blame and praise with equanimity through month after month of discouragement and work gone for naught and fever and death his eyes never left his goal and by grace of the wisdom of that president who himself knew sorrow and suffering and defeat and unjust censure general grant won  boldness did it the canal abandoned one red night fleet and transports swept around the bend and passed the citys heights on a red river the parrotts and the dahlgrens roared and the high bluffs flung out the sound over the empty swamp land  then there came the landing below and the cutting loose from a baseunheard of corps behind cursed corps ahead for sweeping the country clear of forage battles were fought confederate generals in mississippi were bewildered  one night while crossing with his regiment a pontoon bridge stephen brice heard a shout raised on the farther shore sitting together on a log under a torch two men in slouch hats were silhouetted that one talking with rapid gestures was general sherman the impassive profile of the other the closecropped beard and the firmly held cigar that seemed to go with itstephen recognized as that of the strange captain grant who had stood beside him in the street by the arsenal he had not changed a whit motionless he watched corps after corps splash by artillery cavalry and infantry nor gave any sign that he heard their plaudits  at length the army came up behind the city to a place primeval where the face of the earth was sore and tortured worn into deep gorges by the rains and flung up in great mounds stripped of the green magnolias and the cane the banks of clay stood forth in hideous yellow nakedness save for a lonely stunted growth or a bare trunk that still stood tottering on the edge of a banks its pitiful withered roots reaching out below the may weather was already sickly hot  first of all there was a murderous assault and a still more murderous repulse three times the besiegers charged sank their color staffs into the redoubts and three times were driven back then the blue army settled into the earth and folded into the ravines three days in that narrow space between the lines lay the dead and wounded suffering untold agonies in the moist heat then came a truce to bury the dead to bring back what was left of the living  the doomed city had no rest like clockwork from the mississippis banks beyond came the boom and shriek of the coehorns on the barges the big shells hung for an instant in the air like birds of prey and then could be seen swooping down here and there while now and anon a shaft of smoke rose straight to the sky the black monument of a home  here was work in the trenches digging the flying sap by night and deepening it by day for officers and men alike from heaven a host of blue ants could be seen toiling in zigzags forward ever forward along the rude watercuts and through the hills a waiting carrion from her vantage point on high marked one spot then another where the blue ants disappeared and again one by one came out of the burrow to hurry down the trencheach with his ball of clay  in due time the ring of metal and sepulchred voices rumbled in the ground beneath the besieged counter mines were started and through the narrow walls of earth commands and curses came above ground the saps were so near that a strange converse became the rule it was hello reb howdy yank both sides were starving the one for tobacco and the other for hardtack and bacon these necessities were tossed across sometimes wrapped in the vicksburg newssheet printed on the white side of a homely green wall paper at other times other amenities were indulged in handgrenades were thrown and shells with lighted fuses rolled down on the heads of acquaintances of the night before who replied from wooden coehorns hooped with iron  the union generals learned common item in a siege that the citizens of vicksburg were eating mule meat not an officer or private in the vicksburg armies who does not remember the 25th of june and the hour of three in an afternoon of pitiless heat silently the long blue files wound into position behind the earth barriers which hid them from the enemy coiled and ready to strike when the towering redoubt on the jackson road should rise heavenwards by common consent the rifle crack of day and night was hushed and even the parrotts were silent stillness closed around the white house of shirley once more but not the stillness it had known in its peaceful homestead days this was the stillness of the death prayer eyes staring at the big redoubt were dimmed at last to those near a little wisp of blue smoke crept out  then the earth opened with a quake the sun was darkened and a hot blast fanned the upturned faces in the sky through the film of shattered clay little black dots scurried poised and fell again as arms and legs and head less trunks and shapeless bits of wood and iron scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty thousand bayonets and a hundred shells were shrieking across the craters edge earth to earth alas and dust to dust men who ran across that rim of a summers afternoon died in torture under tier upon tier of their comradesand so the hole was filled  an upright cannon marks the spot where a scrawny oak once stood on a scarred and baked hillside outside of the confederate lines at vicksburg under the scanty shade of that tree on the eve of the nations birthday stood two men who typified the future and the past as at donelson a trick of fortunes had delivered one comrade of old into the hands of another now she chose to kiss the one upon whom she had heaped obscurity and poverty and contumely he had ceased to think or care about fortune and hence being born a woman she favored him  the two armies watched and were still they noted the friendly greeting of old comrades and after that they saw the selfcontained northerner biting his cigar as one to whom the pleasantries of life were past and gone the south saw her general turn on his heel the bitterness of his life was come both sides honored him for the fight he had made but war does not reward a man according to his deserts  the next daythe day our sundered nation was born vicksburg surrendered the obstinate man with the mighty force had conquered see the gray regiments marching silently in the tropic heat into the folds of that blue army whose grip has choked them at last silently too the blue coats stand pity and admiration on the brickred faces the arms are stacked and surrendered officers and men are to be parolled when the counting is finished the formations melt away and those who for months have sought each others lives are grouped in friendly talk the coarse army bread is drawn eagerly from the knapsacks of the blue smoke quivers above a hundred fires and the smell of frying bacon brings a wistful look into the gaunt faces tears stand in the eyes of many a man as he eats the food his yankee brothers have given him on the birthday of their country  within the city it is the same stephen brice now a captain in general laumans brigade sees with thanksgiving the stars and stripes flutter from the dome of that courthouse which he had so long watched from afar  later on down a side street he pauses before a house with its face blown away on the verge of one of its jagged floors is an old fourposted bed and beside it a childs cot is standing pitifullythe tiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the foot so much for one of the navys shells  while he was thinking of the sadness of it all a little scene was acted the side door of the house opened a weeping woman came out and with her was a tall confederate colonel of cavalry gallantly giving her his arm he escorted her as far as the little gate where she bade him good by with much feeling with an impulsive movement he drew some money from his pocket thrust it upon her and started hurriedly away that he might not listen to her thanks such was his preoccupation that he actually brushed into stephen who was standing beside a tree he stopped and bowed  excuse me seh he said contritely i beg your pardon seh  certainly said stephen smiling it was my fault for getting in your way  not at all seh said the cavalry colonel my clumsiness seh he did not pass on but stood pulling with some violence a very long mustache damn you yankees he continued in the same amiable tone youve brought us a heap of misfortune why seh in another week wed been foced to eat niggers  the colonel made such a wry face that stephen laughed in spite of himself he had marked the mans charitable action and admired his attempt to cover it the colonel seemed to be all breadth like a card his shoulders were incredible the face was scant perchance from lack of food the nose large with a curved rim and the eyes blue gray he wore clayflecked cavalry boots and was six feet five if an inch so that stephens six seemed insignificant beside him  captain he said taking in stephens rank so we wont qual as to whos host heah one things suah he added with a twinkle ive been heah longest seems like ten yeahs since i saw the wife and children down in the palmetto state i cant offer you a dinner seh weve eaten all the mules and rats and sugar cane in town his eye seemed to interpolate that stephen wouldnt be there otherwise but i can offer you something choicer than you have in the noth  whereupon he drew from his hip a dented silver flask the colonel remarked that stephens eyes fell on the coat of arms  propety of my grandfather seh of washingtons army my name is jennisoncatesby jennison at your service seh he said you have the advantage of me captain  my name is brice said stephen  the big colonel bowed decorously held out a great wide hand and thereupon unscrewed the flask now stephen had never learned to like straight whiskey but he took down his share without a face the exploit seemed to please the colonel who after he likewise had done the liquor justice screwed on the lid with ceremony offered stephen his arm with still greater ceremony and they walked off down the street together stephen drew from his pocket several of judge whipples cigars to which his new friend gave unqualified praise  on every hand vicksburg showed signs of hard usage houses with gaping chasms in their sides others mere heaps of black ruins great trees felled cabins demolished and here and there the sidewalk ploughed across from curb to fence  lordy exclaimed the colonel lordy i how my ears ache since your damned coehorns have stopped the noise got to be silence with us seh and yesterday i reckoned a hundred volcanoes had bust tell me said he when the redoubt over the jackson road was blown up they said a nigger came down in your lines alive is that so  yes said stephen smiling he struck near the place where my company was stationed his head ached a mite that seemed to be all  i reckon he fell on it said colonel catesby jennison as if it were a matter of no special note  and now tell me something said stephen how did you burn our saprollers  this time the colonel stopped and gave himself up to hearty laughter  why that was a yankee trick sure enough he cried some ingenious cuss soaked port fire in turpentine and shot the wad in a largebore musket  we thought you used explosive bullets  the colonel laughed again still more heartily explosive bulletsgood lord it was all we could do to get percussion caps do you know how we got percussion caps seh three of our officersdaredevils sehfloated down the mississippi on logs one fellow made his way back with two hundred thousand hes the pride of our vicksburg army not afraid of hell a chivalrous man a forlornhope man the night you ran the batteries he and some others went across to your side in skiffsin skiffs seh i sayand set fire to the houses in de soto that we might see to shoot and then he came back in the face of our own batteries and your guns that man was wounded by a trick of fate by a cussed bit of shell from your coehorns while eating his dinner in vicksburg hes pretty low now poor fellow added the colonel sadly  where is he demanded stephen fired with a desire to see the man  well he aint a great ways from here said the colonel perhaps you might be able to do something for him he continued thoughtfully id hate to see him die the doctor says hell pull through if he can get care and good air and good food he seized stephens arm in a fierce grip you aint fooling he said  indeed i am not said stephen  no said the colonel thoughtfully as to himself you dont look like the man to fool  whereupon he set out with great strides in marked contrast to his former languorous gait and after a while they came to a sort of gorge where the street ran between high banks of clay there stephen saw the magazines which the confederates had dug out and of which he had heard but he saw something too of which he had not heard colonel catesby jennison stopped before an open doorway in the yellow bank and knocked a womans voice called softly to him to enter  they went into a room hewn out of the solid clay carpet was stretched on the floor paper was on the walls and even a picture there was a little window cut like a port in a prison cell and under it a bed beside which a middleaged lady was seated she had a kindly face which seemed to stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture of restraint she pointed to the bed where a sheet lay limply over the angles of a wasted frame the face was to the wall  hush said the ladyit is the first time in two days that he has slept  but the sleeper stirred wearily and woke with a start he turned over the face so yellow and peaked was of the type that grows even more handsome in sickness and in the great feverstricken eyes a high spirit burned for an instant only the man stared at stephen and then he dragged himself to the wall  the eyes of the other two were both fixed on the young union captain  my god cried jennison seizing stephens rigid arm does he look as bad as that weve seen him every day  ii know him answered stephen he stepped quickly to the bedside and bent over it colfax he said colfax  this is too much jennison came from the bed a voice that was pitifully weak why do you bring yankees in here  captain brice is a friend of yours colfax said the colonel tugging at his mustache  brice repeated clarence brice does he come from st louis  do you come from st louis sir  yes i have met captain colfax  colonel sir  colonel colfax before the war and if he would like to go to st louis i think i can have it arranged at once  in silence they waited for clarences answer stephen well knew what was passing in his mind and guessed at his repugnance to accept a favor from a yankee he wondered whether there was in this case a special detestation and so his mind was carried far to the northward to the memory of that day in the summerhouse on the meramee heights virginia had not loved her cousin thenof that stephen was sure but nownow that the vicksburg army was ringing with his praise now that he was unfortunatestephen sighed his comfort was that he would be the instrument  the lady in her uneasiness smoothed the single sheen that covered the sick man from afar came the sound of cheering and it was this that seemed to rouse him he faced them again impatiently  i have reason to remember mr brice he said steadily and then with some vehemence what is he doing in vicksburg  stephen looked at jennison who winced  the city has surrendered said that officer  they counted on a burst of anger colfax only groaned  then you can afford to be generous he said with a bitter laugh but you havent whipped us yet by a good deal jennison he cried jennison why in hell did you give up  colfax said stephen coming forward youre too sick a man to talk ill look up the general it may be that i can have you sent north today  you can do as you please said clarence coldly with aprisoner  the blood rushed to stephens face bowing to the lady he strode out of the room colonel jennison running after him caught him in the street  youre not offended brice he said hes sickand god almighty hes proudi reckon he added with a touch of humility that went straight to stephens heart i reckon that some of us are too derned proudbut we aint cold  stephen grasped his hand  offended he said i admire the man ill go to the general directly but just let me thank you and i hope colonel that we may meet againas friends hold on seh said colonel catesby jennison we may as well drink to that  fortunately as stephen drew near the court house he caught sight of a group of officers seated on its steps and among them he was quick to recognize general sherman  brice said the general returning his salute been celebrating this glorious fourth with some of our rebel friends  yes sir answered stephen and i came to ask a favor for one of them seeing that the generals genial interested expression did not change he was emboldened to go on this is one of their colonels sir you may have heard of him he is the man who floated down the river on a log and brought back two hundred thousand percussion caps  good lord interrupted the general i guess we all heard of him after that what else has he done to endear himself he asked with a smile  well general he rowed across the river in a skiff the night we ran these batteries and set fire to de soto to make targets for their gunners  id like to see that man said the general in his eager way where is he  what i was going to tell you sir after he went through all this he was hit by a piece of mortar shell while sitting at his dinner hes rather far gone now general and they say he cant live unless he can be sent north ii know who he is in st louis and i thought that as long as the officers are to be paroled i might get your permission to send him up today  whats his name  colfax sir  the general laughed i know the breed said he ill bet he didnt thank you  no sir he didnt  i like his grit said the general emphatically these young bloods are the backbone of this rebellion brice they were made for war they never did anything except horseracing and cockfighting they ride like the devil fight like the devil but dont care a picayune for anything walker had some of em crittenden had some and good lord how they hate a yankee i know this colfax too hes a cousin of that finelooking girl brinsmade spoke of they say hes engaged to her be a pity to disappoint hereh  yes general  why captain i believe you would like to marry her yourself take my advice sir and dont try to tame any wildcats  im glad to do a favor for that young man said the general when stephen had gone off with the slip of paper he had given him i like to do that kind of a favor for any officer when i can did you notice how he flared up when i mentioned the girl  this is why clarence colfax found himself that evening on a hospital steamer of the sanitary commission bound north for st louis     chapter xi bellegarde once more  supper at bellegarde was not the simple meal it had been for a year past at colonel carvels house in town mrs colfax was proud of her table proud of her fried chickens and corn fritters and her desserts how virginia chafed at those suppers and how she despised the guests whom her aunt was in the habit of inviting to some of them and when none was present she was forced to listen to mrs colfaxs prattle about the fashions her tirades against the yankees  im sure he must be dead said that lady one sultry evening in july her tone however was not one of conviction a lazy wind from the river stirred the lawn of virginias gown the girl with her hand on the wicker back of the chair was watching a storm gather to the eastward across the illinois prairie  i dont see why you say that aunt lillian she replied bad news travels faster than good  and not a word from comyn it is cruel of him not to send us a line telling us where his regiment is  virginia did not reply she had long since learned that the wisdom of silence was the best for her aunts unreasonableness certainly if clarences letters could not pass the close lines of the federal troops news of her fathers texas regiment could not come from red river  how was judge whipple today asked mrs colfax presently  very weak he doesnt seem to improve much  i cant see why mrs briceisnt that her namedoesnt take him to her house yankee women are such prudes  virginia began to rock slowly and her foot tapped the porch  mrs brice has begged the judge to come to her but he says he has lived in those rooms and that he will die therewhen the time comes  how you worship that woman virginia you have become quite a yankee yourself i believe spending whole days with her nursing that old man  the judge is an old friend of my fathers i think he would wish it replied the girl in a lifeless voice  her speech did not reveal all the pain and resentment she felt she thought of the old man racked with pain and suffering in the heat lying patient on his narrow bed the only light of life remaining the presence of the two women they came day by day and often margaret brice had taken the place of the old negress who sat with him at night worship margaret brice yes it was worship it had been worship since the day she and her father had gone to the little whitewashed hospital providence had brought them together at the judges bedside the marvellous quiet power of the older woman had laid hold of the girl in spite of all barriers  often when the judges pain was eased sufficiently for him to talk he would speak of stephen the mother never spoke of her son but a light would come into her eyes at this praise of him which thrilled virginia to see and when the good lady was gone and the judge had fallen into slumber it would still haunt her  was it out of consideration for her that mrs brice would turn the judge from this topic which he seemed to love best virginia could not admit to herself that she resented this she had heard stephens letters to the judge they came every week strong and manly they were with plenty of praises for the southern defenders of vicksburg only yesterday virginia had read one of these to mr whipple her face burning well that his face was turned to the window and that stephens mother was not there  he says very little about himself mr whipple complained had it not been for brinsmade we should never know that sherman had his eye on him and had promoted him we should never have known of that exploit at chickasaw bluff but what a glorious victory was grants capture of vicksburg on the fourth of july i guess well make short work of the rebels now  no the judge had not changed much even in illness he would never change virginia laid the letter down and tears started to her eyes as she repressed a retort it was not the first time this had happened at every union victory mr whipple would loose his tongue how strange that with all his thought of others he should fall short here  one day after unusual forbearance mrs brice had overtaken virginia on the stairway well she knew the girls nature and how difficult she must have found repression margaret brice had taken her hand  my dear she had said you are a wonderful woman that was all but virginia had driven back to bellegarde with a strange elation in her heart  some things the judge had forborne to mention and for this virginia was thankful one was the piano but she had overheard shadrach telling old nancy how mrs brice had pleaded with him to move it that he might have more room and air he had been obdurate and colonel carvels name had never once passed his lips  many a night the girl had lain awake listening to the steamboats as they toiled against the rivers current while horror held her horror lest her father at that moment be in mortal agony amongst the heaps left by the battles surges heaps in which like mounds of ashes the fire was not yet dead fearful tales she had heard in the prison hospitals of wounded men lying for days in the southern sun between the trenches at vicksburg or freezing amidst the snow and sleet at donelson  was her bitterness against the north not just what a life had been colonel carvels it had dawned brightly one war had cost him his wife another and he had lost his fortune his home his friends all that was dear to him and that daughter whom he loved best in all the world he was perchance to see no more  mrs colfax yawning had taken a book and gone to bed still virginia sat on the porch while the frogs sang of rain and the lightning quivered across the eastern sky she heard the crunch of wheels in the gravel  a bar of light peopled by moths slanted out of the doorway and fell on a closed carriage a gentleman slowly ascended the steps virginia recognized him as mr brinsmade  your cousin clarence has come home my dear he said he was among the captured at vicksburg and is paroled by general grant  virginia gave a little cry and started forward but he held her hands  he has been wounded  yes she exclaimed yes oh tell me mr brinsmade tell meall  no he is not dead but he is very low mr russell has been kind enough to come with me  she hurried to call the servants but they were all there in the light in african postures of terroralfred and sambo and mammy easter and ned they lifted the limp figure in gray and carried it into the hall chamber his eyes closed his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy heavily virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt  there is little need to dwell on the dark days which followedclarence hanging between life and death that his life was saved was due to virginia and to mammy easter and in no particle to his mother mrs colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing until virginia was driven to desperation and held a council of war with dr polk then her aunt grew jealous talked of a conspiracy and threatened to send for dr brownwhich dr polk implored her to do by spells she wept when they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door she would creep in to him in the night during mammy easters watches and talk him into a raging fever but virginia slept lightly and took the alarm more than one scene these two had in the small hours while ned was riding post haste over the black road to town for the doctor  by the same trusty messenger did virginia contrive to send a note to mrs brice begging her to explain her absence to judge whipple by day or night virginia did not leave bellegarde and once dr polk while walking in the garden found the girl fast asleep on a bench her sewing on her lap would that a master had painted his face as he looked down at her  twas he who brought virginia daily news of judge whipple bad news alas for he seemed to miss her greatly he had become more querulous and exacting with patient mrs brice and inquired for her continually  she would not go but often when he got into his buggy the doctor found the seat filled with roses and fresh fruit well he knew where to carry them  what virginias feelings were at this time no one will ever know god had mercifully given her occupation first with the judge and later when she needed it more with clarence it was she whom he recognized first of all whose name was on his lips in his waking moments with the petulance of returning reason he pushed his mother away unless virginia was at his bedside when he awoke his fever rose he put his hot hand into her cool one and it rested there sometimes for hours then and only then did he seem contented  the wonder was that her health did not fail people who saw her during that fearful summer fresh and with color in her cheeks marvelled greathearted puss russell who came frequently to inquire was quieted before her friend and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that presence anne brinsmade came with her father and wondered a miracle had changed virginia her poise her gentleness her dignity were the effects which people saw her force people felt and this is why we cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature it is god who changeswho cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial happy thrice happy those whom he chasteneth and yet how many are there who could not bear the firewho would cry out at the flame  little by little clarence mended until he came to sit out on the porch in the cool of the afternoon then he would watch for hours the tassels stirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond while the two women sat by at times when mrs colfaxs headaches came on and virginia was alone with him he would talk of the war sometimes of their childhood of the mad pranks they played here at bellegarde of their friends only when virginia read to him the northern account of the battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement and he clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of jackson and the fall of port hudson of love he spoke not a word and now that he was better he ceased to hold her hand but often when she looked up from her book she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon her and a look in them of but one interpretation she was troubled  the doctor came but every other day now in the afternoon it was his custom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with virginia his stout frame filling the rockingchair dr polks indulgence was gossipthough always of a harmless nature how mr cluyme always managed to squirm over to the side which was in favor and how maude catherwoods loveletter to a certain dashing officer of the confederate army had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful democrat it was the doctor who gave virginia news of the judge and sometimes he would mention mrs brice then clarence would raise his head and once she saw with trepidation he had opened his lips to speak  one day the doctor came and virginia looked into his face and divined that he had something to tell her he sat but a few moments and when he arose to go he took her hand  i have a favor to beg of you jinny he said judge has lost his nurse do you think clarence could spare you for a little while every day i shouldnt ask it dr polk continued somewhat hurriedly for him but the judge cannot bear a stranger near him and i am afraid to have him excited while in this condition  mrs brice is ill she cried and clarence watching saw her color go  no replied dr polk but her son stephen has come home from the army he was transferred to laumans brigade and then he was wounded he jangled the keys in his pocket and continued it seems that he had no business in the battle johnston in his retreat had driven animals into all the ponds and shot them and in the hot weather the water was soon poisoned mr brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made the charge and he is now in a dreadful condition he is a fine fellow added the doctor with a sigh general sherman sent a special physician to the boat with him he is subconsciously the doctors arm sought virginias back as though he felt her swaying but he was looking at clarence who had jerked himself forward in his chair his thin hands convulsively clutching at the arms of it he did not appear to see virginia  stephen brice did you say he cried will he die  in his astonishment the doctor passed his palm across his brow and for a moment he did not answer virginia had taken a step from him and was standing motionless almost rigid her eyes on his face  die he said repeating the word mechanically my god i hope not the danger is over and he is resting easily if he were not he said quickly and forcibly i should not be here  the doctors mare passed more than one fleetfooted trotter on the road to town that day and the doctors black servant heard his master utter the word fool twice and with great emphasis  for a long time virginia stood on the end of the porch until the heaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road she felt clarence gaze upon her before she turned to face him  virginia he had called her so of late yes dear  virginia sit here a moment i have something to tell you  she came and took the chair beside him her heart beating her breast rising and falling she looked into his eyes and her own lashes fell before the hopelessness there but he put out his fingers wasted by illness and she took them in her own  he began slowly as if every word cost him pain  virginia we were children together here i cannot remember the time when i did not love you when i did not think of you as my wife all i did when we played together was to try to win your applause that was my nature i could not help it do you remember the day i climbed out on the rotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pearwhen i fell on the roof of alfreds cabin i did not feel the pain it was because you kissed it and cried over me you are crying now he said tenderly dont jinny it isnt to make you sad that i am saying this  i have had a great deal of time to think lately jinny i was not brought up seriouslyto be a man i have been thinking of that day just before you were eighteen when you rode out here how well i remember it it was a purple day the grapes were purple and a purple haze was over there across the river you had been cruel to me you were grown a woman then and i was still nothing but a boy do you remember the doe coming out of the forest and how she ran screaming when i tried to kiss you you told me i was good for nothing please dont interrupt me it was true what you said that i was wild and utterly useless i had never served or pleased any but myselfand you i had never studied or worked you were right when you told me i must learn somethingdo somethingbecome of some account in the world i am just as useless to day  clarence after what you have done for the south  he smiled with peculiar bitterness  what have i done for her he added crossed the river and burned houses i could not build them again floated down the river on a log after a few percussion caps that did not save vicksburg  and how many had the courage to do that she exclaimed  pooh he said courage the whole south has it courage if i did not have that i would send sambo to my fathers room for his ebony box and blow my brains out no jinny i am nothing but a soldier of fortune i never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure to shirk work i wanted to go with walker you remember i wanted to go to kansas i wanted to distinguish myself he added with a gesture but that is all gone now jinny i wanted to distinguish myself for you now i see how an earnest life might have won you no i have not done yet  she raised her head frightened and looked at him searchingly  one day he said one day a good many years ago you and i and uncle comyn were walking along market street in front of judge whipples office and a slave auction was going on a girl was being sold on whom you had set your heart there was some one in the crowd a yankee who bid her in and set her free do you remember him  he saw her profile her lips parted her look far away she inclined her head  yes said her cousin so do i remember him he has crossed my path many times since virginia and mark what i sayit was he whom you had in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of myself it was stephen brice  her eyes flashed upon him quickly  oh how dare you she cried  i dare anything virginia he answered quietly i am not blaming you and i am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you had in mind  the impression of him has never left it fate is in it again that night at the brinsmades when we were in fancy dress i felt that i had lost you when i got back he had been there when i was away and gone again andandyou never told me  it was a horrible mistake max she faltered i was waiting for you down the road and stopped his horse instead itit was nothing  it was fate jinny in that halfhour i lost you how i hated that man he cried how i hated him  hated exclaimed virginia involuntarily oh no  yes he said hated i would have killed him if i could but now  but now  now he has saved my life i have noti could not tell you before he came into the place where i was lying in vicksburg and they told him that my only chance was to come north i turned my back upon him insulted him yet he went to sherman and had me brought hometo you virginia if he loves youand i have long suspected that he does  oh no she cried hiding her face no  i know he loves you jinny her cousin continued calmly inexorably and you know that he does you must feel that he does it was a brave thing to do and a generous he knew that you were engaged to me he thought that he was saving me for you he was giving up the hope of marrying you himself  virginia sprang to her feet unless you had seen her then you had never known the woman in her glory  marry a yankee she cried clarence colfax have you known and loved me all my life that you might accuse me of this never never never transformed he looked incredulous admiration  jinny do you mean it he cried  in answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that was hers and pressed her lips to his forehead long after she had disappeared in the door he sat staring after her  but later when mammy easter went to call her mistress for supper she found her with her face buried in the pillows     chapter x in judge whipples office  after this virginia went to the judges bedside every day in the morning when clarence took his sleep she read his newspapers to him when he was well enough she read the detested missouri democrat which i think was the greatest trial virginia ever had to put up with to have her beloved south abused to have her heroes ridiculed was more than she could bear once when the judge was perceptibly better she flung the paper out of the window and left the room he called her back penitently  my dear he said smiling admiration forgive an old bear a selfish old bear jinny my only excuse is my love for the union when you are not here i lie in agony lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown to me jinny and if god sees fit to spare our great country the day will come when you will go down on your knees and thank him for the inheritance which he saved for your children you are a good woman my dear and a strong one i have hoped that you will see the right that you will marry a great citizen one unwavering in his service and devotion to our republic the judges voice trembled with earnestness as he spoke and the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with the sacred fire of his lifes purpose undaunted as her spirit was she could not answer him then  once only once he said to her virginia i loved your father better than any man i ever knew please god i may see him again before i die  he never spoke of the piano but sometimes at twilight his eyes would rest on the black cloth that hid it  virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud upon a life of happiness that was dead and gone  virginia had not been with judge whipple during the critical week after stephen was brought home but anne had told her that his anxiety was a pitiful thing to see and that it had left him perceptibly weaker certain it was that he was failing fast so fast that on some days virginia watching him would send ned or shadrach in hot haste for dr polk  at noon anne would relieve virginiaanne or her motherand frequently mr brinsmade would come likewise for it is those who have the most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds as the hour for their coming drew near the judge would be seeking the clock and scarce did annes figure appear in the doorway before the question had arisen to his lipsand how is my young captain today  that is what he called himmy young captain virginias choice of her cousin and her devotion to him while seemingly natural enough had drawn many a sigh from anne she thought it strange that virginia herself had never once asked her about stephens condition and she spoke of this one day to the judge with as much warmth as she was capable of  jinnys heart is like steel where a yankee is concerned if her best friend were a yankee  judge whipple checked her smiling  she has been very good to one yankee i know of he said and as for mrs brice i believe she worships her  but when i said that stephen was much better today she swept out of the room as if she did not care whether he lived or died  well anne the judge had answered you women are a puzzle to me i guess you dont understand yourselves he added  that was a strange month in the life of clarence colfaxthe last of his recovery while he was waiting for the news of his exchange bellegarde was never more beautiful for mrs colfax had no whim of letting the place run down because a great war was in progress though devoted to the south she did not consecrate her fortune to it clarence gave as much as he could  whole afternoons virginia and he would sit in the shaded arbor seat or at the cool of the day descend to the bench on the lower tier of the summer garden to steep as it were in the blended perfumes of the roses and the mignonettes and the pinks he was soberer than of old often through the night he pondered on the change in her she too was grave but he was troubled to analyze her gravity her dignity was this merely strength of character the natural result of the trials through which she had passed the habit acquired of being the helper and comforter instead of the helped and comforted long years afterward the brightly colored portrait of her remained in his eyethe simple linen gown of pink or white the brown hair shining in the sunlight the graceful poise of the head and the background of flowersflowers everywhere far from the field of war  sometimes when she brought his breakfast on a tray in the morning there was laughter in her eyes in the days gone by they had been all laughter  they were engaged she was to be his wife he said it over to himself many many times in the day he would sit for a space feasting his eyes upon her until she lifted her look to his and the rich color flooded her face he was not a lover to sit quietly by was clarence and yet as the winged days flew on that is what he did it was not that she did not respond to his advances he did not make them nor could he have told why was it the chivalry inherited from a long life of colfaxes who were gentlemen not wholly something of awe had crept into his feeling for her  as the month wore on and the time drew near for him to go back to the war a state that was not quite estrangement and yet something very like it set in poor clarence doubts bothered him and he dared not give them voice by night he would plan his speechesimpassioned imploring to see her in her marvellous severity was to strike him dumb horrible thought whether she loved him whether she did not love him she would not give him up through the long years of their lives together he would never know he was not a weak man now was clarence colfax he was merely a man possessed of a devil enchained by the power of selfrepression come upon her whom he loved  and day by day that power seemed to grow more intenseinvulnerable among her friends and in the little household it had raised virginia to heights which she herself did not seem to realize she was become the mistress of bellegarde mrs colfax was under its sway and doubly miserable because clarence would listen to her tirades no more  when are you to be married she had ventured to ask him once nor had she taken pains to hide the sarcasm in her voice  his answer bringing with it her remembrance of her husband at certain times when it was not safe to question him had silenced her addison colfax had not been a quiet man when he was quiet he was dangerous  whenever virginia is ready mother he had replied whenever virginia was ready he knew in his heart that if he were to ask her permission to send for dr posthelwaite tomorrow that she would say yes tomorrow cameand with it a great envelope an official answer to clarences report that he was fit for duty once more he had been exchanged he was to proceed to cairo there to await the arrival of the transport indianapolis which was to carry five hundred officers and men from sandusky prison who were going back to fight once more for the confederacy o that they might have seen the north all those brave men who made that sacrifice that they might have realized the numbers and the resources and the wealth arrayed against them  it was a cool day for september a perfect day an auspicious day and yet it went the way of the others before it this was the very fulness of the year the earth giving out the sweetness of her maturity the corn in martial ranks with golden plumes nodding the forest still in its glory of green they walked in silence the familiar paths and alfred clipping the late roses for the supper table shook his white head as they passed him the sun who had begun to hurry on his southward journey went to bed at six the few clothes clarence was to take with him had been packed by virginia in his bag and the two were standing in the twilight on the steps of the house when ned came around the corner he called his young mistress by name but she did not hear him he called again  miss jinny  she started as from a sleep and paused  yes mr johnson said she and smiled he wore that air of mystery so dear to darkeys  gemmen to see you miss jinny  a gentleman she said in surprise where  the negro pointed to the lilac shrubbery  thar  whats all this nonsense ned said clarence sharply if a man is there bring him here at once  reckon he wont come marse clarence said ned he fearful skeered ob de light ob day he got suthin very pertickler fo miss jinny  do you know him clarence demanded  no sahyessahleastwise ibe seed um names robimson  the word was hardly out of his mouth before virginia had leaped down the four feet from the porch to the flowerbed and was running across the lawn toward the shrubbery parting the bushes after her clarence found his cousin confronting a large man whom he recognized as the carrier who brought messages from the south  whats the matter jinny he demanded  pa has got through the lines she said breathlessly hehe came up to see me where is he robinson  he went to judge whipples rooms maam they say the judge is dying i reckoned you knew it miss jinny robinson added contritely  clarence she said i must go at once  i will go with you he said you cannot go alone in a twinkling ned and sambo had the swift pair of horses harnessed and the light carriage was flying over the soft clay road toward the city as they passed mr brinsmades place the moon hung like a great round lantern under the spreading trees about the house clarence caught a glimpse of his cousins face in the light she was leaning forward her gaze fixed intently on the stone posts which stood like monuments between the bushes at the entrance then she drew back again into the dark corner of the barouche she was startled by a sharp challenge and the carriage stopped looking out she saw the provosts guard like black card figures on the road and ned fumbling for his pass  on they drove into the city streets until the dark bulk of the court house loomed in front of them and ned drew rein at the little stairway which led to the judges rooms virginia leaping out of the carriage flew up the steps and into the outer office and landed in the colonels arms  jinny  oh pa she cried why do you risk your life in this way if the yankees catch you  they wont catch me honey he answered kissing her then he held her out at arms length and gazed earnestly into her face trembling she searched his own pa how old you look

she did virginia faltered she was here night and day until her son came home she is a noble woman  her son repeated the colonel stephen brice silas has done nothing the last halfhour but call his name he says he must see the boy before he dies polk says he is not strong enough to come  oh no he is not strong enough cried virginia the colonel looked down at her queerly where is clarence he asked  she had not thought of clarence she turned hurriedly glanced around the room and then peered down the dark stairway  why he came in with me i wonder why he did not follow me up  virginia  yes pa  virginia are you happy  why yes pa  are you going to marry clarence he asked  i have promised she said simply  then after a long pause seeing her father said nothing she added perhaps he was waiting for you to see me alone i will go down to see if he is in the carriage  the colonel started with her but she pulled him back in alarm  you will be seen pa she cried how can you be so reckless  he stayed at the top of the passage holding open the door that she might have light when she reached the sidewalk there was ned standing beside the horses and the carriage empty  ned  yassm miss jinny  wheres mr clarence  he done gone miss tinny  gone  yassm fust i seed was a man plump outn willumss miss jinny he was agwine shufflin up de street when marse clarence put out after him pos hase den he

and pushed open the door  oh pa do you think you are safe here she cried why yes honey i reckon so he answered wheres clarence  ned says he ran after a man who was hiding in an entrance pa i am afraid they are watching the place  i dont think so jinny i came here with polk in his buggy after dark  virginia listening heard footsteps on the stairs and seized her fathers sleeve  think of the risk you are running pa she whispered she would have dragged him to the closet but it was too late the door opened and mr brinsmade entered and with him a lady veiled  at sight of mr carvel mr brinsmade started back in surprise how long he stared at his old friend virginia could not say it seemed to her an eternity but mrs brice has often told since how straight the colonel stood his fine head thrown back as he returned the glance then mr brinsmade came forward with his hand outstretched  comyn said he his voice breaking a little i have known you these many years as a man of unstained honor you are safe with me i ask no questions god will judge whether i have done my duty  mr carvel took his friends hand thank you calvin he said i give you my word of honor as a gentleman that i came into this city for no other reason than to see my daughter and hearing that my old friend was dying i could not resist the temptation sir  mr brinsmade finished for him and his voice shook  to come to his bedside how many men do you think would risk their lives so mrs brice  not many indeed mr brinsmade she answered thank god he will now die happy i know it has been much on his mind  the colonel bowed over her hand  and in his name madamin the name of my oldest and best friendi thank you for what you have done for him i trust that you will allow me to add that i have learned from my daughter to respect and admire you i hope that your son is doing well  he is thank you colonel carvel if he but knew that the judge were dying i could not have kept him at home dr polk says that he must not leave the house or undergo any excitement  just then the door of the inner room opened and dr polk came out he bowed gravely to mrs brice and mr brinsmade and he patted virginia  the judge is still asleep he said gently andhe may not wake up in this world  silently sadly they went together into that little room where so much of judge whipples life had been spent how little it was and how completely they filled itthese five people and the big rothfield covered with the black cloth virginia pressed her fathers arm as they leaned against it and brushed her eyes the doctor turned the wick of the nightlamp  what was that upon the sleepers face from which they drew back a smile yes and a light the divine light which is shed upon those who have lived for others who have denied themselves the lusts of the flesh for a long space perhaps an hour they stayed silent save for a low word now and again from the doctor as he felt the judges heart tableaux from the past floated before virginias eyes of the old days of the happy days in locust street of the judge quarrelling with her father and she and captain lige smiling nearby and she remembered how sometimes when the controversy was finished the judge would rub his nose and say  its my turn now lige  whereupon the captain would open the piano and she would play the hymn that he liked best it was lead kindly light  what was it in silas whipples nature that courted the pain of memories what pleasure could it have been all through his illness to look upon this silent and cruel reminder of days gone by forever she had heard that stephen brice had been with the judge when he had bid it in she wondered that he had allowed it for they said that he was the only one who had ever been known to break the judges will virginias eyes rested on margaret brice who was seated at the head of the bed smoothing the pillows the strength of stephens features were in hers but not the ruggedness her features were large indeed yet stanch and softened the widow as if feeling virginias look upon her glanced up from the judges face and smiled at her the girl colored with pleasure and again at the thought which she had had of the likeness between mother and son  still the judge slept on while they watched and at length the thought of clarence crossed virginias mind  why had he not returned perhaps he was in the office without whispering to her father she stole out on tiptoe the office was empty descending to the street she was unable to gain any news of clarence from ned who was becoming alarmed likewise  perplexed and troubled she climbed the stairs again no sound came from the judges room perhaps clarence would be back at any moment perhaps her father was in danger she sat down to thinkher elbows on the desk in front of her her chin in her hand her eyes at the level of a line of books which stood on endchittys pleadings blackstone greenleaf on evidence absently as a person whose mind is in trouble she reached out and took one of them down and opened it across the flyleaf in a high and bold hand was written the name stephen atterbury brice  it was his desk she was sitting in his chair  she dropped the book and rising abruptly crossed quickly to the other side of the room then she turned hesitatingly and went back this was his deskhis chair in which he had worked so faithfully for the man who lay dying beyond the door for him whom they all lovedwhose last hours they were were to soothe wars and schisms may part our bodies but stronger ties unite our souls through silas whipple through his mother virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with stephen brice in a thousand ways she was reminded lest she drive it from her belief she might marry another and that would not matter  she sank again into his chair and gave herself over to the thoughts crowding in her heart how the threads of his life ran next to hers and crossed and recrossed them the slave auction her dance with him the fair the meeting at mr brinsmades gateshe knew them all her love and admiration for his mother her dreams of himfor she did dream of him and now he had saved clarences life that she might marry her cousin was it true that she would marry clarence that seemed to her only a dream it had never seemed real again she glanced at the signature in the book as if fascinated by the very strength of it she turned over a few pages of the book supposing the defendants counsel essays to prove by means of that was his writing again a marginal note there were marginal notes on every pageeven the last was covered with them and then at the end first reading february 1858 second reading july 1858 bought with some of money obtained by first article for m d that capacity for work incomparable gift was what she had always coveted the most again she rested her elbows on the desk and her chin on her hands and sighed unconsciously  she had not heard the step on the stair she had not seen the door open she did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his voice and then she thought that she was dreaming  miss carvel  yes her head did not move he took a step toward her  miss carvel  slowly she raised her face to his unbelief and wonder in her eyesunbelief and wonder and fright no it could not be he but when she met the quality of his look the grave tenderness of it she trembled and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting quivered and became a blur  he never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him she herself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person exhaled it seemed to have come upon him suddenly he needed not to have spoken for her to have felt that what it was she could not tell she knew alone that it was nigh irresistible and she grasped the back of the chair as though material support might sustain her  is hedead  she was breathing hard  no she said notnot yet they are waiting for the end  and you he asked in grave surprise glancing at the door of the judges room  then she remembered clarence  i am waiting for my cousin she said  even as she spoke she was with this man again at the brinsmade gate those had been her very words intuition told her that he too was thinking of that time now he had found her at his desk and as if that were not humiliation enough with one of his books taken down and laid open at his signature suffused she groped for words to carry her on  i am waiting for clarence mr brice he was here and is gone somewhere  he did not seem to take account of the speech and his silencegoad to indiscretionpressed her to add you saved him mr brice iwe allthank you so much and that is not all i want to say it is a poor enough acknowledgment of what you didfor we have not always treated you well her voice faltered almost to faintness as he raised his hand in pained protest but she continued i shall regard it as a debt i can never repay it is not likely that in my life to come i can ever help you but i shall pray for that opportunity  he interrupted her  i did nothing miss carvel nothing that the most unfeeling man in our army would not do nothing that i would not have done for the merest stranger  you saved him for me she said  o fateful words that spoke of themselves she turned away from him for very shame and yet she heard him saying yes i saved him for you  his voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength to suffer to put aside the thought of self a note to which her soul responded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of woman  oh you ought not to have come here tonight why did you come the doctor forbade it the consequences may kill you  it does not matter much he answered the judge was dying  how did you know  i guessed itbecause my mother had left me  oh you ought not to have come she said again  the judge has been my benefactor he answered quietly i could walk and it was my duty to come  you did not walk she gasped  he smiled i had no carriage he said  with the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under him you must sit down at once she cried  but i am not tired he replied  oh you must sit down you must captain brice he started at the title which came so prettily from her lips wont you please she said pleadingly  he sat down and as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky she smiled  it is your chair she said  he glanced at the book and the bit of sky was crimson but still he said nothing  it is your book she stammered i did not know that it was yours when i took it down ii was looking at it while i was waiting for clarence  it is dry reading he remarked which was not what he wished to say  and yet  yes  and yet you have read it twice the confession had slipped to her lips  she was sitting on the edge of his desk looking down at him still he did not look at her all the will that was left him averted his head and the seal of honor was upon his speech and he wondered if man were ever more tempted  then the evil spread its wings and soared away into the night and the moment was past peace seemed to come upon them both quieting the tumult in their hearts and giving them back their reason respect like wise came to the girlrespect that was akin to awe it was he who spoke first  my mother has me how faithfully you nursed the judge miss carvel it was a very noble thing to do  not noble at all she replied hastily your mother did the most of it and he is an old friend of my father  it was none the less noble said stephen warmly and he quarrelled with colonel carvel  my father quarrelled with him she corrected it was well that i should make some atonement and yet mine was no atonement i love judge whipple it was aa privilege to see your mother every dayoh how he would talk of you i think he loves you better than any one on this earth  tell me about him said stephen gently  virginia told him and into the narrative she threw the whole of her pentup self how patient the judge had been and the joy he had derived from stephens letters you were very good to write to him so often she said it seemed like a dream to stephen like one of the many dreams of her the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken he could not recall a time when she had not been rebellious antagonistic and nowas he listened to her voice with its exquisite low tones and modulations as he sat there in this sacred intimacy perchance to be the last in his life he became dazed his eyes softened with supreme eloquence cried out that she was his forever and forever the magnetic force which god uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her and yet the puritan resisted  then the door swung open and clarence colfax out of breath ran into the room he stopped short when he saw them his hand fell to his sides and his words died on his lips virginia did not stir  it was stephen who rose to meet him and with her eyes the girl followed his motions the broad and loosely built frame of the northerner his shoulders slightly stooping contrasted with clarences slighter figure erect compact springy the southerners eye for that moment was flint struck with the spark from the steel stephens face thinned by illness was grave the eyes kindly yet penetrating for an instant they stood thus regarding each other neither offering a hand it was stephen who spoke first and if there was a trace of emotion in his voice one who was listening intently failed to mark it  i am glad to see that you have recovered colonel colfax he said  i should indeed be without gratitude if i did not thank captain brice for my life answered clarence virginia flushed she had detected the undue accent on her cousins last words and she glanced apprehensively at stephen his forceful reply surprised them both  miss carvel has already thanked me sufficiently sir he said i am happy to have been able to have done you a good turn and at the same time to have served her so well it was she who saved your life it is to her your thanks are chiefly due i believe that i am not going too far colonel colfax he added when i congratulate you both  before her cousin could recover virginia slid down from the desk and had come between them how her eyes shone and her lip trembled as she gazed at him stephen has never forgotten what a woman she was as she took her cousins arm and made him a curtsey  what you have done may seem a light thing to you captain brice she said that is apt to be the way with those who have big hearts you have put upon colonel colfax and upon me a lifes obligation  when she began to speak clarence raised his head as he glanced incredulous from her to stephen his look gradually softened and when she had finished his manner had become again frank boyish impetuousnay penitent he seized stephens hand  forgive me brice he cried forgive me i should have known better ii did you an injustice and you virginia i was a foola scoundrel stephen shook his head  no you were neither he said then upon his face came the smile of one who has the strength to renounce all that is dearest to himthat smile of the unselfish sweetest of all it brought tears to virginia she was to see it once again upon the features of one who bore a crossabraham lincoln clarence looked and then he turned away toward the door to the stairway as one who walks blindly in a sorrow  his hand was on the knob when virginia seemed to awake she flew after him  wait she whispered  then she raised her eyes slowly to stephen who was standing motionless beside his chair  captain brice  yes he answered  my father is in the judges room she said  your father he exclaimed i thought  that he was an officer in the confederate army so he is her head went up as she spoke  stephen stared at her troubled suddenly her manner changed she took a step toward him appealingly  oh he is not a spy she cried he has given mr brinsmade his word that he came here for no other purpose than to see me then he heard that the judge was dying  he has given his word to mr brinsmade  yes  then said stephen what mr brinsmade sanctions is not for me to question  she gave him yet another look a fleeting one which he did not see then she softly opened the door and passed into the room of the dying man stephen followed her as for clarence he stood for a space staring after them then he went noiselessly down the stairs into the street     chapter xi lead kindly light  when the judge opened his eyes for the last time in this world they fell first upon the face of his old friend colonel carvel twice he tried to speak his name and twice he failed the third time he said it faintly  comyn  yes silas  comyn what are you doing here  i reckon i came to see you silas answered the colonel  to see me die said the judge grimly  colonel carvels face twitched and the silence in that little room seemed to throb  comyn said the judge again i heard that you had gone south to fight against your country i see you here can it be that you have at last returned in your allegiances to the flag for which your forefathers died  poor colonel carvel  i am still of the same mind silas he said  the judge turned his face away his thin lips moving as in prayer but they knew that he was not praying silas said mr carvel we were friends for twenty years let us be friends again before  before i die the judge interrupted i am ready to die yes i am ready i have had a hard life comyn and few friends it was my fault ii did not know how to make them yet no man ever valued those few more than but he cried the stern fire unquenched to the last i would that god had spared me to see this rebellion stamped out for it will be stamped out to those watching his eyes seemed fixed on a distant point and the light of prophecy was in them i would that god had spared me to see this union supreme once more yes it will be supreme a high destiny is reserved for this nation i think the highest of all on this earth amid profound silence he leaned back on the pillows from which he had risen his breath coming fast none dared look at the neighbor beside them  it was stephens mother who spoke would you not like to see a clergyman judge she asked  the look on his face softened as he turned to her  no madam he answered you are clergyman enough for me you are near enough to godthere is no one in this room who is not worthy to stand in the presence of death yet i wish that a clergyman were here that he might listen to one thing i have to say when i was a boy i worked my way down the river to new york to see the city i met a bishop there he said to me sit down my son i want to talk to you i know your father in albany you are senator whipples son i said to him no sir i am not senator whipples son i am no relation of his if the bishop had wished to talk to me after that mrs brice he might have made my life a little easiera little sweeter i know that they are not all like that but it was by just such things that i was embittered when i was a boy he stopped and when he spoke again it was more slowly more gently than any of them had heard him speak in all his life before i wish that some of the blessings which i am leaving now had come to me thenwhen i was a boy i might have done my little share in making the world a brighter place to live in as all of you have done yes as all of you are now doing for me i am leaving the world with a better opinion of it than i ever held in life god hid the sun from me when i was a little child margaret brice he said if i had had such a mother as you i would have been softened then i thank god that he sent you when he did  the widow bowed her head and a tear fell upon his pillow  i have done nothing she murmured nothing  so shall they answer at the last whom he has chosen said the judge i was sick and ye visited me he has promised to remember those who do that hold up your head my daughter god has been good to you he has given you a son whom all men may look in the face of whom you need never be ashamed stephen said the judge come here  stephen made his way to the bedside but because of the moisture in his eyes he saw but dimly the gaunt face and yet he shrank back in awe at the change in it so must all of the martyrs have looked when the fire of the faggots licked their feet so must john bunyan have stared through his prison bars at the sky  stephen he said you have been faithful in a few things so shall you be made ruler over many things the little i have i leave to you and the chief of this is an untarnished name i know that you will be true to it because i have tried your strength listen carefully to what i have to say for i have thought over it long in the days gone by our fathers worked for the good of the people and they had no thought of gain a time is coming when we shall need that blood and that bone in this republic wealth not yet dreamed of will flow out of this land and the waters of it will rot all save the pure and corrupt all save the incorruptible halftried men wilt go down before that flood you and those like you will remember how your fathers governedstrongly sternly justly it was so that they governed themselves  be vigilant serve your city serve your state but above all serve your country  he paused to catch his breath which was coming painfully now and reached out his bony hand to seek stephens i was harsh with you at first my son he went on i wished to try you and when i had tried you i wished your mind to open to keep pace with the growth of this nation i sent you to see abraham lincoln that you might be born againin the west you were born again i saw it when you came backi saw it in your face o god he cried with sudden eloquence i would that his handsabraham lincolns handsmight be laid upon all who complain and cavil and criticise and think of the little things in life i would that his spirit might possess their spirit  he stopped again they marvelled and were awed for never in all his days had such speech broken from this man goodby stephen he said when they thought he was not to speak again hold the image of abraham lincoln in front of you never forget him youyou are a man after his own heartandand mine  the last word was scarcely audible they started for ward for his eyes were closed but presently he stirred again and opened them  brinsmade he said brinsmade take care of my orphan girls send shadrach here  the negro came forth shuffling and sobbing from the doorway  you aint gwine away marse judge  yes shadrach goodby you have served me well i have left you provided for  shadrach kissed the hand of whose secret charity he knew so much then the judge withdrew it and motioned to him to rise he called his oldest friend by name and colonel carvel came from the corner where he had been listening with his face drawn  goodby comyn you were my friend when there was none other you were true to me when the hand of every man was against me youyou have risked your life to come to me here may god spare it for virginia  at the sound of her name the girl started she came and bent over him and when she kissed him on the forehead he trembled  uncle silas she faltered  weakly he reached up and put his hands on her shoulders he whispered in her ear the tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the button at his throat  there on a piece of cotton twine hung a little key she took it off but still his hands held her  i have saved it for you my dear he said god bless you why did his eyes seek stephensand make your life happy virginiawill you play my hymnonce moreonce more  they lifted the night lamp from the piano and the medicine it was stephen who stripped it of the black cloth it had worn who stood by virginia ready to lift the lid when she had turned the lock the girls exaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the wellremembered chords and those who heard were lifted lifted far above and beyond the power of earthly spell         lead kindly light amid the encircling gloom         lead thou me on         the night is dark and i am far from home         lead thou me on         keep thou my feet i do not ask to see         the distant scene one step enough for me  a sigh shook silas whipples wasted frame and he died     volume 8     chapter xii the last card  mr brinsmade and the doctor were the first to leave the little room where silas whipple had lived and worked and died mr brinsmade bent upon one of those errands which claimed him at all times he took shadrach with him virginia sat on a vague fear haunting hera fear for her fathers safety where was clarence what had he seen was the place watched these questions at first intruding upon her sorrow remained to torture her  softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano and opened the door of the outer office a clock in a steeple near by was striking twelve the colonel did not raise his head only stephen saw her go she felt his eyes following her and as she slipped out lifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the door then it closed behind her  first of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning dimly and the discovery gave her a shock who had turned it down had clarence was he here fearfully searching the room for him her gaze was held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the room a solid bulky figure it was and though uncertainly outlined in the semidarkness she knew it she took a step nearer and a cry escaped her  the man was eliphalet hopper he got down from the sill with a motion at once sheepish and stealthy her breath caught and instinctively she gave back toward the door as if to open it again  hold on he said ive got something i want to say to you miss virginia  his tones seemed strangely natural they were not brutal but she shivered and paused horrified at the thought of what she was about to do her father was in that roomand stephen she must keep them there and get this man away she must not show fright before him and yet she could not trust her voice to speak just then she must not let him know that she was afraid of himthis she kept repeating to herself but how to act suddenly an idea flashed upon her  virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him even swiftly and turn up the gas he started back blinking as the jet flared for a moment she stood beside it with her head high confronting him and striving to steady herself for speech  why have you come here she said judge whipplediedtonight  the dominating note in his answer was a whine as if in spite of himself he were awed  i aint here to see the judge  she was pale and quite motionless and she faltered now she felt her lips moving but knew not whether the words had come  what do you mean  he gained confidence the look in his little eyes was the filmy look of those of an animal feasting  i came here to see you he said you she was staring at him now in horror and if you dont give me what i want i callate to see some one elsein there said mr hopper  he smiled for she was swaying her lids half closed by a supreme effort she conquered her terror and looked at him the look was in his eyes still intensified now  how dare you speak to me after what has happened she said if colonel carvel were here he wouldkill you  he flinched at the name and the word involuntarily he wiped his forehead hot at the very thought  i want to know he exclaimed in fainthearted irony then remembering his advantage he stepped close to her  he is here he said intense now he is here in that there room he seized her wrists virginia struggled and yet she refrained from crying out he never leaves this city without i choose i can have him hung if i choose he whispered next to her  oh she cried oh if you choose  still his body crept closer and his face closer and her strength was going  theres but one price to pay he said hoarsely theres but one price to pay and thats youyou i callate youll marry me now  delirious at the touch of her he did not hear the door open her senses were strained for that very sound she heard it close again and a footstep across the room she knew the stepshe knew the voice and her heart leaped at the sound of it in anger an arm in a blue sleeve came between them and eliphalet hopper staggered and fell across the books on the table his hand to his face above him towered stephen brice towered was the impression that came to virginia then and so she thought of the scene ever afterward small bits like points of tempered steel glittered in stephens eyes and his hands following up the mastery he had given them clutched mr hoppers shoulders twice stephen shook him so that his head beat upon the table  youyou beast he cried but he kept his voice low and then as if he expected hopper to reply shall i kill you  again he shook him violently he felt virginias touch on his arm  stephen she cried your wounds be careful oh do be careful  she had called him stephen he turned slowly and his hands fell from mr hoppers cowering form as his eyes met hers even he could not fathom the appeal the yearning in their dark blue depths and yet what he saw there made him tremble she turned away trembling too  please sit down she entreated hehe wont touch me again while you are here  eliphalet hopper raised himself from the desk and one of the big books fell with a crash to the floor then they saw him shrink his eyes fixed upon some one behind them before the judges door stood colonel carvel in calm familiar posture his feet apart and his head bent forward as he pulled at his goatee  what is this man doing here virginia he asked she did not answer him nor did speech seem to come easily to mr hopper in that instant perhaps the sight of colonel carvel had brought before him too vividly the memory of that afternoon at glencoe  all at once virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this mans hands at a word from him her father would be shot as a spyand stephen brice perhaps as a traitor but if colonel carvel should learn that he had seized herhere was the terrible danger of the situation well she knew what the colonel would do would stephen tell him she trusted in his coolness that he would not  before a word of reply came from any of the three a noise was heard on the stairway some one was coming up there followed four seconds of suspense and then clarence came in she saw that his face wore a worried dejected look it changed instantly when he glanced about him and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out eliphalet hopper standing in sullen aggressiveness beside the table  so youre the spy are you he said in disgust then he turned his back and faced his uncle i saw him in williamss entry as we drove up he got away from me  a thought seemed to strike him he strode to the open window at the back of the office and looked out there was a roof under it  the sneak got in here he said he knew i was waiting for him in the street so youre the spy are you  mr hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where stephen had struck him  no i aint the spy he said with a meaning glance at the colonel  then what are you doing here demanded clarence fiercely  i callate that he knows eliphalet replied jerking his head toward colonel carvel wheres his confederate uniform whats to prevent my calling up the provosts guard below he continued with a smile that was hideous on his swelling face  it was the colonel who answered him very quickly and very clearly  nothing whatever mr hopper he said this is the way out he pointed at the door stephen who was watching him could not tell whether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the colonels mouth as he added you might prefer the window  mr hopper did not move but his eyes shifted to virginias form stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see her  what are you waiting for said the colonel in the mild voice that should have been an ominous warning still mr hopper did not move it was clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this that he had waited in the window to deal with virginia alone but now the very force of a desire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless his voice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain  lets be calm about this business colonel he said we wont say anything about the past but i aint set on having you shot theres a consideration that would stop me and i callate you know what it is  then the colonel made a motion but before he had taken a step virginia had crossed the room swiftly and flung herself upon him  oh dont pa she cried dont tell him that i will agree to it yes i will i cant have youshot the last word came falteringly faintly  let me gohoney whispered the colonel gently his eyes did not leave eliphalet he tried to disengage himself but her fingers were clasped about his neck in a passion of fear and love and then while she clung to him her head was raised to listen the sound of stephen brices voice held her as in a spell his words were coming coldly deliberately and yet so sharply that each seemed to fall like a lash  mr hopper if ever i hear of your repeating what you have seen or heard in this room i will make this city and this state too hot for you to live in i know you i know how you hide in areas how you talk sedition in private how you have made money out of other mens misery and what is more i can prove that you have had traitorous dealings with the confederacy general sherman has been good enough to call himself a friend of mine and if he prosecutes you for your dealings in memphis you will get a term in a government prison you ought to be hung colonel carvel has shown you the door now go  and mr hopper went     chapter xiii from the letters of major stephen brice  of the staff of general sherman on the march to the sea and on the march from savannah northward  headquarters military division of the mississippi goldsboro nc march 24 1865  dear mother the south carolina campaign is a thing of the past i pause as i write these wordsthey seem so incredible to me we have marched the four hundred and twentyfive miles in fifty days and the general himself has said that it is the longest and most important march ever made by an organized army in a civilized country i know that you will not be misled by the words civilized country not until the history of this campaign is written will the public realize the wide rivers and all but impassable swamps we have crossed with our baggage trains and artillery the roads by courtesy so called were a sea of molasses and every mile of them has had to be corduroyed for fear of worrying you i did not write you from savannah how they laughed at us for starting at that season of the year they said we would not go ten miles and i most solemnly believe that no one but uncle billy and an army organized and equipped by him could have gone ten miles nothing seems to stop him you have probably remarked in the tone of my letters ever since we left kingston for the sea a growing admiration for my general  it seems very strange that this wonderful tactician can be the same man i met that day going to the arsenal in the streetcar and again at camp jackson i am sure that history will give him a high place among the commanders of the world certainly none was ever more tireless than he he never fights a battle when it can be avoided and his march into columbia while threatening charleston and augusta was certainly a master stroke of strategy  i think his simplicity his most remarkable trait you should see him as he rides through the army an erect figure with his clothes all angular and awry and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes you can hear his name running from file to file and some times the new regiments cant resist cheering he generally says to the colonelstop that noise sir dont like it  on our march to the sea if the orders were ever given to turn northward the boys would get very much depressed one moonlight night i was walking my horse close to the generals over the pine needles when we overheard this conversation between two soldiers say john said one i guess uncle billy dont know our corps is goin north  i wonder if he does said john if i could only get a sight of them white socks id know it was all right  the general rode past without a word but i heard him telling the story to mower the next day  i can find little if any change in his manner since i knew him first he is brusque but kindly and he has the same comradeship with officers and menand even the negroes who flock to our army but few dare to take advantage of it and they never do so twice i have been very near to him and have tried not to worry him or ask many foolish questions sometimes on the march he will beckon me to close up to him and we have a conversation something on this order theres kenesaw brice  yes sir  pointing with his arm  went beyond lines there with small party rebel battery on summit had to git fired on next day i thought rebels would leave in the night got up before daylight fixed telescope on stand and waited watched top of kenesaw no rebel saw one blue man creep up very cautious looked around waved his hat rebels gone thought so  this gives you but a faint idea of the vividness of his talk when we make a halt for any time the general officers and their staffs flock to headquarters to listen to his stories when anything goes wrong his perception of it is like a lightning flashand he acts as quickly  by the way i have just found the letter he wrote me offering this staff position please keep it carefully as it is something i shall value all my life     gaylesville alabama october 25 1864     major stephen a brice     dear sirthe world goes on and wicked men sound asleep davis    has sworn to destroy my army and beauregard has come to do the    workso if you expect to share in our calamity come down i    offer you this last chance for staff duty and hope you have had    enough in the field i do not wish to hurry you but you cant get    aboard a ship at sea so if you want to make the trip come to    chattanooga and take your chances of meeting me                 yours truly                    w t sherman major general  one nightat cheraw i think it washe sent for me to talk to him i found him lying on a bed of spanish moss they had made for him he asked me a great many questions about st louis and praised mr brinsmade especially his management of the sanitary commission  brice he said after a while you remember when grant sent me to beat off joe johnstons army from vicksburg you were wounded then by the way in that dash lauman made grant thought he ought to warn me against johnston  hes wily sherman said he hes a dangerous man  grant said i you give me men enough and time enough to look over the ground and im not afraid of the devil  nothing could sum up the man better than that and now what a trick of fate it is that he has johnston before him again in what we hope will prove the last gasp of the war he likes johnston by the way and has the greatest respect for him  i wish you could have peeped into our camp once in a while in the rare bursts of sunshine on this march our premises have been decorated with gay red blankets and sombre gray ones brought from the quartermasters and white hudsons bay blankets not so white now all being between forked sticks it is wonderful how the pitching of a few tents and the busy crackle of a few fires and the sound of voicessometimes merry sometimes sad depending on the weather will change the look of a lonely pine knoll you ask me how we fare i should be heartily ashamed if a word of complaint ever fell from my lips but the men whenever i wake up at night with my feet in a puddle between the blankets i think of the men the corduroy roads which our horses stumble over through the mud they make as well as march on our flies are carried in wagons and our utensils and provisions they must often bear on their backs the little dogtents under which put up by their own labor they crawl to sleep wrapped in a blanket they have carried all day perhaps waist deep in water the food they eat has been in their haversacks for many a weary mile and is cooked in the little skillet and pot which have also been a part of their burden then they have their musket and accoutrements and the forty rounds at their backs patiently cheerily tramping along going they know not where nor care much either so it be not in retreat ready to make roads throw up works tear up railroads or hew out and build wooden bridges or best of all to go for the johnnies under hot sun or heavy rain through swamp and mire and quicksand they marched ten miles to storm fort mcallister and how the cheers broke from them when the pop pop pop of the skirmish line began after we came in sight of savannah no man who has seen but not shared their life may talk of personal hardship  we arrived at this pretty little town yesterday so effecting a junction with schofield who got in with the 3d corps the day before i am writing at general schofields headquarters there was a bit of a battle on tuesday at bentonville and we have come hither in smoke as usual but this time we thank heaven that it is not the smoke of burning homesonly some resin the johnnies set on fire before they left  i must close general sherman has just sent for me                 on board despatch boat martin                   at sea march 25 1865  dear mother a most curious thing has happened but i may as well begin at the beginning when i stopped writing last evening at the summons of the general i was about to tell you something of the battle of bentonville on tuesday last mower charged through as bad a piece of wood and swamp as i ever saw and got within one hundred yards of johnston himself who was at the bridge across mill creek of course we did not know this at the time and learned it from prisoners  as i have written you i have been under fire very little since coming to the staff when the battle opened however i saw that if i stayed with the general who was then behind the reserves i would see little or nothing i went ahead to get information beyond the line of battle into the woods i did not find these favorable to landscape views and just as i was turning my horse back again i caught sight of a commotion some distance to my right the rebel skirmish line had fallen back just that instant two of our skirmishers were grappling with a third man who was fighting desperately it struck me as singular that the fellow was not in gray but had on some sort of dark clothes  i could not reach them in the swamp on horseback and was in the act of dismounting when the man fell and then they set out to carry him to the rear still farther to my right beyond the swamp i shouted and one of the skirmishers came up i asked him what the matter was  weve got a spy sir he said excitedly  a spy here  yes major he was hid in the thicket yonder lying flat on his face he reckoned that our boys would run right over him and that hed get into our lines that way tim foley stumbled on him and he put up as good a fight with his fists as any man i ever saw  just then a regiment swept past us that night i told the general who sent over to the headquarters of the 17th corps to inquire the word came back that the mans name was addison and he claimed to be a union sympathizer who owned a plantation near by he declared that he had been conscripted by the rebels wounded sent back home and was now about to be pressed in again he had taken this method of escaping to our lines it was a common story enough but general mower added in his message that he thought the story fishy this was because the mans appearance was very striking and he seemed the type of confederate fighter who would do and dare anything he had a wound which had been a bad one evidently got from a piece of shell but they had been able to find nothing on him sherman sent back word to keep the man until he could see him in person it was about nine oclock last night when i reached the house the general has taken a prisoners guard was resting outside and the hall was full of officers they said that the general was awaiting me and pointed to the closed door of a room that had been the dining room i opened it  two candles were burning in pewter sticks on the bare mahogany table there was the general sitting beside them with his legs crossed holding some crumpled tissue paper very near his eyes and reading he did not look up when i entered i was aware of a man standing tall and straight just out of range of the candles rays he wore the easy dress of a southern planter with the broad felt hat the head was flung back so that there was just a patch of light on the chin and the lids of the eyes in the shadow were half closed  my sensations are worth noting for the moment i felt precisely as i had when i was hit by that bullet in laumans charge i was aware of something very like pain yet i could not place the cause of it but this is what since has made me feel queer you doubtless remember staying at hollingdean when i was a boy and hearing the story of lord northwells daredevil royalist ancestorthe one with the lace collar over the dullgold velvet and the pointed chin and the lazy scorn in the eyes those eyes are painted with drooping lids the first time i saw clarence colfax i thought of that pictureand now i thought of the picture first  the generals voice startled me  major brice do you know this gentleman he asked  yes general  who is he  his name is colfax sircolonel colfax i think  thought so said the general  i have thought much of that scene since as i am steaming northward over green seas and under cloudless skies and it has seemed very unreal i should almost say supernatural when i reflect how i have run across this man again and again and always opposing him i can recall just how he looked at the slave auction which seem so long ago very handsome very boyish and yet with the air of one to be deferred to it was sufficiently remarkable that i should have found him in vicksburg but nowto be brought face to face with him in this old dining room in goldsboro and he a prisoner he had not moved i did not know how he would act but i went up to him and held out my hand and saidhow do you do colonel colfax  i am sure that my voice was not very steady for i cannot help liking him and then his face lighted up and he gave me his hand and he smiled at me and again at the general as much as to say that it was all over he has a wonderful smile  we seem to run into each other major brice said he  the pluck of the man was superb i could see that the general too was moved from the way he looked at him and he speaks a little more abruptly at such times  guess that settles it colonel he said  i reckon it does general said clarence still smiling the general turned from him to the table with a kind of jerk and clapped his hand on the tissue paper  these speak for themselves sir he said it is very plain that they would have reached the prominent citizens for whom they were intended if you had succeeded in your enterprise you were captured out of uniform you know enough of war to appreciate the risk you ran any statement to make  no sir  call captain vaughan brice and ask him to conduct the prisoner back  may i speak to him general i asked the general nodded  i asked him if i could write home for him or do anything else that seemed to touch him some day i shall tell you what he said  then vaughan took him out and i heard the guard shoulder arms and tramp away in the night the general and i were left alone with the mahogany table between us and a family portrait of somebody looking down on us from the shadow on the wall a moist spring air came in at the open windows and the candles flickered after a silence i ventured to say  i hope he wont be shot general  dont know brice he answered cant tell now hate to shoot him but war is war magnificent class he belongs topity we should have to fight those fellows  he paused and drummed on the table brice said he im going to send you to general grant at city point with despatches im sorry dunn went back yesterday but it cant be helped can you start in half an hour  yes sir  youll have to ride to kinston the railroad wont be through until tomorrow ill telegraph there and to general easton at morehead city hell have a boat for you tell grant i expect to run up there in a day or two myself when things are arranged here you may wait until i come  yes sir  i turned to go but clarence colfax was on my mind general  eh what  general could you hold colonel colfax until i see you again  it was a bold thing to say and i quaked and he looked at me in his keen way through and through you saved his life once before didnt you  you allowed me to have him sent home from vicksburg sir  he answered with one of his jokesapropos of something he said on the court house steps at vicksburg perhaps i shall tell it to you sometime  well well he said ill see ill see thank god this war is pretty near over ill let you know brice before i shoot him  i rode the thirty odd miles to kinston inlittle more than three hours a locomotive was waiting for me and i jumped into a cab with a friendly engineer soon we were roaring seaward through the vast pine forests it was a lonely journey and you were much in my mind my greatest apprehension was that we might be derailed and the despatches captured for as fast as our army had advanced the track of it had closed again like the wake of a ship at sea guerillas were roving about tearing up ties and destroying bridges  there was one fiveminute interval of excitement when far down the tunnel through the forest we saw a light gleaming the engineer said there was no house there that it must be a fire but we did not slacken our speed and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until we were upon them  not one gaunt figure stood between them and us not one shot broke the stillness of the night as dawn broke i beheld the flat gray waters of the sound stretching away to the eastward and there was the boat at the desolate wharf beside the warehouse her steam rising white in the chill morning air     chapter xiv the same continued               headquarters armies of the united states               city point virginia march 28 1865  dear mother i arrived here safely the day before yesterday and i hope that you will soon receive some of the letters i forwarded on that day it is an extraordinary place this city point a military city sprung up like a mushroom in a winter and my breath was quite taken away when i first caught sight of it on the high tableland the great bay in front of it which the appomattox helps to make is a maze of rigging and smokepipes like the harbor of a prosperous seaport there are gunboats and supply boats schooners and squareriggers and steamers all huddled together and our captain pointed out to me the malvern flying admiral porters flag barges were tied up at the long wharves and these were piled high with wares and flanked by squat warehouses although it was sunday a locomotive was puffing and panting along the foot of the ragged bank  high above on the flat promontory between the two rivers is the city of tents and wooden huts the great trees in their fresh faint green towering above the low roofs at the point of the bluff a large flag drooped against its staff and i did not have to be told that this was general grants headquarters  there was a fine steamboat lying at the wharf and i had hardly stepped ashore before they told me she was president lincolns i read the name on herthe river queen yes the president is here too with his wife and family  there are many fellows here with whom i was brought up in boston i am living with jack hancock whom you will remember well he is a captain now and has a beard  but i must go on with my story i went straight to general grants headquartersjust a plain rough slat house such as a contractor might build for a temporary residence only the high flagstaff and the stars and stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind a group of officers stood chatting outside of it and they told me that the general had walked over to get his mail he is just as unassuming and democratic as my general general rankin took me into the office a rude room and we sat down at the long table there presently the door opened and a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned he was smoking a cigar we rose to our feet and i saluted  it was the generalinchief he stared at me but said nothing  general this is major brice of general shermans staff he has brought despatches from goldsboro said rankin  he nodded took off his hat and laid it on the table and reached out for the despatches while reading them he did not move except to light another cigar i am getting hardened to unrealitiesperhaps i should say marvels now our country abounds in them it did not seem so strange that this silent general with the baggy trousers was the man who had risen by leaps and bounds in four years to be generalinchief of our armies his face looks older and more sunken than it did on that day in the street near the arsenal in st louis when he was just a military carpetbagger out of a job he is not changed otherwise but how different the impressions made by the man in authority and the same man out of authority  he made a sufficient impression upon me then as i told you at the time that was because i overheard his wellmerited rebuke to hopper but i little dreamed that i was looking on the man who was to come out of the west and save this country from disunion and how quietly and simply he has done it without parade or pomp or vainglory of all those who with every means at their disposal have tried to conquer lee he is the only one who has in any manner succeeded he has been able to hold him fettered while sherman has swept the confederacy and these are the two men who were unknown when the war began  when the general had finished reading the despatches he folded them quickly and put them in his pocket  sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours major he said  i talked with him for about half an hour i should rather say talked to him he is a marked contrast to sherman in this respect i believe that he only opened his lips to ask two questions you may well believe that they were worth the asking and they revealed an intimate knowledge of our march from savannah i was interrupted many times by the arrival of different generals aides etc he sat there smoking imperturbable sometimes he said yes or no but oftener he merely nodded his head once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant who floundered the general seemed to know more than he about the matter he had in hand  when i left him he asked me where i was quartered and said he hoped i would be comfortable  jack hancock was waiting for me and we walked around the city which even has barber shops everywhere were signs of preparation for the roads are getting dry and the general preparing for a final campaign against lee poor lee what a marvellous fight he has made with his material i think that he will be reckoned among the greatest generals of our race  of course i was very anxious to get a glimpse of the president and so we went down to the wharf where we heard that he had gone off for a horseback ride they say that he rides nearly every day over the corduroy roads and through the swamps and wherever the boys see that tall hat they cheer they know it as well as the lookout tower on the flats of bermuda hundred he lingers at the campfires and swaps stories with the officers and entertains the sick and wounded in the hospitals isnt it like him  he hasnt changed either i believe that the great men dont change away with your napoleons and your marlboroughs and your stuarts these are the days of simple men who command by force of character as well as knowledge thank god for the american i believe that he will change the world and strip it of its vainglory and hypocrisy  in the evening as we were sitting around hancocks fire an officer came in  is major brice here he asked i jumped up  the president sends his compliments major and wants to know if you would care to pay him a little visit  if i would care to pay him a little visit that officer had to hurry to keep up with the as i walked to the wharf he led me aboard the river queen and stopped at the door of the aftercabin  mr lincoln was sitting under the lamp slouched down in his chair in the position i remembered so well it was as if i had left him but yesterday he was whittling and he had made some little toy for his son tad who ran out as i entered  when he saw me the president rose to his great height a sombre towering figure in black he wears a scraggly beard now but the sad smile the kindly eyes in their dark caverns the voiceall were just the same i stopped when i looked upon the face it was sad and lined when i had known it but now all the agony endured by the millions north and south seemed written on it  dont you remember me major he asked  the wonder was that he had remembered me i took his big bony hand which reminded me of judge whipples yes it was just as if i had been with him always and he were still the gaunt country lawyer  yes sir i said indeed i do  he looked at me with that queer expression of mirth he sometimes has  are these boston ways steve he asked theyre tenacious i didnt think that any man could travel so close to sherman and keep em  theyre unfortunate ways sir i said if they lead you to misjudge me  he laid his hand on my shoulder just as he had done at freeport  i know you steve he said i shuck an ear of corn before i buy it ive kept tab on you a little the last five years and when i heard sherman had sent a major brice up here i sent for you  what i said was boyish i tried very hard to get a glimpse of you today mr lincoln i wanted to see you again  he was plainly pleased  im glad to hear it steve he said then you havent joined the ranks of the grumblers you havent been one of those who would have liked to try running this country for a day or two just to show me how to do it  no sir i said laughing  good he cried slapping his knee i didnt think you were that kind steve now sit down and tell me about this general of mine who wears sevenleagued boots what was itfour hundred and twenty miles in fifty days how many navigable rivers did he step across he began to count on those long fingers of his the edisto the broad the catawba the pedee and  the cape fear i said  isis the general a nice man asked mr lincoln his eyes twinkling  yes sir he is that i answered heartily and not a man in the army wants anything when he is around you should see that army of the mississippi sir they arrived in goldsboro in splendid condition  he got up and gathered his coattails under his arms and began to walk up and down the cabin  what do the boys call the general he asked  i told him uncle billy and thinking the story of the white socks might amuse him i told him that it did amuse him  well now he said any man that has a nickname like that is all right thats the best recommendation you can give the generaljust say uncle billy he put one lip over the other youve given uncle billy a good recommendation steve he said did you ever hear the story of mr wallaces irish gardener  no sir  well when wallace was hiring his gardener he asked him whom he had been living with  misther dalton sorr  have you a recommendation terence  a ricommindation is it sorr sure i have nothing agin misther dalton though he moightnt be knowing just the respict the likes of a firstclass garthener is entitled to  he did not laugh he seldom does it seems at his own stories but i could not help laughing over the ricommindation i had given the general he knew that i was embarrassed and said kindly now tell me something about uncle billys bummers i hear that they have a most effectual way of tearing up railroads  i told him of poes contrivance of the hook and chain and how the heaviest rails were easily overturned with it and how the ties were piled and fired and the rails twisted out of shape the president listened to every word with intense interest  by jing he exclaimed we have got a general caesar burnt his bridges behind him but sherman burns his rails now tell me some more  he helped me along by asking questions then i began to tell him how the negroes had flocked into our camps and how simply and plainly the general had talked to them advising them against violence of any kind and explaining to them that freedom meant only the liberty to earn their own living in their own way and not freedom from work  we have got a general sure enough he cried he talks to them plainly does he so that they understand i say to you brice he went on earnestly the importance of plain talk cant be overestimated any thought however abstruse can be put in speech that a boy or a negro can grasp any book however deep can be written in terms that everybody can comprehend if a man only tries hard enough when i was a boy i used to hear the neighbors talking and it bothered me so because i could not understand them that i used to sit up half the night thinking things out for myself i remember that i did not know what the word demonstrate meant so i stopped my studies then and there and got a volume of euclid before i got through i could demonstrate everything in it and i have never been bothered with demonstrate since  i thought of those wonderfully limpid speeches of his of the freeport debates and of the contrast between his style and douglass and i understood the reason for it at last i understood the supreme mind that had conceived the freeport question and as i stood before him then at the close of this fearful war the words of the gospel were in my mind so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen  how i wished that all those who have maligned and tortured him could talk with him as i had talked with him to know his great heart would disarm them of all antagonism they would feel as i feel that his life is so much nobler than theirs and his burdens so much heavier that they would go away ashamed of their criticism  he said to me once brice i hope we are in sight of the end now i hope that we may get through without any more fighting i dont want to see any more of our countrymen killed and then he said as if talking to himself and then we must show them mercymercy  i thought it a good time to mention colfaxs case he has been on my mind ever since mr lincoln listened attentively once he sighed and he was winding his long fingers around each other while i talked  i saw the man captured mr lincoln i concluded and if a technicality will help him out he was actually within his own skirmish line at the time the rebel skirmishers had not fallen back on each side of him  brice he said with that sorrowful smile a technicality might save colfax but it wont save me is this man a friend of yours he asked  that was a poser  i think he is mr lincoln i should like to call him so i admire him and i went on to tell of what he had done at vicksburg leaving out however my instrumentality in having him sent north the president used almost shermans words  by jing he exclaimed that seems to be a favorite expression of his those fellows were born to fight if it wasnt for them the south would have quit long ago then he looked at me in his funny way and said see here steve if this colfax isnt exactly a friend of yours there must be some reason why you are pleading for him in this way  well sir i said at length i should like to get him off on account of his cousin miss virginia carvel and i told him something about miss carvel and how she had helped you with the union sergeant that day in the hot hospital and how she had nursed judge whipple  shes a fine woman he said those women have helped those men to prolong this war about three years  and yet we must save them for the nations sake they are to be the mothers of our patriots in days to come is she a friend of yours too steve  what was i to say  not especially sir i answered finally i have had to offend her rather often but i know that she likes my mother  why he cried jumping up shes a daughter of colonel carvel i always had an admiration for that man an ideal southern gentleman of the old schoolcourteous as honorable and open as the day and as brave as a lion youve heard the story of how he threw a man named babcock out of his store who tried to bribe him  i heard you tell it in that tavern sir and i have heard it since it did me good to hear the colonel praised  i always liked that story he said by the way whats become of the colonel  he got awaysouth sir i answered he couldnt stand it he hasnt been heard of since the summer of 63 they think he was killed in texas but they are not positive they probably never will be i added he was silent awhile  too bad he said too bad what stuff those men are made of and so you want me to pardon this colfax  it would be presumptuous in me to go that far sir i replied but i hoped you might speak of it to the general when he comes and i would be glad of the opportunity to testify  he took a few strides up and down the room  well well he said thats my vicepardoning saying yes its always one more drink with me it he smiledit makes me sleep better ive pardoned enough rebels to populate new orleans why he continued with his whimsical look just before i left washington in comes one of your missouri senators with a list of rebels who are shut up in mcdowells and alton i said senator youre not going to ask me to turn loose all those at once  he said just what you said when you were speaking of missouri a while ago that he was afraid of guerilla warfare and that the war was nearly over i signed em and then what does he do but pull out another batch longer than the first and those were worse than the first  what you dont want me to turn these loose too  yes i do mr president i think it will pay to be merciful  then durned if i dont i said and i signed em                    steamer river queen                on the potomac april 9 1865  dear mother i am glad that the telegrams i have been able to send reached you safely i have not had time to write and this will be but a short letter  you will be surprised to see this heading i am on the presidents boat in the presidents party bound with him for washington and this is how it happened the very afternoon of the day i wrote you general sherman himself arrived at city point on the steamer russia i heard the salutes and was on the wharf to meet him that same afternoon he and general grant and admiral porter went aboard the river queen to see the president how i should have liked to be present at that interview after it was over they all came out of the cabin together general grant silent and smoking as usual general sherman talking vivaciously and lincoln and the admiral smiling and listening that was historic i shall never expect to see such a sight again in all my days you can imagine my surprise when the president called me from where i was standing at some distance with the other officers he put his hand on my shoulder then and there and turned to general sherman  major brice is a friend of mine general he said i knew him in illinois  he never told me that said the general  i guess hes got a great many important things shut up inside of him said mr lincoln banteringly but he gave you a good recommendation sherman he said that you wore white socks and that the boys liked you and called you uncle billy and i told him that was the best recommendation he could give anybody  i was frightened but the general only looked at me with those eyes that go through everything and then he laughed  brice he said youll have my reputation ruined  sherman said mr lincoln you dont want the major right away do you let him stay around here for a while with me i think hell find it interesting he looked at the generalinchief who was smiling just a little bit ive got a sneaking notion that grants going to do something  then they all laughed  certainly mr lincoln said my general you may have brice be careful he doesnt talk you to deathhes said too much already  that is how i came to stay  i have no time now to tell you all that i have seen and heard i have ridden with the president and have gone with him on errands of mercy and errands of cheer i have been almost within sight of what we hope is the last struggle of this frightful war i have listened to the guns of five forks where sheridan and warren bore their own colors in the front of the charge i was with mr lincoln while the battle of petersburg was raging and there were tears in his eyes  then came the retreat of lee and the instant pursuit of grant andrichmond the quiet general did not so much as turn aside to enter the smoking city he had besieged for so long but i went there with the president and if i had one incident in my life to live over again i should choose this as we were going up the river a disabled steamer lay across the passage in the obstruction of piles the confederates had built mr lincoln would not wait there were but a few of us in his party and we stepped into admiral porters twelveoared barge and were rowed to richmond the smoke of the fires still darkening the sky we landed within a block of libby prison  with the little guard of ten sailors he marched the mile and a half to general weitzels headquartersthe presidential mansion of the confederacy you can imagine our anxiety i shall remember him always as i saw him that day a tall black figure of sorrow with the high silk hat we have learned to love unafraid his heart rent with pity he walked unharmed amid such tumult as i have rarely seen the windows filled the streets ahead of us became choked as the word that the president was coming ran on like quickfire the mob shouted and pushed drunken men reeled against him the negroes wept aloud and cried hosannas they pressed upon him that they might touch the hem of his coat and one threw himself on his knees and kissed the presidents feet  still he walked on unharmed past the ashes and the ruins not as a conqueror was he come to march in triumph not to destroy but to heal though there were many times when we had to fight for a path through the crowds he did not seem to feel the danger  was it because he knew that his hour was not yet come  today on the boat as we were steaming between the green shores of the potomac i overheard him reading to mr sumner            duncan is in his grave         after lifes fitful fever he sleeps well         treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison         malice domestic foreign levy nothing         can touch him further            willards hotel washington april 10 1865  i have looked up the passage and have written it in above it haunts me     chapter xv man of sorrow  the train was latevery late it was virginia who first caught sight of the new dome of the capitol through the slanting rain but she merely pressed her lips together and said nothing in the dingy brick station of the baltimore and ohio railroad more than one person paused to look after them and a kindhearted lady who had been in the car kissed the girl goodby  you think that you can find your uncles house my dear she asked glancing at virginia with concern through all of that long journey she had worn a look apart do you think you can find your uncles house  virginia started and then she smiled as she looked at the honest alert and squarely built gentleman beside her  captain brent can mrs ware she said he can find anything  whereupon the kind lady gave the captain her hand you look as if you could captain said she remember if general carvel is out of town you promised to bring her to me  yes maam said captain lige and so i shall  kerridge kerridge right disaway no sah dat aint de kerridge you wants dats it lady youse lookin at it kerridge kerridge kerridge  virginia tried bravely to smile but she was very near to tears as she stood on the uneven pavement and looked at the scrawny horses standing patiently in the steady downpour all sorts of people were coming and going army officers and navy officers and citizens of states and territories driving up and driving away  and this was washington  she was thinking then of the multitude who came here with aching heartswith heavier hearts than was hers that day how many of the throng hurrying by would not flee if they could back to the peaceful homes they had left but perhaps those homes were gone now destroyed like her own by the war women with children at their breasts and mothers bowed with sorrow had sought this city in their agony young men and old had come hither striving to keep back the thoughts of dear ones left behind whom they might never see again and by the thousands and tens of thousands they had passed from here to the places of blood beyond  kerridge sah kerridge  do you know where general daniel carvel lives  yes sah reckon i does i street sah jump right in sah  virginia sank back on the stuffy cushions of the rattletrap and then sat upright again and stared out of the window at the dismal scene they were splashing through a sea of mud ever since they had left st louis captain lige had done his best to cheer her and he did not intend to desist now  this beats all he cried so this is washington why it dont compare to st louis except we havent got the white house and the capitol jinny it would take a scow to get across the street and we dont have ramshackly stores and nigger cabins bang up against fine houses like that this is ragged thats what it is ragged we dont have any dirty pickaninnies dodging among the horses in our residence streets i declare jinny if those arent pigs  virginia laughed she could not help it  poor lige she said i hope uncle daniel has some breakfast for you youve had a good deal to put up with on this trip  lordy jinny said the captain id put up with a good deal more than this for the sake of going anywhere with you  even to such a doleful place as this she sighed  this is all right if the sunll only come out and dry things up and let us see the green on those trees he said lordy how i do love to see the spring green in the sunlight  she put out her hand over his  lige she said you know youre just trying to keep up my spirits youve been doing that ever since we left home  no such thing he replied with vehemence theres nothing for you to be cast down about  oh but there is she cried suppose i cant make your black republican president pardon clarence  pooh said the captain squeezing her hand and trying to appear unconcerned your uncle daniel knows mr lincoln hell have that arranged  just then the rattletrap pulled up at the sidewalk the wheels of the near side in four inches of mud and the captain leaped out and spread the umbrella they were in front of a rather imposing house of brick flanked on one side by a house just like it and on the other by a series of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools they climbed the steps and rang the bell in due time the door was opened by a smiling yellow butler in black  does general carvel live here  yas miss but he aint to home now done gone to new york  oh faltered virginia didnt he get my telegram day before yesterday i sent it to the war department  hes done gone since saturday miss and then evidently impressed by the young ladys looks he added hospitably kin i do anything fo you miss  im his niece miss virginia carvel and this is captain brent  the yellow butlers face lighted up  come right in miss jinny done heerd de general speak of you oftenyasm de generalll be to home dis aternoon suah twill do him good ter see you miss jinny hes been mighty lonesome walk right in capn and make yoselves at home lizbethlizbeth  a yellow maid came running down the stairs heahs miss jinny  lan of goodness cried lizbeth i knows miss jinny done seed her at calvet house how is you miss jinny  very well lizbeth said virginia listlessly sitting down on the hall sofa can you give us some breakfast  yasm said lizbeth jes reckon we kin she ushered them into a walnut dining room big and high and sombre with plushbottomed chairs placed aboutwalnut also for that was the fashion in those days but the captain had no sooner seated himself than he shot up again and started out  where are you going lige  to pay off the carriage driver he said  let him wait said virginia im going to the white house in a little while  whatwhat for he gasped  to see your black republican president she replied with alarming calmness  now jinny he cried in excited appeal dont go doin any such fool trick as that your uncle danl will be here this afternoon he knows the president and then the thingll be fixed all right and no mistake  her reply was in the same tonealmost a monotonewhich she had used for three days it made the captain very uneasy for he knew when she spoke in that way that her will was in it  and to lose that time she answered may be to have him shot  but you cant get to the president without credentials he objected  what she flashed hasnt any one a right to see the president you mean to say that he will not see a woman in trouble then all these pretty stories i hear of him are false they are made up by the yankees  poor captain lige he had some notion of the multitude of calls upon mr lincoln especially at that time but he could not he dared not remind her of the principal reason for thislees surrender and the approaching end of the war and then the captain had never seen mr lincoln in the distant valley of the mississippi he had only heard of the president very conflicting things he had heard him criticised and reviled and praised just as is every man who goes to the white house be he saint or sinner and during an administration no man at a distance may come at a presidents true character and worth the captain had seen lincoln caricatured vilely and again he had read and heard the pleasant anecdotes of which virginia had spoken until he did not know what to believe  as for virginia he knew her partisanship to and undying love for the south he knew the class prejudice which was bound to assert itself and he had seen enough in the girls demeanor to fear that she was going to demand rather than implore she did not come of a race that was wont to bend the knee  well well he said despairingly you must eat some breakfast first jinny  she waited with an ominous calmness until it was brought in and then she took a part of a roll and some coffee  this wont do exclaimed the captain why why that wont get you halfway to mr lincoln  she shook her head half smiling  you must eat enough lige she said  he was finished in an incredibly short time and amid the protestations of lizbeth and the yellow butler they got into the carriage again and splashed and rattled toward the white house once virginia glanced out and catching sight of the bedraggled flags on the houses in honor of lees surrender a look of pain crossed her face the captain could not repress a note of warning  jinny said he i have an idea that youll find the president a good deal of a man now if youre allowed to see him dont get him mad jinny whatever you do  virginia stared straight ahead  if he is something of a man lige he will not lose his temper with a woman  captain lige subsided and just then they came in sight of the house of the presidents with its beautiful portico and its broad wings and they turned in under the dripping trees of the grounds a carriage with a black coachman and footman was ahead of them and they saw two stately gentlemen descend from it and pass the guard at the door then their turn came the captain helped her out in his best manner and gave some money to the driver  i reckon he neednt wait for us this time jinny said be she shook her head and went in he following and they were directed to the anteroom of the presidents office on the second floor there were many people in the corridors and one or two young officers in blue who stared at her she passed them with her head high  but her spirits sank when they came to the anteroom it was full of all sorts of people politicians both prosperous and seedy full faced and keen faced seeking office women officers and a onearmed soldier sitting in the corner he was among the men who offered virginia their seats and the only one whom she thanked but she walked directly to the doorkeeper at the end of the room captain lige was beside her  can we see the president he asked  have you got an appointment said the old man  no  then youll have to wait your turn sir he said shaking his head and looking at virginia and he added its slow work waiting your turn theres so many governors and generals and senators although the sessions over its a busy time miss  virginia went very close to him  oh cant you do something she said and added with an inspiration i must see him its a matter of life and death  she saw instantly with a womans instinct that these words had had their effect the old man glanced at her again as if demurring  youre sure miss its life and death he said  oh why should i say so if it were not she cried  the orders are very strict he said but the president told me to give precedence to cases when a life is in question just you wait a minute miss until governor doddridge comes out and ill see what i can do for you give me your name please miss  she remained standing where she was in a little while the heavy door opened and a portly rubicund man came out with a smile on his face he broke into a laugh when halfway across the room as if the memory of what he had heard were too much for his gravity the doorkeeper slipped into the room and there was a silent anxious interval then he came out again  the president will see you miss  captain lige started forward with her but she restrained him  wait for me here lige she said  she swept in alone and the door closed softly after her the room was a big one and there were maps on the table with pins sticking in them she saw that much and then  could this fantastically tall stooping figure before her be that of the president of the united states she stopped as from the shock he gave her the lean yellow face with the masklike lines all up and down the unkempt tousled hair the beardwhy he was a hundred times more ridiculous than his caricatures he might have stood for many of the poor white trash farmers she had seen in kentuckysave for the long black coat  isis this mr lincoln she asked her breath taken away  he bowed and smiled down at her somehow that smile changed his face a little  i guess ill have to own up he answered  my name is virginia carvel she said i have come all the way from st louis to see you  miss carvel said the president looking at her intently i have rarely been so flattered in my life ii hope i have not disappointed you  virginia was justly angry  oh you havent she cried her eyes flashing because i am what you would call a rebel  the mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more and then she saw that the president was laughing  and have you a better name for it miss carvel he asked because i am searching for a better namejust now  she was silentsternly silent and she tapped her foot on the carpet what manner of man was this wont you sit down said the president kindly you must be tired after your journey and he put forth a chair  no thank you said virginia i think that i can say what i have come to say better standing  well said mr lincoln thats not strange im that way too the words seem to come out better that reminds me of a story they tell about general buck tanner ever heard of buck miss carvel no well buck was a character he got his title in the mormon war one day the boys asked him over to the square to make a speech the general was a little uneasy  im all right when i get standing up liza he said to his wife then the words come right along only trouble is they come too cussed fast howm i going to stop em when i want to  well i du declare buck said she i gave you credit for some sense all youve got to do is to set down thatll end it i reckon  so the general went over to the square and talked for about an hour and a half and then a chicago man shouted to him to dry up the general looked pained  boys said he its jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you youll have to hand up a chair boys because im never going to get shet of this goldarned speech any anther way  mr lincoln had told this so comically that virginia was forced to laugh and she immediately hated herself a man who could joke at such a time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his office he should have been a comedian and yet this was the president who had conducted the war whose generals had conquered the confederacy and she was come to ask him a favor virginia swallowed her pride  mr lincoln she began i have come to talk to you about my cousin colonel clarence colfax  i shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin colonel colfax miss carvel is he your third or fourth cousin  he is my first cousin she retorted  is he in the city asked mr lincoln innocently why didnt he come with you  oh havent you heard she cried he is clarence colfax of st louis now a colonel in the army of the confederate states  which army asked mr lincoln virginia tossed her head in exasperation  in general joseph johnstons army she replied trying to be patient but now she gulped now he has been arrested as a spy by general shermans army  thats too bad answered mr lincoln  andand they are going to shoot him  thats worse said mr lincoln gravely but i expect he deserves it  oh no he doesnt she cried you dont know how brave he is he floated down the mississippi on a log out of vicksburg and brought back thousands and thousands of percussion caps he rowed across the river when the yankee fleet was going down and set fire to de soto so that they could see to shoot  well said mr lincoln thats a good starter then he looked thoughtful  miss carvel said he that argument reminds me of a story about a man i used to know in the old days in illinois his name was mcneil and he was a lawyer  one day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before judge drake  judge says mcneil you oughtnt to lock this man up it was a fair fight and hes the best man in the state in a fair fight and whats more hes never been licked in a fair fight in his life  and if your honor does lock me up the prisoner put in ill give your honor a thunderin big lickin when i get out  the judge took off his coat  gentlemen said he its a powerful queer argument but the court will admit it on its merits the prisoner will please to step out on the grass  this time virginia contrived merely to smile she was striving against something she knew not what her breath was coming deeply and she was dangerously near to tears why she could not tell she had come into this mans presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor the sight of his face she had ridiculed now she could not look into it without an odd sensation what was in it sorrow yes that was nearest it  what had the man done told her a few funny storiesgiven quizzical answers to some of her questions quizzical yes but she could not be sure then there was not wisdom in them and that humiliated her she had never conceived of such a man and be it added gratuitously virginia deemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men  and now said mr lincoln to continue for the defence i believe that colonel colfax first distinguished himself at the time of camp jackson when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole  startled she looked up at him swiftly and then down again yes she answered yes but oh mr lincoln please dont hold that against him  if she could only have seen his face then but her lashes were dropped  my dear young lady replied the president i honor him for it i was merely elaborating the argument which you have begun on the other hand it is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned and attempted to enter general shermans lines as a civilianas a spy  he had spoken these last words very gently but she was too excited to heed his gentleness she drew herself up a gleam in her eyes like the crest of a blue wave in a storm  a spy she cried it takes more courage to be a spy than anything else in war then he will be shot you are not content in the north with what you have gained you are not content with depriving us of our rights and our fortunes with forcing us back to an allegiance we despise you are not content with humiliating our generals and putting innocent men in prisons but now i suppose you will shoot us all and all this mercy that i have heard about means nothingnothing  why did she falter and stop  miss carvel said the president i am afraid from what i have heard just now that it means nothing oh the sadness of that voicethe ineffable sadnessthe sadness and the woe of a great nation and the sorrow in those eyes the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meeklyhow heavy none will ever know the pain of a crown of thorns worn for a world that did not understand no wonder virginia faltered and was silent she looked at abraham lincoln standing there bent and sorrowful and it was as if a light had fallen upon him but strangest of all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength it was the same strength she had felt in stephen brice this was the thought that came to her  slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds where the wind was shaking the wet trees past the unfinished monument to the father of her country and across the broad potomac to alexandria in the hazy distance the rain beat upon the panes and then she knew that she was crying softly to herself she had met a force that she could not conquer she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not fathom albeit she had known sorrow  presently she felt him near she turned and looked through her tears at his face that was all compassion and now she was unashamed he had placed a chair behind her  sit down virginia he said even the name fell from him naturally  she obeyed him then like a child he remained standing  tell me about your cousin he said are you going to marry him  she hung an instant on her answer would that save clarence but in that moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her soul  no mr lincoln she said i wasbut i did not love him ii think that was one reason why he was so reckless  mr lincoln smiled  the officer who happened to see colonel colfax captured is now in washington when your name was given to me i sent for him perhaps he is in the anteroom now i should like to tell you first of all that this officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him  he defended him he asked you to pardon him who is he she exclaimed  again mr lincoln smiled he strode to the bellcord and spoke a few words to the usher who answered his ring  the usher went out then the door opened and a young officer spare erect came quickly into the room and bowed respectfully to the president but mr lincolns eyes were not on him they were on the girl he saw her head lifted timidly he saw her lips part and the color come flooding into her face but she did not rise  the president sighed but the light in her eyes was reflected in his own it has been truly said that abraham lincoln knew the human heart  the officer still stood facing the president the girl staring at his profile the door closed behind him major brice said mr lincoln when you asked me to pardon colonel colfax i believe that you told me he was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured  yes sir he was  suddenly stephen turned as if impelled by the presidents gaze and so his eyes met virginias he forgot time and placefor the while even this man whom he revered above all men he saw her hand tighten on the arm of her chair he took a step toward her and stopped mr lincoln was speaking again  he put in a plea a lawyers plea wholly unworthy of him miss virginia he asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality what do you think of that  oh said virginia just the exclamation escaped hernothing more the crimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks slowly the eyes she had yielded to stephen came back again and rested on the president and now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful  i wish it understood mr lawyer the president continued that i am not letting off colonel colfax on a technicality i am sparing his life he said slowly because the time for which we have been waiting and longing for four years is now at handthe time to be merciful let us all thank god for it  virginia had risen now she crossed the room her head lifted her heart lifted to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her  mr lincoln she faltered i did not know you when i came here i should have known you for i had heard himi had heard major brice praise you oh she cried how i wish that every man and woman and child in the south might come here and see you as i have seen you today i thinki think that some of their bitterness might be taken away  abraham lincoln laid his hands upon the girl and stephen watching knew that he was looking upon a benediction  virginia said mr lincoln i have not suffered by the south i have suffered with the south your sorrow has been my sorrow and your pain has been my pain what you have lost i have lost and what you have gained he added sublimely i have gained  he led her gently to the window the clouds were flying before the wind and a patch of blue sky shone above the potomac with his long arm he pointed across the river to the southeast and as if by a miracle a shaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of alexandria  in the first days of the war he said a flag flew there in sight of the place where george washington lived and died i used to watch that flag and thank god that washington had not lived to see it and sometimes sometimes i wondered if god had allowed it to be put in irony just there his voice seemed to catch that was wrong he continued i should have known that this was our punishmentthat the sight of it was my punishment before we could become the great nation he has destined us to be our sins must be wiped out in blood you loved that flag virginia you love it still  i say in all sincerity may you always love it may the day come when this nation north and south may look back upon it with reverence thousands upon thousands of brave americans have died under it for what they believed was right but may the day come again when you will love that flag you see there nowwashingtons flagbetter still  he stopped and the tears were wet upon virginias lashes she could not have spoken then  mr lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it then he began to write slouched forward one knee resting on the floor his lips moving at the same time when he got up again he seemed taller than ever  there he said i guess that will fix it ill have that sent to sherman i have already spoken to him about the matter  they did not thank him it was beyond them both he turned to stephen with that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear  steve he said ill tell you a story the other night harlan was here making a speech to a crowd out of the window and my boy tad was sitting behind him  what shall we do with the rebels said harlan to the crowd  hang em cried the people no says tad hang on to em  and the boy was right that is what we intend to dohang on to em and steve said mr lincoln putting his hand again on virginias shoulder if you have the sense i think you have youll hang on too  for an instant he stood smiling at their blusheshe to whom the power was given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the happiness of others for of such was his happiness  then the president drew out his watch bless me he said i am ten minutes behind my appointment at the department miss virginia you may care to thank the major for the little service he has done you you can do so undisturbed here make yourselves at home  as he opened the door he paused and looked back at them the smile passed from his face and an ineffable expression of longinglonging and tendernesscame upon it  then he was gone  for a space while his spell was upon them they did not stir then stephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him they were not denied him now it was virginia who first found her voice and she called him by his name  oh stephen she said how sad he looked  he was close to her at her side and he answered her in the earnest tone which she knew so well  virginia if i could have had what i most wished for in the world i should have asked that you should know abraham lincoln  then she dropped her eyes and her breath came quickly  ii might have known she answered i might have known what he was i had heard you talk of him i had seen him in you and i did not know do you remember that day when we were in the summerhouse together at glencoe long ago when you had come back from seeing him  as yesterday he said  you were changed then she said bravely i saw it now i understand it was because you had seen mr lincoln  when i saw him said stephen reverently i knew how little and narrow i was  then overcome by the incense of her presence he drew her to him until her heart beat against his own she did not resist but lifted her face to him and he kissed her  you love me virginia he cried  yes stephen she answered low more wonderful in her surrender than ever before yesdear then she hid her face against his blue coat ii cannot help it oh stephen how i have struggled against it how i have tried to hate you and couldnt no i couldnt i tried to insult you i did insult you and when i saw how splendidly you bore it i used to cry he kissed her brown hair  i loved you through it all he said  virginia  yes dearest  virginia did you dream of me  she raised her head quickly and awe was in her eyes how did you know  because i dreamed of you he answered and those dreams used to linger with me half the day as i went about my work i used to think of them as i sat in the saddle on the march  i too treasured them she said and i hated myself for doing it  virginia will you marry me  yes  tomorrow  yes dear tomorrow faintly i have no one but younow  once more he drew her to him and she gloried in his strength  god help me to cherish you dear he said and guard you well  she drew away from him gently and turned toward the window  see stephen she cried the sun has come out at last  for a while they were silent looking out the drops glistened on blade and leaf and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their hearts     chapter xvi annapolis  it was virginias wish and was therefore sacred as for stephen he little cared whither they went and so they found themselves on that bright afternoon in midapril under the great trees that arch the unpaved streets of old annapolis  they stopped by direction at a gate and behind it was a green cluster of lilac bushes which lined the walk to the big plumcolored house which lionel carvel had built virginia remembered that down this walk on a certain day in june a hundred years agone richard carvel had led dorothy manners  they climbed the steps tottering now with age and disuse and virginia playfully raised the big brass knocker brown now that scipio had been wont to polish until it shone stephen took from his pocket the clumsy key that general carvel had given him and turned it in the rusty lock the door swung open and virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors  it was musty and damp this day as the day when richard had come back from england and found it vacant and his grandfather dead but there at the parting of the stairs was the triplearched window which he had described through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now even as then checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green but the tall clock which lionel carvel used to wind was at calvert house with many another treasure  they went up the stairs and reverently they walked over the bare floors their footfalls echoing through the silent house a score of scenes in her greatgrandfathers life came to virginia here was the roomthe cornet one at the back of the main building which looked out over the deserted gardenthat had been richards mothers she recalled how he had stolen into it on that summers day after his return and had flung open the shutters they were open now for their locks were off the priedieu was gone and the dresser but the high bed was there stripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains and the steps by which she had entered it  and next they went into the great square room that had been lionel carvels and there too was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman had lain with the gout while richard read to him from the spectator one side of it looked out on the trees in freshwater lane and the other across the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the blue and white waters of the chesapeake  honey said virginia as they stood in the deep recess of the window wouldnt it be nice if we could live here always away from the world just we two but you would never be content to do that she said smiling reproachfully you are the kind of man who must be in the midst of things in a little while you will have far more besides me to think about  he was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice and he drew her to him  we all have our duty to perform in the world dear he answered it cannot be all pleasure  youyou puritan she cried to think that i should have married a puritan what would my greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather say who was such a stanch royalist why i think i can see him frowning at me now from the door in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat  he was well punished retorted stephen his own grandson was a whig and seems to have married a woman of spirit  she had spirit said virginia i am sure that she did not allow my greatgrandfather to kiss herunless she wanted to  and she looked up at him half smiling half pouting altogether bewitching  from what i hear of him he was something of a man said stephen perhaps he did it anyway  i am glad that marlborough street isnt a crowded thoroughfare said virginia  when they had seen the dining room with its carved mantel and silver doorknobs and the ballroom in the wing they came out and stephen locked the door again they walked around the house and stood looking down the terracesonce stately but crumbled nowwhere dorothy had danced on the green on richards birthday beyond and below was the springhouse and there was the place where the brook dived under the ruined wallwhere dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the valley before she sailed for london  the remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the outlines of the formal garden the trim hedges for seventy years neglected had grown incontinent the garden itself was full of wild green things coming up through the brown of last seasons growth but in the grass the blue violets nestled and virginia picked some of these and put them in stephens coat  you must keep them always she said because we got them here  they spied a seat beside a hoary trunk there on many a spring day lionel carvel had sat reading his gazette and there they rested now the sun hung low over the oldworld gables in the street beyond the wall and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white like a bride the sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered in the air  it was virginia who broke the silence  stephen do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic when you came over from anne brinsmades to reassure me  yes dear he said but what made you think of it now  she did not answer him directly  i believed what you said stephen but you were so strong so calm so sure of yourself i think that made me angry when i thought how ridiculous i must have been  he pressed her hand  you were not ridiculous jinny she laughed  i was not as ridiculous as mr cluyme with his bronze clock but do you know what i had under my armwhat i was saving of all the things i owned  no he answered but i have often wondered she blushed  this housethis place made me think of it it was dorothy mannerss gown and her necklace i could not leave them they were all the remembrance i had of that night at mr brinsmades gate when we came so near to each other  virginia he said some force that we cannot understand has brought us together some force that we could not hinder it is foolish for me to say so but on that day of the slave auction when i first saw you i had a premonition about you that i have never admitted until now even to myself  she started  why stephen she cried i felt the same way  and then he continued quickly it was strange that i should have gone to judge whipple who was an intimate of your fatherssuch a singular intimate and then came your party and glencoe and that curious incident at the fair  when i was talking to the prince and looked up and saw you among all those people  he laughed  that was the most uncomfortable of all for me  stephen she said stirring the leaves at her feet you might have taken me in your arms the night judge whipple diedif you had wanted to but you were strong enough to resist i love you all the more for that  again she said it was through your mother dearest that we were most strongly drawn together i worshipped her from the day i saw her in the hospital i believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the north  my mother would have chosen you above all women virginia he answered  in the morning came to them the news of abraham lincolns death and the same thought was in both their hearts who had known him as it was given to few to know him how he had lived in sorrow how he had died a martyr on the very day of christs death upon the cross and they believed that abraham lincoln gave his life for his country even as christ gave his for the world  and so must we believe that god has reserved for this nation a destiny high upon the earth  many years afterward stephen brice read again to his wife those sublime closing words of the second inaugural     with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the    right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish    the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him    who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his children    to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace    among ourselves and with all nations     afterword  the author has chosen st louis for the principal scene of this story for many reasons grant and sherman were living there before the civil war and abraham lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring state of illinois it has been one of the aims of this book to show the remarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the west this old city of st louis which was founded by laclede in 1765 likewise became the principal meetingplace of two great streams of emigration which had been separated more or less since cromwells day to be sure they were not all cavaliers who settled in the tidewater colonies there were puritan settlements in both maryland and virginia but the life in the southern states took on the more liberal tinge which had characterized that of the royalists even to the extent of affecting the scotch calvinists while the asceticism of the roundheads was the keynote of the puritan character in new england when this great country of ours began to develop the streams moved westward one over what became the plain states of ohio and indiana and illinois and the other across the blue ridge mountains into kentucky and tennessee they mixed along the line of the ohio river they met at st louis and farther west in kansas  nor can the german element in st louis be ignored the part played by this people in the civil war is a matter of history the scope of this book has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading classes which formed the mass in this movement but richter the type of the universitybred revolutionist which emigrated after 48 is drawn more or less from life and the duel described actually took place in berlin  st louis is the authors birthplace and his home the home of those friends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him with unfaltering kindness he begs that they will believe him when he says that only such characters as he loves are reminiscent of those he has known there the city has a large populationlarge enough to include all the types that are to be found in the middle west  one word more this book is written of a time when feeling ran high it has been necessary to put strong speech into the mouths of the characters the breach that threatened our countrys existence is healed now there is no side but abraham lincolns side and this side with all reverence and patriotism the author has tried to take  abraham lincoln loved the south as well as the north         etext editors bookmarks       behind that door was the future so he opened it fearfully      being caught was the unpardonable crime      believe in others having a hard time      freedom meant only the liberty to earn their own living      humiliation and not conscience which makes the sting      most dangerous of gifts the seeing of two sides of a quarrel      naturally she took preoccupation for indifference      principle in law not to volunteer
