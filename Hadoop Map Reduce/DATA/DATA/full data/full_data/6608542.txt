an ancient to ancients    after reading psalms xxxix xl    surview    apology    about half the verses that follow were written quite lately  the rest are older having been held over in ms when past volumes were published on considering that these would contain a sufficient number of pages to offer readers at one time more especially during the distractions of the war  the unusually far back poems to be found here are however but some that were overlooked in gathering previous collections  a freshness in them now unattainable seemed to make up for their inexperience and to justify their inclusion  a few are dated the dates of others are not discoverable  the launching of a volume of this kind in neogeorgian days by one who began writing in midvictorian and has published nothing to speak of for some years may seem to call for a few words of excuse or explanation  whether or no readers may feel assured that a new book is submitted to them with great hesitation at so belated a date insistent practical reasons however among which were requests from some illustrious men of letters who are in sympathy with my productions the accident that several of the poems have already seen the light and that dozens of them have been lying about for years compelled the course adopted in spite of the natural disinclination of a writer whose works have been so frequently regarded askance by a pragmatic section here and there to draw attention to them once more  i do not know that it is necessary to say much on the contents of the book even in deference to suggestions that will be mentioned presently  i believe that those readers who care for my poems at allreaders to whom no passport is requiredwill care for this new instalment of them perhaps the last as much as for any that have preceded them  moreover in the eyes of a less friendly class the pieces though a very mixed collection indeed contain so far as i am able to see little or nothing in technic or teaching that can be considered a starchamber matter or so much as agitating to a ladies school even though to use wordsworths observation in his preface to lyrical ballads such readers may suppose that by the act of writing in verse an author makes a formal engagement that he will gratify certain known habits of association  that he not only thus apprises the reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book but that others will be carefully excluded  it is true nevertheless that some grave positive stark delineations are interspersed among those of the passive lighter and traditional sort presumably nearer to stereotyped tastes  for while i am quite aware that a thinker is not expected and indeed is scarcely allowed now more than heretofore to state all that crosses his mind concerning existence in this universe in his attempts to explain or excuse the presence of evil and the incongruity of penalizing the irresponsibleit must be obvious to open intelligences that without denying the beauty and faithful service of certain venerable cults such disallowance of obstinate questionings and blank misgivings tends to a paralysed intellectual stalemate  heine observed nearly a hundred years ago that the soul has her eternal rights that she will not be darkened by statutes nor lullabied by the music of bells  and what is to day in allusions to the present authors pages alleged to be pessimism is in truth only such questionings in the exploration of reality and is the first step towards the souls betterment and the bodys also  if i may be forgiven for quoting my own old words let me repeat what i printed in this relation more than twenty years ago and wrote much earlier in a poem entitled in tenebris   if way to the better there be it exacts a full look at the worst   that is to say by the exploration of reality and its frank recognition stage by stage along the survey with an eye to the best consummation possible  briefly evolutionary meliorism  but it is called pessimism nevertheless under which word expressed with condemnatory emphasis it is regarded by many as some pernicious new thing though so old as to underlie the christian idea and even to permeate the greek drama and the subject is charitably left to decent silence as if further comment were needless  happily there are some who feel such levitical passingby to be alas by no means a permanent dismissal of the matter that comment on where the world stands is very much the reverse of needless in these disordered years of our prematurely afflicted century  that amendment and not madness lies that way  and looking down the future these few hold fast to the same  that whether the human and kindred animal races survive till the exhaustion or destruction of the globe or whether these races perish and are succeeded by others before that conclusion comes pain to all upon it tongued or dumb shall be kept down to a minimum by lovingkindness operating through scientific knowledge and actuated by the modicum of free will conjecturally possessed by organic life when the mighty necessitating forces unconscious or otherthat have the balancings of the clouds happen to be in equilibrium which may or may not be often  to conclude this question i may add that the argument of the so called optimists is neatly summarized in a stern pronouncement against me by my friend mr frederic harrison in a late essay of his in the words  this view of life is not mine  the solemn declaration does not seem to me to be so annihilating to the said view really a series of fugitive impressions which i have never tried to coordinate as is complacently assumed  surely it embodies a too human fallacy quite familiar in logic  next a knowing reviewer apparently a roman catholic young man speaks with some rather gross instances of the suggestio falsi in his article of mr hardy refusing consolation the dark gravity of his ideas and so on  when a positivist and a catholic agree there must be something wonderful in it which should make a poet sit up  but    o that twere possible  i would not have alluded in this place or anywhere else to such casual personal criticismsfor casual and unreflecting they must be but for the satisfaction of two or three friends in whose opinion a short answer was deemed desirable on account of the continual repetition of these criticisms or more precisely quizzings  after all the serious and truly literary inquiry in this connection is should a shaper of such stuff as dreams are made on disregard considerations of what is customary and expected and apply himself to the real function of poetry the application of ideas to life in matthew arnolds familiar phrase  this bears more particularly on what has been called the philosophy of these poemsusually reproved as queer  whoever the author may be that undertakes such application of ideas in this philosophic directionwhere it is specially requiredglacial judgments must inevitably fall upon him amid opinion whose arbiters largely decry individuality to whom ideas are oddities to smile at who are moved by a yearning the reverse of that of the athenian inquirers on mars hill and stiffen their features not only at sound of a new thing but at a restatement of old things in new terms  hence should anything of this sort in the following adumbrations seem queer should any of them seem to good panglossians to embody strange and disrespectful conceptions of this best of all possible worlds i apologize but cannot help it  such divergences which though piquant for the nonce it would be affectation to say are not saddening and discouraging likewise may to be sure arise sometimes from superficial aspect only writer and reader seeing the same thing at different angles  but in palpable cases of divergence they arise as already said whenever a serious effort is made towards that which the authority i have citedwho would now be called oldfashioned possibly even parochialaffirmed to be what no good critic could deny as the poets province the application of ideas to life  one might shrewdly guess by the by that in such recommendation the famous writer may have overlooked the coldshouldering results upon an enthusiastic disciple that would be pretty certain to follow his putting the high aim in practice and have forgotten the disconcerting experience of gil blas with the archbishop  to add a few more words to what has already taken up too many there is a contingency liable to miscellanies of verse that i have never seen mentioned so far as i can remember i mean the chance little shocks that may be caused over a book of various character like the present and its predecessors by the juxtaposition of unrelated even discordant effusions poems perhaps years apart in the making yet facing each other  an odd result of this has been that dramatic anecdotes of a satirical and humorous intention such eg as royal sponsors following verse in graver voice have been read as misfires because they raise the smile that they were intended to raise the journalist deaf to the sudden change of key being unconscious that he is laughing with the author and not at him  i admit that i did not foresee such contingencies as i ought to have done and that people might not perceive when the tone altered  but the difficulties of arranging the themes in a graduated kinship of moods would have been so great that irrelation was almost unavoidable with efforts so diverse  i must trust for right notecatching to those finelytouched spirits who can divine without half a whisper whose intuitiveness is proof against all the accidents of inconsequence  in respect of the less alert however should any ones train of thought be thrown out of gear by a consecutive piping of vocal reeds in jarring tonics without a semiquavers rest between and be led thereby to miss the writers aim and meaning in one out of two contiguous compositions i shall deeply regret it  having at last i think finished with the personal points that i was recommended to notice i will forsake the immediate object of this preface and leaving late lyrics to whatever fate it deserves digress for a few moments to more general considerations  the thoughts of any man of letters concerned to keep poetry alive cannot but run uncomfortably on the precarious prospects of english verse at the present day  verily the hazards and casualties surrounding the birth and setting forth of almost every modern creation in numbers are ominously like those of one of shelleys paperboats on a windy lake  and a forward conjecture scarcely permits the hope of a better time unless mens tendencies should change  so indeed of all art literature and high thinking nowadays  whether owing to the barbarizing of taste in the younger minds by the dark madness of the late war the unabashed cultivation of selfishness in all classes the plethoric growth of knowledge simultaneously with the stunting of wisdom a degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation to quote wordsworth again or from any other cause we seem threatened with a new dark age  i formerly thought like so many roughly handled writers that so far as literature was concerned a partial cause might be impotent or mischievous criticism the satirizing of individuality the lack of wholeseeing in contemporary estimates of poetry and kindred work the knowingness affected by junior reviewers the overgrowth of meticulousness in their peerings for an opinion as if it were a cultivated habit in them to scrutinize the toolmarks and be blind to the building to hearken for the keycreaks and be deaf to the diapason to judge the landscape by a nocturnal exploration with a flashlantern  in other words to carry on the old game of sampling the poem or drama by quoting the worst line or worst passage only in ignorance or not of coleridges proof that a versification of any length neither can be nor ought to be all poetry of reading meanings into a book that its author never dreamt of writing there  i might go on interminably  but i do not now think any such temporary obstructions to be the cause of the hazard for these negligences and ignorances though they may have stifled a few true poets in the run of generations disperse like stricken leaves before the wind of next week and are no more heard of again in the region of letters than their writers themselves  no  we may be convinced that something of the deeper sort mentioned must be the cause  in any event poetry pure literature in general religioni include religion because poetry and religion touch each other or rather modulate into each other are indeed often but different names for the same thingthese i say the visible signs of mental and emotional life must like all other things keep moving becoming even though at present when belief in witches of endor is displacing the darwinian theory and the truth that shall make you free mens minds appear as above noted to be moving backwards rather than on i speak of course somewhat sweepingly and should except many isolated minds also the minds of men in certain worthy but small bodies of various denominations and perhaps in the homely quarter where advance might have been the very least expected a few years backthe english churchif one reads it rightly as showing evidence of removing those things that are shaken in accordance with the wise epistolary recommendation to the hebrews  for since the historic and once august hierarchy of rome some generation ago lost its chance of being the religion of the future by doing otherwise and throwing over the little band of neocatholics who were making a struggle for continuity by applying the principle of evolution to their own faith joining hands with modern science and outflanking the hesitating english instinct towards liturgical reform a flank march which i at the time quite expected to witness with the gathering of many millions of waiting agnostics into its fold since then one may ask what other purely english establishment than the church of sufficient dignity and footing and with such strength of old association such architectural spell is left in this country to keep the shreds of morality together  it may be a forlorn hope a mere dream that of an alliance between religion which must be retained unless the world is to perish and complete rationality which must come unless also the world is to perish by means of the interfusing effect of poetrythe breath and finer spirit of all knowledge the impassioned expression of science as it was defined by an english poet who was quite orthodox in his ideas  but if it be true as comte argued that advance is never in a straight line but in a looped orbit we may in the aforesaid ominous moving backward be doing it pour mieux sauter drawing back for a spring  i repeat that i forlornly hope so notwithstanding the supercilious regard of hope by schopenhauer von hartmann and other philosophers down to einstein who have my respect  but one dares not prophesy  physical chronological and other contingencies keep me in these days from critical studies and literary circles   where once we held debate a band of youthful friends on mind and art   if one may quote tennyson in this century of free verse  hence i cannot know how things are going so well as i used to know them and the aforesaid limitations must quite prevent my knowing hence forward  i have to thank the editors and owners of the times fortnightly mercury and other periodicals in which a few of the poems have appeared for kindly assenting to their being reclaimed for collected publication  t h  february 1922    weathers    this is the weather the cuckoo likes    and so do i when

strength of a tender whim the stranger was she who bore his name there       not she who wedded him    her song    i sang that song on sunday    to witch an idle while i sang that song on monday    as fittest to beguile i sang it as the year outwore       and the new slid in i thought not what might shape before    another would begin  i sang that song in summer    all unforeknowingly to him as a newcomer    from regions strange to me i sang it when in afteryears       the shades stretched out and paths were faint and flocking fears    brought cupeyed care and doubt  sings he that song on sundays    in some dim land afar on saturdays or mondays    as when the evening star glimpsed in upon his bending face       and my hanging hair and time untouched me with a trace    of soulsmart or despair    a wet august    nine drops of water bead the jessamine and nineandninety smear the stones and tiles  twas not so in that augustfullrayed fine when we lived outofdoors sang songs strode miles  or was there then no noted radiancy of summer  were dun clouds a dribbling bough gilt over by the light i bore in me and was the waste world just the same as now  it can have been so  yea that threatenings of coming downdrip on the sunless gray by the then possibilities in things were wrought more bright than brightest skies today  1920    the dissemblers    it was not you i came to please    only myself flipped she i like this spot of phantasies    and thought you far from me but o he was the secret spell    that led her to the lea  it was not she who shaped my ways    or works or thoughts he said i scarcely marked her living days    or missed her much when dead but o his joyance knew its knell    when daisies hid her head    to a lady playing and singing in the morning       joyful lady sing and i will lurk here listening though nought be done and nought begun and workhours swift are scurrying     sing o lady still aye i will wait each note you trill though duties due that press to do this whole day long i unfulfil     it is an evening tune one not designed to waste the noon you say  i know  time bids me go for daytide passes too too soon     but let indulgence be this once to my rash ecstasy when sounds nowhere that carolled air my idled morn may comfort me    a man was drawing near to me    on that gray night of mournful drone a part from aught to hear to see i dreamt not that from shires unknown    in gloom alone    by halworthy a man was drawing near to me  id no concern at anything no sense of coming pullheart play yet under the silent outspreading

these coasts the man had passed tresparret posts  there was no light at all inland only the seaward pharosfire nothing to let me understand    that hard at hand    by hennett byre the man was getting

the chapter so begun    in that odd complex what was done    well happiness comes in full to none let peace lie on lulled lips  i will not say  weymouth    a gentlemans epitaph on himself and a lady who were buried together    i dwelt in the shade of a city    she far by the sea with folk perhaps good gracious witty    but never with me  her form on the ballrooms smooth flooring    i never once met to guide her with accents adoring    through weipperts first set 1  i spent my lifes seasons with pale ones    in vanity fair and she enjoyed hers among hale ones    in saltsmelling air  maybe she had eyes of deep colour    maybe they were blue maybe as she aged they got duller    that never i knew  she may have had lips like the coral    but i never kissed them saw pouting nor curling in

days and vernal    lie i and lies she this neverknown lady eternal    companion to me    the old gown song    i have seen her in gowns the brightest    of azure green and red and in the simplest whitest    muslined from heel to head i have watched her walking riding    shadeflecked by a leafy tree or in fixed thought abiding    by the foamfingered sea  in woodlands i have known her    when boughs were mourning loud in the rainreek she has shown her    wildhaired and waterybrowed and once or twice she has cast me    as she pomped along the street courtclad ere quite she had passed me    a glance from her chariotseat  but in my memoried passion    for evermore stands she in the gown of fading fashion    she wore that night when we doomed long to part assembled    in the snug small room yea when she sang with lips that trembled    shall i see his face again    a night in november    i marked when the weather changed and the panes began to quake and the winds rose up and ranged that night lying halfawake  dead leaves blew into my room and alighted upon my bed and a tree declared to the gloom its sorrow that they were shed  one leaf of them touched my hand and i thought that it was you there stood as you used to stand and saying at last you knew   1913    a duettist to her pianoforte song of silence e l hh c h    since every sound moves memories    how can i play you just as i might if you raised no scene by your ivory rows of a form between my vision and your timeworn sheen       as when each day you answered our fingers with ecstasy so its hushed hushed hushed you are for me  and as i am doomed to counterchord    her notes no more in those old things i used to know in a fashion when we practised so goodnightgoodbye to your pleated show       of silk now hoar each nodding hammer and pedal and key for dead dead dead you are to me  i fain would second her strike to her stroke    as when she was by aye even from the ancient clamorous fall of paris or battle of prague withal to the roving minstrels or elfin call       sung soft as a sigh but upping ghosts press achefully and mute mute mute you are for me  should i fling your polyphones plaints and quavers    afresh on the air too quick would the small white shapes be here of the fellow twain of hands so dear and a blacktressed profile and pale smooth ear      then how shall i bear such heavilyhaunted harmony nay  hushed hushed hushed you are for me    where three roads joined    where three roads joined it was green and fair and over a gate was the sunglazed sea and life laughed sweet when i halted there yet there i never again would be  i am sure those branchways are brooding now with a wistful blankness upon their face while the few mute passengers notice how spectreberidden is the place  which nightly sighs like a laden soul and grieves that a pair in bliss for a spell not far from thence should have let it roll away from them down a plumbless well  while the phasm of him who fared starts up and of her who was waiting him sobs from near as they haunt there and drink the wormwood cup they filled for themselves when their sky was clear  yes i see those roadsnow rutted and bare while over the gate is no sunglazed sea and though life laughed when i halted there it is where i never again would be    and there was a great calm on the signing of the armistice nov 11 1918    i  there had been years of passionscorching cold and much despair and anger heaving high care whitely watching sorrows manifold among the young among the weak and old and the pensive spirit of pity

raised their glance to where had stood those poplars lank and lopped as they had raised it through the four years dance of death in the now familiar flats of france and murmured strange this  how  all

horses mused  we are not whipped today no weftwinged engines blurred the moons thin horn  ix  calm fell  from heaven distilled a clemency there was peace on earth and silence in the sky some could some could not shake off misery the sinister spirit sneered  it had to be and again the spirit of pity whispered why    haunting fingers a phantasy in a museum of musical instruments             are

on me    on stinsford hill at midnight    i glimpsed a womans muslined form    singsonging airily against the moon and still she sang    and took no heed of me  another trice and i beheld    what first i had not scanned that now and then she tapped and shook    a timbrel in her hand  so late the hour so white her drape    so strange the look it lent to that blank hill i could not guess    what

chimes played lifes a bumper on that day to the measure of my walking as i went their sweetness frisked and floated on the lea as they played out lifes a bumper there to me  awake i said  i go to take a bride the sun arose behind me rubyred as i journeyed townwards from the countryside the chiming bells saluting near ahead their sweetness swelled in tripping tings of glee as they played out lifes a bumper there to me  again arise  i seek a turfy slope and go forth slowly on an autumn noon and there i lay her who has been my hope and think o may i follow hither soon while on the wind the chimes come cheerily playing out lifes a bumper there to me  1913    i worked no wile to meet you song    i worked no wile to meet you    my sight was set elsewhere i sheered about to shun you    and lent

through as i play here tonight to play never again by the light of that lowering sun peering in at the windowpane and over the backstreet roofs throwing shades from the boys of the chore in the gallery right upon me sitting up to these keys once more     how i used to hear tongues ask as i sat here when i was new who is she playing the organ  she touches it mightily true she travels from havenpool town the deacon would softly speak the stipend can hardly cover her fare hither twice in the week it fell far short of doing indeed but i never told for i have craved minstrelsy more than lovers or beauty or gold  twas so he answered at first but the story grew different later it cannot go on much longer from what we hear of her now at the meaning wheeze in the words the inquirer would shift his place till he could see round the curtain that screened me from people below a handsome girl he would murmur upstaring and so i am buttoo much sex in her build fine eyes but eyelids too heavy a bosom too full for her age in her lips too voluptuous a look it may be  but who put it there  assuredly it was not i  i went on playing and singing when this i had heard and more though tears halfblinded me yes i remained going on and on just as i used me to chord and to sing at the selfsame time    for its a contraltomy voice is theyll hear it again here to night in the psalmody notes that i love more than world or than flesh or than life  well the deacon in fact that day had learnt new tidings about me they troubled his mind not a little for he was a worthy man he trades as a chemist in high street and during the week he had sought his fellowdeacon who throve as a bookbinder over the way these are strange rumours he said  we must guard the good name of the chapel if sooth shes of evil report what else can we do but dismiss her but get such another to play here we cannot for double the price it settled the point for the time and i triumphed awhile in their strait and my muchbeloved grand semibreves went living on under my fingers  at length in the congregation more headshakes and murmurs were rife and my dismissal was ruled though i was not warned of it then but a day came when they declared it  the news entered me as a sword i was broken so pallid of face that they thought i should faint they said i rallied  o rather than go i will play you for nothing said i twas in much desperation i spoke it for bring me to forfeit i could not those melodies chorded so richly for which i had laboured and lived they paused  and for nothing i played at the chapel through sundays anon upheld by that art which i loved more than blandishments lavished of men  but it fell that murmurs again from the flock broke the pastors peace some member had seen me at havenpool comrading close a seacaptain yes i was thereto constrained lacking means for the fare to and fro yet god knows if aught he knows ever i loved the oldhundredth saint stephens mount zion new sabbath mileslane holy rest and arabia and eaton above all embraces of body by wooers who sought me and won    next week twas declared i was seen coming home with a lover at dawn the deacons insisted then strong and forgiveness i did not implore i saw all was lost for me quite but i made a last bid in my throbs high love had been beaten by lust and the senses had conquered the soul but the soul should die game if i knew it  i turned to my masters and said i yield gentlemen without parlance  butlet me just hymn you once more its a little thing sirs that i ask and a passion is music with me they saw

travelled to where in her lifetime    shed knelt at morning prayer    to call her up as if there but she paid no heed to my suing as though her old haunt could win not    a thought from her spirit or care  i went where my friend had lectioned    the prophets in high declaim    that my souls ear the same full tones should catch as aforetime but silenced by gear of the present    was the voice that once there came  where the ocean had sprayed our banquet    i stood to recall it as then    the same eluding again no vision  shows contingent affrighted it further from me    even than from my homeden  when i found them no responders    but fugitives prone to flee    from where they had used to be it vouched i had been led hither as by night wisps in bogland    and bruised the heart of me    after a romantic day       the railway bore him through       an earthen cutting out from a city    there was no scope for view though the frail light shed by a slim young moon    fell like a friendly tune     fell like a liquid ditty and the blank lack of any charm    of landscape did no harm the bald steep cutting rigid rough    and moonlit was enough for poetry of place  its weathered face formed a convenient sheet whereon the visions of his mind were drawn    the two wives smokers clubstory    i waited at home all the while they were boating together        my wife and my near neighbours wife    till there entered a woman i loved more than life and we sat and sat on and beheld the uprising dark weather       with a sense that some mischief was rife  tidings came that the boat had capsized and that one of the ladies       was drownedwhich of them was unknown    and i marvelledmy friends wifeor was it my own who had gone in such wise to the land where the sun as the shade is      we learnt it was his had so gone  then i cried in unrest  he is free  but no good is releasing       to him as it would be to me    but it is said the woman i loved quietly how i asked her  because he has long loved me too without ceasing       and its just the same thing dont you see    i knew a lady club song    i knew a lady when the days    grew long and evenings goldened    but i was not emboldened by her prompt eyes and winning ways  and when old winter nipt the haws    anothers wife ill be    and then youll care for me she said and think how sweet i was  and soon she shone as anothers wife    as such i often met her    and sighed how i regret her my folly cuts me like a knife  and then today her husband came    and moaned why did you flout her    well could i do without her for both our burdens you are to blame    a house with a history    there is a house in a city street    some past ones made their own its floors were crisscrossed by their feet       and their babblings beat    from ceiling to white hearthstone  and who are peopling its parlours now    who talk across its floor mere freshlings are they blank of brow       who read not how    its prime had passed before  their raw equipments scenes and says    afflicted its memoried face that had seen every larger phase       of human ways    before these filled the place  to them that houses tale is theirs    no former voices call aloud therein  its aspect bears       their joys and cares    alone from wall to wall    a procession of dead days    i see the ghost of a perished day i know his face and the feel of his dawn twas he who took me far away    to a spot strange and gray look at me day and then pass on but come again  yes come anon  enters another into view his features are not cold or white but rosy as a vein seen through    too soon he smiles adieu adieu o ghostday of delight but come and grace my dying sight  enters the day that brought the kiss he brought it in his foggy hand to where the mumbling river is    and the high clematis it lent new colour to the land and all the boy within me manned  ah this one  yes i know his name he is the day that wrought a shine even on a precinct common and tame    as twere of purposed aim he shows him as a rainbow sign of promise made to me and mine  the next stands forth in his morning clothes and yet despite their misty blue they mark no sombre customgrowths    that joyous living loathes but a meteor act that left in its queue a train of sparks my lifetime through  i almost tremble at his nod  this next in trainwho looks at me as i were slave and he were god    wielding an iron rod i close my eyes yet still is he in front there looking mastery  in the similitude of a nurse the phantom of the next one comes i did not know what better or worse    chancings might bless or curse when his original glossed the thrums of ivy bringing that which numbs  yes trees were turning in their sleep upon their windy pillows of gray when he stole in  silent his creep    on the grassed eastern steep    i shall not soon forget that day and what his third hour took away    he follows himself    in a heavy time i dogged myself    along a louring way till my leading self to my following self    said  why do you hang on me       so harassingly  i have watched you heart of mine i cried    so often going astray and leaving me that i have pursued    feeling such truancy       ought not to be  he said no more and i dogged him on    from noon to the dun of day by prowling paths until anew    he begged  please turn and flee        what do you see  methinks i see a man said i    dimming his hours to gray i will not leave him while i know    part of myself is he       who dreams such dree  i go to my old friends house he urged    so do not watch me pray well i will leave you in peace said i    though of this poignancy       you should fight free  your friend o other me is dead    you know not what you say  that do i  and at his greengrassed door    by nights bright galaxy       i bend a knee   the yewplumes moved like mockers beards    though only boughs were they and i seemed to go yet still was there    and am and there haunt we       thus bootlessly    the singing woman       there was a singing woman       came riding across the mead    at the time of the mild may weather          tameless tireless this song she sung  i am fair i am young       and many turned to heed     and the same singing woman       sat crooning in her need    at the time of the winter weather          friendless fireless she sang this song  life thourt too long       and there was none to heed    without not within her    it was what you bore with you woman    not inly were that throned you from all else human    however fair  it was that strange freshness you carried    into a soul whereon no thought of yours tarried    two moments at all  and out from his spirit flew death    and bale and ban like the cornchaff under the breath    of the winnowingfan    o i wont lead a homely life to an old air    o i wont lead a homely life as fathers jack and mothers jill but i will be a fiddlers wife    with music mine at will       just a little tune       another one soon    as i merrily fling my fill  and she became a fiddlers dear and merry all day she strove to be and he played and played afar and near    but never at home played he       any little tune       or late or soon    and sunk and sad was she    in the small hours    i lay in my bed and fiddled    with a dreamland viol and bow and the tunes flew back to my fingers    i had melodied years ago it was two or three in the morning    when i fancyfiddled so long reels and countrydances    and hornpipes swift and slow  and soon anon came crossing    the chamber in the gray figures of jigging fieldfolk     saviours of corn and hay  to the air of haste to the wedding    as after a weddingday yea up and down the middle    in windless whirls went they  there danced the bride and bridegroom    and couples in a train gay partners time and travail    had longwhiles stilled amain    it seemed a thing for weeping    to find at slumbers wane and mornings sly increeping    that now not then held reign    the little old table    creak little wood thing creak when i touch you with elbow or knee that is the way you speak of one who gave you to me  you little table she brought  brought me with her own hand as she looked at me with a thought that i did not understand   whoever owns it anon and hears it will never know what a history hangs upon this creak from long ago    vagg hollow    vagg hollow is a marshy spot on the old roman road near ilchester where things are seen  merchandise was formerly fetched inland from the canalboats at loadbridge by waggons this way  what do you see in vagg hollow little boy when you go in the morning at five on your lonely drive i see mens souls who follow till weve passed where the road lies low when they vanish at our creaking  they are like white faces speaking beside and behind the waggon  one just as fathers was when here the waggoner drinks from his flagon or hed flinch when the hollow is near but he does not give me any  sometimes the faces are many but i walk along by the horses he asleep on the straw as we jog and i hear the loud watercourses and the drops from the trees in the fog and watch till the day is breaking  and the wind out by tintinhull waking i hear in it fathers call as he called when i saw him dying and he sat by the fire last fall and mother stood by sighing but im not afraid at all    the dream iswhich    i am laughing by the brook with her    splashed in its tumbling stir and then it is a blankness looms    as if i walked not there nor she but found me in haggard rooms    and treading a lonely stair  with radiant cheeks and rapid eyes    we sit where none espies till a harsh change comes edging in    as no such scene were there but winter and i were bent and thin    and cindergray my hair  we dance in heys around the hall    weightless as thistleball and then a curtain drops between    as if i danced not there but wandered through a mounded green    to find her i knew where  march 1913    the country wedding a fiddlers story    little fogs were gathered in every hollow but the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather as we marched with our fiddles over the heather  how it comes backto their wedding that day  our getting there brought our neighbours and all o till two and two the couples stood ready and her father said  souls for gods sake be steady and we strung up our fiddles and sounded out a  the groomsman he stared and said you must follow but wed gone to fiddle in front of the party our feelings as friends being true and hearty and fiddle in front we didall the way  yes from their door by milltailshallow and up styleslane and by frontstreet houses where stood maids bachelors and spouses who cheered the songs that we knew how to play  i bowed the treble before her father michael the tenor in front of the lady the bassviol reuband right well played he  the serpent jim ay to church and back  i thought the bridegroom was flurried rather as we kept up the tune outside the chancel while they were swearing things none can cancel inside the walls to our drumsticks whack  too gay she pleaded  clouds may gather and sorrow come  but she gave in laughing and by suppertime when wed got to the quaffing her fears were forgot and her smiles werent slack  a grand wedding twas  and what would follow we never thought  or that we should have buried her on the same day with the man that married her a day like the first half hazy half clear  yes  little fogs were in every hollow though the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather when we went to play em to church together and carried em there in an after year    first or last song       if grief come early    joy comes late    if joy come early    grief will wait       aye my dear and tender  wise ones joy them early while the cheeks are red banish grief till surly time has dulled their dread     and joy being ours    ere youth has flown    the later hours    may find us gone       aye my dear and tender    lonely days    lonely her fate was environed from sight in the house where the gate was past finding at night none there to share it no one to tell long shed to bear it and bore it well  elsewhere just so she spent many a day wishing to go she continued to stay and people without basked warm in the air but none sought her out or knew she was there even birthdays were passed so sunny and shady years did it last so for this sad lady never declaring it no one to tell still she kept bearing it  bore it well  the days grew chillier and then she went to a city familiar in years forespent when she walked gaily far to and fro but now moving frailly could nowhere go the cheerful colour of houses shed known had died to a duller and dingier tone streets were now noisy where once had rolled a few quiet coaches or citizens strolled through the partywall of the memoried spot they danced at a ball who recalled her not tramlines lay crossing once gravelled slopes metal rods clanked and electric ropes so she endured it all thin thinner wrought until time cured it all and she knew nought  versified from a diary  versified from a diary    what did it mean    what did it mean that noontide when you bade me pluck the flower within the other womans bower    whom i knew nought of then  i thought the flower blushed deeplieraye and as i drew its stalk to me it seemed to breathe  i am i see made use of in a human play  and while i plucked upstarted sheer as phantom from the pane thereby a corpselike countenance with eye that iced me by its baleful peer     silent as from a bier     when i came back your face had changed    it was no face for me o did it speak of hearts estranged    and deadly rivalry     in times before    i darked your door    to seise me of    mere second love which still the haunting first deranged    at the dinnertable    i sat at dinner in my prime and glimpsed my face in the sideboardglass and started as if i had seen a crime and prayed the ghastly show might pass  wrenched wrinkled features met my sight grinning back to me as my own i wellnigh fainted with affright at finding me a haggard crone  my husband laughed  he had slily set a warping mirror there in whim to startle me  my eyes grew wet i spoke not all the eve to him  he was sorry he said for what he had done and took away the distorting glass uncovering the accustomed one and so it ended  no alas  fifty years later when he died i sat me in the selfsame chair thinking of him  till wearyeyed i saw the sideboard facing there  and from its mirror looked the lean thing id become each wrinkle and score the image of me that i had seen in jest there fifty years before    the marble tablet    there it stands though alas what a little of her    shows in its cold white look not her glance glide or smile not a tittle of her    voice like the purl of a brook    not her thoughts that you read like a book  it may stand for her once in november    when first she breathed

   i missed one night but the next i went    it was gusty above and clear she was there with the look of one illcontent    and said  do not come near   i am sorry last night to have failed you here    and now i have travelled all day and its long rowing back to the westhoe pier    so brief must be my stay   o man of mystery why not say    out plain to me all you mean why you missed last night and must now away    isanother has come between    o woman so mocking in mood and mien    so be it i replied and if i am due at a differing scene    before the dark has died  tis that unresting to wander wide    has ever been my plight and at least i have met you at cremyll side    if not last eve tonight   you get small restthat read i quite    and so do i maybe though theres a rest hid safe from sight    elsewhere awaiting me  a mad star crossed the sky to the sea    wasting in sparks as it streamed and when i looked to where stood she    she had changed much changed it seemed  the sparks of the star in her pupils gleamed    she was vague as a vapour now and ere of its meaning i had dreamed    shed vanishedi knew not how  i stood on long each clifftop bough    like a cynic nodding there moved up and down though no mans brow    but mine met the wayward air  still stood i wholly unaware    of what had come to pass or had brought the secret of my new fair    to my old love alas  i went down then by crag and grass    to the boat wherein i had come said the man with the oars  this news of the lass    of edgcumbe is sharp for some  yes  found this daybreak stiff and numb    on the shore here whither shed sped to meet her lover last night in the glum    and he came not tis said  and she leapt down hearthit  pity shes dead    so much for the faithfulbent    i looked and again a star overhead    shot through the firmament    she who saw not       did you see something within the house that made me call you before the red sunsetting something that all this common scene endows with a richened impress there can be no forgetting     i have found nothing to see therein o sage that should have made you urge me to enter nothing to fire the soul or the sense to win i rate you as a rare misrepresenter     go anew ladyin by the right    well  why does your face not shine like the face of moses i found no moving thing there save the light and shadow flung on the wall by the outside roses     go yet once more pray  look on a seat i go    o sage its only a man that sits there with eyes on the sun  muteaverage head to feet no moreno more  just one the place befits there     as the rays reach in through the open door and he looks at his hand and the sun glows through his fingers while hes thinking thoughts whose tenour is no more to me than the swaying rosetree shade that lingers     no more  and years drew on and on till no sun came dank fogs the house enfolding and she saw inside when the form in the flesh had gone as a vision what she had missed when the real beholding    the old workman    why are you so bent down before your time old mason  many have not left their prime so far behind at your age and can still    stand full upright at will  he pointed to the mansionfront hard by and to the stones of the quoin against the sky those upper blocks he said that there you see    it was that ruined me  there stood in the air up to the parapet crowning the corner height the stones as set by himashlar whereon the gales might drum    for centuries to come  i carried them up he said by a ladder there the last was as big a load as i could bear but on i heaved and something in my back    moved as twere with a crack  so i got crookt  i never lost that sprain and those who live there walled from wind and rain by freestone that i lifted do not know    that my lifes ache came so  they dont know me or even know my name but good i think it somehow all the same to have kept em safe from harm and right and tight    though it has broke me quite  yes that i fixed it firm up there i am proud facing the hail and snow and sun and cloud and to stand storms for ages beating round    when i lie underground    the sailors mother       o whence do you come figure in the nightfog that chills me numb  i come to you across from my house up there and i dont mind the brinemist clinging to me    that blows from the quay for i heard him in my chamber and thought you unaware     but what did you hear that brought you blindly knocking in this middlewatch so drear  my sailor sons voice as twere calling at your door and i dont mind my bare feet clammy on the stones    and the blight to my bones for he only knows of this house i lived in before     nobodys nigh woman like a skeleton with socketsunk eye  ahnobodys nigh  and my life is drearisome and this is the old home we loved in many a day    before he went away and the salt fog mops me  and nobodys come  from to please his wife    outside the casement a reminiscence of the war       we sat in the room    and praised her whom we saw in the porticoshade outside    she could not hear    what was said of her but smiled for its purport we did not hide     then in was brought    that message fraught with evil fortune for her out there    whom we loved that day    more than any could say and would fain have fenced from a waft of care     and the question pressed    like lead on each breast should we cloak the tidings or call her and tell    it was too intense    a choice for our sense as we pondered and watched her we loved so well     yea spirit failed us    at what assailed us how long while seeing what soon must come    should we counterfeit    no knowledge of it and stay the stroke that would blanch and numb     and thus before    for evermore joy left her we practised to beguile    her innocence when    she now and again looked in and smiled us another smile    the passerby l h recalls her romance    he used to pass welltrimmed and brushed    my window every day and when i smiled on him he blushed that youth quite as a girl might aye    in the shyest way  thus often did he pass hereby    that youth of bounding gait until the one who blushed was i and he became as here i sate    my joy my fate  and now he passes by no more    that youth i loved too true i grieve should he as here of yore pass elsewhere seated in his view    some maiden new  if such should be alas for her    hell make her feel him dear become her daily comforter then tire him of her beauteous gear    and disappear    i was the midmost    i was the midmost of my world    when first i frisked me free for though within its circuit gleamed    but a small company and i was immature they seemed    to bend their looks on me  she was the midmost of my world    when i went further forth and hence it was that whether i turned    to south east west or north beams of an allday polestar burned    from that new axe of earth  where now is midmost in my world    i trace it not at all no midmost shows it here or there    when wistful voices call we are fain  we are fain from everywhere    on earths bewildering ball    a sound in the night woodsford castle  17    what do i catch upon the nightwind husband  what is it sounds in this house so eerily it seems to be a womans voice  each little while i hear it    and it much troubles me  tis but the eaves dripping down upon the plinthslopes letting fancies worry theesure tis a foolish thing when we were ony coupled halfanhour before the noontide    and now its but evening  yet seems it still a womans voice outside the castle husband and tis cold tonight and rain beats and this is a lonely place didst thou fathom much of womankind in travel or adventure    ere ever thou sawest my face  it may be a tree bride that rubs his arms acrosswise if it is not the eavesdrip upon the lower slopes or the river at the bend where it whirls about the hatches    like a creature that sighs and mopes  yet it still seems to me like the crying of a woman and it saddens me much that so piteous a sound on this my bridal night when i would get agone from sorrow    should so ghostlike wander round  to satisfy thee love i will strike the flintandsteel then and set the rushcandle up and undo the door and take the new hornlantern that we bought upon our journey    and throw the light over the moor  he struck a light and breeched and booted in the further chamber and lit the new hornlantern and went from her sight and vanished down the turret and she heard him pass the postern    and go out into the night  she listened as she lay till she heard his step returning and his voice as he unclothed him  twas nothing as i said but the norwest wind ablowing from the moor athart the river    and the tree that taps the gurgoylehead  nay husband you perplex me for if the noise i heard here awaking me from sleep so were but as you avow the rainfall and the wind and the treebough and the river    why is it silent now  and why is thy hand and thy clasping arm so shaking and thy sleeve and tags of hair so muddy and so wet and why feel i thy heart athumping every time thou kissest me    and thy breath as if hard to get  he lay there in silence for a while still quickly breathing then started up and walked about the room resentfully o woman witch whom i in sooth against my will have wedded    why castedst thou thy spells on me  there was one i loved once  the cry you heard was her cry she came to me tonight and her plight was passing sore as no woman    yea and it was een the cry you heard wife    but she will cry no more  and now i cant abide thee  this place it hath a curse ont this farmstead once a castle  ill get me straight away he dressed this time in darkness unspeaking as she listened    and went ere the dawn turned day  they found a womans body at a spot called rocky shallow where the froom stream curves amid the moorland washed aground and they searched about for him the yeoman who had darkly known her    but he could not be found  and the bride left for goodandall the farmstead once a castle and in a county far away lives mourns and sleeps alone and thinks in windy weather that she hears a woman crying    and sometimes an infants moan    on a discovered curl of hair    when your soft welcomings were said this curl was waving on your head and when we walked where breakers dinned it sported in the sun and wind and when i had won your words of grace it brushed and clung about my face then to abate the misery of absentness you gave it me  where are its fellows now  ah they for brightest brown have donned a gray and gone into a caverned ark ever unopened always dark  yet this one curl untouched of time beams with live brown as in its prime so that it seems i even could now restore it to the living brow by bearing down the western road till i had reached your old abode  february 1913    an old likeness recalling r t    who would have thought that not having missed her talks tears laughter in absence or sought to recall for so long her gamut of song or ever to waft her signal of aught that she fancyfanned would well understand i should have kissed her picture when scanned yawning years after  yet seeing her poor dimoutlined form chancewise at nighttime some old allure came on me warm fresh pleadful pure as in that bright time at a far season of love and unreason and took me by storm here in this blighttime  and thus it arose that yawning years after our early flows of wit and laughter and framing of rhymes at idle times at sight of her painting though she lies cold in churchyard mould i took its feinting as real and kissed it as if i had wist it herself of old    her apotheosis secretum meum mihi faded womans song    there was a spell of leisure    no record vouches when with honours praises pleasure    to womankind from men  but no such lures bewitched me    no hand was stretched to raise no gracious gifts enriched me    no voices sang my praise  yet an iris at that season    amid the accustomed slight from denseness dull unreason    ringed me with living light    sacred to the memory mary h    that sacred to the memory is clearly carven there i own and all may think that on the stone the words have been inscribed by me in bare conventionality  they know not and will never know that my full script is not confined to that stone space but stands deep lined upon the landscape high and low wherein she made such worthy show    to a wellnamed dwelling    glad old house of lichened stonework what i owed you in my lone work    noon and night whensoever faint or ailing letting go my grasp and failing    you lent light  how by that fair title came you did some forward eye so name you    knowing that one sauntering down his century blindly would remark your sound so kindly    and be won  smile in sunlight sleep in moonlight bask in april may and junelight    zephyrfanned let your chambers show no sorrow blanching day or stuporing morrow    while they stand    the whipperin    my father was the whipperin     is stillif im not misled and now i see where the hedge is thin    a little spot of red    surely it is my father    going to the kennelshed  i cursed and fought my fatheraye    and sailed to a foreign land and feeling sorry im back to stay    please god as his helping hand    surely it is my father    near where the kennels stand  true  whipperin he used to be    for twenty years or more and you did go away to sea    as youths have done before    yes oddly enough that red there    is the very coat he wore  but hehes dead was thrown somehow    and gave his back a crick and though that is his coat tis now    the scarecrow of a rick    youll see when you get nearer     tis spread out on a stick  you see when all had settled down    your mothers things were sold and she went back to her own town    and the coat ate out with mould    is now used by the farmer    for scaring as tis old    a military appointment scherzando    so back you have come from the town nan dear and have you seen him there or near     that soldier of mine  who long since promised to meet me here  o yes nell  from the town i come and have seen your lover on sickleave home     that soldier of yours  who swore to meet you or strikehimdumb  but has kept himself of late away yetin short hes coming i heard him say     that lover of yours  to this very spot on this very day  then ill wait ill wait through wet or dry ill give him a goblet brimming high     this lover of mine  and not of complaint one word or sigh  nell him i have chanced so much to see thathe has grown the lover of me     that lover of yours  and its here our meeting is planned to be    the milestone by the rabbitburrow on yellham hill    in my loamy nook as i dig my hole i observe men look at a stone and sigh as they pass it by to some far goal  something it says to their glancing eyes that must distress the frail and lame and the strong of frame gladden or surprise  do signs on its face declare how far feet have to trace before they gain some blest champaign where no gins are    the lament of the lookingglass    words from the mirror softly pass    to the curtains with a sigh why should i trouble again to glass    these smileless things hard by since she i pleasured once alas    is now no longer nigh  ive imaged shadows of coursing cloud    and of the plying limb on the pensive pine when the air is loud    with its aerial hymn but never do they make me proud    to catch them within my rim  i flash back phantoms of the night    that sometimes flit by me i echo roses red and white     the loveliest blooms that be  but now i never hold to sight    so sweet a flower as she    crosscurrents    they parteda pallid trembling i pair    and rushing down the lane he left her lonely near me there   i asked her of their pain  it is for ever at length she said    his friends have schemed it so that the longpurposed day to wed    never shall we two know  in such a cruel case said i    love will contrive a course well no    a thing may underlie    which robs that of its force  a thing i could not tell him of    though all the year i have tried this  never could i have given him love    even had i been his bride  so when his kinsfolk stop the way    pointblank there could not be a happening in the world today    more opportune for me  yet hearno doubt to your surprise     i am sorry for his sake that i have escaped the sacrifice    i was prepared to make    the old neighbour and the new    twas to greet the new rector i called i here    but in the armchair i see my old friend for long years installed here    who palely nods to me  the new man explains what hes planning    in a smart and cheerful tone and i listen the while that im scanning    the figure behind his own  the newcomer urges things on me    i return a vague smile thereto the olden face gazing upon me    just as it used to do  and on leaving i scarcely remember    which neighbour today i have seen the one carried out in september    or him who but entered yestreen    the chosen    greek text which cannot be reproduced  a woman for whom great gods might strive    i said and kissed her there and then i thought of the other five    and of how charms outwear  i thought of the first with her eating eyes and i thought of the second with hers greengray and i thought of the third experienced wise and i thought of the fourth who sang all day  and i thought of the fifth whom id called a jade    and i thought of them all tearfraught and that each had shown her a passable maid    yet not of the favour sought  so i traced these words on the bark of a beech just at the falling of the mast after scanning five yes each and each ive found the woman desiredat last  i feel a strange benumbing spell    as one illwished said she and soon it seemed that something fell    was starving her love for me  i feel some curse  o five were there and wanly she swerved and went away i followed sick  night numbed the air and dark the mournful moorland lay  i cried  o darling turn your head    but never her face i viewed o turn o turn again i said    and miserably pursued  at length i came to a christcross stone which she had passed without discern and i knelt upon the leaves there strown and prayed aloud that she might turn  i rose and looked and turn she did    i cried my heart revives look more she said  i looked as bid    her face was all the fives  all the five women clear come back i saw in herwith her made one the while she drooped upon the track and her frail term seemed wellnigh run  shed half forgot me in her change    who are you  wont you say who you may be you man so strange    following since yesterday  i took the composite form she was and carried her to an arbour small not passionmoved but even because in one i could atone to all  and there she lies and there i tend    till my lifes threads unwind a various womanhood in blend     not one but all combined    the inscription a tale    sir john was entombed and the crypt was closed and she like a soul that could meet no more the sight of the sun inclined her in weepings and prayings continually    as his widowed one  and to pleasure her in her sorrow and fix his name as a memory times fierce frost should never kill she caused to be richly chased a brass to his fame    which should link them still  for she bonded her name with his own on the brazen page as if dead and interred there with him and cold and numb omitting the day of her dying and year of her age    till her end should come  and implored good people to pray of their charytie for these twaine soulesyea she who did last remain forgoing heavens bliss if ever with spouse should she    again have lain  even there as it first was set you may see it now writ in quaint church text with the date of her death left bare in the aged estminster aisle where the folk yet bow    themselves in prayer  thereafter some years slid till there came a day when it slowly began to be marked of the standersby that she would regard the brass and would bend away    with a drooping sigh  now the lady was fair as any the eye might scan through a summer day of rovinga type at whose lip despite her maturing seasons no meet man    would be loth to sip  and her heart was stirred with a lightning love to its pith for a newcomer who while less in years was one full eager and able to make her his own forthwith    restrained of none  but she answered nay deathwhite and still as he urged she adversely spake overmuch as she loved the while till he pressed for why and she led with the face of one scourged    to the neighbouring aisle  and showed him the words ever gleaming upon her pew memorizing her there as the knights eternal wife or falsing such debarred inheritance due    of celestial life  he blenched and reproached her that one yet undeceased should bury her futurethat future which none can spell and she wept and purposed anon to inquire of the priest    if the price were hell  of her wedding in face of the record  her lover agreed and they parted before the brass with a shudderful kiss for it seemed to flash out on their impulse of passionate need    mock ye not this  well the priest whom more perceptions moved than one said she erred at the first to have written as if she were dead her name and adjuration but since it was done    nought could be said  save that she must abide by the pledge for the peace of her soul and so by her life maintain the apostrophe good if she wished anon to reach the coveted goal    of beatitude  to erase from the consecrate text her prayer as there prayed would aver that since earths joys most drew her past doubt friends prayers for her joy above by jesus aid    could be done without  moreover she thought of the laughter the shrug the jibe that would rise at her back in the nave when she should pass as anothers avowed by the words she had chosen to inscribe    on the changeless brass  and so for months she replied to her love  no no while sorrow was gnawing her beauties ever and more till he longsuffering and weary grew to show    less warmth than before  and after an absence wrote words absolute that he gave her till midsummer morn to make her mind clear and that if by then she had not said yea to his suit    he should wed elsewhere  thence on at unwonted times through the lengthening days she was seen in the churchat dawn or when the sun dipt and the moon rose standing with hands joined blank of gaze    before the script  she thinned as he came not shrank like a creature that cowers as summer drew nearer but still had not promised to wed when just at the zenith of june in the still night hours    she was missed from her bed  the church they whispered with qualms where often she sits they found her  facing the brass there else seeing none but feeling the words with her finger gibbering in fits    and she knew them not one  and so she remained in her handmaids charge late soon tracing words in the air with her finger as seen that night  those incised on the brasstill at length unwatched one noon    she vanished from sight  and as talebearers tell thence on to her lasttaken breath was unseen save as wraith that in front of the brass made moan so that ever the way of her life and the time of her death    remained unknown  and hence as indited above you may read even now the quaint churchtext with the date of her death left bare in the aged estminster aisle where folk yet bow    themselves in prayer  october 30 1907    the marblestreeted town    i reach the marblestreeted town    whose sound outbreathes its air       of sharp seasalts i see the movement up and down       as when she was there ships of all countries come and go    the bandsmen boom in the sun       a throbbing waltz the schoolgirls laugh along the hoe       as when she was one  i move away as the music rolls    the place seems not to mind       that sheof old the brightest of its native souls        left it behind over this green aforedays she    on light treads went and came       yea times untold yet none here knows her history        has heard her name  plymouth 1914    a woman driving    how she held up the horses heads    firmlipped with steady rein down that grim steep the coastguard treads    till all was safe again  with form erect and keen contour    she passed against the sea and dipping into the chines obscure    was seen no more by me  to others she appeared anew    at times of dusky light but always so they told withdrew    from close and curious sight  some said her silent wheels would roll    rutless on softest loam and even that her steeds footfall    sank not upon the foam  where drives she now  it may be where    no mortal horses are but in a chariot of the air    towards some radiant star    a womans trust    if he should live a thousand years    hed find it not again    that scorn of him by men could less disturb a womans trust in him as a steadfast star which must rise scathless from the nether spheres if he should live a thousand years    hed find it not again  she waited like a little child    unchilled by damps of doubt    while from her eyes looked out a confidence sublime as springs when stressed by winters loiterings thus howsoever the wicked wiled she waited like a little child    unchilled by damps of doubt  through cruel years and crueller    thus she believed in him    and his aurore so dim that after fenweeds flowers would blow and above all things did she show her faith in his good faith with her through cruel years and crueller    thus she believed in him    best times    we went a days excursion to the stream basked by the bank and bent to the ripplegleam       and i did not know       that life would show however it might flower no finer glow  i walked in the sunday sunshine by the road that wound towards the wicket of your abode       and i did not think       that life would shrink to nothing ere it shed a rosier pink  unlooked for i arrived on a rainy night and you hailed me at the door by the swaying light       and i full forgot       that life might not again be touching that ecstatic height  and that calm eve when you walked up the stair after a gaiety prolonged and rare       no thought soever       that you might never walk down again struck me as i stood there  rewritten from an old draft    the casual acquaintance    while he was here in breath and bone    to speak to and to see would i had knownmore clearly known     what that man did for me  when the wind scraped a minor lay    and the spent west from white to gray turned tiredly and from gray    to broadest bands of night  but i saw not and he saw not    what shining lifetides flowed to meward from his casual jot    of service on that road  he would have said  twas nothing new    we all do what we can twas only what one man would do    for any other man  now that i gauge his goodliness    hes slipped from human eyes and when he passed theres none can guess    or point out where he lies    intra sepulchrum       what curious things we said    what curious things we did up there in the world we walked till dead    our kith and kin amid     how we played at love    and its wildness weakness woe yes played thereat far more than enough    as it turned out i trow     played at believing in gods    and observing the ordinances i for your sake in impossible codes    right ready to acquiesce     thinking our lives unique    quite quainter than usual kinds we held that we could not abide a week    the tether of typic minds    yet people who day by day    pass by and look at us from over the wall in a casual way    are of this unconscious     and feel if anything    that none can be buried here removed from commonest fashioning    or lending note to a bier     no twain who in heartheaves proved    themselves at all adept who more than many laughed and loved    who more than many wept     or were as sprites or elves    into blind matter hurled or ever could have been to themselves    the centre of the world    the whitewashed wall    why does she turn in that shy soft way    whenever she stirs the fire and kiss to the chimneycorner wall    as if entranced to admire its whitewashed bareness more than the sight    of a rose in richest green i have known her long but this raptured rite    i never before have seen   well once when her son cast his shadow there    a friend took a pencil and drew him upon that flamelit wall  and the lines    had a lifelike semblance to him and there long stayed his familiar look    but one day ere she knew the whitener came to cleanse the nook    and covered the face from view  yes he said  my brush goes on with a rush    and the draught is buried under when you have to whiten old cots and brighten    what else can you do i wonder but she knows hes there  and when she yearns    for him deep in the labouring night she sees him as close at hand and turns    to him under his sheet of white    just the same    i sat  it all was past hope never would hail again fair days had ceased at a blast the world was a darkened den  the beauty and dream were gone and the halo in which i had hied so gaily gallantly on had suffered blot and died  i went forth heedless whither in a cloud too black for name  people frisked hither and thither the world was just the same    the last time    the kiss had been given and taken    and gathered to many past it never could reawaken    but you heard none say  its the last  the clock showed the hour and the minute    but you did not turn and look you read no finis in it    as at closing of a book  but you read it all too rightly    when at a time anon a figure lay stretched out whitely    and you stood looking thereon    the seven times    the dark was thick  a boy he seemed at that time    who trotted by me with uncertain air ill tell my tale he murmured for i fancy    a friend goes there      then thus he told  i reachedtwas for the first time     a dwelling  life was clogged in me with care i thought not i should meet an eyesome maiden    but found one there  i entered on the precincts for the second time     twas an adventure fit and fresh and fair  i slackened in my footsteps at the porchway    and found her there  i rose and travelled thither for the third time    the hopehues growing gayer and yet gayer as i hastened round the boscage of the outskirts    and found her there  i journeyed to the place again the fourth time    the best and rarest visit of the rare as it seemed to me engrossed about these goings    and found her there  when i bent me to my pilgrimage the fifth time    softthinking as i journeyed i would dare a certain word at token of good auspice    i found her there  that landscape did i traverse for the sixth time    and dreamed on what we purposed to prepare i reached a tryst before my journeys end came    and found her there  i went againlong afteraye the seventh time    the look of things was sinister and bare as i caught no customed signal heard no voice call    nor found her there  and now i gad the globeday night and any time    to light upon her hiding unaware and maybe i shall nigh me to some nymphniche    and find her there   but how said i has your so little lifetime    given roomage for such loving loss despair a boy so young  forthwith i turned my lantern    upon him there  his head was white  his small form fine aforetime    was shrunken with old age and battering wear an eightyyears long plodder saw i pacing    beside me there    the suns last look on the country girl m h    the sun threw down a radiant spot    on the face in the windingsheet  the face it had lit when a babes in its cot and the sun knew not and the face knew not    that soon they would no more meet  now that the grave has shut its door    and lets not in one ray do they wonder that they meet no more  that face and its beaming visitor     that met so many a day  december 1915    in a london flat    i  you look like a widower she said through the foldingdoors with a laugh from the bed as he sat by the fire in the outer room reading late on a night of gloom and a cabhacks wheeze and the clap of its feet in its breathless pace on the smooth wet street were all that came to them now and then    you really do she quizzed again  ii  and the spirits behind the curtains heard and also laughed amused at her word and at her lighthearted view of him lets get him made sojust for a whim said the phantom ironic  twould serve her right if we coaxed the will to do it some night o pray not pleaded the younger one the sprite of the pities  she said it in fun  iii  but so it befell whatever the cause that what she had called him he next year was and on such a night when she lay elsewhere he watched by those phantoms again sat there and gazed as if gazing on far faint shores at the empty bed through the foldingdoors as he remembered her words and wept that she had forgotten them where she slept    drawing details in an old church    i hear the bellrope sawing and the oilless axle grind as i sit alone here drawing what some gothic brain designed and i catch the toll that follows    from the lagging bell ere it spreads to hills and hollows where the parish people dwell  i ask not whom it
