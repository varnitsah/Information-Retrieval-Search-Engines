23963985	a ride across palestine  by anthony trollope     circumstances took me to the holy land without a companion and compelled me to visit bethany the mount of olives and the church of the sepulchre alone  i acknowledge myself to be a gregarious animal or perhaps rather one of those which nature has intended to go in pairs  at any rate i dislike solitude and especially travelling solitude and was therefore rather sad at heart as i sat one night at zs hotel in jerusalem thinking over my proposed wanderings for the next few days  early on the following morning i intended to start of course on horseback for the dead sea the banks of jordan jericho and those mountains of the wilderness through which it is supposed that our saviour wandered for the forty days when the devil tempted him  i would then return to the holy city and remaining only long enough to refresh my horse and wipe the dust from my hands and feet i would start again for jaffa and there catch a certain austrian steamer which would take me to egypt such was my programme and i confess that i was but ill contented with it seeing that i was to be alone during the time  i had already made all my arrangements and though i had no reason for any doubt as to my personal security during the trip i did not feel altogether satisfied with them  i intended to take a french guide or dragoman who had been with me for some days and to put myself under the peculiar guardianship of two bedouin arabs who were to accompany me as long as i should remain east of jerusalem this travelling through the desert under the protection of bedouins was in idea pleasant enough and i must here declare that i did not at all begrudge the forty shillings which i was told by our british consul that i must pay them for their trouble in accordance with the established tariff  but i did begrudge the fact of the tariff  i would rather have fallen in with my friendly arabs as it were by chance and have rewarded their fidelity at the end of our joint journeyings by a donation of piastres to be settled by myself and which under such circumstances would certainly have been as agreeable to them as the stipulated sum  in the same way i dislike having waiters put down in my bill  i find that i pay them twice over and thus lose money and as they do not expect to be so treated i never have the advantage of their civility  the world i fear is becoming too fond of tariffs  a tariff said i to the consul feeling that the whole romance of my expedition would be dissipated by such an arrangement  then ill go alone ill take a revolver with me  you cant do it sir said the consul in a dry and somewhat angry tone  you have no more right to ride through that country without paying the regular price for protection than you have to stop in z s hotel without settling the bill  i could not contest the point so i ordered my bedouins for the appointed day exactly as i would send for a ticketporter at home and determined to make the best of it  the wild unlimited sands the desolation of the dead sea the rushing waters of jordan the outlines of the mountains of moabthose things the consular tariff could not alter nor deprive them of the glories of their association  i had submitted and the arrangements had been made  joseph my dragoman was to come to me with the horses and an arab groom at five in the morning and we were to encounter our bedouins outside the gate of st stephen down the hill where the road turns close to the tomb of the virgin  i was sitting alone in the public room at the hotel filling my flask with brandyfor matters of primary importance i never leave to servant dragoman or guidewhen the waiter entered and said that a gentleman wished to speak with me  the gentleman had not sent in his card or name but any gentleman was welcome to me in my solitude and i requested that the gentleman might enter  in appearance the gentleman certainly was a gentleman for i thought that i had never before seen a young man whose looks were more in his favour or whose face and gait and outward bearing seemed to betoken better breeding  he might be some twenty or twentyone years of age was slight and well made with very black hair which he wore rather long very dark long bright eyes a straight nose and teeth that were perfectly white  he was dressed throughout in grey tweed clothing having coat waistcoat and trousers of the same and in his hand he carried a very broadbrimmed straw hat  mr jones i believe he said as he bowed to me  jones is a good travelling name and if the reader will allow me i will call myself jones on the present occasion  yes i said pausing with the brandybottle in one hand and the flask in the other  thats my name im jones  can i do anything for you sir  why yes you can said he  my name is smithjohn smith  pray sit down mr smith i said pointing to a chair  will you do anything in this way and i proposed to hand the bottle to him as far as i can judge from a short stay you wont find much like that in jerusalem  he declined the cognac however and immediately began his story i hear mr jones said he that you are going to moab to morrow  well i replied i dont know whether i shall cross the water its not very easy i take it at all times but i shall certainly get as far as jordan  can i do anything for you in those parts  and then he explained to me what was the object of his visit  he was quite alone in jerusalem as i was myself and was staying at h s hotel  he had heard that i was starting for the dead sea and had called to ask if i objected to his joining me  he had found himself he said very lonely and as he had heard that i also was alone he had ventured to call and make his proposition  he seemed to be very bashful and half ashamed of what he was doing and when he had done speaking he declared himself conscious that he was intruding and expressed a hope that i would not hesitate to say so if his suggestion were from any cause disagreeable to me  as a rule i am rather shy of chance travelling english friends  it has so frequently happened to me that i have had to blush for the acquaintances whom i have selected that i seldom indulge in any close intimacies of this kind  but nevertheless i was taken with john smith in spite of his name  there was so much about him that was pleasant both to the eye and to the understanding  one meets constantly with men from contact with whom one revolts without knowing the cause of such dislike  the cut of their beard is displeasing or the mode in which they walk or speak  but on the other hand there are men who are attractive and i must confess that i was attracted by john smith at first sight  i hesitated however for a minute for there are sundry things of which it behoves a traveller to think before he can join a companion for such a journey as that which i was about to make  could the young man rise early and remain in the saddle for ten hours together  could he live upon hardboiled eggs and brandyandwater  could he take his chance of a tent under which to sleep and make himself happy with the bare fact of being in the desert  he saw my hesitation and attributed it to a cause which was not present in my mind at the moment though the subject was one of the greatest importance when strangers consent to join themselves together for a time and agree to become no strangers on the spur of the moment  of course i will take half the expense said he absolutely blushing as he mentioned the matter  as to that there will be very little  you have your own horse of course  oh yes  my dragoman and groomboy will do for both  but youll have to pay forty shillings to the arabs  theres no getting over that  the consul wont even look after your dead body if you get murdered without going through that ceremony  mr smith immediately produced his purse which he tendered to me if you will manage it all said he it will make it so much the easier and i shall be infinitely obliged to you  this of course i declined to do  i had no business with his purse and explained to him that if we went together we could settle that on our return to jerusalem  but could he go through really hard work i asked  he answered me with an assurance that he would and could do anything in that way that it was possible for man to perform  as for eating and drinking he cared nothing about it and would undertake to be astir at any hour of the morning that might be named  as for sleeping accommodation he did not care if he kept his clothes on for a week together  he looked slight and weak but he spoke so well and that without boasting that i ultimately agreed to his proposal and in a few minutes he took his leave of me promising to be at zs door with his horse at five oclock on the following morning  i wish youd allow me to leave my purse with you he said again  i cannot think of it  there is no possible occasion for it i said again  if there is anything to pay ill ask you for it when the journey is over  that forty shillings you must fork out  its a law of the medes and persians  id better give it you at once he said again offering me money but i would not have it  it would be quite time enough for that when the arabs were leaving us  because he added strangers i know are sometimes suspicious about money and i would not for worlds have you think that i would put you to expense  i assured him that i did not think so and then the subject was dropped  he was at any rate up to his time for when i came down on the following morning i found him in the narrow street the first on horseback  joseph the frenchman was strapping on to a rough pony our belongings and was staring at mr smith  my new friend unfortunately could not speak a word of french and therefore i had to explain to the dragoman how it had come to pass that our party was to be enlarged  but the bedouins will expect full pay for both said he alarmed men in that class and especially orientals always think that every arrangement of life let it be made in what way it will is made with the intention of saving some expense or cheating somebody out of some money  they do not understand that men can have any other object and are ever on their guard lest the saving should be made at their cost or lest they should be the victims of the fraud  all right said i  i shall be responsible monsieur said the dragoman piteously  it shall be all right said i again  if that does not satisfy you you may remain behind  if monsieur says it is all right of course it is so and then he completed his strapping  we took blankets with us of which i had to borrow two out of the hotel for my friend smith a small hamper of provisions a sack containing forage for the horses and a large empty jar so that we might supply ourselves with water when leaving the neighbourhood of wells for any considerable time  i ought to have brought these things for myself said smith quite unhappy at finding that he had thrown on me the necessity of catering for him  but i laughed at him saying that it was nothing he should do as much for me another time  i am prepared to own that i do not willingly rush upstairs and load myself with blankets out of strange rooms for men whom i do not know nor as a rule do i make all the smiths of the world free of my canteen  but with reference to this fellow i did feel more than ordinarily good natured and unselfish  there was something in the tone of his voice which was satisfactory and i should really have felt vexed had anything occurred at the last moment to prevent his going with me  let it be a rule with every man to carry an english saddle with him when travelling in the east  of what material is formed the nether man of a turk i have never been informed but i am sure that it is not flesh and blood  no flesh and bloodsimply flesh and blood could withstand the wear and tear of a turkish saddle  this being the case and the consequences being well known to me i was grieved to find that smith was not properly provided  he was seated on one of those hard red highpointed machines in which the shovels intended to act as stirrups are attached in such a manner and hang at such an angle as to be absolutely destructive to the leg of a christian  there is no part of the christian body with which the turkish saddle comes in contact that does not become more or less macerated  i have sat in one for days but i left it a flayed man and therefore i was sorry for smith  i explained this to him taking hold of his leg by the calf to show how the leather would chafe him but it seemed to me that he did not quite like my interference  never mind said he twitching his leg away i have ridden in this way before  then you must have suffered the very mischief  only a little and i shall be used to it now  you will not hear me complain  by heavens you might have heard me complain a mile off when i came to the end of a journey i once took  i roared like a bull when i began to cool  joseph could you not get a european saddle for mr smith  but joseph did not seem to like mr smith and declared such a thing to be impossible  no european in jerusalem would think of lending so precious an article except to a very dear friend joseph himself was on an english saddle and i made up my mind that after the first stage we would bribe him to make an exchange  and then we started  the bedouins were not with us but we were to meet them as i have said before outside st stephens gate  and if they are not there said joseph we shall be sure to come across them on the road  not there said i  how about the consuls tariff if they dont keep their part of the engagement  but joseph explained to me that their part of the engagement really amounted to thisthat we should ride into their country without molestation provided that such and such payments were made  it was the period of easter and jerusalem was full of pilgrims even at that early hour of the morning we could hardly make our way through the narrow streets  it must be understood that there is no accommodation in the town for the fourteen or fifteen thousand strangers who flock to the holy sepulchre at this period of the year  many of them sleep out in the open air lying on low benches which run along the outside walls of the houses or even on the ground wrapped in their thick hoods and cloaks  slumberers such as these are easily disturbed nor are they detained long at their toilets  they shake themselves like dogs and growl and stretch themselves and then they are ready for the day  we rode out of the town in a long file  first went the groomboy i forget his proper syrian appellation but we used to call him mucherry that sound being in some sort like the name  then followed the horse with the forage and blankets and next to him my friend smith in the turkish saddle  i was behind him and joseph brought up the rear  we moved slowly down the via dolorosa noting the spot at which our saviour is said to have fallen while bearing his cross we passed by pilates house and paused at the gate of the templethe gate which once was beautifullooking down into the hole of the pool in which the maimed and halt were healed whenever the waters moved  what names they are  and yet there at jerusalem they are bandied to and fro with as little reverence as are the fanciful appellations given by guides to rocks and stones and little lakes in all countries overrun by tourists  for those who would still fain believelet them stay at home said my friend smith  for those who cannot divide the wheat from the chaff let them stay at home i answered  and then we rode out through st stephens gate having the mountain of the men of galilee directly before us and the mount of olives a little to our right and the valley of jehoshaphat lying between us and it  of course you know all these places now said smith  i answered that i did know them well  and was it not better for you when you knew them only in holy writ he asked  no by jove said i  the mountains stand where they ever stood the same valleys are still green with the morning dew and the watercourses are unchanged  the children of mahomet may build their tawdry temple on the threshingfloor which david bought that there might stand the lords house  man may undo what man did even though the doer was solomon  but here we have gods handiwork and his own evidences  at the bottom of the steep descent from the city gate we came to the tomb of the virgin and by special agreement made with joseph we left our horses here for a few moments in order that we might descend into the subterranean chapel under the tomb in which mass was at this moment being said  there is something awful in that chapel when as at the present moment it is crowded with eastern worshippers from the very altar up to the top of the dark steps by which the descent is made  it must be remembered that eastern worshippers are not like the churchgoers of london or even of rome or cologne  they are wild men of various nations and races maronites from lebanon roumelians candiotes copts from upper egypt russians from the crimea armenians and abyssinians  they savour strongly of oriental life and of oriental dirt  they are clad in skins or hairy cloaks with huge hoods  their heads are shaved and their faces covered with short grisly fierce beards they are silent mostly looking out of their eyes ferociously as though murder were in their thoughts and rapine  but they never slouch or cringe in their bodies or shuffle in their gait  dirty fiercelooking uncouth repellent as they are there is always about them a something of personal dignity which is not compatible with an englishmans ordinary hat and pantaloons   as we were about to descend preparing to make our way through the crowd smith took hold of my arm  that will never do my dear fellow said i the job will be tough enough for a single file but we should never cut our way two and two  im broadshouldered and will go first  so i did and gradually we worked our way into the body of the chapel  how is it that englishmen can push themselves anywhere  these men were fiercelooking and had murder and rapine as i have said almost in their eyes  one would have supposed that they were not lambs or doves capable of being thrust here or there without anger on their part and they too were all anxious to descend and approach the altar  yet we did win our way through them and apparently no man was angry with us  i doubt after all whether a ferocious eye and a strong smell and dirt are so efficacious in creating awe and obedience in others as an open brow and traces of soap and water  i know this at leastthat a dirty maronite would make very little progress if he attempted to shove his way unfairly through a crowd of englishmen at the door of a london theatre  we did shove unfairly and we did make progress till we found ourselves in the centre of the dense crowd collected in the body of the chapel  having got so far our next object was to get out again  the place was dark mysterious and full of strange odours but darkness mystery and strange odours soon lose their charms when men have much work before them  joseph had made a point of being allowed to attend mass before the altar of the virgin but a very few minutes sufficed for his prayers  so we again turned round and pushed our way back again smith still following in my wake  the men who had let us pass once let us pass again without opposition or show of anger  to them the occasion was very holy  they were stretching out their hands in every direction with long tapers in order that they might obtain a spark of the sacred fire which was burning on one of the altars  as we made our way out we passed many who with dumb motions begged us to assist them in their object  and we did assist them getting lights for their tapers handing them to and fro and using the authority with which we seemed to be invested but smith i observed was much more courteous in this way to the women than to the men as i did not forget to remind him when we were afterwards on our road together  remounting our horses we rode slowly up the winding ascent of the mount of olives turning round at the brow of the hill to look back over jerusalem  sometimes i think that of all spots in the world this one should be the spot most cherished in the memory of christians  it was there that he stood when he wept over the city so much we do know though we are ignorant and ever shall be so of the site of his cross and of the tomb  and then we descended on the eastern side of the hill passing through bethany the town of lazarus and his sisters and turned our faces steadily towards the mountains of moab  hitherto we had met no bedouins and i interrogated my dragoman about them more than once but he always told me that it did not signify we should meet them he said before any danger could arise  as for danger said i i think more of this than i do of the arabs and i put my hand on my revolver  but as they agreed to be here here they ought to be  dont you carry a revolver smith  smith said that he never had done so but that he would take the charge of mine if i liked  to this however i demurred  i never part with my pistol to any one i said rather drily  but he explained that he only intended to signify that if there were danger to be encountered he would be glad to encounter it and i fully believed him  we shant have much fighting i replied but if there be any the tool will come readiest to the hand of its master but if you mean to remain here long i would advise you to get one these orientals are a people with whom appearances go a long way and as a rule fear and respect mean the same thing with them  a pistol hanging over your loins is no great trouble to you and looks as though you could bite  many a dog goes through the world well by merely showing his teeth  and then my companion began to talk of himself  he did not he said mean to remain in syria very long  nor i either said i  i have done with this part of the world for the present and shall take the next steamer from jaffa for alexandria  i shall only have one night in jerusalem on my return  after this he remained silent for a few moments and then declared that that also had been his intention  he was almost ashamed to say so however because it looked as though he had resolved to hook himself on to me  so he answered expressing almost regret at the circumstance  dont let that trouble you said i i shall be delighted to have your company  when you know me better as i hope you will do you will find that if such were not the case i should tell you so as frankly  i shall remain in cairo some little time so that beyond our arrival in egypt i can answer for nothing  he said that he expected letters at alexandria which would govern his future movements  i thought he seemed sad as he said so and imagined from his manner that he did not expect very happy tidings  indeed i had made up my mind that he was by no means free from care or sorrow  he had not the air of a man who could say of himself that he was totus teres atque rotundus  but i had no wish to inquire and the matter would have dropped had he not himself addedi fear that i shall meet acquaintances in egypt whom it will give me no pleasure to see  then said i if i were you i would go to constantinople insteadindeed anywhere rather than fall among friends who are not friendly  and the nearer the friend is the more one feels that sort of thing  to my way of thinking there is nothing on earth so pleasant as a pleasant wife but then what is there so damnable as one that is unpleasant  are you a married man he inquired  all his questions were put in a low tone of voice which seemed to give to them an air of special interest and made one almost feel that they were asked with some special view to ones individual welfare  now the fact is that i am a married man with a family but i am not much given to talk to strangers about my domestic concerns and therefore though i had no particular object in view i denied my obligations in this respect  no said i i have not come to that promotion yet  i am too frequently on the move to write myself down as paterfamilias  then you know nothing about that pleasantness of which you spoke just now  nor of the unpleasantness thank god my personal experiences are all to comeas also are yours i presume  it was possible that he had hampered himself with some woman and that she was to meet him at alexandria  poor fellow thought i but his unhappiness was not of that kind  no said he i am not married i am all alone in the world  then i certainly would not allow myself to be troubled by unpleasant acquaintances  it was now four hours since we had left jerusalem and we had arrived at the place at which it was proposed that we should breakfast  there was a large well there and shade afforded by a rock under which the water sprung and the arabs had constructed a tank out of which the horses could drink so that the place was ordinarily known as the first stage out of jerusalem  smith had said not a word about his saddle or complained in any way of discomfort so that i had in truth forgotten the subject  other matters had continually presented themselves and i had never even asked him how he had fared  i now jumped from my horse but i perceived at once that he was unable to do so  he smiled faintly as his eye caught mine but i knew that he wanted assistance  ah said i that confounded turkish saddle has already galled your skin  i see how it is i shall have to doctor you with a little brandyexternally applied my friend  but i lent him my shoulder and with that assistance he got down very gently and slowly  we ate our breakfast with a good will bread and cold fowl and brandyandwater with a hardboiled egg by way of a final delicacy and then i began to bargain with joseph for the loan of his english saddle  i saw that smith could not get through the journey with that monstrous turkish affair and that he would go on without complaining till he fainted or came to some other signal grief  but the frenchman seeing the plight in which we were was disposed to drive a very hard bargain  he wanted forty shillings the price of a pair of live bedouins for the accommodation and declared that even then he should make the sacrifice only out of consideration to me  very well said i  im tolerably tough myself and ill change with the gentleman  the chances are that i shall not be in a very liberal humour when i reach jaffa with stiff limbs and a sore skin i have a very good memory joseph  ill take thirty shillings mr jones though i shall have to groan all the way like a condemned devil  i struck a bargain with him at last for fiveandtwenty and set him to work to make the necessary change on the horses  it will be just the same thing to him i said to smith  i find that he is as much used to one as to the other  but how much money are you to pay him he asked  oh nothing i replied  give him a few piastres when you part with him at jaffa i do not know why i should have felt thus inclined to pay money out of my pocket for this smitha man whom i had only seen for the first time on the preceding evening and whose temperament was so essentially different from my own but so i did  i would have done almost anything in reason for his comfort and yet he was a melancholy fellow with good inward pluck as i believed but without that outward show of dash and hardihood which i confess i love to see  pray tell him that ill pay him for it said he  well make that all right i answered and then we remountednot without some difficulty on his part  you should have let me rub in that brandy i said  you cant conceive how efficaciously i would have done it  but he made me no answer  at noon we met a caravan of pilgrims coming up from jordan  there might be some three or four hundred but the number seemed to be treble that from the loose and straggling line in which they journeyed  it was a very singular sight as they moved slowly along the narrow path through the sand coming out of a defile among the hills which was perhaps a quarter of a mile in front of us passing us as we stood still by the wayside and then winding again out of sight on the track over which we had come  some rode on camelsa whole family in many cases being perched on the same animal  i observed a very old man and a very old woman slung in panniers over a camels backnot such panniers as might be befitting such a purpose but square baskets so that the heads and heels of each of the old couple hung out of the rear and front  surely the journey will be their death i said to joseph  yes it will he replied quite coolly but what matter how soon they die now that they have bathed in jordan  very many rode on donkeys two generally on each donkey others who had command of money on horses but the greater number walked toiling painfully from jerusalem to jericho on the first day sleeping there in tents and going to bathe on the second day and then returning from jericho to jerusalem on the third  the pilgrimage is made throughout in accordance with fixed rules and there is a tariff for the tent accommodation at jericho so much per head per night including the use of hot water  standing there close by the wayside we could see not only the garments and faces of these strange people but we could watch their gestures and form some opinion of what was going on within their thoughts  they were much quietertamer as it werethan englishmen would be under such circumstances  those who were carried seemed to sit on their beasts in passive tranquillity neither enjoying nor suffering anything  their object had been to wash in jordanto do that once in their livesand they had washed in jordan  the benefit expected was not to be immediately spiritual  no earnest prayerfulness was considered necessary after the ceremony  to these members of the greek christian church it had been handed down from father to son that washing in jordan once during life was efficacious towards salvation  and therefore the journey had been made at terrible cost and terrible risk for these people had come from afar and were from their habits but little capable of long journeys  many die under the toil but this matters not if they do not die before they have reached jordan  some few there are undoubtedly more ecstatic in this great deed of their religion  one man i especially noticed on this day  he had bound himself to make the pilgrimage from jerusalem to the river with one foot bare  he was of a better class and was even nobly dressed as though it were a part of his vow to show to all men that he did this deed wealthy and great though he was  he was a fine man perhaps thirty years of age with a wellgrown beard descending on his breast and at his girdle he carried a brace of pistols  but never in my life had i seen bodily pain so plainly written in a mans face  the sweat was falling from his brow and his eyes were strained and bloodshot with agony  he had no stick his vow i presume debarring him from such assistance and he limped along putting to the ground the heel of the unprotected foot  i could see it and it was a mass of blood and sores and broken skin  an irish girl would walk from jerusalem to jericho without shoes and be not a penny the worse for it  this poor fellow clearly suffered so much that i was almost inclined to think that in the performance of his penance he had done something to aggravate his pain  those around him paid no attention to him and the dragoman seemed to think nothing of the affair whatever  those fools of greeks do not understand the christian religion he said being himself a latin or roman catholic  at the tail of the line we encountered two bedouins who were in charge of the caravan and joseph at once addressed them  the men were mounted one on a very sorrylooking jade but the other on a good stout arab barb  they had guns slung behind their backs coloured handkerchiefs on their heads and they wore the striped bernouse  the parley went on for about ten minutes during which the procession of pilgrims wound out of sight and it ended in our being accompanied by the two arabs who thus left their greater charge to take care of itself back to the city  i understood afterwards that they had endeavoured to persuade joseph that we might just as well go on alone merely satisfying the demand of the tariff  but he had pointed out that i was a particular man and that under such circumstances the final settlement might be doubtful  so they turned and accompanied us but as a matter of fact we should have been as well without them  the sun was beginning to fall in the heavens when we reached the actual margin of the dead sea  we had seen the glitter of its still waters for a long time previously shining under the sun as though it were not real  we have often heard and some of us have seen how effects of light and shade together will produce so vivid an appearance of water where there is no water as to deceive the most experienced  but the reverse was the case here  there was the lake and there it had been before our eyes for the last two hours and yet it looked then and now as though it were an image of a lake and not real water  i had long since made up my mind to bathe in it feeling well convinced that i could do so without harm to myself and i had been endeavouring to persuade smith to accompany me but he positively refused  he would bathe he said neither in the dead sea nor in the river jordan  he did not like bathing and preferred to do his washing in his own room  of course i had nothing further to say and begged that under these circumstances he would take charge of my purse and pistols while i was in the water  this he agreed to do but even in this he was strange and almost uncivil  i was to bathe from the farthest point of a little island into which there was a rough causeway from the land made of stones and broken pieces of wood and i exhorted him to go with me thither but he insisted on remaining with his horse on the mainland at some little distance from the island  he did not feel inclined to go down to the waters edge he said  i confess that at this moment i almost suspected that he was going to play me foul and i hesitated  he saw in an instant what was passing through my mind  you had better take your pistol and money with you they will be quite safe on your clothes  but to have kept the things now would have shown suspicion too plainly and as i could not bring myself to do that i gave them up  i have sometimes thought that i was a fool to do so  i went away by myself to the end of the island and then i did bathe  it is impossible to conceive anything more desolate than the appearance of the place  the land shelves very gradually away to the water and the whole margin to the breadth of some twenty or thirty feet is strewn with the debris of rushes bits of timber and old white withered reeds  whence these bits of timber have come it seems difficult to say  the appearance is as though the water had receded and left them there  i have heard it said that there is no vegetation near the dead sea but such is not the case for these rushes do grow on the bank  i found it difficult enough to get into the water for the ground shelves down very slowly and is rough with stones and large pieces of halfrotten wood moreover when i was in nearly up to my hips the water knocked me down indeed it did so when i had gone as far as my knees but i recovered myself and by perseverance did proceed somewhat farther  it must not be imagined that this knocking down was effected by the movement of the water  there is no such movement  everything is perfectly still and the fluid seems hardly to be displaced by the entrance of the body but the effect is that ones feet are tripped up and that one falls prostrate on to the surface  the water is so strong and buoyant that when above a few feet in depth has to be encountered the strength and weight of the bather are not sufficient to keep down his feet and legs  i then essayed to swim but i could not do this in the ordinary way as i was unable to keep enough of my body below the surface so that my head and face seemed to be propelled down upon it  i turned round and floated but the glare of the sun was so powerful that i could not remain long in that position  however i had bathed in the dead sea and was so far satisfied  anything more abominable to the palate than this water if it be water i never had inside my mouth  i expected it to be extremely salt and no doubt if it were analysed such would be the result but there is a flavour in it which kills the salt  no attempt can be made at describing this taste  it may be imagined that i did not drink heartily merely taking up a drop or two with my tongue from the palm of my hand but it seemed to me as though i had been drenched with it  even brandy would not relieve me from it  and then my whole body was in a mess and i felt as though i had been rubbed with pitch  looking at my limbs i saw no sign on them of the fluid  they seemed to dry from this as they usually do from any other water but still the feeling remained  however i was to ride from hence to a spot on the banks of jordan which i should reach in an hour and at which i would wash so i clothed myself and prepared for my departure  seated in my position in the island i was unable to see what was going on among the remainder of the party and therefore could not tell whether my pistols and money was safe  i dressed therefore rather hurriedly and on getting again to the shore found that mr john smith had not levanted  he was seated on his horse at some distance from joseph and the arabs and had no appearance of being in league with those no doubt worthy guides  i certainly had suspected a ruse and now was angry with myself that i had done so and yet in london one would not trust ones money to a stranger whom one had met twentyfour hours since in a coffeeroom  why then do it with a stranger whom one chanced to meet in a desert  thanks i said as he handed me my belongings  i wish i could have induced you to come in also  the dead sea is now at your elbow and therefore you think nothing of it but in ten or fifteen years time you would be glad to be able to tell your children that you had bathed in it  i shall never have any children to care for such tidings he replied  the river jordan for some miles above the point at which it joins the dead sea runs through very steep banksbanks which are almost precipitousand is as it were guarded by the thick trees and bushes which grow upon its sides  this is so much the case that one may ride as we did for a considerable distance along the margin and not be able even to approach the water  i had a fancy for bathing in some spot of my own selection instead of going to the open shore frequented by all the pilgrims but i was baffled in this  when i did force my way down to the river side i found that the water ran so rapidly and that the bushes and boughs of trees grew so far over and into the stream as to make it impossible for me to bathe  i could not have got in without my clothes and having got in i could not have got out again  i was therefore obliged to put up with the open muddy shore to which the bathers descend and at which we may presume that joshua passed when he came over as one of the twelve spies to spy out the land  and even here i could not go full into the stream as i would fain have done lest i should be carried down and so have assisted to whiten the shores of the dead sea with my bones  as to getting over to the moabitish side of the river that was plainly impossible and indeed it seemed to be the prevailing opinion that the passage of the river was not practicable without going up as far as samaria  and yet we know that there or thereabouts the israelites did cross it  i jumped from my horse the moment i got to the place and once more gave my purse and pistols to my friend  you are going to bathe again he said  certainly said i you dont suppose that i would come to jordan and not wash there even if i were not foul with the foulness of the dead sea  youll kill yourself in your present state of heat he said remonstrating just as ones mother or wife might do  but even had it been my mother or wife i could not have attended to such remonstrance then and before he had done looking at me with those big eyes of his my coat and waistcoat and cravat were on the ground and i was at work at my braces whereupon he turned from me slowly and strolled away into the wood  on this occasion i had no base fears about my money  and then i did bathevery uncomfortably  the shore was muddy with the feet of the pilgrims and the river so rapid that i hardly dared to get beyond the mud  i did manage to take a plunge in head foremost but i was forced to wade out through the dirt and slush so that i found it difficult to make my feet and legs clean enough for my shoes and stockings and then moreover the flies plagued me most unmercifully  i should have thought that the filthy flavour from the dead sea would have saved me from that nuisance but the mosquitoes thereabouts are probably used to it  finding this process of bathing to be so difficult i inquired as to the practice of the pilgrims  i found that with them bathing in jordan has come to be much the same as baptism has with us  it does not mean immersion  no doubt they do take off their shoes and stockings but they do not strip and go bodily into the water  as soon as i was dressed i found that smith was again at my side with purse and pistols  we then went up a little above the wood and sat down together on the long sandy grass  it was now quite evening so that the short syrian twilight had commenced and the sun was no longer hot in the heavens  it would be night as we rode on to the tents at jericho but there was no difficulty as to the way and therefore we did not hurry the horses who were feeding on the grass  we sat down together on a spot from which we could see the streamclose together so that when i stretched myself out in my weariness as i did before we started my head rested on his legs  ah me one does not take such liberties with new friends in england  it was a place which led one on to some special thoughts the mountains of moab were before us very plain in their outline  moab is my washpot and over edom will i cast out my shoe  there they were before us very visible to the eye and we began naturally to ask questions of each other  why was moab the washpot and edom thus cursed with indignity  why had the right bank of the river been selected for such great purposes whereas the left was thus condemned  was there at that time any special fertility in this land of promise which has since departed from it  we are told of a bunch of grapes which took two men to carry it but now there is not a vine in the whole country side  nowadays the sandy plain round jericho is as dry and arid as are any of the valleys of moab  the jordan was running beneath our feetthe jordan in which the leprous king had washed though the bright rivers of his own damascus were so much nearer to his hand  it was but a humble stream to which he was sent but the spot probably was higher up above the sea of galilee where the river is narrow  but another also had come down to this river perhaps to this very spot on its shores and submitted himself to its watersas to whom perhaps it will be better that i should not speak much in this light story  the dead sea was on our right still glittering in the distance and behind us lay the plains of jericho and the wretched collection of huts which still bears the name of the ancient city  beyond that but still seemingly within easy distance of us were the mountains of the wilderness  the wilderness  in truth the spot was one which did lead to many thoughts  we talked of these things as to many of which i found that my friend was much more free in his doubts and questionings than myself and then our words came back to ourselves the natural centre of all mensthoughts and words  from what you say i said i gather that you have had enough of this land  quite enough he said  why seek such spots as these if they only dispel the associations and veneration of ones childhood  but with me such associations and veneration are riveted the stronger by seeing the places and putting my hand upon the spots i do not speak of that fictitious marble slab up there but here among the sandhills by this river and at the mount of olives over which we passed i do believe  he paused a moment and then replied  to me it is all nothing absolutely nothing  but then do we not know that our thoughts are formed and our beliefs modelled not on the outward signs or intrinsic evidences of thingsas would be the case were we always rationalbut by the inner workings of the mind itself  at the present turn of my life i can believe in nothing that is gracious  ah you mean that you are unhappy  you have come to grief in some of your doings or belongings and therefore find that all things are bitter to the taste  i have had my palate out of order too but the proper appreciation of flavours has come back to me  bahhow noisome was that dead sea water  the dead sea waters are noisome he said and i have been drinking of them by long draughts  long draughts i answered thinking to console him  draughts have not been long which can have been swallowed in your years your disease may be acute but it cannot yet have become chronic  a man always thinks at the moment of each misfortune that that special misery will last his lifetime but god is too good for that  i do not know what ails you but this day twelvemonth will see you again as sound as a roach  we then sat silent for a while during which i was puffing at a cigar  smith among his accomplishments did not reckon that of smokingwhich was a grief to me for a man enjoys the tobacco doubly when another is enjoying it with him  no you do not know what ails me he said at last and therefore cannot judge  perhaps not my dear fellow  but my experience tells me that early wounds are generally capable of cure and therefore i surmise that yours may be so  the heart at your time of life is not worn out and has strength and soundness left wherewith to throw off its maladies  i hope it may be so with you  god knows   i do not mean to say that there are none more to be pitied than i am but at the present moment i am notnot light hearted  i wish i could ease your burden my dear fellow  it is most preposterous in me thus to force myself upon you and then trouble you with my cares  but i had been alone so long and i was so weary of it  by jove and so had i  make no apology  and let me tell you thisthough perhaps you will not credit methat i would sooner laugh with a comrade than cry with him is true enough but if occasion demands i can do the latter also  he then put out his hand to me and i pressed it in token of my friendship  my own hand was hot and rough with the heat and sand but his was soft and cool almost as a womans  i thoroughly hate an effeminate man but in spite of a certain womanly softness about this fellow i could not hate him  yes i continued though somewhat unused to the melting mood i also sometimes give forth my medicinal gums  i dont want to ask you any questions and as a rule i hate to be told secrets but if i can be of any service to you in any matter i will do my best  i dont say this with reference to the present moment but think of it before we part  i looked round at him and saw that he was in tears  i know that you will think that i am a weak fool he said pressing his handkerchief to his eyes  by no means  there are moments in a mans life when it becomes him to weep like a woman but the older he grows the more seldom those moments come to him  as far as i can see of men they never cry at that which disgraces them  it is left for women to do that he answered  oh women  a woman cries for everything and for nothing  it is the sharpest arrow she has in her quiverthe best card in her hand  when a woman cries what can you do but give her all she asks for  do youdislike women  no by jove  i am never really happy unless one is near me or more than one  a man as a rule has an amount of energy within him which he cannot turn to profit on himself alone  it is good for him to have a woman by him that he may work for her and thus have exercise for his limbs and faculties  i am very fond of women  but i always like those best who are most helpless  we were silent again for a while and it was during this time that i found myself lying with my head in his lap  i had slept but it could have been but for a few minutes and when i woke i found his hand upon my brow  as i started up he said that the flies had been annoying me and that he had not chosen to waken me as i seemed weary  it has been that double bathing i said apologetically for i always feel ashamed when i am detected sleeping in the day in hot weather the water does make one drowsy  by jove its getting dark we had better have the horses  stay half a moment he said speaking very softly and laying his hand upon my arm i will not detain you a minute  there is no hurry in life i said  you promised me just now you would assist me  if it be in my power i will  before we part at alexandria i will endeavour to tell you the story of my troubles and then if you can aid me  it struck me as he paused that i had made a rash promise but nevertheless i must stand by it nowwith one or two provisoes  the chances were that the young man was short of money or else that he had got into a scrape about a girl  in either ease i might give him some slight assistance but then it behoved me to make him understand that i would not consent to become a participator in mischief  i was too old to get my head willingly into a scrape and this i must endeavour to make him understand  i will if it be in my power i said  i will ask no questions now but if your trouble be about some lady  it is not said he  well so be it  of all troubles those are the most troublesome if you are short of cash  no i am not short of cash  you are not  thats well too for want of money is a sore trouble also  and then i paused before i came to the point  i do not suspect anything bad of you smith  had i done so i should not have spoken as i have done  and if there be nothing bad  there is nothing disgraceful he said  that is just what i mean and in that case i will do anything for you that may be within my power  now let us look for joseph and the mucherryboy for it is time that we were at jericho  i cannot describe at length the whole of our journey from thence to our tents at jericho nor back to jerusalem nor even from jerusalem to jaffa  at jericho we did sleep in tents paying so much per night according to the tariff  we wandered out at night and drank coffee with a family of arabs in the desert sitting in a ring round their coffeekettle  and we saw a turkish soldier punished with the bastinadoa sight which did not do me any good and which made smith very sick  indeed after the first blow he walked away jericho is a remarkable spot in that pilgrim week and i wish i had space to describe it  but i have not for i must hurry on back to jerusalem and thence to jaffa  i had much to tell also of those bedouins how they were essentially true to us but teased us almost to frenzy by their continual begging  they begged for our food and our drink for our cigars and our gunpowder for the clothes off our backs and the handkerchiefs out of our pockets  as to gunpowder i had none to give them for my charges were all made up in cartridges and i learned that the guns behind their backs were a mere pretence for they had not a grain of powder among them  we slept one night in jerusalem and started early on the following morning  smith came to my hotel so that we might be ready together for the move  we still carried with us joseph and the mucherryboy but for our bedouins who had duly received their forty shillings a piece we had no further use  on our road down to jerusalem we had much chat together but only one adventure  those pilgrims of whom i have spoken journey to jerusalem in the greatest number by the route which we were now taking from it and they come in long droves reaching jaffa in crowds by the french and austrian steamers from smyrna damascus and constantinople  as their number confers security in that somewhat insecure country many travellers from the west of europe make arrangements to travel with them  on our way down we met the last of these caravans for the year and we were passing it for more than two hours  on this occasion i rode first and smith was immediately behind me but of a sudden i observed him to wheel his horse round and to clamber downwards among bushes and stones towards a river that ran below us  hallo smith i cried you will destroy your horse and yourself too  but he would not answer me and all i could do was to draw up in the path and wait my confusion was made the worse as at that moment a long string of pilgrims was passing by  good morning sir said an old man to me in good english  i looked up as i answered him and saw a grey haired gentleman of very solemn and sad aspect  he might be seventy years of age and i could see that he was attended by three or four servants  i shall never forget the severe and sorrowful expression of his eyes over which his heavy eyebrows hung low are there many english in jerusalem he asked  a good many i replied there always are at easter  can you tell me anything of any of them he asked  not a word said i for i knew no one but our consul can  and then we bowed to each other and he passed on  i got off my horse and scrambled down on foot after smith  i found him gathering berries and bushes as though his very soul were mad with botany but as i had seen nothing of this in him before i asked what strange freak had taken him  you were talking to that old man he said  well yes i was  that is the relation of whom i have spoken to you  the d he is  and i would avoid him if it be possible  i then learned that the old gentleman was his uncle  he had no living father or mother and he now supposed that his relative was going to jerusalem in quest of him  if so said i you will undoubtedly give him leg bail unless the austrian boat is more than ordinarily late  it is as much as we shall do to catch it and you may be half over africa or far gone on your way to india before he can be on your track again  i will tell you all about it at alexandria he replied and then he scrambled up again with his horse and we went on  that night we slept at the armenian convent at ramlath or ramath  this place is supposed to stand on the site of arimathea and is marked as such in many of the maps  the monks at this time of the year are very busy as the pilgrims all stay here for one night on their routes backwards and forwards and the place on such occasions is terribly crowded  on the night of our visit it was nearly empty as a caravan had left it that morning and thus we were indulged with separate cells a point on which my companion seemed to lay considerable stress  on the following day at about noon we entered jaffa and put up at an inn there which is kept by a pole  the boat from beyrout which touches at jaffa on its way to alexandria was not yet in nor even sighted we were therefore amply in time  shall we sail tonight i asked of the agent  yes in all probability he replied  if the signal be seen before three we shall do so  if not then not and so i returned to the hotel  smith had involuntarily shown signs of fatigue during the journey but yet he had borne up well against it  i had never felt called on to grant any extra indulgence as to time because the work was too much for him  but now he was a good deal knocked up and i was a little frightened fearing that i had overdriven him under the heat of the sun  i was alarmed lest he should have fever and proposed to send for the jaffa doctor  but this he utterly refused  he would shut himself for an hour or two in his room he said and by that time he trusted the boat would be in sight  it was clear to me that he was very anxious on the subject fearing that his uncle would be back upon his heels before he had started  i ordered a serious breakfast for myself for with me on such occasions my appetite demands more immediate attention than my limbs  i also acknowledge that i become fatigued and can lay myself at length during such idle days and sleep from hour to hour but the desire to do so never comes till i have well eaten and drunken  a bottle of french wine three or four cutlets of goats flesh an omelet made out of the freshest eggs and an enormous dish of oranges was the banquet set before me and though i might have found fault with it in paris or london i thought that it did well enough in jaffa  my poor friend could not join me but had a cup of coffee in his room  at any rate take a little brandy in it i said to him as i stood over his bed  i could not swallow it said he looking at me with almost beseeching eyes  beshrew the fellow i said to myself as i left him carefully closing the door so that the sound should not shake him he is little better than a woman and yet i have become as fond of him as though he were my brother  i went out at three but up to that time the boat had not been signalled  and we shall not get out tonight  no not to night said the agent  and what time tomorrow  if she comes in this evening you will start by daylight  but they so manage her departure from beyrout that she seldom is here in the evening it will be noon tomorrow then  yes the man said noon to morrow  i calculated however that the old gentleman could not possibly be on our track by that time  he would not have reached jerusalem till late in the day on which we saw him and it would take him some time to obtain tidings of his nephew  but it might be possible that messengers sent by him should reach jaffa by four or five on the day after his arrival  that would be this very day which we were now wasting at jaffa  having thus made my calculations i returned to smith to give him such consolation as it might be in my power to afford  he seemed to be dreadfully afflicted by all this  he will have traced me to jerusalem and then again away and will follow me immediately  that is all very well i said but let even a young man do the best he can and he will not get from jerusalem to jaffa in less than twelve hours  your uncle is not a young man and could not possibly do the journey under two days  but he will send  he will not mind what money he spends  and if he does send take off your hat to his messengers and bid them carry your complaints back  you are not a felon whom he can arrest  no he cannot arrest me but ah you do not understand and then he sat up on the bed and seemed as though he were going to wring his hands in despair  i waited for some half hour in his room thinking that he would tell me this story of his  if he required that i should give him my aid in the presence either of his uncle or of his uncles myrmidons i must at any rate know what was likely to be the dispute between them  but as he said nothing i suggested that he should stroll out with me among the orangegroves by which the town is surrounded  in answer to this he looked up piteously into my face as though begging me to be merciful to him  you are strong said he and cannot understand what it is to feel fatigue as i do  and yet he had declared on commencing his journey that he would not be found to complain  nor had he complained by a single word till after that encounter with his uncle  nay he had borne up well till this news had reached us of the boat being late  i felt convinced that if the boat were at this moment lying in the harbour all that appearance of excessive weakness would soon vanish  what it was that he feared i could not guess but it was manifest to me that some great terror almost overwhelmed him  my idea is said i and i suppose that i spoke with something less of goodnature in my tone than i had assumed for the last day or two that no man should under any circumstances be so afraid of another man as to tremble at his presenceeither at his presence or his expected presence  ah now you are angry with me now you despise me  neither the one nor the other  but if i may take the liberty of a friend with you i should advise you to combat this feeling of horror  if you do not it will unman you  after all what can your uncle do to you  he cannot rob you of your heart and soul  he cannot touch your inner self  you do not know he said  ah but smith i do know that  whatever may be this quarrel between you and him you should not tremble at the thought of him unless indeed  unless what  unless you had done aught that should make you tremble before every honest man  i own i had begun to have my doubts of him and to fear that he had absolutely disgraced himself  even in such case ii individuallydid not wish to be severe on him but i should be annoyed to find that i had opened my heart to a swindler or a practised knave  i will tell you all tomorrow said he but i have been guilty of nothing of that sort  in the evening he did come out and sat with me as i smoked my cigar  the boat he was told would almost undoubtedly come in by daybreak on the following morning and be off at nine whereas it was very improbable that any arrival from jerusalem would be so early as that  beside i reminded him your uncle will hardly hurry down to jaffa because he will have no reason to think but what you have already started  there are no telegraphs here you know  in the evening he was still very sad though the paroxysm of his terror seemed to have passed away  i would not bother him as he had himself chosen the following morning for the telling of his story  so i sat and smoked and talked to him about our past journey and by degrees the power of speech came back to him and i again felt that i loved him  yes loved him  i have not taken many such fancies into my head at so short a notice but i did love him as though he were a younger brother  i felt a delight in serving him and though i was almost old enough to be his father i ministered to him as though he had been an old man or a woman  on the following morning we were stirring at daybreak and found that the vessel was in sight  she would be in the roads off the town in two hours time they said and would start at eleven or twelve  and then we walked round by the gate of the town and sauntered a quarter of a mile or so along the way that leads towards jerusalem  i could see that his eye was anxiously turned down the road but he said nothing  we saw no cloud of dust and then we returned to breakfast  the steamer has come to anchor said our dirty polish host to us in execrable english  and we may be off on board said smith not yet he said they must put their cargo out first  i saw however that smith was uneasy and i made up my mind to go off to the vessel at once  when they should see an english portmanteau making an offer to come up the gangway the austrian sailors would not stop it  so i called for the bill and ordered that the things should be taken down to the wretched broken heap of rotten timber which they called a quay  smith had not told me his story but no doubt he would as soon as he was on board  i was in the act of squabbling with the pole over the last demand for piastres when we heard a noise in the gateway of the inn and i saw smiths countenance become pale  it was an englishmans voice asking if there were any strangers there so i went into the courtyard closing the door behind me and turning the key upon the landlord and smith  smith said i to myself will keep the pole quiet if he have any wit left  the man who had asked the question had the air of an upper english servant and i thought that i recognised one of those whom i had seen with the old gentleman on the road but the matter was soon put at rest by the appearance of that gentleman himself  he walked up into the courtyard looked hard at me from under those bushy eyebrows just raised his hat and thensaid i believe i am speaking to mr jones  yes said i i am mr jones  can i have the honour of serving you  there was something peculiarly unpleasant about this mans face  at the present moment i examined it closely and could understand the great aversion which his nephew felt towards him  he looked like a gentleman and like a man of talent nor was there anything of meanness in his face neither was he illlooking in the usual acceptation of the word but one could see that he was solemn austere and overbearing that he would be incapable of any light enjoyment and unforgiving towards all offences  i took him to be a man who being old himself could never remember that he had been young and who therefore hated the levities of youth  to me such a character is specially odious for i would fain if it be possible be young even to my grave  smith if he were clever might escape from the window of the room which opened out upon a terrace and still get down to the steamer  i would keep the old man in play for some time and even though i lost my passage would be true to my friend  there lay our joint luggage at my feet in the yard  if smith would venture away without his portion of it all might yet be right  my name sir is sir william weston he began  i had heard of the name before and knew him to be a man of wealth and family and note  i took off my hat and said that i had much honour in meeting sir william weston  and i presume you know the object with which i am now here he continued  not exactly said i  nor do i understand how i possibly should know it seeing that up to this moment i did not even know your name and have heard nothing concerning either your movements or your affairs  sir said he i have hitherto believed that i might at any rate expect from you the truth  sir said i i am bold to think that you will not dare to tell me either now or at any other time that you have received or expect to receive from me anything that is not true  he then stood still looking at me for a moment or two and i beg to assert that i looked as fully at him  there was at any rate no cause why i should tremble before him  i was not his nephew nor was i responsible for his nephews doings towards him  two of his servants were behind him and on my side there stood a boy and girl belonging to the inn  they however could not understand a word of english  i saw that he was hesitating but at last he spoke out  i confess now that his words when they were spoken did at the first moment make me tremble  i have to charge you said he with eloping with my niece and i demand of you to inform me where she is  you are perfectly aware that i am her guardian by law  i did tremblenot that i cared much for sir williams guardianship but i saw before me so terrible an embarrassment  and then i felt so thoroughly abashed in that i had allowed myself to be so deceived  it all came back upon me in a moment and covered me with a shame that even made me blush  i had travelled through the desert with a woman for days and had not discovered her though she had given me a thousand signs  all those signs i remembered now and i blushed pain fully  when her hand was on my forehead i still thought that she was a man  i declare that at this moment i felt a stronger disinclination to face my late companion than i did to encounter her angry uncle  your niece i said speaking with a sheepish bewilderment which should have convinced him at once of my innocence  she had asked me too whether i was a married man and i had denied it  how was i to escape from such a mess of misfortunes  i declare that i began to forget her troubles in my own  yes my niecemiss julia weston  the disgrace which you have brought upon me must be wiped out but my first duty is to save that unfortunate young woman from further misery  if it be as you say i exclaimed by the honour of a gentleman  i care nothing for the honour of a gentleman till i see it proved be good enough to inform me sir whether miss weston is in this house  for a moment i hesitated but i saw at once that i should make myself responsible for certain mischief of which i was at any rate hitherto in truth innocent if i allowed myself to become a party to concealing a young lady  up to this period i could at any rate defend myself whether my defence were believed or not believed  i still had a hope that the charming julia might have escaped through the window and a feeling that if she had done so i was not responsible  when i turned the lock i turned it on smith  for a moment i hesitated and then walked slowly across the yard and opened the door  sir william i said as i did so i travelled here with a companion dressed as a man and i believed him to be what he seemed till this minute  sir said sir william with a look of scorn in his face which gave me the lie in my teeth as plainly as any words could do  and then he entered the room  the pole was standing in one corner apparently amazed at what was going on and smithi may as well call her miss weston at once for the baronets statement was true was sitting on a sort of divan in the corner of the chamber hiding her face in her hands  she had made no attempt at an escape and a full explanation was therefore indispensable  for myself i own that i felt ashamed of my part in the playashamed even of my own innocency  had i been less innocent i should certainly have contrived to appear much less guilty  had it occurred to me on the banks of the jordan that smith was a lady i should not have travelled with her in her gentlemans habiliments from jerusalem to jaffa  had she consented to remain under my protection she must have done so without a masquerade  the uncle stood still and looked at his niece  he probably understood how thoroughly stern and disagreeable was his own face and considered that he could punish the crime of his relative in no severer way than by looking at her  in this i think he was right but at last there was a necessity for speaking  unfortunate young woman he said and then paused  we had better get rid of the landlord i said before we come to any explanation  and i motioned to the man to leave the room this he did very unwillingly but at last he was gone  i fear that it is needless to care on her account who may hear the story of her shame said sir william  i looked at miss weston but she still sat hiding her face  however if she did not defend herself it was necessary that i should defend both her and me  i do not know how far i may be at liberty to speak with reference to the private matters of yourself or of youryour niece sir william weston  i would not willingly interfere  sir said he your interference has already taken place  will you have the goodness to explain to me what are your intentions with regard to that lady  my intentions  heaven help me  my intentions of course were to leave her in her uncles hands  indeed i could hardly be said to have formed any intention since i had learned that i had been honoured by a ladys presence  at this moment i deeply regretted that i had thoughtlessly stated to her that i was an unmarried man in doing so i had had no object  but at that time smith had been quite a stranger to me and i had not thought it necessary to declare my own private concerns  since that i had talked so little of myself that the fact of my family at home had not been mentioned will you have the goodness to explain what are your intentions with regard to that lady said the baronet  oh uncle william exclaimed miss weston now at length raising her head from her hands  hold your peace madam said he  when called upon to speak you will find your words with difficulty enough  sir i am waiting for an answer from you  but uncle he is nothing to methe gentleman is nothing to me  by the heavens above us he shall be something or i will know the reason why  what he has gone off with you he has travelled through the country with you hiding you from your only natural friend he has been your companion for weeks  six days sir said i  sir said the baronet again giving me the lie  and now he continued addressing his niece you tell me that he is nothing to you  he shall give me his promise that he will make you his wife at the consulate at alexandria or i will destroy him  i know who he is  if you know who i am said i you must know  but he would not listen to me  and as for you madam unless he makes me that promise  and then he paused in his threat and turning round looked me in the face  i saw that she also was looking at me though not openly as he did and some flattering devil that was at work round my heart would have persuaded that she also would have heard a certain answer given without dismaywould even have received comfort in her agony from such an answer  but the reader knows how completely that answer was out of my power  i have not the slightest ground for supposing said i that the lady would accede to such an arrangementif it were possible  my acquaintance with her has been altogether confined to  to tell the truth i have not been in miss westons confidence and have only taken her for that which she has seemed to be  sir said the baronet again looking at me as though he would wither me on the spot for my falsehood  it is true said julia getting up from her seat and appealing with clasped hands to her uncleas true as heaven  madam said he do you both take me for a fool  that you should take me for one said i would be very natural the facts are as we state to you  miss westonas i now learn that she isdid me the honour of calling at my hotel having heard and then it seemed to me as though i were attempting to screen myself by telling the story against her so i was again silent never in my life had i been in a position of such extraordinary difficulty  the duty which i owed to julia as a woman and to sir william as a guardian and to myself as the father of a family all clashed with each other  i was anxious to be generous honest and prudent but it was impossible so i made up my mind to say nothing further  mr jones said the baronet i have explained to you the only arrangement which under the present circumstances i can permit to pass without open exposure and condign punishment  that you are a gentleman by birth education and position i am awarewhereupon i raised my hat and then he continued  that lady has three hundred a year of her own  and attractions personal and mental which are worth ten times the money said i and i bowed to my fair friend who looked at me the while with sad beseeching eyes  i confess that the mistress of my bosom had she known my thoughts at that one moment might have had cause for anger  very well continued he  then the proposal which i name cannot i imagine but be satisfactory  if you will make to her and to me the only amends which it is in your power as a gentleman to afford i will forgive all  tell me that you will make her your wife on your arrival in egypt  i would have given anything not to have looked at miss weston at this moment but i could not help it  i did turn my face half round to her before i answered and then felt that i had been cruel in doing so  sir william said i i have at home already a wife and family of my own  it is not true said he retreating a step and staring at me with amazement  there is something sir i replied in the unprecedented circumstances of this meeting and in your position with regard to that lady which joined to your advanced age will enable me to regard that useless insult as unspoken  i am a married man  there is the signature of my wifes last letter and i handed him one which i had received as i was leaving jerusalem  but the coarse violent contradiction which sir william had given me was nothing compared with the reproach conveyed in miss westons countenance  she looked at me as though all her anger were now turned against me  and yet methought there was more of sorrow than of resentment in her countenance  but what cause was there for either  why should i be reproached even by her look  she did not remember at the moment that when i answered her chance question as to my domestic affairs i had answered it as to a man who was a stranger to me and not as to a beautiful woman with whom i was about to pass certain days in close and intimate society  to her at the moment it seemed as though i had cruelly deceived her  in truth the one person really deceived had been myself  and here i must explain on behalf of the lady that when she first joined me she had no other view than that of seeing the banks of the jordan in that guise which she had chosen to assume in order to escape from the solemnity and austerity of a disagreeable relative she had been very foolish and that was all  i take it that she had first left her uncle at constantinople but on this point i never got certain information  afterwards while we were travelling together the idea had come upon her that she might go on as far as alexandria with me  and then i know nothing further of the ladys intentions but i am certain that her wishes were good and pure her uncle had been intolerable to her and she had fled from him such had been her offence and no more  then sir said the baronet giving me back my letter you must be a doubledyed villain  and you sir said i   but here julia weston interrupted me  uncle you altogether wrong this gentleman she said  he has been kind to me beyond my power of words to express but till told by you he knew nothing of my secret  nor would he have known it she added looking down upon the ground  as to that latter assertion i was at liberty to believe as much as i pleased  the pole now came to the door informing us that any who wished to start by the packet must go on board and therefore as the unreasonable old gentleman perceived it was necessary that we should all make our arrangements  i cannot say that they were such as enable me to look back on them with satisfaction  he did seem now at last to believe that i had been an unconscious agent in his nieces stratagem but he hardly on that account became civil to me it was absolutely necessary he said that he and that unfortunate young woman as he would call her should depart at onceby this ship now going  to this proposition of course i made no opposition  and you mr jones he continued will at once perceive that you as a gentleman should allow us to proceed on our journey without the honour of your company  this was very dreadful but what could i say or indeed what could i do  my most earnest desire in the matter was to save miss weston from annoyance and under existing circumstances my presence on board could not but be a burden to her  and then if i wentif i did go in opposition to the wishes of the baronet could i trust my own prudence  it was better for all parties that i should remain  sir william said i after a minutes consideration if you will apologise to me for the gross insults you have offered me it shall be as you say  mr jones said sir william i do apologise for the words which i used to you while i was labouring under a very natural misconception of the circumstances  i do not know that i was much the better for the apology but at the moment i regarded it sufficient  their things were then hurried down to the strand and i accompanied them to the ruined quay  i took off my hat to sir william as he was first let down into the boat  he descended first so that he might receive his niecefor all jaffa now knew that it was a ladyand then i gave her my hand for the last time  god bless you miss weston i said pressing it closely  god bless you mr jones she replied  and from that day to this i have neither spoken to her nor seen her  i waited a fortnight at jaffa for the french boat eating cutlets of goats flesh and wandering among the orange groves  i certainly look back on that fortnight as the most miserable period of my life i had been deceived and had failed to discover the deceit even though the deceiver had perhaps wished that i should do so  for that blindness i have never forgiven myself
