94644384	the mahatma and the hare  a dream story   by h rider haggard       ultimately a good hare was found which took the field at         there the hounds pressed her and on the hunt arriving at the edge      of the cliff the hare could be seen crossing the beach and going      right out to sea a boat was procured and the master and some      others rowed out to her just as she drowned and bringing the      body in gave it to the hounds a hare swimming out to sea is a      sight not often witnessedlocal paper january 1911          a long check occurred in the latter part of this hunt the      hare having laid up in a hedgerow from which she was at last      evicted by a crack of the whip her next place of refuge was a      horsepond which she tried to swim but got stuck in the ice      midway and was sinking when the huntsman went in after her it      was a novel sight to see huntsman and hare being lifted over a      wall out of the pond the eager pack waiting for their prey behind      the walllocal paper february 1911    the author supposes that the first of the above extracts must have impressed him at any rate on the night after the reading of it just as he went to sleep or on the following morning just as he awoke he cannot tell which there came to him the title and the outlines of this fantasy including the command with which it ends with a particular clearness did he seem to see the picture of the great white road straight as the way of the spirit and broad as the breast of death and of the little hare travelling towards the awful gates  like the mahatma of this fable he expresses no opinion as to the merits of the controversy between the redfaced man and the hare that without search on his own part presented itself to his mind in so odd a fashion it is one on which anybody interested in such matters can form an individual judgment     the mahatma        mahatma greatsouled one of a class of persons with      preternatural powers imagined to exist in india and      thibetnew english dictionary  everyone has seen a hare either crouched or running in the fields or hanging dead in a poulterers shop or lastly pathetic even dreadfullooking and in this form almost indistinguishable from a skinned cat on the domestic table but not many people have met a mahatma at least to their knowledge not many people know even who or what a mahatma is the majority of those who chance to have heard the title are apt to confuse it with another that of mad hatter  this is even done of malice prepense especially for obvious reasons if a hare is in any way concerned in scorn not in ignorance by persons who are well acquainted with the real meaning of the word and even with its sanscrit origin the truth is that an incredulous western world puts no faith in mahatmas to it a mahatma is a kind of spiritual mrs harris giving an address in thibet at which no letters are delivered either it says there is no such person or he is a fraudulent scamp with no greater occult powerswell than a hare  i confess that this view of mahatmas is one that does not surprise me in the least i never met and i scarcely expect to meet an individual entitled to set mahatma after his name certainly i have no right to do so who only took that title on the spur of the moment when the hare asked me how i was called and now make use of it as a nomdeplume it is true there is jorsen by whose order for it amounts to that i publish this history for aught i know jorsen may be a mahatma but he does not in the least look the part  imagine a bluff person with a strong hard face piercing grey eyes and very prominent bushy eyebrows of about fifty or sixty years of age add a scotch accent and a meerschaum pipe which he smokes even when he is wearing a frock coat and a tall hat and you have jorsen i believe that he lives somewhere in the country is well off and practises gardening if so he has never asked me to his place and i only meet him when he comes to town as i understand to visit flowershows  then i always meet him because he orders me to do so not by letter or by word of mouth but in quite a different way suddenly i receive an impression in my mind that i am to go to a certain place at a certain hour and that there i shall find jorsen i do go sometimes to an hotel sometimes to a lodging sometimes to a railway station or to the corner of a particular street and there i do find jorsen smoking his big meerschaum pipe we shake hands and he explains why he has sent for me after which we talk of various things never mind what they are for that would be telling jorsens secrets as well as my own which i must not do  it may be asked how i came to know jorsen well in a strange way nearly thirty years ago a dreadful thing happened to me i was married and although still young a person of some mark in literature indeed even now one or two of the books which i wrote are read and remembered although it is supposed that their author has long left the world  the thing which happened was that my wife and our daughter were coming over from the channel islands where they had been on a visit she was a jersey woman and andwell the ship was lost thats all the shock broke my heart in such a way that it has never been mended again but unfortunately did not kill me  afterwards i took to drink and sank as drunkards do then the river began to draw me i had a lodging in a poor street at chelsea and i could hear the river calling me at night andi wished to die as the others had died at last i yielded for the drink had rotted out all my moral sense about one oclock of a wild winter morning i went to a bridge i knew where in those days policemen rarely came and listened to that call of the water  come it seemed to say this world is the real hell ending in the eternal naught the dreams of a life beyond and of reunion there are but a demons mocking breathed into the mortal heart lest by its universal suicide mankind should rob him of his torturepit there is no truth in all your father taught you he was a clergyman and rather eminent in his profession there is no hope for man there is nothing he can win except the deep happiness of sleep come and sleep  such were the arguments of that voice of the river the old familiar arguments of desolation and despair i leant over the parapet in another moment i should have been gone when i became aware that some one was standing near to me i did not see the person because it was too dark i did not hear him because of the raving of the wind but i knew that he was there so i waited until the moon shone out for a while between the edges of two ragged clouds the shapes of which i can see to this hour it showed me jorsen looking just as he does today for he never seems to changejorsen on whom to my knowledge i had not set eyes before  even a year ago he said in his strong rough voice you would not have allowed your mind to be convinced by such arguments as those which you have just heard in the voice of the river that is one of the worst sides of drink it decays the reason as it does the body you must have noticed it yourself  i replied that i had for i was surprised into acquiescence then i grew defiant and asked him what he knew of the arguments which were or were not influencing me to my surpriseno that is not the wordto my bewilderment he repeated them to me one by one just as they had arisen a few minutes before in my heart moreover he told me what i had been about to do and why i was about to do it  you know me and my story i muttered at last  no he answered at least not more than i know that of many men with whom i chance to be in touch that is i have not met you for nearly eleven hundred years a thousand and eightysix to be correct i was a blind priest then and you were the captain of irenes guard  at this news i burst out laughing and the laugh did me good  i did not know i was so old i said  do you call that old answered jorsen why the first time that we had anything to do with each other so far as i can learn that is was over eight thousand years ago in egypt before the beginning of recorded history  i thought that i was mad but you are madder i said  doubtless well i am so mad that i managed to be here in time to save you from suicide as once in the past you saved me for thus things come round but your rooms are near are they not let us go there and talk this place is cold and the river is always calling  that was how i came to know jorsen whom i believe to be one of the greatest men alive on this particular night that i have described he told me many things and since then he has taught me much me and a few others but whether he is what is called a mahatma i am sure i do not know he has never claimed such a rank in my hearing or indeed to be anything more than a man who has succeeded in winning a knowledge of his own powers out of the depths of the dark that lies behind us of course i mean out of his past in other incarnations long before he was jorsen moreover by degrees as i grew fit to bear the light he showed me something of my own and of how the two were intertwined  but all these things are secrets of which i have perhaps no right to speak at present it is enough to say that jorsen changed the current of my life on that night when he saved me from death  for instance from that day onwards to the present time i have never touched the drink which so nearly ruined me also the darkness has rolled away and with it every doubt and fear i know the truth and for that truth i live considered from certain aspects such knowledge i admit is not altogether desirable thus it has deprived me of my interest in earthly things ambition has left me altogether for years i have had no wish to succeed in the profession which i adopted in my youth or in any other indeed i doubt whether the elements of worldly success still remain in me whether they are not entirely burnt away by that fire of wisdom in which i have bathed how can we strive to win a crown we have no longer any desire to wear now i desire other crowns and at times i wear them if only for a little while my spirit grows and grows it is dragging at its strings  what am i to look at a small whitehaired man with a thin and rather plaintive face in which are set two large dark eyes that continually seem to soften and develop that is my picture and what am i in the world i will tell you on certain days of the week i employ myself in editing a trade journal that has to do with haberdashery on another day i act as auctioneer to a firm which imports and sells cheap italian statuary modern very modern copies of the antique florid marble vases and so forth some of you who read may have passed such marts in different parts of the city or even have dropped in and purchased a bust or a tazza for a surprisingly small sum perhaps i knocked it down to you only too pleased to find a bonâ fide bidder amongst my company  as for the rest of my timewell i employ it in doing what good i can among the poor and those who need comfort or who are bereaved especially among those who are bereaved for to such i am sometimes able to bring the breath of hope that blows from another shore  occasionally also i amuse myself in my own fashion thus sure knowledge has come to me about certain epochs in the past in which i lived in other shapes and i study those epochs hoping that one day i may find time to write of them and of the parts i played in them some of these parts are extremely interesting especially as i am of course able to contrast them with our modern modes of thought and action  they do not all come back to me with equal clearness the earlier lives being as one might expect the more difficult to recover and the comparatively recent ones the easiest also they seem to range over a vast stretch of time back indeed to the days of primeval prehistoric man in short i think the subconscious in some ways resembles the conscious and natural memory that which is very far off to it grows dim and blurred that which is comparatively close remains clear and sharp although of course this rule is not invariable moreover there is foresight as well as memory at least from time to time i seem to come in touch with future events and states of society in which i shall have my share  i believe some thinkers hold a theory that such conditions as those of past present and future do not in fact exist that everything already is standing like a completed column between earth and heaven that the sum is added up the equation worked out at times i am tempted to believe in the truth of this proposition but if it be true of course it remains difficult to obtain a clear view of other parts of the column than that in which we happen to find ourselves objectively conscious at any given period and needless to say impossible to see it from base to capital  however this may be no individual entity pervades all the column there are great sections of it with which that entity has nothing to do although it always seems to appear again above i suppose that those sections which are empty of an individual and his atmosphere represent the intervals between his lives which he spends in sleep or in states of existence with which this world is not concerned but of such gulfs of oblivion and states of being i know nothing  to take a single instance of what i do know once this spirit of mine that now by the workings of destiny for a little while occupies the body of a fourthrate auctioneer and of the editor of a trade journal dwelt in that of a pharaoh of egyptnever mind which pharoah yes although you may laugh and think me mad to say it for me the legions fought and thundered to me the peoples bowed and the secret sanctuaries were opened that i and i alone might commune with the gods i who in the flesh and after it myself was worshipped as a god  well of this forgotten royalty of whom little is known save what a few inscriptions have to tell there remains a portrait statue in the british museum sometimes i go to look at that statue and try to recall exactly under what circumstances i caused it to be shaped puzzling out the story bit by bit  not long ago i stood thus absorbed and did not notice that the hour of the closing of the great gallery had come still i stood and gazed and dreamt till the policeman on duty seeing and suspecting me came up and roughly ordered me to begone  the mans tone angered me i laid my hand on the foot of the statue for it had just come back to me that it was a ka image a sacred thing any egyptologist will know what i mean which for ages had sat in a chamber of my tomb then the ka that clings to it eternally awoke at my touch and knew me or so i suppose at least i felt myself change a new strength came into me my shape battered in this worlds storms put on something of its ancient dignity my eyes grew royal i looked at that man as pharaoh may have looked at one who had done him insult he saw the change and trembledyes trembled i believe he thought i was some imperial ghost that the shadows of evening had caused him to mistake for man at any rate he gasped out  i beg your pardon i was obeying orders i hope your majesty wont hurt me now i think of it i have been told that things come out of these old statues in the night  then turning he ran literally ran where to i am sure i do not know probably to seek the fellowship of some other policeman in due course i followed and lifting the bar at the end of the hall departed without further question asked afterwards i was very glad to think that i had done the man no injury at the moment i knew that i could hurt him if i would and what is more i had the desire to do so it came to me i suppose with that breath of the past when i was so great and absolute perhaps i or that part of me then incarnate was a tyrant in those days and this is why now i must be so humble fate is turning my pride to its hammer and beating it out of me  for thus in the long history of the soul it serves all our vices    the great white road  now as i have hinted under the teaching of jorsen who saved me from degradation and selfmurder yes and helped me with money until once again i could earn a livelihood i have acquired certain knowledge and wisdom of a sort that are not common that is jorsen taught me the elements of these things he set my feet upon the path which thenceforward having the sight i have been able to follow for myself how i followed it does not matter nor could i teach others if i would  i am no member of any mystic brotherhood and as i have explained no mahatma although i have called myself thus for present purposes because the name is a convenient cloak i repeat that i am ignorant if there are such people as mahatmas though if so i think jorsen must be one of them still he never told me this what he has told is that every individual spirit must work out its own destiny quite independently of others indeed being rather fond of fine phrases he has sometimes spoken to me of or rather insisted upon what he called the lonesome splendour of the human soul which it is our business to perfect through various lives till i can scarcely appreciate and am certainly unable to describe  to tell the truth the thought of this lonesome splendour to which it seems some of us may attain alarms me i have had enough of being lonesome and i do not ask for any particular splendour my only ambitions are to find those whom i have lost and in whatever life i live to be of use to others however as i gather that the exalted condition to which jorsen alludes is thousands of ages off for any of us and may after all mean something quite different to what it seems to mean the thought of it does not trouble me over much meanwhile what i seek is the vision of those i love  now i have this power occasionally when i am in deep sleep some part of me seems to leave my body and to be transported quite outside the world it travels as though i were already dead to the gates that all who live must pass and there takes its stand on the great white road watching those who have been called speed by continually those upon the earth know nothing of that road blinded by their pomps and vanities they cannot see they will not see it always growing towards the feet of every one of them but i see and know of course you who read will say that this is but a dream of mine and it may be still if so it is a very wonderful dream and except for the change of the passing people or rather of those who have been people always very much the same  there straight as the way of the spirit and broad as the breast of death is the great white road running i know not whence up to those gates that gleam like moonlight and are higher than the alps there beyond the gates the radiant presences move mysteriously thence at the appointed time the voice cries and they are opened with a sound like to that of deepest thunder or sometimes are burned away while from the glory that lies beyond flow the sweetfaced welcomers to greet those for whom they wait bearing the cups from which they give to drink i do not know what is in the cups whether it be a draught of lethe or some baptismal water of new birth or both but always the thirsting worldworn soul appears to change and then as it were to be lost in the presence that gave the cup at least they are lost to my sight i see them no more  why do i watch those gates in truth or in dream before my time oh you can guess that perchance i may behold those for whom my heart burns with a quenchless eating fire and once i beheldnot the mother but the child my child changed indeed mysterious wonderful gleaming like a star with eyes so deep that in their depths my humanity seemed to swoon  she came forward she knew me she smiled and laid her finger on her lips she shook her hair about her and in it vanished as in a cloud yet as she vanished a voice spoke in my heart her voice and the words it said were  wait our beloved wait  mark well our beloved not my beloved so there are others by whom i am beloved or at least one other and i know well who that one must be    after this dream perhaps i had better call it a dream i was ill for a long while for the joy and the glory of it overpowered me and brought me near to the death i had always sought but i recovered for my hour is not yet moreover for a long while as we reckon time some years indeed i obeyed the injunction and sought the great white road no more at length the longing grew too strong for me and i returned thither but never again did the vision come its word was spoken its mission was fulfilled yet from time to time i a mortal seem to stand upon the borders of that immortal road and watch the newly dead who travel it towards the glorious gates  once or twice there have been among them people whom i have known as these pass me i appear to have the power of looking into their hearts and there i read strange things sometimes they are beautiful things and sometimes ugly things thus i have learned that those i thought bad were really good in the main for who can claim to be quite good and on the other hand that those i believed to be as honest as the daywell had their faults  to take an example which i quote because it is so absurd the rooms i live in were owned by a prim old woman who for more than twenty years was my landlady she and i were great friends indeed she tended me like a mother and when i was so ill nursed me as perhaps few mothers would have done yet while i was watching on the road suddenly she came by and with horror i saw that during all those years she had been robbing me taking i am sorry to say many things in money trinkets and food often i had discussed with her where these articles could possibly have gone till finally suspicion settled upon the man who cleaned the windows yes and worst of all he was prosecuted and i gave evidence against him or rather strengthened her evidence on faith of which the magistrate sent him to prison for a month  oh mrs smithers i said to her how could you do it mrs smithers  she stopped and looked about her terrified so that my heart smote me and i added in haste dont be frightened mrs smithers i forgive you  i cant see you sir she exclaimed or so i dreamed but there i always knew you would  yes mrs smithers i replied but how about the windowcleaner who went to jail and lost his situation  then she passed on or was drawn away without making any answer  now comes the odd part of the story when i woke up on the following morning in my rooms it was to be informed by the frightened maidofallwork that mrs smithers had been found dead in her bed moreover a few days later i learned from a lawyer that she had made a will leaving me everything she possessed including the lease of her house and nearly £1000 for she had been a saving old person during all her long life  well i sought out that windowcleaner and compensated him handsomely saying that i had found i was mistaken in the evidence i gave against him the rest of the property i kept and i hope that it was not wrong of me to do so it will be remembered that some of it was already my own temporarily diverted into another channel and for the rest i have so many to help to be frank i do not spend much upon myself    the hare  now i have done with myself or rather with my own insignificant present history and come to that of the hare it impressed me a good deal at the time which is not long ago so much indeed that i communicated the facts to jorsen he ordered me to publish them and what jorsen orders must be done i dont know why this should be but it is so he has authority of a sort that i am unable to define  one night after the usual aspirations and concentration of mind which by the way are not always successful i passed into what occultists call spirit and others a state of dream at any rate i found myself upon the borders of the great white road as near to the mighty gates as i am ever allowed to come how far that may be away i cannot tell perhaps it is but a few yards and perhaps it is the width of this great world for in that place which my spirit visits time and distance do not exist there all things are new and strange not to be reckoned by our measures there the sight is not our sight nor the hearing our hearing i repeat that all things are different but that difference i cannot describe and if i could it would prove past comprehension  there i sat by the borders of the great white road my eyes fixed upon the gates above which the towers mount for miles on miles outlined against an encircling gloom with the radiance of the world beyond the worlds foursquare they stand those towers and fourfold the gates that open to the denizens of other earths but of these i have no knowledge beyond the fact that it is so in my visions  i sat upon the borders of the road my eyes fixed in hope upon the gates though well i knew that the hope would never be fulfilled and watched the dead go by  they were many that night some plague was working in the east and unchaining thousands the folk that it loosed were strange to me who in this particular life have seldom left england and i studied them with curiosity highfeatured darkhued people with a patient air the knowledge which i have told me that one and all they were very ancient souls who often and often had walked this road before and therefore although as yet they did not know it were well accustomed to the journey no i am wrong for here and there an individual did know indeed one deepeyed wistful little woman who carried a baby in her arms stopped for a moment and spoke to me  the others cannot see you as i do she said priest of the queen of queens i know you well hand in hand we climbed by the seven stairways to the altars of the moon  who is the queen of queens i asked  have you forgotten her of the hundred names whose veils we lifted one by one her whose breast was beauty and whose eyes were truth in a day to come you will remember farewell till we walk this road no more  staywhen did we meet  when our souls were young she answered and faded from my ken like a shadow from the sea  after the easterns came many others from all parts of the earth then suddenly appeared a company of about six hundred folk of every age and english in their looks they were not so calm as are the majority of those who make this journey when i read the papers a few days later i understood why a great passenger ship had sunk suddenly in mid ocean and they were all cut off unprepared  when followed by a few stragglers these had passed and gathered themselves in the red shadow beneath the gateway towers waiting for the summons an unusual thing occurred for a few moments the road was left quite empty after that last great stroke death seemed to be resting on his laurels when thus unpeopled it looked a very vast place like to a huge arched causeway bordered on either side by blackness but itself gleaming with a curious phosphorescence such as once or twice i have seen in the waters of a summer sea at night  presently in the very centre of this illuminated desolation whilst it was as yet far away something caught my eye something so strange to the place so utterly unfamiliar that i watched it earnestly wondering what it might be nearer and nearer it came with curious uncertain hops yes a little brown object that hopped  well i said to myself if i were not where i am i should say that yonder thing was a hare only what would a hare be doing on the great white road how could a hare tread the pathway of eternal souls i must be mistaken  so i reflected whilst still the thing hopped on until i became certain that either i suffered from delusions or that it was a hare indeed a particularly fine hare much such a one as a friend of my old landlady mrs smithers had once sent her as a christmas present from norfolk which hare i ate  a few more hops brought it opposite to my post of observation here it halted as though it seemed to see me at any rate it sat up in the alert fashion that hares have its forepaws hanging absurdly in front of it with one ear on which there was a grey blotch cocked and one dragging and sniffed with its funny little nostrils then it began to talk to me i do not mean that it really talked but the thoughts which were in its mind were flashed on to my mind so that i understood perfectly yes and could answer them in the same fashion it said or thought thus  you are real you are a man who yet lives beneath the sun though how you came here i do not know i hate men all hares do for men are cruel to them still it is a comfort in this strange place to see something one has seen before and to be able to talk even to a man which i could never do until the change came the dreadful changei mean because of the way of it and it seemed to shiver may i ask you some questions  certainly i said or rather thought back  you are sure that they wont make you angry so that you hurt me  i cant hurt you even if i wished to do so you are not a hare any longer if you ever were one but only the shadow of a hare  ah i thought as much and thats a good thing anyhow tell me man have you ever been torn to pieces by dogs  good gracious no  or coursed or hunted or caught in a trap or shot all over your back or twisted up in nets and choked in snares or have you swum out to sea to die more easily or seen your mate and mother and father killed  no no please stop hare your questions are very unpleasant  not half so unpleasant as the things are themselves i can assure you man i will tell you my story if you like then you can judge for yourself but first if you will do you tell me why i am here have you seen more hares about this place  never nor any other animals no i am wrong once i saw a dog  the hare looked about it anxiously  a dog how horrible what was it doing hunting if there are no hares here what could it be hunting a rabbit or a pheasant with a broken wing or perhaps a fox i should not mind so much if it were a fox i hate foxes they catch young hares when they are asleep and eat them  none of these things i was told that it belonged to a little girl who died that broke its heart so that it died also when they shut her up in a box therefore it was allowed to accompany her here because it had loved so much indeed i saw them together both very happy and together they went through those gates  if dogs love little girls why dont they love hares at least as anything likes to be loved for the dog didnt want to eat the little girl did it i see you cant answer me now would you like me to tell you my story something inside of me is saying that i am to do so if you will listen also that there is plenty of time for i am not wanted at present and when i am i can run to those gates much quicker than you could  i should like it very much hare once a prophet heard an ass speak in order to warn him but since then except very very rarely in dreams no creature has talked to a man so far as i know perhaps you wish to warn me about something or others through me as the ass warned balaam  who is balaam i never heard of balaam he wasnt the man who fetches dead pheasants in the donkeycart was he if so ive seen him make the ass talkwith a thick stick no well never mind i daresay i should not understand about him if you told me now for my story  then the hare sat itself down planting its forepaws firmly in front of it as these animals do when they are on the watch looked up at me and began to pour the contents of its mind into mine    i was born it said or rather told me by thought transference in a field of growing corn near to a big wood at least i suppose i was born there though the first thing i remember is playing about in the wheat with two other little ones of my own size a brother and a sister that were born with me it was at night for a great round shining thing which i now know was the moon hung in the sky above us we gambolled together and were very happy till presently my mother camei remember how big she lookedand cuffed me with her paw because i had led the others away from the place where she had told us to stop and given her a great hunt to find us that is the first thing i remember about my mother afterwards she seemed sorry because she had hurt me and nursed us all three letting me have the most milk my mother always loved me the best of us because i was such a fine leveret with a pretty grey patch on my left ear just as i had finished drinking another hare came who was my father he was very large with a glossy coat and big shining eyes that always seemed to see everything even when it was behind him  he was frightened about something and hustled my mother and us little ones out of the wheatfield into the big wood by which it is bordered as we left the field i saw two tall creatures that afterwards i came to know were men they were placing wirenetting round the fieldyou see i understand now what all these things were although of course i did not at the time the two ends of the wire netting had nearly come together there was only a little gap left through which we could run another young hare or it may have been a rabbit had got entangled in it and one of the men was beating it to death with a stick i remember that the sound of its screams made me feel cold down the back for i had never heard anything like that before and this was the first that i had seen of pain and death  the other man saw us slipping through and ran at us with his stick my mother went first and escaped him then came my sister then i then my brother my father was last of all the man hit with his stick and it came down thud along side of me just touching my fur he hit again and broke the foreleg of my brother still we all managed to get through into the wood except my father who was behind  theres the old buck cried one of the men i understand what he said now though at the time it meant nothing to me knock him on the head  so leaving us alone they ran at him but my father was much too quick for them he rushed back into the corn and afterwards joined us in the wood for he had seen wire before and knew how to escape it still he was terribly frightened and made us keep in the wood till the following evening not even allowing my mother to go to her form in the rough pasture on its other side and lie up there  also we were in trouble because my brothers forepaw was broken it gave him a great deal of pain so that he could not rest or sleep after a while however it mended up in a fashion but he was never able to run as fast as we could nor did he grow so big in the end the mother fox killed him as i shall tell  my mother asked my father what the men with the sticks were doingfor you know many animals can talk to each other in their own way even if they are of different kinds he told her that they were protecting the wheat to prevent us from eating it to which she answered angrily that hares must live somehow especially when they had young ones to nurse my father replied that men did not seem to think so and perhaps they had young ones also i see now that my father was a philosophic hare but are you tired of my story  not at all i answered go on please it is very interesting to hear things described from the animals point of view especially when that animal has grown wise and learned to understand  ah answered the hare i see what you mean and it is odd but i do understand all has become clear to me i dont know what happened when i died but there came a change and i knew that i who was but a beast always have been and still am a necessary part of everything as much as you are though more helpless and humble yes i am as ancient and as farreaching as yourself but how i began and how i shall end is dark to me well i will go on with my story  it must have been a moon or so later after my mother had given up nursing me that i went to lie out by myself there was a big house on the hillside overlooking the sea and near to it were gardens surrounded by a wall also outside of this wall was another patch of garden where cabbages grew i found a way to those cabbages and kept it secret for i was greedy and wanted them all for myself i used to creep in at night and eat them also some flowers with spiky leaves that grew round them which had a very fine flavour then after the dawn came i went to a form which i had made under a furze bush on the slope that ran down to the sea and slept there  one day i was awakened by something white hard and round which rolled gently and stopped still quite close to me it was not alive although it had a queer smell and i wondered why it moved at all presently i heard voices and there appeared a little man and with him somebody who was not a man because it was differently dressed and spoke in a higher voice i saw that they had sticks in their hands and thought of running away then that it would be safer to lie quite close they came up to me and the little man said  theres the ball pick it up ella the lie is too bad  she for now i know it was what is called a girl stooped to obey and saw my back  tom she said in a whisper heres a young hare on its form  get out of the light he answered and ill kill it and he lifted the stick he held which had a twisted iron end  no she said catch it alive i want a hare to be a friend to my rabbit which has lost all its little ones  lost them eaten them you mean because you would always go and stare at it said tom wheres the leveret oh i see now look out  a moment later and i was in darkness tom had thrown himself upon the top of me and was grabbing at me with his hands i nearly got away but as my head poked up under his arm the girl caught hold of it  oh its scratching she cried as indeed i was with all my might hold it tom hold it  hold it yourself said tom my face is full of furze prickles so she held and presently he helped her till in the end i was tied up in a pockethandkerchief and carried i knew not whither indeed i was almost mad with fear  when i came to myself i found that i was within a kind of wire run which smelt foully as though hundreds of things had lived in it for years there was a hutch at the end of the run in which sat an enormous sherabbit quite as big as my mother a fiercelooking brute with long yellow teeth i was afraid of that rabbit and got as far from it as i could presently it hopped out and looked at me  what are you doing here it asked cant you talk well it doesnt matter if i get hungry ill eat you do you hear that ill eat you as i did all the others and it showed its big yellow teeth and hopped back into the hutch  after that tom and the girl came and gave us plenty of food which the big rabbit ate for i could touch nothing for two days they came and then i think they forgot all about us i grew very hungry and at night filled myself with some of the remaining food such as stale cabbage leaves by next morning all was gone and the big rabbit grew hungry also all that day it hopped about sniffing at me and showing its yellow teeth  i shall eat you tonight it said  i ran round and round the pen in terror till at last i found a place where rats had been working under the wire almost big enough for me to squeeze through but not quite  the sun went down and the big sherabbit came out  now i am going to eat you it said as i ate all the others i am hungry very hungry and it prodded me about with its nose and rolled me over  at last with a little squeal it drove its big yellow teeth into me behind oh how they hurt i was near the rathole i rushed at it scrabbling and wriggling the big rabbit pounced on me with its forefeet trying to hold me but too late for i was through leaving some of my fur behind me i ran how i ran without stopping till at length i found my mother in the rough pasture by the wood and told her everything  ah she said thats what comes of greediness and of trying to be too clever now perhaps you will learn to stop at home  so i did for a long while    the summer went by without anything particular happening except that my brother with the lame foot was eaten by the mother fox that great red beast was always prowling about and at night surprised us in a field near the wood where we were feeding on some beautiful turnips the rest of us got away but my brother being lame was not quick enough the fox caught him and i heard her sharp white teeth crunch into his bones the sound made me quite sick and my mother was very sad afterwards she complained to my father of the cruelty of foxes but he who as i have said was a philosopher answered her almost in her own words  foxes must live and this one has young to feed and therefore is always hungry there are three of them in a hole at the top of the wood he remarked also our son was lame and would certainly have been caught when the hunting begins  whats the hunting i asked  never mind said my father sharply no doubt youll find out in time that is if you live through the shooting  whats the shooting i began but my father cuffed me over the head and i was silent  i may tell you that my mother soon got over the loss of my brother for just about that time she had four new little ones after which neither she nor my father seemed to think any more about us my sister and i hated those little ones we two alone remembered my brother and sometimes wondered whether he was quite gone or would one day come back the fox i am glad to say got caught in a trap at least i am not glad nowi was glad because you see i was so much afraid of her    the shooting  i was quite close by one morning when the fox who was smelling about after me i suppose because it had liked my brother so much got caught in the big trap which was covered over artfully with earth and baited with some stuff which stank horribly i remember it looked very like my own hindlegs the fox not being able to find me went to this filth and tried to eat it  then suddenly there was a dreadful fuss the fox yelped and flew into the air i saw that a great black thing was fast on its forepaw how that fox did jump and roll it was quite wonderful to see her she looked like a great yellow ball except for a lot of white marks about the head which were her teeth but the trap would not come away because it was tied to a root with a chain  at last the fox grew tired and lying down began to think licking its paw as it thought and making a kind of moaning noise next it commenced gnawing at the root after trying the chain and finding that its teeth would not go into it while it was doing this i heard the sound of a man somewhere in the wood so did the fox and oh it looked so frightened it lay down panting its tongue hanging out and its ears pressed back against its head and whisked its big tail from side to side then it began to gnaw again but this time at its own leg it wanted to bite it off and so get away i thought this very brave of the fox and though i hated it because it had eaten my brother and tried to eat me i felt quite sorry  it was about half through its leg when the man came i remember that he had a cat with a little red collar on its neck and an owl in his hand both of them dead for he was giles the headkeeper going round his traps he was a tall man with sandy whiskers and a rough voice and he carried a singlebarrelled gun under his arm  you see now that i am dead i know the use of these things just as i understand all that was said though of course at the time it had no meaning for me still i find that i have forgotten nothing not one word from the beginning of my life to the end  the keeper who was on his way to the place where he nailed the creatures he did not like by dozens upon poles looked down and saw the fox oh my beauty he said so i have got you at last dont you think yourself clever trying to bite off that leg youd have done it too only i came along just in time well good night old girl you wont have no more of my pheasants  then he lifted the gun there was a most dreadful noise and the fox rolled over and lay still  there you are all neat and tidy my dear said the keeper now i must just tuck you away in the hollow tree before old grampus sneaks round and sees you for if he should it will be almost as much as my place is worth  next he set his foot on the trap and opening it took hold of the fox by the forelegs to carry it off the cat and the owl he stuffed away into a great pocket in his coat  jemima dont you wholly stink he said then gave a most awful yell  the fox wasnt quite dead after all it was only shamming dead at any rate it got giles hand in its mouth and made its teeth meet through the flesh  now the keeper began to jump about just as the fox had done when it set its paw in the trap shouting and saying all sorts of things that somehow i dont think i ought to repeat here round and round he went with the fox hanging to his hand like hares do when they dance together for he couldnt get it off anyhow at last he tumbled down into a pool of mud and water and when he got up again all wet through i saw that the fox was really dead but it had died biting and now i know that this pleased it very much  it was just then that the man whom the keeper had called grampus came up he was a big fat man with a very red face who made a kind of blowing noise when he walked fast i know now that he was the lord of all the other men about that place that he lived in the house which looked over the sea and that the boy and girl who put me in with the yellowtoothed rabbit were his children he was what the farmers called a firstrate allround sportsman which means my friendbut what is your name  oh mahatma i answered at hazard  which means my friend mahatma that he spent most of the year in killing the lower animals such as me yes he spent quite eight months out of the twelve in killing us one way and another for when there was no more killing to be done in his own country he would travel to others and kill there he would even kill pigeons from a trap or young rooks just out of their nests or rats in a stack or sparrows among ivy rather than not kill anything ive heard giles say so to the underkeeper and call him a regular slaughterer and a trueblood englishman  yet my friend mahatma i say in the light of the truth which has come to me that according to his knowledge grampus was a good man thus what little time he had to spare from sport he passed in helping his brother men by sending them to prison although of course he never worked or earned anything he was very rich because money flowed to him from other people who had been very rich but who at last were forced to travel this road and could not bring it with them if they could have brought it i am sure that grampus would never have got any however he did get it and he aided a great many people with that part of it which he found he could not spend upon himself he was a very good man only he liked killing us lower creatures whom he bred up with his money to be killed  go on with your story hare i said when i see this redfaced man i will judge of him for myself probably you are prejudiced about him  i daresay i am answered the hare rubbing its nose but please observe that i am not speaking unkindly of grampus although before i have done you may think that i might have reason to do so however you will be able to form your own opinion when he comes here which i am sure he does not mean to do for many many years the world is much too comfortable for him he does not wish to leave it  still he may be obliged to do so hare  oh no people like that are never obliged to do anything they do not like it is only poor things such as you and i mahatma which must suffer i can see that you have had a great deal to bear and so have i for we were born to suffering as the redfaced man was born to happiness  go on with your story hare i repeated you are becoming metaphysical and therefore dull the time is short and i want to hear what happened  quite so mahatma well grampus came up breathing very heavily and looking very red in the face he held his hat in one hand and a large crooked stick in the other and even the top of his head on which no hair grew was red for he had been running  what the deuce is the matter he puffed oh it is you giles is it what are you doing sir looking like that all covered with blood and mud has a poacher shot you or what  no squire answered giles humbly touching his hat i have shot a poacher thats all and it has given me what for and he lifted the body of the fox from the water  a fox said grampus a fox do you mean to say giles that you have dared to shoot a fox and a vixen with a litter too how often have i told you that although i keep harriers and not foxhounds you are never to touch a fox you will get me into trouble with all my neighbours i give you a months notice you will leave on this day month  very well squire said giles ill leave and i hope youll find some one to serve you better meanwhile i didnt shoot the dratted fox at least i only shot her after shed gone and got herself into a trap which i had set for that there rectory dog what you told me to make off with on the quiet so that the young lady might never know what become of it and cry and make a fuss as she did about the last then seeing that she was finished with her leg half chewed off i shot her or rather i didnt shoot her as well as i should for the beggar gave a twist as i fired and now shes bit me right through the hand i only hopes you wont have to pay my widow for it squire under the act as foxes bites is uncommon poisonous especially when theyve been aeating of rotten rabbit  dear me said the redfaced man softening dear me the beast does seem to have bitten you very badly you must go and be cauterised with a redhot iron it is painful but the best thing to do meanwhile suck it giles suck it i daresay that will draw out the poison and if it doesnt thank my stars i am insured look here a minute or two can make no difference for if you are poisoned you are poisoned where can we put this brute i wouldnt have it seen for ten pounds  theres an old pollard squire about five yards away down near the fence which is hollow and handy said giles  quite so he answered i know it well do you bring thedog giles remember it was a dog not a fox  then they went to the pollard and as giless hand was hurt the redfaced man climbed up it though giles tried to prevent him  now then giles he said give me the foxi mean the dog and i will drop it down great heavens how this tree stinks has there been an earth here  not as i knows of squire said giles sullenly  grampus stretched his hand down into the hollow of the pollard and dragged up a rotting fox by its tail  giles he said you have been killing more foxes and hiding them in this tree giles i dismiss you at once and without a months wages  all right sir said giles ill go and i prays youll find some one what will keep your hares which you must have and your pheasants which you must have and your partridges which you must have without killing these varmints of foxes what eats the lot  the redfaced man descended from the tree holding his nose and looked at giles giles sucked his bleeding hand and looked at him  foxes are very destructive animals said the redfaced man to giles especially when one shoots and keeps harriers  they are that sir said giles to the redfaced man as only those know what has to do with them  put the other in giles said the redfaced man and when you have time throw some soil on to the top of the lot this place smells horrible and look you here giles he added in a voice of thunder if ever i find you killing a fox upon this property you will be dismissed at once as i have often told you before do you understand  yes squire i understand answered giles and ill see to the burying of them this same afternoon if the pain in my hand will suffer it  very well said the redfaced man thats done withexcept the cubs as you have killed the vixen you had better stink the cubs out of the earth i daresay they are old enough to look after themselvesat any rate i hope so and now giles we must shoot some of these hares when we begin on the partridges next week there are too many of them the tenants are complaining ungrateful beggars as they are seeing that i keep them for their sport  at this point i thought that i had heard enough and slipped away when their backs were turned for friend mahatma i had just seen a fox shot and now i knew what shooting meant    about a week later i knew better still it came about thus by that time the turnips i have mentioned those that grew in the big field had swelled into fine large bulbs with leafy tops we used to eat them at nights and in the daytime to lie up among them in our snug forms you know mahatma dont you that a form is a little hollow which a hare makes in the ground just to fit itself no hare likes to sleep in another hares form do you understand  yes i answered i understand it would be like a man wearing another mans boots  i dont know anything about boots mahatma except that they are hard things with iron on them which kick one out of ones form if one sits too close once that happened to me well my form was under a particularly fine turnip that had some dead leaves beneath the green ones i chose it because like the brown earth they just matched the colour of my back i was sleeping there quite soundly when my sister came and woke me  there are men in the field she said her eyes nearly starting out of her head with fear for she was always very timid  im off  are you i answered well i think i shall stop here where i shant be noticed if we begin jumping over those turnips they will see us  we might run down the rows keeping our ears close to our backs she remarked  no i said there are too many bare patches  at this moment a gun went bang some way off and my sister like a wise hare scuttled away at full speed for the wood but i only made myself smaller than usual and lay watching and listening  there was a good deal to see and hear for instance a covey of partridges troublesome birds that come scratching and fidgeting about when one wants to sleep were running to and fro in a great state of concern  they are after us said the old cock  i remember the same thing last year come on do  how can i with all these young ones to look after answered the hen why if once they are scattered i shall never find them again  just as you like you know best said the cock goodbye and away he flew while his wife and the rest ran to a little distance scattered and squatted  presently looking back over my shoulders without turning my head as a hare can i saw a line of men walking towards me there was the redfaced man whom giles called grampus behind his back and squire to his face there was giles himself with his hurt hand tied up holding a kind of stick with a slit in it from which hung a lot of dead partridges whose necks were in the slit one of them was not dead or had come to life again for it flapped in the stick trying to fly away he held these in the hand that was tied up and in the other oh horror was a dead hare bleeding from its nose it looked uncommonly like my mother but whether it were or no i couldnt be quite sure at least from that day neither my sister nor i ever saw her again i suppose you havent met her coming up this big white road have you mahatma  no no i answered impatiently i have already told you that you are the first hare i have ever seen upon the road please get on with your story or the lights will change and the gates be opened before i hear its end  just when i saw her i was thinking of running away but the sight terrified me so much that i could not stir you see mahatma i really loved my mother as much as a hare can love anything which is a good deal  well beyond giles was who do you think that dreadful boy tom with a gun in his hand too did i say that they all had guns except giles and some beater men only that toms was singlebarrelled then there were others whom i need not describe stretching to left and right and worst of all perhaps there was giless great black dog a sillylooking beast which always seemed to have its mouth open and its tongue hanging out and to be wagging a big tail like the foxs only black and more ragged  as i watched up got the old hen partridge and one of her young ones and flew towards me the redfaced man lifted his gun and fired once twice and down came first the mother partridge and then the young one i forgot to say that tom fired too at the old partridge which fell dead quite close to me leaving a lot of feathers floating in the air as it fell tom screeched out  i killed that father  this made the redfaced man very angry  you young scoundrel he said how often have i told you not to shoot at my birds under my nose no sportsman shoots at another mans birds and as for killing it you were yards under the thing if you do it again i will send you home  sorry father said tom adding in a low voice with a snigger i did kill it after all dad thinks no one can hit a partridge except himself  just then up jumped my father near to giles and came leaping in front of the redfaced man about twenty yards away from him  mark hare shouted giles and grampus who was still glowering at tom and had not quite finished pushing the cartridges into his gun shut it up in a hurry and fired first one barrel and then the other but my father who was very cunning jumped into the air at the first shot and ducked at the second so that he was missed at least i suppose that is why he was missed  giles grinned and the redfaced man said damn what does damn mean mahatma it was a very favourite word with the redfaced man but even now i cant quite understand it  nor can i i answered go on  well my poor father next ran in front of tom who shot too and hit him in the hind legs so that he rolled over and over in the turnips kicking and screaming have you ever heard a hare scream mahatma  yes yes it makes a horrid noise like a baby  wiped your eye that time dad cried tom in an exultant voice  i dont know about wiping my eye answered his father turning quite purple with rage but i wish you would be good enough thomas not to shoot my hares behind so that they make that beastly row which upsets me i think that the redfaced man was really kind at the bottom and spoils them for the market if you cant hit a hare in front miss it like a gentleman  as you do dad said tom sniggering again all right ill try  giles roared grampus pretending not to hear send your dog and fetch that hare i cant bear its screeching  so that great black dog rushed forward and caught my poor father in its big mouth although he tried to drag himself away on his front paws and after that i shut my eyes  then a lot of partridges got up and there was any amount of banging though most of them were missed this made the redfaced man angrier than ever he took off his hat and waved it bellowing  call back that brute of a dog of yours giles call it back at once or ill shoot it  so giles called nigger come you ere nigger nigg nigg nigg  but nigger rushed about putting up partridges all over the place while grampus stamped and shouted and every one missed everything till at last tom sat down on the turnips and roared with laughter  at length after giles had beaten nigger till he broke a stick over him making him howl terribly order was restored and the line having reformed began to march down on me for mahatma i was so frightened by what had happened to my father and i think my mother that i didnt remember what he i mean my dead father had told me always to run away when there is a chance as poor hares can only protect themselves by flight  so as i had lost the chance i thought that i would just sit tight hoping that they would not see me nor indeed would they if it hadnt been for that horrible tom  during the confusion the mother partridge which the redfaced man had shot had been forgotten by everybody except tom tom you see was certain that he had shot it himself being a very obstinate boy and was determined to retrieve it as his own  now that partridge had fallen within a yard of me with its beak and claws pointing to the sky and when the line had passed where we lay tom lagged behind to look for it he did not find it then whether he ever found it afterwards i am sure i dont know but he found me  by jove heres a hare he said and made a grab at me just as he had done in the furze bush  well i went tom shot when i wasnt more than four yards from him and the whole charge passed like a bullet between my hind legs and struck the ground under my stomach sending up such a shower of earth and stones that i was knocked right over  ive hit it yelled tom as he crammed another cartridge into his singlebarrelled gun  by the time that it was loaded i was quite thirty yards away and going like the wind tom lifted the gun  dont shoot roared the redfaced man  mind that there boy bellowed giles  i was running down between two rows of turnips and presently butted into a lad who was bending over i suppose to pick up a partridge at any rate his taildo you call it his tail mahatma  that will do i answered  well his tail was towards me it looked very round and shiny the shot from toms gun hit it everywhere i wish they had all gone into it but as he was so far away the charge scattered and six of the bullets struck me oh they did hurt put your hand on my back mahatma and you will feel the six lumps they made beneath the grey tufts of hair that grew over them for they are still there  forgetting that we were on the road i stretched out my hand but of course it went quite through the hare although i could see the six little grey tufts clearly enough  you are foolish hare you dont remember that your body is not here but somewhere else  quite true mahatma if it were here i could not be talking to you could i as a matter of fact i have no body now it isoh never mind where still you can see the grey tufts cant you well i only hope that those shot hurt that fat boy half as much as they did me no i dont mean that i hope it now i used to hope it  my goodness didnt he screech much worse than my father when his legs were broken and didnt everybody else roar and shout and didnt i dance off i went right over the fat boy who had tumbled down up to the end of the field then so bewildered was i with shock and the burning pain back again quite close to them  but now nobody shot at me because they all thought the boy was killed and were gathered round him looking very solemn only i saw that the redfaced man had tom by the neck and was kicking him hard  after that i saw no more for i ran five miles before i stopped and at last lay down in a little swamp near the seashore to which my mother had once taken me my back was burning like fire and i tried to cool it in the soft slush    the coursing  quite a moon went by before i recovered from toms shot at first i thought that i was going to die for although luckily none of my bones were broken the pain in my back was dreadful when i tried to ease the agony by rubbing against roots it only became worse for the fur fell off leaving sores upon which flies settled i could scarcely eat or sleep and grew so thin that the bones nearly poked through my pelt indeed i wanted very much to die but could not on the contrary by degrees i recovered till at last i was quite strong again and like other hares except for the six little grey tufts upon my back and one hole through my right ear  now all this while i had lived in the swamp near the sea but when my strength returned i thought of my old home to which something seemed to draw me also there were no turnips near the swamp and as the winter came on i found very little to eat there so one day or rather one night i travelled back home  as it happened the first hare that i met near the big wood was my sister she was very glad to see me although she had forgotten how we came to part and when i spoke of our father and mother these did not seem to interest her still from that time forward we lived together more or less till her end came  one daythis was after we had made our home in the big wood as hares often do in winterthere was a great disturbance when we tried to go out to feed at daylight we found little fires burning everywhere and near to them boys who beat themselves and shouted so we went back into the wood where the pheasants were running to and fro in a great state of mind  some hours later when the sun was quite high men began to march about and scores of shots were fired a long way off also a wounded cockpheasant fell near to us and fluttered away making a queer noise in its throat it looked very funny stumbling along on one leg with its beak gaping and two of the long feathers in its tail broken  i know what this is i said to my sister lets be gone before they shoot us ive had enough of being shot  so off we went rushing past a boy by his fire who yelled and threw a stick at us but as it happened on the borders of the property of the redfaced man there were poachers who knew that hares would come out of the wood on this day of the shooting and had made ready for us by setting wire nooses in the gaps of the hedges through which we ran i got my foot into one of these but managed to shake it off my sister was not so lucky for her head went into another of them she kicked and tore but the more she struggled the tighter drew the noose  i watched her for a little while until one of the poachers ran up with a stick  then i went away as i could not bear to see her beaten to death and that was the end of my sister so now i was the only one left alive of our family except perhaps some younger brothers whom i did not know though i think it was one of these that afterwards i saw shot quite dead by giles he went over and over and lay as still as though he had never moved in all his life death seems a very wonderful thing mahatma but i wont ask you what it is because i perceive that you cant answer  after this nothing happened to me for a long while indeed i had the best time of my life and grew very strong and big yes the strongest and biggest hare of any that i ever saw also the swiftest of foot twice i was chased by dogs once by giless black beast nigger and once by that of a shepherd finding that i could run right away from them without exerting myself at all i grew to despise dogs ah little did i know then that there are many different breeds of these animals  one day in midwinter as the weather was very mild and open i was lying on the rough grass field that i have spoken of which borders a flat stretch of moorland on this moorland in summer grew tall ferns but now these had died and been broken down by the wind suddenly i woke up from my sleep to see a number of men walking and riding towards me  they were tenants and others who although the real coursing season had not yet begun in our neighbourhood had been asked by grampus to come to try their greyhounds upon his land those of them who walked for the most part held two long lean dogs on a string while one or two carried dead hares they were dreadfullooking hares that seemed to have been bitten all over at least their coats were wet and broken i shivered at the sight of them feeling sure that i was going to be put to some new kind of torture  besides the men on foot were those on horseback among whom i recognised the redfaced man and my enemy the dreadful tom most of the others were people called farmers who seemed very happy and excited and from time to time drank something out of little bottles which they passed to each other giles was not there now i know that this was because he hated coursing which killed down hares hares he thought out to be shot not coursed  whilst i watched wondering what to do there was a shout of there she goes and all the long dogs began to pull at their strings off the necks of two of them the collars seemed to fall and away they leapt pursuing a hare the men on the horses galloped after them but the men on foot remained where they were  now i was afraid to get up and run lest they should loose the other dogs on me so i lay still till presently i saw the hare coming back towards me followed by the two dogs whose noses almost touched its tail it was exhausted and tried to twist and spring away to the right but as it did so one of the dogs caught it in its mouth and bit it till it died  that was a rotten hare said tom who cantered up just then it gave no course at all  yes puffed grampus hope the next one will show better sport  hope so too answered tom especially as it is jack and jills turn to be slipped and they are the best greyhounds for twenty miles round  then the redfaced man gave some orders and jack and jill were brought forward by the man whose business it was to slip the dogs one of them was black and one yellow i think jack was the black onea dreadful sneakinglooking beast with a white tip to its tail which ended in a sort of curl  forward now said grampus and go slow theres sure to be another puss or two in this rough grass  next second i was up and away and before you could count twelve jack and jill were after me i saw them standing on their hind legs straining at the cord then the collars fell from them and they leapt forward like the light my thought was to get back to the wood which was about a minutes run behind me but i did not dare to turn and head for it because of the long line of people through which i must pass if i tried to do so so i ran straight for the moorland hoping to turn there and reach the wood on its other side although this meant a long journey  for a while all went well with me and having a good start i began to hope that i should outrun these beasts as i had the shepherds dog and the retriever but i did not know jack and jill just as i reached the borders of the moor i heard the patter of their feet behind me and looking back saw them coming up about as far away as i was from tom when he shot me  they were running quite close together and behind them galloped the judge and other men there was a fence here and i bolted through a hole in it the greyhounds jumped over and for a moment lost sight of me for i had turned and run down near the side of the fence but tom who had come through a gap saw me and waved his arm shouting and next instant jack and jill saw me too  then as the going was rough by the fence i took to the open moor always trying however to work round to the left in the hope that i might win the shelter of the wood  on we went like the wind and now jack and jill were quite close behind me though before they got there i had managed to circle so that at last my head pointed to the wood which was more than half a mile away their speed was greater than mine and i knew that i must soon be caught  at last they were not more than two yards behind and for the first time i twisted so that they overshot me which gave me another start three times they came up and three times i wrenched or twisted the wood was not so far away now but i was almost spent  what was i to do what was i to do i saw a clump of furze to the left a big clump and thick and remembered that there was a hares run through it i reached it just as jill was on the top of me and once more they lost sight of me for a while as they ran round the clump staring and jumping when they saw me again on the further side i was thirty yards ahead of them and the wood was perhaps two hundred and fifty yards away but now i could only run more slowly for my heart seemed to be bursting though luckily jack and jill were getting tired also still they soon came up and now i must twist every few yards or be caught in their jaws  i cant tell you what i felt mahatma and until you have been hunted by greyhounds you will never know it was horrible yet i managed to twist and jump so that always jack and jill just missed me the farmers on the horses laughed to see my desperate leaps and wrenches  but tom did worse than laugh noting that i was getting quite near the wood he rode between me and it trying to turn me into the open for he wished to see me killed  dont do that it isnt sportsmanlike shouted the redfaced man give the poor beast a chance  i dont know whether he obeyed or not as just then i made my last double and felt jills teeth cut through the fur of my scut and heard them snap i had dodged jill but jack was right on to me and the wood still twenty yards away  i could not twist any more it was just which of us could get there first i gathered all my remaining strength for i was mad mad with terror and bounded forward  after me came jack i felt his hot breath on my flank i jumped the ditch yes i found power to jump that ditch where there was a rabbit run just by the trunk of a young oak jack jumped after me we must both have been in the air at the same time but i got through the rabbit run whereas jack hit his sharp nose against the trunk of the tree and broke his neck yes he fell dead into the ditch  i crawled on a few yards to a thick clump and squatted down for i could not stir another inch so it came about that i heard them all talking on the other side  one of them said i was the finest hare he had ever coursed others who had dragged jack out of the ditch lamented his death especially the owner who vowed that he was worth £50 and abused tom tom he said had caused him to be killedi dont know how but i suppose because he had ridden forward and tried to turn me the redfaced man also scolded tom then he added  well i am glad she got off for shell give us a good run with the harriers one day i shall always know that hare again by the white marks on its back also it is the biggest i have seen for a long while come on my friends the dog is dead and theres an end of it at least we have had a good mornings sport so lets go to the hall and get some lunch    the hare paused for a little then looked up at me in its comical fashion and asked  did you ever course hares mahatma  not i thank goodness i answered  well what do you think of coursing  i would rather not say i replied  then i will said the hare with conviction i think it horrible  yes but hare you do not remember the pleasure this sport gives to the men and the dogs you look at it from an entirely selfish point of view  and so would you mahatma if you had felt jacks hot breath on your back and jills teeth in your tail    the hunting  the hare sat silent for a time while i employed myself in watching certain shadows stream past us on the great white road among them was that of a politician whom i had much admired upon the earth in this land of truth i was grieved to observe certain characteristics about him which i had never before suspected it seemed to me alas that in his mundane career he had not been so entirely influenced by a singlehearted desire for the welfare of our country as he had proclaimed and i had believed i gathered even that his own interests had sometimes inspired his policy  he went by leaving so far as i was concerned a somewhat painful impression from which i sought relief in the company of the opensouled hare  well i said i suppose that you died of exhaustion after your coursing experience and came on here  died of exhaustion mahatma not a bit of it in three days i was as well as ever only much more cunning than i had been before in the night i fed in the fields upon whatever i could get but in the daytime i always lay up in woods this i did because i found out the shooting was over and i knew that greyhounds which run by sight would never come into woods  the weeks went by and the days began to lengthen pretty yellow flowers that i had not seen before appeared in the woods and i ate plenty of them they have a nice flavour then i met another hare and loved her because she reminded me of my sister we used to play about together and were very happy i wonder what she will do now that i am gone  console herself with somebody else i suggested sarcastically  no she wont do that mahatma because the hounds chopped her just outside the round plantation i mean they caught and ate her you think that i am contradicting myself but i am not i mean i wonder what she will do without me in whatever world she has reached for i dont see her here well i went to the little round plantation because i found that giles seldom came there and i thought it would be safer but as it proved i made a great mistake one day there appeared the redfaced man and tom and the girl ella and a lot of other people mounted on horses some of them dressed in green coats with ridiculouslooking caps on their heads  also with them were i dont know how many spotted dogs whose tails curled over their backs not like greyhounds whose tails curl between their legs outside of the plantation those dogs caught and ate my future wife as i have said it was her own fault for i had warned her not to go there but she was a very selfwilled character as it was she never even gave them a run for they were all round her in a minute then they made a kind of cartwheel their heads were in the centre of this cartwheel and their tails pointed out in its exact middle was my future wife  when the wheel broke up there was nothing of her left except her scut which lay upon the ground  i had seen so many of such things that i was not so much shocked as you might suppose after all a fine hare like myself could always get another wife and as i have told you she was very selfwilled  so i lay still thinking that those men and dogs would go away  but what do you think mahatma just as they were going the boy tom called out  i say dad i think we might as well knock through the round plantation giles tells me that the old specklebacked buck lies up here  does he said grampus well if so thats the hare i want to see for i know hed give us a good run here jerry jerry was the huntsman just put the hounds into that place  so jerry put the hounds in making dreadful noises to encourage them and of course i came out as i did not wish to share the fate of my future wife  thats him screeched tom look at the grey marks on his back  yes thats he right enough shouted the redfaced man lay them on jerry lay them on were in for a rattling run now ill warrant  so they were laid on and i went away as hard as my legs would carry me very soon i found that i had left all those curlytailed dogs a long way behind  ah i said to myself proudly these beasts are not greyhounds they are like giless retriever and the sheep dog theyll never see me again so i looped along saving my breath and heading for a wood which was quite five miles off that i had once visited from the marsh on the seashore where i lay sick for i was sure they would never follow me there  you can imagine then mahatma how surprised i was when i drew near that wood to hear a hideous noise of dogs all barking together behind me and on looking back to see those spotted brutes with their tongues hanging out coming along quite close to each other and not more than a quarter of a mile away  moreover they were coming after me i was sure of that for the first of them kept setting its nose to the ground just where i had run and then lifting up its head to bay yes they were coming on my scent they could smell me as giless curly dog smells the wounded partridges my heart sank at the thought but presently i remembered that the wood was quite close and that there i should certainly give them the slip  so i went on quite cheerfully not even running as fast as i could but fortune was against me as everything has always been for i never found a friend i ran along the side of a hedgerow which went quite up to the wood not knowing that at the end of it three men were engaged in cutting down an oak tree you see mahatma they had caught sight of the hunt and stopped from their work so that i did not hear the sound of their axes upon the tree nor as my head was so near the ground did i see them until i was right on to them at which moment also they saw me  here she is yelled one of them keep her out of covert or theyll lose her and he threw out his arms and began to jump about as did the other two  i pulled up short within three or four yards of them behind were the dogs and the people galloping upon horses and in front were the three men what was i to do now i had stopped exactly in a gateway for a lane ran alongside the wood after a moments pause i bolted through the gateway thinking that i would get into the wood beyond but one of the men who of course wanted to see me killed was too quick for me and there headed me again  then i lost my senses instead of running on past him and leaping into the wood i swung right round and rushed back still clinging to the hedgerow indeed as i went down one side of it the hounds and the hunters came up on the other so that there were only a few sticks between us though fortunately the wind was blowing from them to me fearing lest they should see me i jumped into the ditch and ran for quite two hundred yards through the mud and water that was gathered there then i had to come out of it again as it ended but here was a fall in the ground so still i was not seen  meanwhile the hunt had reached the three men and i heard them all talking together the end of it was that the men explained which way i had gone and once more the hounds were laid on to me in a minute they got to where i had entered the ditch and there grew confused because my footmarks did not smell in the water for quite a long time they looked about till at length taking a wide cast the hounds found my smell again at the end of the ditch  during this check i was making the best of my way back towards my own home indeed had it not been for it i should have been caught and torn to pieces much sooner than i was thus it happened that i had covered quite three miles before once more i heard those hounds baying behind me this was just as i got on to the moorland at that edge of it which is about another three miles from the great house called the hall which stands on the top of a cliff that slopes down to the beach and the sea  i had thought of making for the other wood that in which i had saved myself from the greyhounds when the beast jack broke its neck against the tree but it was too far off and the ground was so open that i did not dare to try  so i went straight on heading towards the cliff another mile and they viewed me for i heard tom yell with delight as he stood up in his stirrups on the black cob he was riding and waved his cap jerry the huntsman also stood up in his stirrups and waved his cap and the last awful hunt began  i ranoh how i ran once when they were nearly on me i managed to check them for a minute in a hollow by getting among some sheep but they soon found me again and came after me at full tear not more than a hundred yards behind in front of me i saw something that looked like walls and bounded towards them with my last strength my heart was bursting my eyes and mouth seemed to be full of blood but the terror of being torn to pieces still gave me power to rush on almost as quickly as though i had just been put off my form for as i have told you mahatma i am or rather was a very strong and swift hare  i reached the walls there was an open doorway in them through which i fled to find myself in a big garden two gardeners saw me and shouted loudly i flew on through some other doors through a yard and into a passage where i met a woman carrying a pail who shrieked and fell on to her back i jumped over her and got into a big room where was a long table covered with white on which were all sorts of things that i suppose men eat out of that room i went into yet another where a fat woman with a hooked nose was seated holding something white in front of her i bolted under the thing on which she was seated and lay there she saw me come and began to shriek also and presently a most terrible noise arose outside  all the spotted dogs were in the house baying and barking and everybody was yelling then for a minute the dogs stopped their clamour and i heard a great clatter of things breaking and of teeth crunching and of the redfaced man shouting  those cursed brutes are eating the hunt lunch get them out jerry you idiot get them out great heavens whats the matter with her ladyship is any one murdering her  i suppose that they couldnt get them out or at least when they did they all came into the other room where i was under the seat on which the fat woman was now standing  what is it mother i heard tom say  an animal she screamed an animal under the sofa  all right he said thats only the hare here hounds out with her hounds  the dogs rushed about some of them with great lumps of food still in their mouths but they were confused and all went into the wrong places everything began to fall with dreadful crashes the fat woman shrieked piercingly and her shriek was  china oh my chinaa john you wretch help help help  to which the redfaced man roared in answer  dont be an infernal fool elizaa i say dont be such an infernal fool  also there were lots of other noises that i cannot remember except one which a dog made  this silly dog had thrust its head up the hole over a fire such as the stops make outside the coverts when men are going to shoot either to hide something or to look for me there when it came down again because the redfaced man kicked it the dog put its paws into the fire and pulled it all out over the floor also it howled very beautifully just then another hound that one which generally led the pack began to sniff about near me and finally poked its nose under the stuff which hid me  it jumped back and bayed whereon i jumped out the other side tom made a rush at me and knocked the fat woman off the thing she was standing on so that she fell among the dogs which covered her up and began to sniff her all over flying from tom i found myself in front of something filmy beyond which i saw grass it looked suspicious but as nothing in the world could be so bad as tom no not even his dogs i jumped at it  there was a crash and a sharp point cut my nose but i was out upon the grass then there were twenty other crashes and all the hounds were out too for tom had cheered them on i ran to the edge of the lawn and saw a steep slope leading to the sands and the sea now i knew what the sea was for after tom had shot me in the back i lived by it for a long while and once swam across a little creek to get to my form from which it cut me off  while i ran down that slope fast as my aching legs would carry me i made up my mind that i would swim out into the sea and drown there since it is better to drown than to be torn to pieces but why are you laughing friend mahatma  i am not laughing i said in this state without a body i have nothing to laugh with still you are right for you see that i should be laughing if i could your story of the stout lady and the dogs and the china is very amusing  perhaps friend but it did not amuse me nothing is amusing when one is going to be eaten alive  of course it isnt i answered please forgive me and go on  well i tumbled down that cliff followed by some of the dogs and tom and the girl ella and the huntsman jerry on foot and dragged myself across the sands till i came to the lip of the sea  just here there was a boat and by it stood giles the keeper he had come there to get out of the way of the hunting which he hated as much as he did the coursing the sight of him settled meinto the sea i went the dogs wanted to follow me but jerry called and whipped them off  i wont have them caught in the current and drowned he said let the fleabitten old devil go shes brought trouble enough already  help me shove off the boat giles shouted tom she shant beat us we must have her for the hounds come on ella  best leave her alone master tom said giles i think shes an unlucky one that i do  still the end of it was that he helped to float the little boat and got into it with tom and ella  just after they had pushed off i saw a man running down the steps on the cliff waving his arms while he called out something but of him they took no heed i do not think they noticed him as for me i swam on  i could not go very fast because i was so dreadfully tired also i did not like swimming and the cold waves broke over my head making the cut in my nose smart and filling my eyes with something that stung them i could not see far either nor did i know where i was going i knew nothing except i was about to die and that soon everything would be at an end men dogseverything yes even tom i wanted things to come to an end i had suffered so dreadfully life was so horrible i was so very tired i felt that it was better to die and have done  so i swam on a long way and began to forget things indeed i thought that i was playing in the big turnip field with my mother and sister but just as i was sinking exhausted a hand shot down into the water and caught me by the ears although from below the fingers looked as though they were bending away from me i saw it coming and tried to sink more quickly but could not  ive got her said the voice of tom gleefully my isnt she a beauty over nine pounds if she is an ounce only just in time though he went on for look shes drowning her head wobbles as though she were seasick buck up pussie buck up you mustnt cheat the hounds at last you know it wouldnt be sportsmanlike and they hate dead hares  then he held me by my hind legs to drain the water out of me and afterwards began to blow down my nose i did not know why  dont do that tom said ella sharply its nasty  must keep the life in her somehow answered tom and went on blowing  master tom interrupted giles who was rowing the boat i aint particular but i wish youd leave that there hare alone somehow i thinks theres bad news in its eye who knows praps the little devil feels any way its a rum one its swimming out to sea i never seed a hunted hare do that afore  bosh said tom and continued his blowing  we reached the shore and tom jumped out of the boat holding me by the ears the hounds were all on the beach most of them lying down for they were very tired but the men were standing in a knot at a distance talking earnestly tom ran to the hounds crying out  here she is my beauties here she is whereon they got up and began to bay then he held me above them  master tom i heard jerrys voice say for gods sake let that hare go and listen master tom and the girl ella who of a sudden had begun to sob tried to pull him back  but he was mad to see me bitten to death and eaten and until he had done so would attend to no one he only shouted onetwothree now hounds worry worry worry  then he threw me into the air above the red throats and gnashing teeth which leapt up towards me    the hare paused but added did you tell me friend mahatma that you had never been torn to pieces by hounds broken up i believe they call it  yes i did i answered and what is more i shall be obliged if you will not dwell upon the subject    the coming of the redfaced man  as you like said the hare certainly it was very dreadful it seemed to last a long time but i dont mind it so much now for i feel that it can never happen to me again at least i hope it cant for i dont know what i have done to deserve such a fate any more than i know why it should have happened to me once  something you did in a previous existence perhaps i answered you see then you may have hunted other creatures so cruelly that at last your turn came to suffer what you had made them suffer i often think that because of what we have done before we men are also really being hunted by something we cannot see  ah exclaimed the hare i never thought of that i hope it is true for it makes things seem juster and less wicked but i say friend mahatma what am i doing here now where you tell me poor creatures with four feet never or hardly ever come  i dont know hare i am not wise to whom it is only granted to visit the road occasionally to search for some one  i understand mahatma but still you must know a great deal or you would not be allowed in such a place before your time or at any rate you must be able to guess a great deal so tell me why do you think that i am here  i cant say hare i cant indeed perhaps after the gates are open and your guardian has given you to drink of the cup you will go to sleep and wake up again as something else  to drink of the cup mahatma i dont drink at least i didnt though i cant tell what may happen here but what do you mean about waking up as something else please be more plain as what else  oh who can know possibly as you are on the human road you might even become a man some day though i should not advise you to build on such a hope as that  what do you say mahatma a man one of those twolegged beasts that hunt hares a thing like giles and tomyes tom oh not thatnot that id almost rather go through everything again than become a cruel torturing man  as it spoke thus the hare grew so disturbed that it nearly vanished literally it seemed to melt away till i could only perceive its outline with a kind of shock i comprehended all the horror that it must feel at such a prospect as i had suggested to it and really this grasping of the truth hurt my human pride it had never come home to me before that the circumstances of their livesand deathsmust cause some creatures to see us in strange lights  oh i have no doubt i was mistaken i said hurriedly and that your wishes on the point will be respected i told you that i know nothing  at these words the hare became quite visible again  it sat up and very reflectively began to rub its still shadowy nose with a shadowy paw i think that it remembered the sting of the salt water in the cut made by the glass of the window through which it had sprung  believing that its remarkable story was done and that presently it would altogether melt away and vanish out of my knowledge i looked about me first i looked above the towering gates to see whether the lights had yet begun to change then as they had not i looked down the great white road following it for miles and miles until even to my spirit sight it lost itself in the nowhere  presently coming up this road towards us i saw a man dressed in a green coat ridingbreeches and boots and a peaked cap who held in his hand a huntingwhip he was a finelooking person of middle age with a pleasant open countenance bright blue eyes and very red cheeks on which he wore lightcoloured whiskers in short a joviallooking individual with whom things had evidently always gone well one to whom sorrow and disappointment and mental struggle were utter strangers he at least had never known what it is to endure hardness in all his life  studying his nature as one can do on the road i perceived also that in him there was no guile he was a goodminded godfearing man according to his simple lights who had done many kindnesses and contributed liberally towards the wants of the poor though as he had been very rich it had cost him little thus to gratify the natural promptings of his heart  moreover he was what jorsen calls a young soul quite young indeed by which i mean that he had not often walked the road in previous states of life as for instance that eastern woman had done who accosted me before the arrival of the hare so to speak his crude nature had scarcely outgrown the primitive human condition in which necessity as well as taste make it customary and pleasant to men to kill that condition through which almost every boy passes on his way to manhood i suppose by the working of some secret law of reminiscence  it was this thought that first led me to connect the newcomer with the redfaced man of the hares story it may seem strange that i should have been so dense but the truth is that it never occurred to me any more than it had done to the hare that such a person would be at all likely to tread the road for many years to come i had gathered that he was comparatively young and although i had argued otherwise with the hare had concluded therefore that he would continue to live his happy earth life until old age brought him to a natural end hence my obtuseness  the man was drifting towards me thoughtfully evidently much bewildered by his new surroundings but not in the least afraid indeed there none are afraid when they glide from their deathbeds to the road they leave fear behind them with the other terrors of our mortal lot  presently he became conscious of the presence of the hare and thoughts passed through his mind which of course i could read  my word he said to himself things are better than i hoped theres a hare and where there are hares there must be hunting and shooting oh if only i had a gun or the ghost of a gun  then an idea struck him he lifted his huntingcrop and hurled it at the hare  as it was only the shadow of a crop of course it could hurt nothing still it went through the shadow of the hare and caused it to twist round like lightning  that was a good shot anyway he reflected with a satisfied smile  by now the hare had seen him  the redfaced man it exclaimed grampus himself and it turned to flee away  dont be frightened i cried he cant hurt you nothing can hurt you here  the hare halted and sat up no it said i forgot but you saw he tried to now mahatma you will understand what a bloodthirsty brute he is even after i am dead he has tried to kill me again  well and why not interrupted the man what are hares for except to be killed  there mahatma you hear him look at me man who am i  so he looked at the hare and the hare looked at him presently his face grew puzzled  by jingo he said slowly you are uncommonly likeyou are that accursed witch of a hare which cost me my life there are the white marks on your back and there is the grey splotch on your ear oh if only i had a guna real gun  you would shoot me wouldnt you or try to said the hare well you havent and you cant you say i cost you your life what do you mean it was my life that was sacrificed not yours  indeed answered the man i thought you got away never saw any more of you after you jumped through the french window never had time the last thing i remember is her ladyship screaming like a mad cockatoo yes and abusing me as though i were a pickpocket with the drawingroom all on fire then something happened and down i went among the broken china and hit my head against the leg of a table next came a kind of whirling blackness and i woke up here  a fit or a stroke i suggested  both i think sir the fit firsti have had em before and the stroke afterwardsagainst the leg of the table anyway they finished me between them thanks to that little beast  then it was that i saw a very strange thing a hare in a rage it seemed to go mad of course i mean spiritually mad its eyes flashed fire it opened its mouth and shut it after the fashion of a suffocating fish at last it spoke in its own wayi cannot stop to explain in further detail the exact manner of speech or rather of its equivalent upon the road  man man it exclaimed you say that i finished you but what did you do to me you shot me look at the marks upon my back you coursed me with your running dogs you hunted me with your hounds you dragged me out of the sea into which i swam to escape you by death and threw me living to the pack and the hare stopped exhausted by its own fury  well replied the man coolly and suppose i or my people did what of it why shouldnt i you were a beast i was a man with dominion over you you can read all about that in the book of genesis  i never heard of the book of genesis said the hare but what does dominion mean does this book of genesis say that it means the right to torment that which is weaker than the tormentor  all you animals were made for us to eat commented the man avoiding an answer to the direct question  very good answered the hare let us suppose that we were given you to eat was it in order to eat me that you came out against me with guns then with dogs that run by sight and then with dogs that run by smell  if you were to be killed and eaten why should you not be killed in one of these ways hare  why should i be killed in those ways man when others more merciful were to your hand indeed why should i be killed at all moreover if you wished to satisfy your hunger with my body why at the last was i thrown to the dogs to devour  i dont quite know hare never looked at the matter in that light before butah ive got you now he added triumphantly if it hadnt been for me you never would have lived you see i gave you the gift of life therefore instead of grumbling you should be very much obliged to me dont you understand i preserved hares so that without me you would never have been a hare isnt that right mr mri am sorry i have forgotten your name he added turning towards me  mahatma i said  oh yes i remember it nowmrahmr hatter  there is something in the argument i replied cautiously but let us hear our friends answer  answermy answer well here it is what are you man who dare to say that you give life or withhold it you a lord of life you i tell you that i know little yet i am sure that you or those like you have no more power to create life than the world we have left has to bid the stars to shine if the life must come it will come and if it cannot fulfil itself as a hare then it will appear as something else if you say that you create life i the poor beast which you tortured tell you that you are a presumptuous liar  you dare to lecture me said the man me the heir of all the ages as the poet called me why you nasty little animal do you know that i have killed hundreds like you and he added with a sudden afflatus of pride thousands of other creatures such as pheasants to say nothing of deer and larger game that has been my principal occupation since i was a boy i may say that i have lived for sport got very little else to show for my life so to speak  oh said the hare have you well if i were you i shouldnt boast about it just now you see we are still outside of those gates who knows but that you will find every one of the living things you have amused yourself by slaughtering waiting for you within them each praying for justice to its maker and your own  my word said the man what a horrible notion its like a bad dream  he reflected a little then added well if they do ive got my answer i killed them for food man must live millions of pheasants are sold to be eaten every year at a much smaller price than they cost to breed what do you say to that mr hatter finishes him i think  im not arguing i replied ask the hare  yes ask me man and although you are repeating yourself ill answer with another question knowing that here you must tell the truth did you really rear us all for food was it for this that you kept your keepers your running dogs and your hunting dogs that you might kill poor defenceless beasts and birds to fill mens stomachs if this was so i have nothing more to say indeed if our deaths or sufferings at their hands really help men in any way i have nothing more to say i admit that you are higher and stronger than we are and have a right to use us for your own advantage or even to destroy us altogether if we harm you  the man pondered then replied sullenly  you know very well that it was not so i did not rear up pheasants and hares merely to eat them or that others might eat them something forces me to tell you that it was in order that i might enjoy myself by showing my skill in shooting them or to have the pleasure and exercise of hunting them to death still he added defiantly i who am a christian man maintain that my religion perfectly justified me in doing all these things and that no blame attaches to me on this account  very good said the hare now we have a clear issue friend mahatma when those gates open presently what happens beyond them  i dont know i answered i have never been there at least not that i can remember  still friend mahatma is it not said that yonder lives some power which judges righteously and declares what is true and what is false  i have heard so hare  very well man i lay my cause before that powerdo you the same if i am wrong i will go back to earth to be tortured by you and yours again if however i am right you shall abide the judgment of the power and i ask that it will make of youa hunted hare  now when he heard these awful wordsfor they were awfulno less the redfaced man grew much disturbed he hummed and he hawed and shifted his feet about at last he said  you must admit that while you lived you had a firstclass time under my protection lots of turnips to eat and so forth  a firstclass time the hare answered with withering scorn what sort of a time would you have had if some one had shot you all over the back and you must creep away to die of pain and starvation how would you have enjoyed it if from day to day you had been forced to live in terror of cunning monsters who at any hour might appear to hurt you in some new fashion do you suppose that animals cannot feel fear and is continual fear the kind of friend that gives them a firstclass time  to this last argument the man seemed able to find no answer  mr hare he said humbly we are all fallible although i never thought to find myself in the position of having to do so i will admit that i may possibly have been mistaken in my views and treatment of you and your kind and indeed of other creatures if so i apologise for any ahtemporary inconvenience i may have caused you i can do no more  come hare i interposed thats handsome perhaps you might let bygones be bygones  apologise exclaimed the hare after all i have suffered i do not think it is enough at the very least mahatma he should say that he is heartily ashamed and sorry  well well said the man its no use making two bites of a cherry i am sorry truly sorry for all the pain and terror i have brought on you if that wont do lets go up and settle the matter and if ive been wrong ill try to bear the consequences like a gentleman only mr hare i hope that you will not wish to put your case more strongly against me than you need  not i man i know now that you only erred because the truth had not been revealed to youbecause you did not understand all that i will ask if i can is that you may be allowed to tell this truth to other men  well i am glad to say i cant do that hare  dont be so sure i broke in its just the kind of thing which might be decreeda generation or two hence when the world is fit to listen to you  but he took no heed or did not comprehend me and went on  it is an impossibility and if i did they would think me a lunatic or a snivelling sentimental humbug i believe that lots of my old friends would scarcely speak to me again why putting aside the pleasures of sport if the views you preach were to be accepted what would become of keepers and beaters and huntsmen and dogbreeders and of thousands of others who directly or indirectly get their living out of hunting and shooting where would game rents be also  i dont know i am sure replied the hare wearily i suppose that they would earn their living in some other way as they must in countries where there is no sport and that you would have to make up for shooting rents by growing more upon the land you know that after all we hares and the other game eat a great deal which might be saved if there were not so many of us but i am not wise and i have never looked at the question from that point of view it may seem selfish but i have to consider myself and the creatures whose cause i plead for something inside me is telling me nowyes nowthat all of them are speaking through my mouth it says that is why i am allowed to be here and to talk with you both for their sakes rather than for my own  if you have more to say you had better say it quickly i interrupted addressing the redfaced man i see that the lights are beginning to change which means that soon the road will be closed and the gates opened  i cant remember anything he answered yes there is one matter he added nervously i see mr hare that you are thinking of my boy tom not very kindly i am afraid as you have been so good as to forgive me i hope that you wont be hard on tom he is not at all a bad sort of a lad if a little thoughtless like many other young people  i dont like tom said the hare with decision tom shot me when you told him not to shoot tom shut me up in a filthy place with a yellow rabbit which he forgot to feed so that it wanted to eat me tom tried to cut me off from the wood so that the running dogs might catch me although you shouted to him that it was not sportsmanlike tom dragged me out of the sea and blew down my nostrils to keep me alive tom threw me to the hounds although giles remonstrated with him and even the huntsman begged him to let me go i tell you that i dont like tom  still mr hare pleaded the redfaced man i hope that if it should be in your power when we get through those gates that you will be merciful to tom i cant think of much to say for him in this hurry but there he is my only son and the truth is that i love him you know he may liveto be differentif you dont bring some misfortune on him  who am i to bring misfortune or to withhold it asked the hare softening visibly well i know what love means for my mother loved me and i loved her in my way i tell you that when i saw her dead turned from a beautiful living thing into a stained lump of flesh and fur i felt dreadful i understand now that you love tom as my mother loved me and man for the sake of your lovenot for his sake mindi promise you that i wont say anything against tom if i can help it or do anything either  youre a real good fellow exclaimed the redfaced man with evident relief give me your hand oh i forgot you cant hullo whats up now everything seems to be altering    as he spoke to my eyes the lights began to change in earnest all the sky i call it sky for clearness above the mighty gates became as it were alive with burning tongues of every colour that an artist can conceive by degrees these fiery tongues or swords shaped themselves into a vast circle which drove back the walls of darkness and through this circle guided guarded by the spirits of dead suns with odours and with chantings descended that crowned city of the mansions before whose glory imagination breaks and even vision veils her eyes  it descended its banners wavering in the winds of prayer it hung above the gates the flowers of all splendours heavens very rose hung like an opal on the boundless breast of night and there it stayed  the voice in the north called to the voice in the south the voice in the east called to the voice in the west and up the great white road sped the angel of the road making report as he came that all his multitude were gathered in and for that while the road was barred  he passed and in a flash the gates were burned away the ashes of them fell upon the heads of those waiting at the gates whitening their faces and drying their tears before the change they fell upon the man and the hare beside me veiling them as it were and making them silent but on me they did not fall then from between the wardens of the gates flowed forth the helpers and the guardians save those who already were without comforting the children seeking their beloved and bearing the cups of slumber and new birth then pealed the question  who hath suffered most let that one first taste of peace  now all the dim hosts surged forward since each outworn soul believed that it had suffered most and was in the bitterest need of peace but the helpers and the guardians gently pressed them back and again there pealed no question but a command  this was the command  draw near thou hare    jorsen asked me what happened after this justification of the hare which if i heard aright appeared to suggest that by the decree of some judge unknown the woes of such creatures are not unnoted and despised or left unsolaced of course i had to answer him that i could not tell  perhaps nothing happened at all perhaps all the wonders i seemed to see even the road by which souls travel from there to here and from here to there and the gates that were burned away and the city of the mansions that descended were but signs and symbols of mysteries which as yet we cannot grasp or understand  whatever may be the truth as to this matter of my visions i need hardly add however that no one can be more anxious than i am myself to learn in what way the redfaced man speaking on behalf of our dominant race and the hare speaking as an appointed advocate of the subject animal creation finished their argument in the light of fuller knowledge much also do i wonder which of them was proved to be right a difficult matter whereon i feel quite incompetent to express any views  but you see at that moment i woke up the edge of the road on which i was standing seemed to give way beneath me and i fell into space as one does in a nightmare it is a very unpleasant sensation    i remember noticing afterwards that i could not have been long asleep when i began to dream i had only just blown out the candle and when i awoke again there was still a smouldering spark upon its wick  but as i have said in that spiritland wither i had journeyed is to be found neither time nor space nor any other familiar thing
