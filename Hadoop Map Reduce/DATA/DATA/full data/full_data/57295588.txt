abandoned but for the too flattering encouragement of a responsible friend  i trust that he may not live to rue the day like keith of craigentolly in the ballad  the loyal lyrics on charles and james and the white rose must not be understood as implying a rebellious desire for the subversion of the present illustrious dynasty   these are but symbols that i sing these names of prince and rose and king types of things dear that do not die but reign in loyal memory across the water surely they abide their twentyninth of may and we shall hail their happy reign when life comes to his own again    over the water that divides us from the voices and faces of our desires and dreams  of the ballads the young ruthven and the queen of spain were written in competition with the street minstrels of the close of the sixteenth century  the legend on which the young ruthven is based is well known the queen of spain is the story of the florencia a ship of the spanish armada wrecked in tobermory bay as it was told to me by a mariner in the sound of mull  in keith of craigentolly the family and territorial names of the hero or villain are purposely altered so as to avoid injuring susceptibilities and arousing unavailing regrets    in augustinum dobsonjam rude donatum    dear poet now turned out to grass like him who reigned in babylon forget the seasons overlaid by business and the board of trade

bard to hold her fan and happy land with such a queen  we live too early or too late you should have shared the pint of pope and taught well pleased the shining shell to murmur of the fair lepel and changed the stars of st johns fate to some more happy horoscope  by duchesses with roses crowned and fed with chicken and champagne urbane and witty and too wary to risk the feud of lady mary you should have walked the courtly ground of times that cannot come again  bring back these years in verse or prose i very much prefer your verse as on some twentyninth of may restore the splendour and the sway forget the sins the wars the woes  the joys alone must you rehearse  forget the dunces there is none so stupid as to snarl at you so may your years with pen and book run pleasant as an english brook through meadows floral in the sun and shadows fragrant of the dew  and thus at ending of your span  as all must endthe world shall say his best he gave  he left us not a line that saints could wish to blot for he was blameless though a man and though the poet he was gay    how the maid marched from blois    supposed to be narrated by james power or polwarth her scottish bannerpainter  the maiden called for her great destrier but he lashed like a fiend when the maid drew near lead him forth to the cross she cried and he stood like a steed of bronze by the holy rood  then i saw the maiden mount and ride with a good steel sperthe that swung by her side and girt with the sword of the heavenly bride that is sained with crosses five for a sign the mystical sword of st catherine and the lily banner was blowing wide with the flowers of france on the field of fame and blent with the blossoms the holy name and the maidens blazon was shown on a shield argent a dove on an azure field that banner was wrought by this hand ye see for the love of the maid and chivalry  her banner was borne by a page of grace with hair of gold and a ladys face and behind it the ranks of her men were dressed  never a man but was clean confessed jackman and archer lord and knight their souls were clean and their hearts were light there was never an oath there was never a laugh and la hire swore soft by his leading staff had we died in that hour we had won the skies and the maiden had marched us through paradise  a moment she turned to the people there who had come to gaze on the maiden fair a moment she glanced at the ring she wore she murmured the holy name it bore then for france and the king good people pray she spoke and she cried to us on and away and the shouts broke forth and the flowers rained down and the maiden led us to orleans town    lone places of the deer    lone places of the deer corrie and loch and ben fount that wells in the cave voice of the burn and the wave

animal male but woman abundantly hath em and mostly her notions prevail and why ladies read what they do read is a thing that no man may explain and if any one asks for a true rede he asketh in vain  ah why is each passing depression of stories that gloomily bore received as the subtle expression of almost unspeakable lore in the dreary the sickly the grimy say why do our women delight and wherefore so constantly ply me with ships in the night  dear ladies in vain you approach us with books to your taste in your hands for alas though you offer to coach us yet the soul of no man understands why the grubby is always the moral why the nastys preferred to the nice while you keep up a secular quarrel with a gay little vice  yes a vice with her lips full of laughter a vice with a rose in her hair you condemn in the present and after to darkness of utter despair but a sin if no rapture redeem it but a passion thats pale and played out or in surgical handsyou esteem it worth scribbling about  what is sauce for the goose for the gander is sauce ye inconsequent fair it is better to laugh than to maunder and better is mirth than despair and though lifes not all beer and all skittles yet the sun on occasion can shine and mon dieu hes a fool who belittles this cosmos of thine  there are cakes there is aleay and ginger shall be hot in the mouth as of old and a villain with cloak and with whinger and a hero in armour of gold and a maid with a face like a lily with a heart that is stainless and gay make a tale worth a world of the silly sad trash of today    rhyme of

that rose and lily art thy tongue doth poison cupids dart  nature herself to deadly flowers refuseth beauty lest the vain insects that hum through august hours with beauty should suck in their bane but thou as rose or lily fair art circled with envenomed air  like progne didst thou lose thy tongue thy lovers might adore and live like that witch circe oft besung thou hast dear gifts if thou wouldst give but since thou hast a wicked wit thy lovers fade or flee from it    tall salmacis    were an apple tree a pine tall and slim and softly swaying then her beauty were like thine salmacis when boune a maying tall as any poplar tree sweet as apple blossoms be  had the amazonian queen seen thee midst thy maiden peers thou the coronel hadst been of that ladys grenadiers troy had never mourned her fall with thine axe to guard her wall  as penthesilea brave is the maiden in her dreams ilium she well might save though achilles armour gleams midst the greeks all vain it is gainst the glance of salmacis    what francesco said of the jubileeby r b    what if we call it fifty years  tis steep to climb so high a gradient  prate of guides are we not roped  the danger  nay the turf no less nor more than mountain peaks my friend hears talk of ropingbut the jubilee nay there you have me  old francesco once this was in milan in viscontis time our wild visconti with one lip askance and beard tonguetwisted in the nostrils nook parlous enoughthese timeswhat  so are ours or any times ifegs to him who thinks  well twas in spring the frolic myrtle trees there gendered the grave olive stocksyou cry a miraclesordello writeth thus  believe me that indeed twas thus and he francesco you are with me  well theres gloom no less than gladness in your fifty years and so said he to supper as we may voltairean  so you take it but tis late and dinner seven sharp at primrose hill    the poet and the jubilee    poscimur  by a d  a birthday ode for meg or nan a rhyme for lady floras fan a verse on smut whos gone astray these things are in the poets way at home with praise of julias lace or delias ankles roses face but something overparted he when asked to rhyme the jubilee  he therefore turns the poet wary and thumbs his carmen seculare to phoebus and to dian prays who tune mens lyres of holidays he reads of the sibylline shades of stainless boys and chosen maids he turns and reads the other page of docile youth and placid age then sings how in this golden year fides pudorque reappear  and if they dont appear you know it were quite unjust to blame the poet    on any beachby m a    yes in the stream and stress of things that breaks around us like the sea there comes to peasants and to kings the solemn hour of jubilee if they till strenuous nature give some fifty harvests chance to live  ah fifty harvests  but the corn is grown beside the barren main is salt with seaspray blown and borne across the green unvintaged plain and life lived out for fifty years is briny with the spray of tears  ah such is life to us that live here in the twilight of the gods who weigh each gift the world can give and sigh and murmur whats the odds so longs youre happy  nay what man finds happiness since time began    ode of jubileeby a c s    me that have sung and shrieked and foamed in praise of freedom me do you ask to sing parochial pomps and waste the wail of jubileedom for queen or prince or king      nay by the foam that fleeting oars have feathered in grecian seas nay by the winds that barques athenian weathered  by all of these i bid you each be mute bards tamed and tethered and feed with fees  for you the laurel smirched for you the gold too of magazines for me the spirit of song unbought unsold to pale priests or queens  for you the gleam of gain the fluttering cheque of mr knowles for me to soar above the ruins and wreck of snobs and souls  when aflush with the dew of the dawn and the rose of the mystical vision the spirit and soul of the men of the future shall rise and be free they shall hail me with hymning and harping with eloquent art and elysian  the singer who sung not but spurned them the slaves that could sing jubilee with pinchbeck lyre and tongue praising their tyrant sung they shall fail and shall fade in derision as wind on the ways of the sea   jubilee before revolutionby w m    tell me o muse of the shifty the man who wandered afar so have i chanted of late and of troy burg wasted of war  now of the sorrows of menfolk that fifty years have been now of the grace of the commune i sing and the days of a queen surely i curse rich menfolk the wights of the whirlwind may they  this is my style of translating greek textsnatch them away the rich thieves rolling in wealth that make profit of labouring men surely the wights of the whirlwind shall swallow them quick in their den o baneful o witstraying in the burg of london ye dwell and ever of profits and three per cent are the tales ye tell but the stark strong polyphemus shall answer you back again him whom no man slayeth by guile and not by main by main i mean main force if aught at all do i mean in the greek of the blindfold bard it is simpler the sense to glean you polyphemus shall swallow and fill his mighty maw what time he maketh an end of the priests the police and the law and then ah who shall purchase the poems of old that i sang who shall pay twelveandsix for an epic in saga slang but perchance even hermes the flitter could scarcely expound what i mean and i trow that another were fitter to sing you a song for a queen    french peasant songs    i  oh fair apple tree and oh fair apple tree as heavy and sweet as the blossoms on thee my heart is heavy with love it wanteth but a little wind to make the blossoms fall it wanteth but a young lover to win me heart and all  ii  i send my love letters by larks on the wing my love sends me letters when nightingales sing  without reading or writing their burden we know they only say love me who love you so  iii  and if they ask for me brother say i come never home for i have taken a strange wife beyond the salt sea foam  the green grass is my bridal bed the black tomb my good mother
