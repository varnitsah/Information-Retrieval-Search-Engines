91139878	the memoirs of  majr alexander ramkins  a highland officer  now in prison at avignon  being  an account of several remarkable adventures during about twenty eight years service in scotland germany italy flanders and ireland exhibiting a very agreeable and instructive lesson of human life both in a publick and private capacity in several pleasant instances of his amours gallantry oeconomy c  london printed for r king at the queenshead and w boreham at the angel in paternosterrow 1719  price 1s 6d stichd and 2s bound     the publisher to the reader   i think it proper to inform the reader that these papers were deliverd into my hands by a near kinsman of the authors who lately came from the southern parts of france his design in imparting these memoirs to me was as i quickly perceivd to know my sentiments of the performance it seems the gentleman had been sourd by french practises and was willing that the world should be no longer a stranger to what was the ground of his distast the author appears very well qualify d for his task and opens a scene of politicks which the good naturd part of mankind will scarce think human race capable of those that are acquainted with the person of major ramkins assure me that the late king fames never had a more active and diligent servant and that he was one never wanting in his station if i am of a contrary opinion to the publick in judging these remarks worthy of the press tis what i do not at present find my self convincd of one benefit at least may be expected from em that they will induce all true britains to be cautious and not imbark themselves in a foreign interest for the future if not for the sake of their country at least for their own sakes i will not anticipate the contents but only take the freedom to acquaint the reader in general that it will be one of the greatest paradoxes in future ages to read that the court of st germains should have been a sleep and imposd upon for twenty eight years successively unless their being trickd by the greatest of politicians be a circumstance to take off from the surprize     the memoirs of  alexander ramkins c   i was not above seventeen years of age when the battle of gillycranky was fought between the two highland generals the lord viscount dundee and mackay and being then a stripling at the university of aberdeen and understanding that several clans were gathering into a body in defence of king james iii sold my books and furniture of my lodgings and equippd my self to observe the martial call i found my self prompted with i arrivd in a few days near the field of battle and joynd my self with a broken body of men who were making up towards the mountains to recover themselves after the fatigue of battle the noviceship i went through in the highlands was no improper foundation for the course method of living i have been since engagd in for above twenty seven years during which time i have run through all those hardships which are incident to one who seeks a preferment in fire and smoak  while i strolled about in the highlands it was my good fortune to be under the tuition of an old officer who let me into many of those little secrets which are not unserviceable to such as design to make the whole earth the theatre of their life but what i chiefly valued this old gentlemans conversation for was the happiness i had to be a hearer of some of his politick lessons of which he was a great master having furnishd himself by fifty years practice with the best ideas of that kind  upon a certain day when our party were out some upon foraging and others to get intelligence i being alone in a cottage with this old captain and being desirous to know his opinion of the affairs of europe in general as also what was like to be the issue of that cause we had undertaken the old captain willing to satisfy my curiosity as far as his skill would reach pulled out some remarks he had made upon the year 1640 observe says he child what i say to you tis a maxim never to be neglected among politicians to keep up divisions in an enemies country you may perhaps imagine that this will be a short game that is a playing but depend upon it my grey hairs will not see an end of it i allow the king of france has declard himself a friend to king james ii he is a very powerful prince and if he would turn his forces this way and be upon the defensive near home a few months would bring the war to a period but that monarch has things in his head which i must not mention there will be great skirmishing in the dominions of great britain but no decisive action if lewis le grand can hinder it he takes cardinal richlieus conduct for a precedent it would have been no difficult task for the french to have joynd their forces with king charles i and have made a short hand of that contest between the king and parliament but that politick cardinal instead of this method had emissaries in the english cabinet to exaggerate matters between them the same method has been observd by that nation ever since and if lewis le grand does not make a politick use of king james ii without doing him any real service i shall be very willing to correct my self and cancel that paragraph in my observations  this was the first politick lesson i was entertaind with by my old master which though at that time my want of experience did not permit me thoroughly to comprehend yet since a resemblance of circumstances has often revivd it my mind nor could i ever be well reconcild to that piece of morality that it was a laudable practice to set people by the ears together  the hopes of being releasd is the best support to men in misery and our small body of three hundred men woud not have remaind so long under discipline if expectation had not been nourishd with daily alarms of assistance from france our commanding officer was romantickly loyal and lookd upon every little hill we scrambled over as an impregnable fortress from whose summit he often took occasion to harangue us as if the eyes of all europe were upon us and the fate of the three kingdoms hung at our swords points but the truth was i believe we were unknown to all mankind and if those villages we marchd by youd but secure the cattle from us the state was in no great danger from our quarter  as for the hopes of being assisted from france though our commander neglected no pains to instill such a belief into the generality of the soldiers in order to prolong his reign in that honourable post he enjoyd yet i read it plainly in my old captains forehead that france was not accustomd to open their treasures in countenancing chimerical adventures and that the most we could expect from thence would be a small dunkirk privateer with a hogshead or two of brandy to keep the cause alive while he was pushing on his conquests in other parts of the globe in which the glory and interest of france was more immediately concernd for my own part as i was resolvd to pursue my fortune in the way of arms and finding that there was no appearance of scotlands being a place of action so i advisd with my old master what course i should steer to answer the ends of my call the old gentleman though he might have deterrd me from such an undertaking by proposing himself as an instance how little youd be gaind that way having nothing to show for near sixty years service in the war but a bundle of politick remarks drawn from the false steps he and others have made in endeavouring to make their fortune yet since every man must spin out his thread of life one way or other and that that was most likely to succeed well to which a person found himself most inclinable so he humourd my present dispositions but at the same time counselld me to transport my self over to the continent where i might meet with something worthy my curiosity islands says he are commonly won and lost in a day nor will they afford you that variety of stratagems which will make you perfect in the art of war after this i only waited for a fit opportunity to quit the service i was in for though i was no farther engaged than in the quality of a gentleman volunteer yet a strain of honour would not permit me to forsake my companions unless some more plausible reason occurrd to me than what i could invent at that time but it was not long before an occasion offered it self to put my project in execution by moving too and fro our little army i was within twenty miles of my mothers house for my father had been dead some years having therefor first communicated my design to my old master whom i intended to invite along with me if he approvd of my undertaking  in conclusion things were orderd so that the old captain with myself and another were detatchd out towards the coast to get intelligence and that night about eleven we agreeably surprizd my mother who had for several months been lamenting the loss of her darling son whom she supposd to be killd at the battle of gillycranky for she had not justly informd herself of the precise time i ran away from the college at aberdeen  i had two elder brothers who both inherited the martial spirit of our family had been a long time absent from home one of them was preferd in the emperors army in hungary the other belonging to the guards of king james ii followd his fate into france and ireland and afterwards was killd in ireland my father had three small lordships which we were equally to be sharers of allowing proportionably for my mothers maintenance with a thousand pounds to be raisd to marry our only sister  now as it was my intention to travel and gain experience in the world so my old captain put it into my head to raise a sum of money upon the credit of my land assuring me it would prove my best friend upon all occasions for that the world had but a very mean opinion of merit when stripd of other advantages to recommend it this affair took up more time than my warm temper could well bear and the lawyers threw in so many delays that had not the old captain who was well acquainted with business been at my elbow to forward things i might have lost my vocation of being a soldier before any agreement coud have been made but after two months were expird i found my self master of fifteen hundred pound the price of my share of land after the deductions made for my mother and sister twelve hundred pounds i lodgd with a banker at amsterdam the other three was employd for an equipage and to supply my necessities in the tour i designd to take the old captain i intended to take along with me to be my guide as well as adviser for i saw so many perfections in him which the ungrateful world had neglected that i judgd it would be an honourable omen in one that was beginning the world not to let him leave the stage of life unrewarded but as his years had renderd him incapable to attend me in my rambles so death came in to release him and this worthy person was taken from me about ten days before the time i had fixd for my travels however i must not let his memory die but give the world an account of him as far as i coud gather from the gentleman when he was disposed to answer to questions concerning himself in which he always behaved himself with a well guarded modesty  i learnd from him that his father was the head of a clan which was one half cut off by oliver cromwell and the other half transported into the westindies with the fifteen hundred scots that were condemnd thither to slavery by the protector my friend being at that time about twelve years old chose rather to share his fathers fate and view the western parts of the worlds than fall into the hands of a person who would stain the beauty of his tender mind by giving him an unsuitable education after he had buried his father in virginia he took the opportunity of a french vessel to pass over to brest and so to paris who by the assistance of a scotch nobleman who was acquainted with his family he pickd up a liberal education and made himself master of the french and latin and having it in his election whether he woud engage himself to the church or follow the camp he chose the latter and after some months spent in the academy he enterd himself among the gens darms and made very useful observations in two or three campaigns in germany in the last of which he was taken prisoner and seducd into the emperors service by some of his countrymen who persuaded him the germans were more accustomd to advance strangers than the french in a little time he was observd by his colonel to be a person of parts and resolution and so was gradually advancd from a cornet to a captain of horse and as a man of spirit and action never wants opportunity to shew himself so this gentleman met with many brave adventures in the way of soldiery which some time he would occasionally recount to me but they would be too tedious to insert in these remarks when king james ii came to the crown of england he desired to throw up his commission it being suggested to him that the prince stood in need of some old experiencd officers to model an army he was raising upon this prospect he passd over to england but being destitute of acquaintance he loiterd about the court till one of the duke of berwicks retinue who had heard of him at the siege of buda made the king acquainted with him so he was orderd down into scotland with the promise of a colonels commission but the revolution following soon after he acted only as a captain of foot at the battle of gillycranky  but to cut short this digression the time now drew near that i was to undertake my intended ramble and indeed it was high time for it being whisperd about in the neighbourhood that i had been in arms for king james ii home as the saying is was too hot a place for me so i sent my servant to enquire for a conveniency to pass over to flanders and in two days i was provided with a roterdam vessel and so with very little ceremony took leave of my mother who though she was unwilling to part with me yet she preferd the lesser danger to the greater and rather wishd me exposd to the waves than to the insults of my enemies at home  the wind blew very fresh but tacking about too much to the north east it drove us upon shore with that violence that we were obligd to put in twice to land once at scarborough and again at yarmouth  at this latter place a pragmatical searcher came aboard us with an air of authority as if he designd to visit my trunks but one of the sailors informing me that this was stretching his commission for he ought not to search after any goods unless the cargo was designd for that port so i ridded my self of this spark with a halfcrown piece for i had no mind to enter much into a parley with him lest he might discover my highland expedition for fear never wants apprehensions after two days stay in this port the wind proving favourable we were not very long in making a trip to roterdam where i only refreshd myself a few hours and passd on to amsterdam to visit my bank and settle a correspondence as to returns of money  i met with nothing in this city that made any impression upon me to stay any longer than settling the small concern of money i lodgd there the hurry of business was too mechanical an entertainment for one whose head was filled with high flights of honour sieges battles and other such like sports the french army at this time lay upon the rhine and my design was to make that way when i arrivd there i found they had surrounded mentz in order to besiege it i was glad to begin my first campaign with so glorious an undertaking not doubting but a great deal of bravery would be shown where the flower of the houshold was designd for action but before i could make any advantage of this occurrence i was to make my self known to some person of character who might introduce me so as to be a spectator of that noble siege at last i met with a scotch gentleman who rid in among the grand molquetains who being fully informd of my warlike dispositions assurd me he would put me into the readiest method he coud to gain experience but when he informd me that i must not pretend to great things on a sudden and that i had at present only two things in election either to carry a musquet in a common foot regiment during the siege or which he woud rather advise me to in case i had money to be at that expence to go to strasburgh and put my self under discipline for six weeks or two months among the french cadets  i must confess this was a great balk upon a double account it not only deprivd me of the satisfaction of seeing the siege carried on but it was a sensible check to my aspiring humour to think what drudgery i was to undergo before i could be regarded by the world but when i reflected on what i had often heard the old captain i buried in the highlands say upon this head it made me easier under the disappointment and the next day i went on to strasburg and enterd my self among the cadets tis in the nature of a college where young gentlemen are instructed in the rudiments of war  during my stay at strasburg i omitted no opportunity of improving myself as to the french and high dutch fortifications and other parts of the mathematicks which were useful in war i was also present at some lectures of politicks which were given to those more advancd in years in which they handled the interest of nations and brought down their reflections to the present times this i lookd upon as an excellent method of educating young officers for it qualifyd them to be serviceable to their country under a double capacity that is as well to argue as to fight for it and defend it equally with their tongue and sword  i remember an antient marquis who had a superintendency over this academy entertaining us one day with the motives of the present war and running up the cause to its original laid it before us in this manner that the monarchs of france woud look upon themselves as injurd by the rest of the princes of europe till the imperial diadem was restord to france who were first possessors of it in the person of charles the great that they had made several pushes in all ages to recover it but without effect that while the english had footing in france they were too lazy to extend their conquests upon the empire of the west and when they had chased out the english and were rid of that incumbrance the house of austria by the vast acquisitions of the low countries and joint power of spain sat so hard upon em that france was not in a capacity to make any advances towards recovering their right to the empire what therefore they had been upon these latter years was to make a strong party among the electoral princes and by degrees secure a majority in the imperial diet in order to set aside the house of austria and settle the imperial crown upon the french line as it was in the beginning to this he added that this invincible monarch lewis xiv had made considerable advances of late years especially in bringing over several electors and now the chapter of cologn to chuse cardinal fustenberg for their archbishop who though a native of germany yet was a frenchman by interest and had given his word to be very industrious in settling the imperial dignity upon the house of bourbon and this election of cardinal fustenberg being contested by the emperor and pope innocent xi was the motive of the present war for they put up the duke of bavarias brother in opposition against him  this account of the occasion of the present war varyd very much from the idea we in scotland had of affairs we were made to believe that the king of france being a zealous roman catholick monarch had engagd himself in a war against the allies meerly upon a religious motive to reestablish king james who was dethrond upon no other account but because he was a roman catholick but i have since found by comparing matters that the revolution in england was not the occasion but the consequence of the war between the french and the allies for the emperor c understanding that king james ii was drawn into a scrape by the french king and that he made a property of him to carry on his ambitious designs tis not to be wonderd at if they preferd the general good of europe and immediate safety of their own people to the private good of king james ii who had been so indiscreet as to expose himself to ruin by giving into a french project however this unpolitick management proved very lucky to france upon a double account for tho they had begun a war upon the disedifying bottom of ambition it was afterwards consecrated in mny peoples thoughts under a colour of justifying a dethrond roman catholick prince besides the advantage of causing a considerable diversion by fomenting a war in the three kingdoms of greatbritain for as for reestablishing that unfortunate prince in his throne though i was a long time of opinion france really designd it yet since i have been convincd by undeniable arguments that it neither was his interest to bring it about nor that he ever seriously attempted it i must own it was never very intelligible to me not even in my very darkest state of bigottry for the french interest that the emperor the king of spain and duke of savoy with many other roman catholick princes nay the pope himself should all fail in their duty and zeal for religion and the king of france who was remarkable upon other occasions for sacrificing it to politick ends should be the only one in europe that woud stand up for it it was not so in the infancy of the dutch republic when france concurrd with the seven provinces to have them torn from the spanish monarchy and by the same assistance enabled em to make head against the church it was not so when a frown of oliver cromwell coud oblige france to lay aside the charitable maxim of royal protection and send charles ii and his brother the duke of york out of their territories by an infamous condescension but james ii had forgotten the affronts offerd to the duke of york and i suppose had a mind to make a second tryal of french hospitality and whether they would be more obliging to him in his old age than they had been in his youth neither is this plausible pretence of defending a prince injurd upon the score of religion very consistent with their conduct in regard of the turk to maintain a catholick prince at st germains and support the enemy of christianity at constantinople with great remittances of moneys and a constant supply of engineers is a piece of state casuistry above my comprehension and prince eugene had a great deal of reason to knock his breast and hold up his hands to heaven when he saw french engineers draggd out of turkish mines in hungary with agnus deis and relicks about their necks as ensigns of lewis xivs christianity and zeal for the church  but to proceed to my own concerns as soon as the time was expird i proposd to my self to stay in the academy at strasburgh i provided my self with the equipage of a grand musketeer and for a present of 50 pistols and the strength of good recommendation from my countrymen i was admitted to ride among em but here i had a fresh difficulty to struggle with my countrymen finding me pretty flush of money and that i was very generous was as observant as a spaniel and so very officious both early and late that i found it impracticable to steal an hour of privacy to recollect my self in order to model my conduct after the best precedents i met with in the course of the day and what made me yet more uneasy he was not content to visit me alone but had often a second or third with him who as they were very obliging in informing me of the methods of living in a camp so they was always very adroit and gave me the preference upon all occasions but then as i engrossd all the ceremony of the day so i was thrown into unavoidable circumstances of paying them for their attendance this constant charge though in time it would have made me weary of acting the grand signior yet i could better have bore with it had i not smelt a design they had to strip me of my bank i had at amsterdam for i was so unguarded in my conduct as to have acquainted my countrymen with my money concerns which he and his associates had already devourd in their imagination and wanted but a fit opportunity to draw me in at play and so at once put me upon a level with themselves and other soldiers of fortune but being aware of the trap that was laid for me my whole study was how to disengage myself from this gang so as to give no suspicion that i understood their meaning for this i imagind might be the ground of a quarrel and to perhaps have worse consequences than if they really had stripd me of my substance armd with this caution i receivd em in the usual manner but still kept off when a motion was made either of high drinking or playing deep for no man is secure when either liquor or passion gains the ascendent over him but this state of violence could not continue long sometimes i was at a loss for an excuse to baffle their importunity other times i found them disposd to represent me as of an uncomplying temper so that there was no way left but either to draw or withdraw for i saw plainly that if i staid among them a quarrel would ensue this consideration with the unheard of devastation i saw in the palatinate made by the french troops gave me a surfeit of the rhine i am not ignorant that no part of the world is free from sharpers but i thought in another place i might better resist their first onset and let them gain no ground upon me while rule i here neglected for want of experience and now i was obligd to make a call upon my banker at amsterdam for two hundred pounds resolving not to break the remaining 1000 pound bulk unless upon some extraordinary emergency i had sometime before intimated to my officers and comrades the design i had to quit the service upon the rhine assuring them it was not out of any disobligation having experienced their obliging temper upon all occasions but as i understood king james was at the head of his army in ireland so i lookd upon my self in some measure inexcusable if i servd in a foreign army when i might contribute more immediately to succour my prince my reasons were applauded and i not a little content to depart without giving disgust without delay therefore i posted to paris where i designd to make no very long stay only what was necessary to recover my self from the fatigue of the campaign and satisfy my curiosity in taking a view of that noble city i was happy in one thing during my stay here that i was agreeably surprizd with the fight of my only sister whose husband being under some malignant court influence was obligd to withdraw with his family out of scotland paris is a place like all other great cities where persons of all conditions and characters may spend their time agreeably if that useful trifle calld money be not wanting hitherto i had no occasion to be melancholly upon that score for though i was not furnishd to make any extraordinary figure yet being only a single person and as yet never launchd out into any extravagances so within my narrow sphere i made a decent appearance but as no man is prosperous at all times so it was not long before i found my self engagd in an affair which very much troubled my repose and which i would willingly have compounded for with my amsterdam bank the business was this my eldest brother before he went with king james into ireland made some stay at paris and st germains where he was orderd to collect some recruits of the three nations which he was to conduct over in the quality of a routecaptain now as he was a person who had seen very much of the world and was somewhat addicted to gallantry and intriguing with the fair sex so he could not remain long in a place without publishing some marks of his vocation that way it happend that a young lady who lodgd in the same house with him had occasion to pay a visit to her acquaintance my brother observing her in a posture to go out of the house alone offerd to usher her to the place she designd for the lady with the usual french freedom and obliging air made him a courtsey and accepted the offer when he complied with this piece of civility he took his leave and returnd to his lodgings from this accident my brother dated an intrigue the ladies carriage which by the way was nothing but what is customary there upon a slender acquaintance encouragd him to make advances the next step he made was to drink tea with her in her chamber and afterwards he invited her to the opera but the young lady as she was strictly virtuous never gave way to none of these freedoms but in the company of her landlady or her daughter who were both prudes in the mean time a relation of this gentlewomans who was a lieutenant in the regiment of navarre came up to paris and had not been long in town before he was informd by some busy noddle that his cousin was either upon the point of being married or what was rather suggested to him that one captain ramkins a scotch officer who lodgd in the same house had dishonourable designs upon her now as persons never want arguments to induce them to take things in the worst sense tho i will not avouch for my brothers intention so the french officer being of a suspicious and also a fiery temper wanted no body to exasperate him he took it for granted the thing was so and taking coach he came to his kinswoman and after having attackd her with a great deal of scurrilous language he waited not for her reply but flung away to find my brother in order to cut his throat my brother was then at st germains receiving his last orders from the secretary for his departure for ireland but returnd that night to paris his landlady at his return gave him a note which she said was deliverd to her by the post the contents were a double surprize to him first a bold and daring challenge and again he neither knew whom he was to meet nor upon what account only the time and place were mentiond thus doubtful with himself what course to take he acquainted his landlady with the subject of the letter but she was also at a loss having neither seen the ladys relation nor heard that he was come to town otherwise it might have created some suspicion but after supper according to custom she went up to have an hours chat with the young lady and among other things mentiond the odd letter captain ramkins had receivd that evening the lady suspecting what the matter really was gave the landlady sufficient intimation by the consternation she was in that she was not unacquainted with the occasion of that letter in the mean time my brother was gone to consult with some of his acquaintance how he should behave himself in this juncture some advisd him to neglect it as a sham challenge whereby some of his acquaintance being merry disposd had a mind to divert themselves others judgd it might be a design to assassinate him upon account of some old grudge now worn out of his memory in conclusion twas orderd that he should present himself at the place mentiond in the challenge and in case it was a real thing and that he escapd with life a horse should be ready to ride post to brest whether he and his recruits were orderd to take shipping but that he might not alarm his lodgings he spent the remainder of the night in the tavern with his friends a fitter preparation than praying for the work he was about about five in the morning he set out towards the place of battle half a dozen of his acquaintance following him at a convenient distance to wait for the issue and to see justice done in case he was assaulted against the usual method of duelling when he came to the place apointed he saw a young gentleman walking and musing under a hedge with his arms a kimbo whom he rightly judgd to be his man when he came within speech of him the french officer stopd and askd him if his name was not ramkins and whether he had not receivd a note the evening before upon such an occasion my brother made no other reply but that he took himself to be the person and that he would indite an answer with the point of his sword for though said he i am a stranger both to you and the occasion of this trouble you have given me yet as i take you to be a man of honour so i suppose you think your self injurd to that degree that satisfaction either cannot or will not be given any other way and therefore i am here ready to make up this mysterious quarrel after the method you have made choice of it sometimes happens that peace is struck up between two nations sword in hand but my brothers antagonist was too warm to stand a parley and act the part of a plenipotentiary upon which without making the least reply he whips off his cloaths into his shirt and opend his breast to show his adversary he scornd to take any ungenerous advantage my brother was also honourable upon the same score for though he wore a short buff waiscoat without skirts according to the fashions of those times and which might have deadened a push yet he threw it off and put himself upon the level with his adversary in all respects so to it they went my brother found himself much superior in strength and vigour and that in all probability he coud command his adversarys sword paried with him a considerable time and put by several pushes without attempting the gentlemans life but finding him resolute and that one of them must fall he made one home thrust and drove his sword quite through his adversarys body falling upon him at the same time and thus fell this unfortunate young gentleman a victim to his ungovernable passion  it appeard afterwards that this french officer having been often playd upon by several in his regiment that he had been two years among them and never yet made any experiment of his personal courage told them at his going up to paris that they should here in a little time he had qualifyd himself by killing his man now it is supposd he thought the british nation not being famd for their skill in handling the sword he had an excellent opportunity of showing his manhood and the advantage of making his escape when he had done the fact because little or no enquiry woud be made after a stranger my brother being convincd his adversary was incapable to rally made haste to gather up his cloaths exchanging the evangelical advice of burying the dead to that natural precept of selfpreservation and i must leave him pursuing his journey towards brest to return to his lodgings and give an account how this catastrophe came to affect me at my coming to paris  the young lady who was the innocent occasion of this unfortunate accident took little rest after she was informd of the contents of the note left by her kinsman and her concern grew upon her when she understood captain ramkins was out of his lodgings all night thus she remaind under great inquietudes till three a clock the next day when she with her landlady and daughter took a coach privately and drove directly to the place where the gentlemen were to meet according to the contents of the letter they dischargd their coach upon a pretence of taking a walk in the fields and after a small tour the landladys daughter put her foot into a cake of clotted blood but it was so changd as to the colour that she could not well distinguish what it was but at a little distance finding a glove and several blades of grass tingd with a vermillion dye being pressd down and ruffled as it were with some cattle weltring and tumbling about they had a strong suspicion one of the gentlemen had ended his days upon the spot and to clear their suspicion they walkd back into the city till they arrived at the petite chastelet which is a publick room in the nature of a guard bed where all corps are exposd to view and whither people usually go in quest of any of their friends or acquaintance that are wanting and here the young gentlewoman was quickly satisfyd that her cousins rashness had brought him to his end this accident happening not long before i came to paris the discourse of it was very fresh and what occasiond me to have an account of it at my first arrival was my lodging at the same house with my brother it being the usual lodgings for english and scotch tis true that landlady and her daughter where removd to orleans where they had an estate belonging to their family but the young lady cousin to the deceasd officer was still in her old apartment i had not been above three days but my name began to be known as well by the direction of some letters i receivd out of germany as by other means there are of having such things divulgd the young lady was not so struck with the horror of the name of her cousins murtherer as not to have the curiosity to peep at me as i came in and out of my lodgings and the more because i had so great a resemblance to him both as to figure and features that without any extraordinary skill in physiognomy she might conclude i was either his brother or some near relation now whether my brothers cavaliers carriage had left an idea in the ladys head which she could not conveniently part with or her inquisitiveness after me was only a female curiosity i am not able to determine but it was very unfortunate to me to have been so near a kin to one she admired in case it was so or that her inquisitiveness should make me so publick for i had not been in paris above eight days but the archers or city guards took me out of my bed at four a clock in the morning and carried me to prison upon strong suspicion of being that very captain ramkins who had killd the french officer in a duel captain ramkins i certainly was calld at my own request having taken that travelling name as all independent gentlemen do who cannot tell well what title to give themselves upon the road my case had no very good aspect at the beginning there were so many circumstances to render me suspected that though i was satisfyd my life was not in danger yet it was an easy thing to perceive it woud be both a troublesome and also a chargeable spot of work the first thing i did was to send for my brotherinlaw whom i employd as my solicitor to lay a true narration of the fact before the kings attorney my counsel advisd me to subpoena the young lady who woud be a material witness that i was not the captain ramkins chargeable with the fact which she seemd willingly to acquiesce to but some of the deceased friends endeavourd to invalidate her affidavit upon a pretence that there was too great an intimacy between her and captain ramkins however to put the contest upon an issue which would allow of no reply i procured the testimonies of several officers in the army that i was actually upon the rhine when the duel was fought at paris besides the corroborating evidence of several irish gentlemen who livd in paris and at st germains who were ready to offer their oaths i was not the man tis incredible to think what pains the deceasd gentlemans relations took to destroy me though i have the charity to think they judgd i was the person they sought after though it is somewhat unintelligible they woud not credit the young lady their cousin this affair helpd me off with the greatest part of my ready money for tis a blessing which attends all lawsuits that the gainer is obligd to refund to the lawyers what he recovers from his adversary and for my part i payd pretty dear for an authentick copy of my innocence and the carriage of the court to me was such as if i had been particularly favourd in not being hangd instead of my brother  after this troublesome business was over i began to enjoy my self a little in the diversions of paris and by the assistance of my brotherinlaw i had a good guide in him to view several of the curiosities that city abounds with though i cannot say i took any extraordinary relish that way for my thoughts being chiefly upon war i digested other matters as a nice appetite does improper food it was my intention to go over to ireland and to made that undertaking less chargeable to me i endeavourd to procure a commission which was no difficult matter at that time especially to one who was provided with a little money to facilitate the grant i did not stick much upon the nature of the commission for my years and small experience could make no very extraordinary demands so i was registred as a lieutenant which i according to the usual custom upon receival dexterously improvd into captain indeed i had very lofty expectations and the affairs of king james went so well at that time in ireland that there was not a footman who followd that prince but lookd upon his fortune as made  these considerations put me and some others upon a project of transporting our selves to the north of england where king james had a very strong party and we were informd that immediately upon the reduction of ireland as before the whole strength of his army woud power in upon england that way a day was fixd to put my design in execution but falling into discourse a little after with a person of experience he intimated that the business woud not be so near over in ireland as i imagind for i can assure you says he three expresses have arrived lately at versailles to solicit the french court for cannon and ammunition without which it woud be impossible for king jamess forces to become masters in ireland but that the french were so dilatory in this affair upon some politick views that it was great odds that nation woud be quickly recoverd by king williams forces this was a misterious insinuation to one of my small experience for my shallow brain told me expedition was the business of war whereas i found afterwards it was the interest of france to spin on the irish war and to order things so that king william should always have an army employd there for they lookd upon it as a chimerical notion that the war could be carryd on into england or that an irish army was capable to reduce england for france knew very well their own designs of not intending to send any french troops to joyn them in england  i own i never entirely forgot the reflexion that gentleman made upon the present posture of affairs but yet i cannot say i assented to his opinion however it wrought so much upon me as to alter my resolutions of going directly into the north of england for i governd my self by this dilemma that in case ireland was not reducd till i came there i might have the opportunity of having a share in the reduction but if it was the passage between the north of ireland and england was very short upon this bottom i began my journey i took shipping at brest and landed at cork pursuing the rest of my journey by land upon account of the danger i was informd of in going by sea for that several english men of war guarded the narrow seas between dublin and holyhead when i came into king jamess army my first enquiry was after my brother whom you may be sure i entertaind in the first place with the consequence of his duel at paris and though he often sighd to reflect upon his misfortune in being the occasion of the french officers death which might have been honourably avoided yet he laughd plentifully when he heard the part i had afterwards in that melancholy farce and rallyd me home when i insisted upon charges and desired to be reimbursd with sixty louis dors which that affair had cost me upon his account all the satisfaction i could get was that he thought i put a greater value upon my being his brother than to think it overrated at that trifling sum the life of a brother said he is the only thing that can answer for a brotherly affection  the scene of affairs in ireland was very much alterd upon raising the siege of londonderry men and arms were imported from england on all sides to make head against king james and several bloody skirmishes happend in several parts of the kingdom it woud make a volume to account the marches and countermarches both parties made in that irregular country to attack and avoid one another but where ever it was my lot to engage the general complaint was a want of money ammunition and arms this as it coud not be otherwise made us unsuccessful under many promising advantages we had men enough and those not destitute of zeal or courage but to expose themselves naked against arms and discipline was a desperate way of engaging but france still went upon the old politick scheme to gain advantages upon the continent by dilatory proceedings in king jamess affairs for unless this was their prospect was it not a supine piece of management to suffer a body of near thirty thousand brave men to lie unarmd in the field above half a year when france had magazines and stores to furnish above a million of soldiers but as king james was not only to be the dupe of their great monarch but the sport and game of his ministers besides a general topick of refusing him an assistance upon the politick motive of prolonging the war it seems the chief minister of state had some private ends in these dilatory proceedings and king jamess cause in ireland was also to be sacrificd to this gentlemans resentments the case was this lewis xiv upon great importunity and to put a gloss upon and lay deep colours upon his politicks condescended so far as to order five or six thousand despicable foot soldiers for king jamess service in ireland with a general at their head who had been more accustomd to lead up a country dance than an army and better qualifyd to break a jest than look in upon an enemy this general however was according to king jamess own liking though contrary to the chief ministers design who wanted that post for a relation of his own this undesignd affront of king james in preferring cl to the ministers favourite lost the battle of the boyne and perhaps all ireland for the chief minister would neither send arms nor money to supply that brave body of men but threw them into the circumstances of either dying unrevengd or saving their lives by flight the history of that battle has so many eye witnesses still alive for me to dwell upon it i shall only make bold to relate what my fate was upon that unfortunate day and how inglorious france withdrew the sham succours they sent king james my post was to head a company of fingalian granadiers who were placd in an orchard which hung over a defilee through which we expected the enemy would march after they had passd the river i make bold to stile my company granadiers because they were designd to be so when first raisd but were now armd rather like pioneers than grenadiers we had not above a dozen granadoes no bayonets and several without any firearms and if the chief men of the action were no better equippd tis easy to guess how the gross of the army was provided according to our expectation a party of the enemy fell into the trap and what shot we had we let it successively fly at them out of the orchard in the mean time we heard a great noise behind us and turning my self about i saw the orchard almost surrounded with horse which i expected were some of our own party coming up to support us but found them to be a squadron of the enemy who immediately summond us to yield or we must expect the last fate of war there was no time to parley upon which i made a sign to the commanding officer of the enemy not to proceed to slaughter and so out of twenty two men with which i defended that post nine of us fell into the enemies hands the rest dying bravely in the engagement our entertaintment was what is usually with prisoners of war hunger and hard lodgings but in a little time being removd to dublin things were better with me i had the liberty of a large prison and civil usage and here it was i met with an excellent friend who never faild those who make application to him i mean a small bank of money which my brother left me and which i had sent to dublin per bill from newry that i might run no hazard of being plunderd in case of a defeat and in this i have often applauded my own caution that though i have frequently hazarded my life i never risqud my substance if death happend i was certain of being provided for and if imprisonment i had what woud make my captivity easy and perhaps purchase my enlargement  tis not a being in a battle that makes a person a capable judge how to describe it every officer has his post which he must not depart from and though he may be able to describe the situation of the troops before an engagement yet afterwards during the fight there is so much noise smoak and confusion that for my part i scarce can give a true narration of what happend within a dozen yards compass upon this account i cannot tell in what manner the french troops behavd themselves but i was informd they made a tollerable stand against king williams army but that they quickly changd it into a running fight and very dexterously conveyd both king james and themselves out of danger and in a little time out of the kingdom directing their march to the next seaport town which was not in the enemies hands from whence they found their way home if these troops were serviceable at the boyne they certainly might have been much more useful if they had remaind and assisted the irish the remainder of the war but they had shown themselves and that was enough to answer the politick ends for which they were sent tis supposd after this defeat at the boyne that king james was aware of the french politics and so would neer think of returning in person again into ireland it being abundantly sufficient if he left two or three active generals among em to alarm the enemy and do the drudgery of the french court in making a diversion to favour his conquests in other parts of the world but to return to the series of my own story i had now obtaind liberty of the city of dublin upon paroll and spent my life pretty agreeable especially when i understood that a kind of a cartel was fixd and there was no danger of a halter my long stay in dublin brought me acquainted with several general officers of king williams army who were my countrymen and well acquainted with my family the great respect they showed me was as i perceivd at long run in order to debauch me from king jamess service but it was not in my power at that time to remove the scruples i was entangled in as to the revolution besides i had other motives urgent enough not to engage in the english service till i had seen a little more abroad but in the midst of all the disasters i met with nothing affected me with a more sensible grief than the thoughts of lewis the xivths insincerity for though it only rid my mind in the nature of a scruple or first impression yet i found it grow daily more and more upon me and often in the height of my diversions it lay upon my stomach like an indigested meal yet at the same time i durst not mutter the least of this matter to the greatest confident i had in the world for i was sensible what would be the consequence of such a liberty of speech and that nothing less than perpetual imprisonment in the bastile must have attond for the crime and that king james woud have lookd upon himself as obligd to have justifyd the conduct of france though perhaps he lay under the same jealousies with myself in regard of french politics how often have i when i have been alone exaggerated my folly in engaging in a cause which the principal agent never designd to bring to an issue but then again i have corrected my self for giving way to a false impression and condemning the conduct of so many thousands who had more experience than i could lay claim to and yet willingly went all the lengths of the french court now as i always had a great respect for men of years and experience so i was resolvd to silence all the scruples relating to french politicks and see an end of the irish war not so much under the influence of a french power which never did any real service to king james in ireland but because so many worthy gentlemen eagerly pursue the cause whom i had reason to think were better judges of such high matters than my self and what in the next place i was to undertake was how to be releasd from my confinement in which i coud find no difficulty besides a breach of paroll my person being every day at liberty but understanding that several persons in the same circumstances with my self were partly connivd at when they made their escape i took the same method and rather chose to walk off than wait to be exchangd or bribe for my enlargement perhaps the reader will expect here to be entertaind with the remaining part of the irish war especially where i was employd but he must be content to be informd in general that as i made it a law with my self neer to omit any occasion of improving my self in the art of war so i took particular care not to be upon any foreign duty in the day of action i was wounded at the battle of aghram where i had one of my legs broke and lost two fingers with the cut of a sabre i was at the first siege of limerick and helpd to surprize the enemys flying camp and provisions they were carrying to supply the main army that was carrying on the siege afterwards i entred the town and remaind there during the siege having the liberty to pass over into france with the rest of the irish troops upon the articles of limerick but there was one remarkable passage happend to me during the siege of that town which i cannot dispense with my self to pass over in silence it was rather a casual matter than a design laid however it equally answerd the end at one of the sallies in which we designd to overthrow a mount they had made to raise a battery upon after a smart engagement it being in the night i had the opportunity to step aside and strip a dutch granadier and immediately putting on his cloaths i mingled my self with the enemys battalions as they drew back towards their camp thus unperceivd i had the opportunity the next morning to view their works and make my remarks but now i was somewhat at a loss how to make a hand of this stratagem and get back into the town nor was i less concernd how to avoid being discoverd as not belonging to the enemy but the confusion they were in the next day in burying their dead and repairing their works made me pass undiscoverd till night so about nine at night when it was throughly dark i stole to that side of the town which lies next to the sea and swimming over undiscoverd i crept under the wall and calling softly upon the next centinel i informd him who i was bidding him call to the captain of the next guard and bring a rope and two or three soldiers to hall me up i was very welcome to the garrison for twas supposd i was either killd or taken prisoner in the sally this stratagem though i had no design in it at our attacking the enemy it being only a sudden thought yet it had a very good event for the next sally we made as i had observd the weakest part of the besiegers works so i lead a party of resolute men that way who lost no time but levelld all their works and draggd a considerable booty into the town  the wars of ireland being at an end and the articles of limerick signd about 15000 regular troops were transported into france besides several thousands of others who all proved as useful to the monarch of france in his wars in italy spain germany c as they had been in making a three years diversion in ireland so happy was france in making a politick use of king jamess misfortune that lewis xiv was much a greater gainer by his being banishd than if he had remaind in the quiet possession of his throne and now there were several speculations what method the french king woud take to make the world believe he had a design to reinstall king james the most direct means was to attempt a descent but this was impracticable by the way of ireland for if an army of 30000 men coud not keep it when they were actually in possession of it there was no likelyhood of their succeeding in a descent nor was it probable that france would add more force to them who had so often refusd them when they were in circumstances to receive the most favourable interpreters of the french kings politicks began now to think he had laid all thoughts of a restoration aside king jamess troops were employd and scatterd where they were useless upon that design and his court was modelld as if nothing more should be attempted however it was thought convenient still to carry the juggle on and several methods were made use of to seduce the poor jacobites in england and st germains that their work was still going on great respect was shown to the court of st germains by his most christian majesty with repeated assurances to stand by them in the mean time i was permitted to leave the army and solace my self for two or three months at paris where by the assistance of my old friend ready money i made my self very acceptable it was my happiness hitherto never to be engaged in an intrigue with the fair sex for though several of my station have diverted themselves that way with much prejudice to their business yet i was always so bent upon war that i coud never find spare hours for such trifling conversation for that was the notion i had of it a general whining and pining away for a trolloping girl was to me a very awkerd and inconsistent piece of pageantry however i had been often told by persons of experience that no man had so just an idea of the world as he that had been well hamperd and sowerd by a love intrigue for though women appear to be only spectators and to bear no sway in the politicks of the world yet underhand the fate of kingdoms often hung at their girdles and the wisest of princes often hazarded the repose of his people for an hours dalliance with some coquet and diverting creature of the fair sex i cannot tell well how it happend but i suppose by not resisting the first impressions of this kind i found my self far gone in an intrigue and that without either thought or design but i understood afterwards that a breach of idleness being espyd in my conduct the roving deity seizd the advantage and enterd sword in hand the gentlewoman who drew me into this snare was no otherwise my acquaintance than by an accidental visit but i was so much a philosopher as to know that where there is a sympathy of humours all other considerations are neglected and a turk with those advantages is as capable to make a conquest as a christian i had at my first entrance upon the stage of the world made a double promise to my self the one was never to hearken to a love affair till i had acquired a stock of experience and money to make that passion serviceable and of real use in an honourable way the other was not to graft upon a foreign stock but i was forcd to humble my self under a violation of both these purposes for the object of my passion was a spanish young lady though of irish extraction her family transporting themselves thither about the middle of queen elizabeths reign now i had two or three difficulties to struggle with relating to this affair in the first place i had not as yet imparted the secret to the young lady again my brothers example gave me grounds to think i coud not avoid a quarrel with some of her relations but what chiefly frighted me was the plague of wedding in case we were both of a mind for a keen hound is not easily calld off from a hot scent till he has either caught or lost his game in the midst of these perplexities i judgd twoud be a wise part to disclose my self to some persons of experience in these matters for in all the skirmishes and sieges i had been at they never threw me into such a consternation and absence of thought and accordingly i met with an old adept in these affairs when he heard my case after two or three turns he approachd me with the serious air of a physician and i thinking he had design to feel my pulse i offerd him my hand which he only shook very gently saying young man all the comfort i can give you is that you must buy your knowledge by experience as i and many others have done before you all advice is lost upon a person in love should i advice you to quit the enterprize i know you would not do it a halter or an eastindia voyage may do you service in case you are refused in a word whatever i advised you to you will certainly do the contrary however that you may be said to have lost your time in coming hither hasten to the young lady tell her in a franck cavalier way how things are with you give all the vent you can to your passion if it blows over you will be a wary man hereafter if it ends in wedlock any body will inform you of the consequences while the old gentleman was entertaining me with this lesson my head grew so dizy as if some invisible hand had turnd it round like a gigg so i left him abruptly and went directly to my lodgings to bed but to this day i cannot tell whether i went a foot or in a coach my head was in such a confusion the next morning finding my ideas better rangd i proposd to seize the first opportunity to let the lady understand the difficulties i struggled under upon her account but the nature of our visits was such that i coud not do it any otherwise than by letter thus when i had once broke the ice and that too with a fair prospect of making advances in the next place i gaind the maid by the usual methods that such creatures are renderd obsequious and under her conduct methoughts i saild prosperously on without the least rub to my supposd happiness tis true i was at a constant charge of presents treats and now and then a serenade according to the spanish customs but i remember at one of these midnight scenes of gallantry i saw something that gave me a great deal of uneasiness drawing up my musick under the ladys window besides her face which was at the casement wide open i saw the reflexion of a periwig move towards the corner of the window this made me vehemently suspect somebody had a better place in her affections than my self for there was no male kind belonging to the family her father and brother as she told me at other times being in spain to take care of some effects they expected by the flota from the west indies however i endeavourd to smother this impression of jealousy attributing the mistake to the circumstances of night candle light or some other false medium that might ground it so i was resolvd to take no notice of it at my next visit but it was not long before i met with another occasion of jealousy which coud not so easily be banishd out of my head sitting in the chocolate house a young gentleman was giving himself airs with a snuffbox which to my eye and it was my interest to observe it very narrowly appeard to be the very same i had some time before presented the lady with and as an aggravating circumstance in taking notice of the gentlemans periwig it had the same form with the reflexion i saw up in the ladys chamber window vid a flat top neither raisd nor parted in the middle which spoke it to be a piece of english furniture the sight of the snuffbox drew all my blood into my heart and left my pale cheeks to account for the consternation wherefore not able to contain my self had i kept my ground i flung out of the chocolate house not unobservd by the company to be in some disorder but when they lookd out of the window and saw me stand gazing in the middle of the street for my motion thither was purely animal having no thought whither i was going it encreasd their surprise however at three steps i was got again into the chocolate house and with a galliard air addressing my self to the gentleman with the snuff box sir said i i confirm the gift and may all sniffling fools that are in love be servd like me i allowd no time for a reply but bolting again into the street it came into my head that perhaps two snuffboxes might be so much alike as not to observe the difference without confronting em this thought gave me a curiosity to step into a toyshop where i desired to have a sight of the newest fashiond snuffboxes and when among others i saw above half a dozen exactly like that i had made the lady a present of a secret confusion spread it self over my soul to have given way to such suspicions the matyrdom accustomd by such like thoughts as these being the usual entertainment of persons in my condition and i having read in several moralists that there can be no true love without a mixture of jealousy which two rose proportionably and that jealousy was the greatest plague of human life these considerations i say made me struggle hard to throw off the tyranny i groand under and it happend very luckily for me that within a few days after the young lady was sent for into spain so that i had in election either to throw up all my expectations in france and follow her or moralize a week or two upon the disappointment and so recover my self again to my senses which i quickly did by spending my time in a treatise of algebra and fortifications as for the lady she parted without any reluctance and it mortifyd me sensibly that what i had made a study and business of was only her diversion and amusement but i kept my resolution never more to divert my self that way till i was effectually tramelld  and now i was preparing to visit italy where some of the irish forces were then employd and my company expected me but before i set out i had a mind to inform my self better of a certain report wisperd at st germains that in a little time king james would make another push and that a descent in england was certainly in agitation now i was at a loss how to be truly informd of this matter the kings fleet rendevouzing upon the coast of normandy and several battalions marching that way lookd something like a descent but this was not sufficient to convince me who knew that such alarms were often given upon a quite different score to what the generality of people had in view however the french laid strong colours upon this preparative first they gave out that they had bribed most of the english fleet so there woud be no danger from that quarter nor body to oppose the descent again king james set forth a solemn manifesto inviting all his subjects to rise and take arms granting an amnesty only to such as were specifyd in his proclamation and to put the last stroke to this masterpiece of policy the king himself was perswaded to appear at the head of some troops upon the coast of normandy the pill thus guilded was swallowd by every body i own i was my self charmd with the beauty of the project and it lookd so like the dawning of a restoration that i was resolvd to make interest with our general that i might not return to my company upon the borders of italy but rather accompany my prince and contribute more immediately to conclude the happy work while these matters were in agitation i had an invitation to see the palace and gardens of st clou from an old acquaintance whom i knew an officer upon the rhine but now was one of the duke of orleans secretaries this gentleman as we walkd in st clous gardens being inquisitive how i had spent my time since our last parting and how my affairs stood at present i gave him a short narration of my travels and actions telling him i was now a captain of foot and had a promise of a lieutenant colonels commission the next vacancy but that i designd to throw up my pretensions and accompany king james the gentleman surprizd at what i said i suppose sir said he you must have a fair prospect of a place at court to put it at ballance with a lieutenant colonels commission and then turning his discourse into raillery or perhaps says he you are so taken with the beautiful enclosures of normandy as to think a tour in that country will recompence all other losses no sir said i but i am in hopes that as i am one who have been useful to his majesty in several capacities so being near his person in the descent if it prove successful as no body seems to question so i shall be more in his majestys eye and in fairer prospect of climbing than if i were doing him service at a distance well sir said he i am sorry our former intimacy does oblige me to use the freedom of disabusing you of this vulgar error of most of king jamess subjects i cannot blame them for being desirous to return home but they are so infatuated in their zeal that way that they imagine every step our monarch takes tends immediately towards their masters restoration believe me old friend kings have commonly long heads and tis well known lewis xiv has led all europe through so many politick mazes for these forty or fifty years that he never lets any body know he is doing a thing till tis in a manner done all masters in politicks look one way and row another i own the preparatives upon the coast of normandy look like a descent but there are false attacks upon kingdoms as well as upon towns you are not ignorant that king william is now at the head of a powerful army in flanders and that our king is not so well provided there as he expected now if king william receives the reinforcement he expects out of england and scotland it will give him that superiority that france will not be able to make the last stand on that quarter so that tis no secret for us at versailles that all this alarm of a descent upon england is a meer blind to make a diversion and to hinder the transportation of the british forces but you jacobites and english are so ragingly disposd to give every thing a favourable turn towards king jamess cause that i have frequently observd there can scare be two men of war sent out of any port of france let it be towards the indies mediterranean or other places but you make a descent of it but as i insinuated sir i am glad i have the opportunity to set you to rights as to this affair that you may not risque a seeming promising fortune by catching a shadow the thoughts of having king james made such a tool of would not permit me immediately to be civil to the gentleman and return him thanks for the seasonable advice however after i had recollected my self i did my duty in that respect but the idea he gave me of his masters politicks left a deep resentment on my soul afterwards as i returnd to paris i ruminated upon this subject and i saw a thousand contradictions and improbabilities in the pretended descent the troops designd for this business was very few and the worst in france the kings own subjects were not to be employd unless a few straglers besides there were no transportships nor in fine any thing that lookd like an attempt to conquer three potent kingdoms king william had in a manner the whole kingdom in his design at his descent he also had the english army securd to him he brought over 15000 veterans in a fleet of 600 sail but this sham descent was destitute of all these advantages i dont question but lewis xiv as he proposed an end in this politick amusement so it answerd accordingly but as for poor king james i know no benefit either he or his friends reapd from it besides the fatigue of a norman progress and having all the jacobites in england imprisond find and plunderd so that to gain a few acres of land to france england must be exasperated to let all the laws loose upon both protestants and roman catholicks that were wellwishers to king james and yet though the french court obtaind their ends in one respect they sufferd from the hand of providence in another i woud not be thought to pry with too much curiosity into the hidden paths of providence otherwise i should be apt to judge that the destruction of the french fleet at the hague lookd somewhat like a judgment from heaven for amusing an unfortunate prince with a false prospect of happiness and yet that loss has been sometimes objected to king james as marrd upon his account so dextrous are the french in turning things to their own credit  after this you may well imagine i took a new resolution not to part with the prospect i had of making my fortune in the post i was in joyning company therefore with three or four more officers who belongd to the same army in which i servd we set out with all expedition i dont remember to have been better diverted upon the road since i first knew what it was to travel one of our company was a provincial and the very quintessence of wit and gaiety there was not the most trivial occurrence but he dexterously made use of it to divert us particularly at a small village within a days journey of lions the bailiff of the village coming to our inn to gather a kind of tax as it happend to be a day pitchd upon for that end for the relief of the poor the provincial gentleman being deputed the steward of our company fell into some discourse with the bailiff in the kitchin among other things the bailiff being mellow gave him to understand that though his mien and equipage was not extraordinary yet he was the chief man in the town and immediately represented the kings majesty so that if any of the company were of quality it was his business to show them that respect which was due to them the provincial had a good cue to give us a comical scene which all was contrivd upon the spot to drive away a deep melancholy from one of our company who had not spoke a word in two days with that he took the bailiff aside sir said the person we all attend here on the prince of  eldest son who is going to travel into italy had there been a garison here it ought to have been drawn up at his entrance and the keys of the town deliverd to him but since you are not so provided you may exert yourselves as much as you can i suppose you have musick in the town yes sir said the bailiff we have three violins a grand bass and a citherne do you never exhibit any plays says the provincial or other antick performance no replies the bailiff but we have a sport that comes very near it which we entertain the country with twice a year viz at easter and whitsunday and the parts are now fresh in the actors memory this will do says the provincial but see all things are ready to give the young prince the diversion immediately after supper because he durst not sit up very late as for the prologue wherein you are to address your selves to his highness i will furnish you with the method and form in which it must be spoke by the schoolmaster of the town now all this was carried on in privacy from us tell we were calld out one by one all excepting the chagrin gentleman who lay dozing in an two armd chair to whom we were instructed to pay a singular respect to during supper to blind the matter and now the whole village was drawn about the inn to have a sight of the young prince after supper all the tables and chairs were removd the bailiff enters with his staff and according to information given him kneels down and pays his respects to the supposd prince after him comes in the actors in their proper dresses and then the schoolmaster who opend the farce with a comical address made by the provincial officer which in every line hinted at some passage of the melancholy gentlemans life but with such an ambiguous turn and yet home to the man that it was an excellent piece of diversion to observe the variety of motions in the princes countenance who thought all to be witchcraft and inchantment the force being over and we left to our selves the provincial returning up stairs from conducting his troop to the door well gentlemen says he how do you relish your diversion et vous monsieur le prince if this will not bring you to your self you shall be dethrond at lyons and put upon a level with the rest of the company for he that pretends to put on a starchd reservd air upon a journey make himself a prince by his distance and so must either lose his dignity by being good humourd or pay the reckoning like a prince and that we have decreed shall be your choice the remainder of the journey the provincial gaind his end for either this comical accident was the occasion or the term of the gentlemans melancholy was expired for afterwards he put on a gay temper and proved tollerable company  we coud not content our selves with a single nights lodging in lyons that city is furnishd with too many rarities for the amusement of strangers not to partake of a little more of their money than any vulgar inn upon the road and as we none of us desired to carry more with us than what woud answer our travelling expences so we joynd in a resolution to divert our selves one week or ten days in that populous place i had a recommendation from paris to an irish clergyman who was a prependary here and a person of repute this gentleman woud oblige me to take a bed with him during my stay there which i was very unwilling to accept of upon account of my company however he said that would be no inconvenience since i might take my freedom with them all the day in case i woud favour him with my company half an hour before bed time in the evening i perceivd this goatly clergyman was of a different stamp to the generality of his countrymen and had a true idea of the french politicks for discoursing one night upon the subject of a restoration and finding i was a person he might deliver his mind freely to certainly said he never prince was more the game of politicians and fools than king james ii his own friends at home threw him out of his throne by their forward and indiscreet management and now he is bubbled with daily hopes of recovering it when in reality there was never any design to bring it about but king james will always be king james and judge every man honest who does but pretend to be so for pray gave me leave sir will it pass for a seizable story in future ages that lewis xiv should make war in order to restore james ii and keep above 40000 men in constant pay and never employ any of them that way twenty thousand horse would have laid the three kingdoms desolate in a few weeks but was there so much as one single dragoon employd that way was not king james forced to melt his canon and debase the coin with it whilst lewis xiv could send vast remittances to constantinople to support the turk were not 300000 men driven like sheep from the banks of the boyne for want of arms while what woud have furnishd a million of men were rusting in the magazines of france were not the highlanders constantly neglected and fed with nothing but promises till they were reducd from a victorious army to a troop of banditti have not the lives and fortunes of thousands in england payed very dear for these french politics by being encouragd to rise up and precipitate themselves into ruin by the motions of fleets and armies upon sham pretences of making descents i own sir i am transported when i find an opportunity to vent my self upon this subject had lewis xiv been streightned by the allies he might have some pretence of not affording so much assistance as otherwise he might but in the last war he was always victorious both upon the rhine and in flanders and if after the battle of steenheer fleurs landen and victories at sea besides the vast number of towns he reduced he did not think fit to employ his arms towards restoring king james i must take the liberty to think the war was not begun upon his account nor that it can be judgd the interest of france unless they act against their own interest which they are too wise a nation to do to have him reestablishd but all this sir i speak under the rose the honour of the french court is too much touchd by such reflections as these to suffer them to go unpunishd if i should be discoverd but i conclude from my worthy friend at paris who gave me your character that i might use any freedom in your company it may perhaps look like ingratitude in me to reflect upon a person by whose benevolence i possess this post i have in the church which does not only afford me a decent maintenance but the opportunity of obliging a friend but as i was a greater sufferer in ireland by giving too much into french projects so i look upon both this or any other kindness they can do me as a piece of restitution the frank and open satyr of this clergyman against the french conduct was very agreeable to my temper and i was not backward in seconding him in the same key but while we were entertaining our selves with these dismal reflections a servant knockd at the chamber door so the gentleman stepd to know his business and after about half a quarter of an hour returnd again i have been says he this fortnight engaged in a very troublesome affair which is like to have an ill consequence to the party concernd here is says he in town an englishman who has as he informs me been studying at a college of that nation of rome but for want of health is obligd to break off his studies to have the benefit of his own country air which the physicians prescribe to him as the only remedy to patch up his decaying constitution but the poor gentleman about three leagues out of town as he was steering his course towards paris and so homeward met with a very unfortunate accident walking on the road about half an hour before sun setting he was overtaken by a gentleman who kept pace with him and askd him among other things how far he designd to travel that night the englishman told him he was a stranger to the stages upon the road but he believd he should take the opportunity of the next inn for that it began to grow late the french man appeard very obliging in his conversation and told him he should have been glad of his company but that he was obligd to turn off on the right hand to a friends house whither he was going to divert himself a day or two they had not gone a hundred rood farther but he stopd and desired the englishman if he woud take a pinch of snuff and then lookd backward and forward with an ominous countenance he collard the englishman and drawing a small pistol out of his pocket without any farther ceremony he cryd ou la vie ou la bourse the business was quickly over and the englishman robbd of all his stock which was to the value of nine pounds english besides a little box of roman coin which were small pieces of money he kept for counters the footpad after he had got his booty alters his course and turns back towards lyons charging the englishman not to pursue him nor yet go forward till he saw him out of sight for if he did he woud certainly return upon him and deprive him of his life as well as his money there was no arguing the case and the surprize was so great that had there been any way of escaping this accident tis probable it woud not have occurrd at that time  as soon as the villain was out of sight the englishman loitered his time too and fro till it was dark and then returnd backward towards lyons hoping to meet either with credit or charity for a small sum to bear his charges home but not being able to reach the town that night he put in at a poor cabaret where he opend his dismal condition to the master of the house who being a very compassionate man promisd to entertain him gratis that night and conduct him to lyons the next morning his first application was to me i promisd to get him some relief in a day or two and the mean time i procurd him a lodging the next day coming up a street which leads to my house he accidently cast his eyes into a habadashers shop where he saw a person sitting upon a stool at the side of the counter chaffering for a hat his back and a silk bag his wigg was tied up in had so much the resemblance with the person that robd him that he stood gazing into the shop so long that the shopkeeper stepd to the door and calld to him if he would come in and please to buy any thing upon which the gentleman upon the stool turning himself about to look out of the shop he was known to be the same man who had committed the robbery and being in a consternation to see the person he had assaulted stand directly before the shop he threw down the hat he had in his hand and leaving his money upon the counter bolted out of the door but the englishman immediately alarmd the whole street and the rogue was taken and carried before a magistrate in the mean time i was sent for to assist the englishman in the narrative of this fact at first the footpad denied he ever saw the person and as for the money it coud not be sworn too but the box with little roman pieces being found upon him he coud not stand that proof besides it appears he can give no account where he was the evening of the robbery and the innkeeper upon the road is positive he was one of the persons which passd by his house that evening and to compleat all several persons who came in to see him out of curiosity deposd that he is very like the man by description has followd that road several years to conclude the englishman only stays in town now to be witness against this malhoneux hanging is certainly his doom but if other suspicions are made out of his being that noted offender who had infested the road for a considerable time it will be his fate to be broke upon the wheel however the englishman has recoverd most of his money but he will be forcd to expend it on charges but i will see to ease him in that point i was very much edifyd with this clergymans generous and christian temper in being obliging and endeavouring to do good to every body but now the time drew near that we were to leave lyons we had but one day more to stay and that the irish prebendary challenged to himself desiring i and my companions would accept of a small treat and dine with him we had every thing that was good in its kind but he woud not press his wine upon us for the churchmans character was not to be sacrificd to the soldiers appetite for he who urges the glass too far if he is not himself suspected of insobriety is certainly obnoxious to the immoral part of the ceremony  when an army is not upon action the camp is a tedious place to spend a mans time in but we who are subjects of great britain had some additional circumstances to make our time lie heavy upon our hands for my own part i always lookd upon my self as a banishd man and my thoughts always lookd homeward there are a great many charms in some sort of delusions especially if they flatter inclination it was now almost grown into a settled opinion with me that france would never make any farther attempt to restore king james than by way of amusement to drive on some other project and yet upon the least intimation of a descent my inclinations willingly carryd me over to another belief and of this my wavering temper i soon after gave a very remarkable instance my brotherinlaw informd me by letter from paris that there was a deep design laid to make us all happy in a little time so he advised me to make what haste i could for that now the sea was dividing and the children of israel were upon their march to the land of promise immediately i answerd the summons and gave into the advice by taking post and had the satisfaction to sup with my brother in five days time the very next day i went to st germains where i was glad to find every thing in such forwardness the king was preparing himself to go to callis where a considerable body of men were rendevouzing as twas generally believd in order to be transported into england where in and about london several persons were privately engagd and ready with arms to receive the king at landing in the town of st germains several persons disposd of their lodgings and furniture and turnd them into money for this expedition the day came that the king was to take leave of the queen and here i was resolvd to play the physiogminist and observe in their countenances whether i coud see any thing that lookd like a descent for i did not think it improbable but the king by this time might be so far habituated to the french politicks as to concur to be made a fool of and i was not the only one of that opinion that the king himself was let into the secret and knew very well his journey to callis and hovering about the coast was only to keep back ten thousand english and scotch whose presence that campaign would have done the french no kindness in flanders an old project and thus much i read both in the king and queens face for neither at parting nor afterwards did the queen signify that disturbance which she could not have conceald had the project been real i need not give the reader any farther account of this matter for it shewed it self upon the kings returning to st germains had this design been attended with no worse circumstances than harassing a monarch and fooling his subjects at paris and st germains it might here be regarded as an innocent stroke of politicks though very disobliging and improper but if we look on the other side the channel it had occasiond very cruel and barbarous consequences those unfortunate gentlemen who went upon the strength of this sham project to raise men provide arms and horses and attempt seizing of king williams person are dear instances of french policy for tis not to be supposd that church king sir william perkins sir john friend sir john fenwick or half a hundred of their adherents woud either have attempted the conquering of three kingdoms or been discoverd by any of the confederacy had not the french both encouragd em and left em in the lurch  it was observable after this peregrination that king james began to ride with a very loose rein and throwing the bridle in the neck managed his concerns with a great deal of indifference he saw clearly how fatal a thing it was for one king to fall into the hands of another and that under the plausible cloak of hospitality and royal protection a person might be lulld a sleep in the arms of an enslaver when princes are detaind prisoners they generally wear all the symptoms of their royalty besides that of freedom which cannot be distinguishd so much by the eye as the judgment and if some of king jamess subjects regarded their master with the same compassion at the castle of st germains as if he had been in the bastile there was very little difference to be found besides the largeness of the enclosure and if king james has not often been heard to let drop expressions as if he regarded himself no otherwise than a politick prisoner i am very much misinformd by those who constantly attended his person the denying him his own guards the number of spies he had upon all his actions the uneasiness he often shewd that he coud enjoy no privacy are circumstances that smell very strong of a prison however the pretence of protecting a person in distress was a noble sham and so well dressd up that the generallity neer lookd through the disguise the salary allowd him and frequent protestations of standing by him with unpolitick heads were lookd upon as undeniable proofs of lewis xiv sincerity but those who were better acquainted with french stratagems easily pulld off the vizard king james fell into the hands of france and was a rich opportunity in the french hands from whence they might raise a thousand advantages he was too great a treasure to be parted with only upon good terms a tool no less useful to make a diversion in time of war than to obtain a beneficial article at the conclusion of peace and if upon the foot of this maxim he was not thrown into one side of the scales at the peace of reswick when france coud have no other motive but being gratified with an equivalent for the disclaim of his title i shall own my self a stranger to the spirit and design of that treaty two things surprisd all europe upon that treaty the first was that france should be so inclinable to hearken to a peace after a war in which he had always been successful the other was that no regard shoud be had to king james not so much as to be admitted to speak though france pretended to have undertaken the war meerly upon his account and that his quarrel seemd to be the only circumstance to justify his conduct in the war the hopes of gaining time to work his ends upon spain will easily account for his forwardness in clapping up a peace and giving up more towns than he had been master of by the war for thus like a through pacd politician he humbled himself by little condescensions to the feet of the allies and sacrifices these excrescencies of his glory in hopes very speedily to make good all such deficiences by the larger acquisition of spain but nothing will answer the other part of peoples expectations lewis xiv had often made solemn protestations that as the war was principally undertaking to do right to k james so peace should not be made unless he was considerd and unless it were a few near the person of lewis xiv who were in the secret concerning the design upon spain there was not a man in france but who had a better opinion of their monarchs honour than to think he woud desert king james the seconds cause in so scandalous a manner as not to admit his plenipotentiaries to speak at reswick yes so undefensible was the conduct of france upon this head that they commonly ownd they were ashamd to look any that belong to the court of st germains in the face since all their lofty protestations for restoring king james ended in the selfended design of securing the spanish monarchy in the house of bourbon and thus poor king james had implicitely devoted himself to the french kings politicks first by suffering himself to be led blindfolded and after he had pulld off the veil though some will have it he died with the film upon his eyes caressd the opportunity and made it a principal ingredient among those misfortunes which he was in hopes to raise his merits hereafter and if he questiond the french kings sincerity he either durst not tell him or scrupled to publish his insincerity  these were the melancholly meditations with which the more discerning part of king jamess friends often entertaind themselves but great care was taken that no such language shoud reach the french court their honour was too nearly touchd to pass over such reflexions in that severity and remarkable punishment i took my self to be pretty cautious upon such like subjects yet upon this last pretended descent king james being informd that i had expressd my self very improperly upon the matter so as to blame the dilatory methods of france upon his account i was orderd to be prisoner in my lodgings but releasd after two days confinement with a threatening charge never more to reflect upon the french kings conduct i do not remember where i spoke the words or in what company but i believe i might make a loose upon their management who preferd the french to the kings own subjects upon this expedition adding withal that it lookd as if such persons had no design the project should take effect but this was enough to shew i had a jealous mind  about this time my company with the rest of the regiment was orderd down into flanders and having been a considerable time absent i was commanded to attend there my brotherinlaw who was one of the robe in his own country and unacquainted with the wars yet was moved with a certain curiosity to see a campaign and tho much against my sisters will resolvd to accompany me into flanders yet his principal motive was to make a halt at doway whither he had been invited some time before by a near relation belonging to the scotch college in that university we went together in the cambray coach and after a short stay at doway we proceeded on to the army which then was under that expert and resolute general the duke of luxembourg it was certainly a kind impulse of heaven that gave me my brother for a companion upon this occasion for an action happening soon after viz the famous battle of launden where it was my misfortune to be dangerously wounded i had the satisfaction of my brothers company and assistance during a tedious sickness which was the consequence of my wounds the french were no great gainers by this battle though they at long run routed the enemy and kept the field for besides the great loss they sustaind during the attack which far exceeded that of the allies the victory was not well pursud it was my post to reinforce a party of french fusiliers who were orderd to storm the intrenchmenent in which service a bullet was lodgd in my shoulder which besides disabling me on one side the loss of blood i sufferd was so great that i was not able to support my self but dropd down and had been trampled to death under my own mens feet had not a strong bodyd drummer hurried me out of the croud upon his back but he carried me off with such precipitation that one of the enemies troopers seeing me at a distance and thinking me to be somebody of consequence sprung after me upon his gelding and carried both me and the drummer into a village on the left hand of the attack where several squadrons were posted the commanding officer who was a colonel of the english guards finding i was of the british nation orderd me to be laid in a barn with a centinel to guard me and the surgeon of the regiment was immediately calld for to dress and tie up my wounds i had not been in that lodging above an hour but the village was attackd by the french gens darms and there was a tryal of skill between the flower of both the armies in which action the french at last were superior so i was releasd but it was equal to me in the condition i was in whose hands i fell into for i had so many fainting fits which succeeded one another that i expected not to survive any of em my brother whom i desired to go to loraine during the action had a mind to be a little nearer so remaind with the baggage but met not with me till the next day that we both went in a waggon to his lodgings in loraine where i was confind three months before i was able to travel  in this retirement it was that i began to be very serious a soldiers life has many occurrences which are not very reconcileable to strict morality to comprize my own character in relation to christianity i was neither a saint nor a devil the pains i felt were very sharp and hindred my rest my blood was heated and boiling up to a fever which being agitated with daily dressing my wounds it requird a skillful physician and a good regimen in the patient to stave off a fit of sickness my brother provd an excellent nurse and had he not usd a great deal of reason in keeping me from improper nourishment the game would quickly have been up with me i was also waited upon several times by a worthy clergyman who neglected not to give me penitent hints to have regard to the main concern i returnd him thanks and gave him to understand i would make use of him when there was more urgent occasion when i began to grow a valetudinarian and that my wounds began to heel up i had the liberty to drink loraine beer which is much celebrated in those parts as yet i had drank nothing but tissans and such like decoctions which being very mild upon the palate did not give content to the inward dryness and thirst i felt by the loss of blood but i quickly repented this indulgence of tasting the beer i took such deep draughts that i relapsd into a dangerous and most violent fever in which i acted all the parts of a dying man besides making my exit i was delirious above three days which though it was but a melancholly sight in it self yet i behavd my self so various in my rambling discourse that it occasiond no small diversion to such as were present and had no immediate concern in my welfare i besiegd towns rallyd scattered forces accepted challenges wandered over the alpes and passd over several seas without ships i was in the orchard at the boyne under the walls of london derry and diverted with the fine rode to lions and what i thought i should never have in my head again some amorous ideas though very faint ones discoverd themselves and i was heard to talk of snuffboxes periwigs and spanish ladies my brother who heard me and to whom i had discoverd that intrigue burst out into a laugh when he heard me name snuffboxes for this was enough to make him believe the passion was not dead in me which he horded up to rally me with  during this entertainment which i gave the spectators my brother had sent for the priest but i was then in a very improper state to settle accounts in relation to the next world however the gentleman approaching my bed and calling upon me to hear whether i could return a rational answer he bid me lift up my heart to god and call upon my redeemer but i as i suppose taking him to be one of my sergeants bid goddn him for a rascal why had he not been with me before for the colonel had orderd a review shoud be made at eleven a clock the priest shruggd up his shoulders sprinkled me with holy water and retird to the window where my brother and the physician were attending my fate when my delirious fit was over which was about an hour afterwards i turnd my eyes towards the other side of the room where i saw three persons leaning in the window with their backs towards me and not being entirely recoverd from my delirious state i fancied my self a prisoner at constantinople and that my brother the physician and the priest were three mutes sent to strangle me but in an instant or two i returnd to my self and discoverd whose hands i was in this was a terrible attack and the enemy had made such a breach that i desired to wisper a word with the priests telling him i woud capitulate next morning about eight a clock afterwards i recoverd very leisurely and took great care not to be too bold with the lorain beer my phician advised me not to remove from that place till i was perfectly establishd assuring me there was not better air in all the netherlands i followd his advice for i coud not think him prompted to give it me through avarice for he was so very moderate in his fees that i thought my self obligd at our parting to make him a handsome present my brother who was a man of letters and very curious in his enquiries had a good opportunity during our stay here to get acquainted with several learned men of this university one of the first account was dr martin an irish clergyman who had a lively genious and was also a person of great reading in the mean time my sister at paris began to grow impatient for her husband but she bore his absence the better when she understood how useful he had been to me during my sickness however we made bold to trespass a little further by taking a turn round the country it was not a journey entirely of pleasure for i was obligd to go to amsterdam there being a stop put to the interest of my mony so i was resolved to see that matter rectifyd so having obtained a pass from the allies under the quality of two scotch merchants we began our journey when i came to amsterdam i was very much surprizd to understand the odd occasion of my money being stopd it seems a countryman of mine who had fishd out something of my concerns and saw me fall at the battle of launden had counterfeited a deed in the nature of a will which imported that all my effects in amsterdam were left to him he being my brother and demanding it as his due the banker had the deed perusd by several persons it had a great appearance of being authentick and my hand was so inimitably clapd to it that when compared with what was certainly known not to be counterfeit twas impossible to discover the difference now the banker desired this pretended brother of mine to have patience till he had an account from paris whether or no i was dead and the general report being that i was killd at launden this was the occasion that the money was neither paid to my correspondent nor to my sham brother this point once cleard i was resolvd to find out the person who had personated my brother that i might bring him to condign punishment as also to clear a suspicion i had that my servant had a hand in it for otherwise i thought it impossible one that was a stranger should know whose hands my money was in in the first place i cunningly interrogated my servant at a distance and found enough by his countenance that he was not entirely innocent however not being able to prove it upon him i in the next place made a diligent search after my shambrother for he had told the banker at his last visit that he woud return again in seven or eight days and six of em were now expired the gentleman was as good as his world he came to the banker with a good assurance and demanded both principal and interest i was then at my lodging but being sent for i was strangely surprisd to see the clerk of my company who was also a sergeant metamorphosd into my brother he shrunk two inches lower at the sight of me but dissembling the matter i am glad to see thee alive sergeant said i for i took it for granted you were killd at the battle of launden and i replyd the impudent villain thought you had otherwise i had not been here but if you please noble captain to walk into the next tavern and give me leave to wait upon you i will discover to you the occasion of my coming to amsterdam my fears as to my money being now all over i complyd with the rascal and went along with him but he dressd up such a narrative in favour of his good intention and strengthend it with such plausible circumstances that he and my servant whom he confessd to be one of the party had no other intention but to get the money out of the bankers hands for the use of my relations for that they had reason to suspect i had made no will and so no body woud have a right to demand the money now though this stratagem was very probably all a fiction yet it wrought so much with me that i did not prosecute either of em for as i was acquainted with both their friends in scotland so i had some regard for them and dismissed them to go home or whither they pleasd not thinking it safe to entertain persons who had been involved in such mysterious practices  my affairs being settled at amsterdam we had the curiosity to see antwerp which is a city where a stranger may employ his time very agreeably for a longer term than we coud conveniently spend there we lodgd at a house where an english nobleman also had an apartment he had been in that city about two months kept a handsome equipage was very young and a well bred gentleman of great value among the ladies and had he been able to support the character he bore at first appearance here it would have convinced the world there is very little difference between a footman and a nobleman where neither sense nor money are wanting to carry on the resemblance i must anticipate the dismal exit of this unfortunate gentleman which happend not till about two years afterwards while he was in his splendour at antwerp and coud answer every bodies expectations as to money matters it was not any mans business to pry into his pedigree but when his conduct began to be observd and taken notice to be full of shuffling and demurs in the payment of small bills there was a jealousy spread about the town that the lord g would prove a cheat so his credit began to sink in the shops but it held up still among the ladies where a handsome personage and a charming tongue is often ready money but it was not long before he began also to be suspected from this quarter his visits were not so frequent his treats much more sparing and especially one lady who was his greatest admirer and most capable to make him happy on all accounts was obligd to expose him and make this phantom of nobility evaporate in the frequent visits he payd this lady he had observd a very handsome diamond ring upon her finger which was no less remarkable for its uncommon form than intrinsick value at a low estimate being judgd to be worth 80l sterling the gentleman had often thrown out a great many compliments upon it which usually tended towards extolling the ladies judgment and fancy in the choice and ordering of that jewel for she wanting to her self let him and every body else know it was a thought of her own the gentleman in the midst of one of his panegyricks upon this little charmer beggd the favour of the lady that he might borrow it for a day or two till he had shewn it a jeweller for he designd to have one made in the same form the lady was not a little pleasd that her fancy was like to become a pattern to the town willingly drew it off her finger not in the least suspecting any trick for as yet his fame was untouchd i think he made two or three visits without returning the ring pretending the workman was dilatory in taking a pattern but tis supposd he wanted time to prepare himself for a flight and brush off with the ring however none of these suspicions enterd the ladies head he not being her aversion about three or four days after a lady visiting her told her the english nobleman had parted with his chariot pawnd his best suit of cloaths and that his credit was not only very low but it was supposd he woud in a day or two be obligd to decamp or take up his quarters in a jail tis obvious to imagine that the first thing that came into the ladies mind upon this occasion was her diamond ring but as she confessd afterwards to a friend the compassion she had for the gentlemans circumstances had so large a place in her heart that she does not remember to have had any concern upon her in relation to the jewel from whence we may gather that evil fate that hangs over some persons heads for had but this unfortunate person pursud the interest he had with that lady whilst he was in flourishing circumstances he might easily have carried it to the non plus ultra and became master of 15000 as she her self ownd when she recoverd her passion and began to think calmly however the diamond ring was not to be neglected for though she had been willing to have parted with her interest in it to succour the gentleman in distress it was too large an alms and would perhaps have been judgd by the world rather an instance of her forwardness and indiscretion than of her charity her friends before advisd her to demand the ring which she did that evening but understood he had pawnd it for the full value upon which she was though much against her inclination obligd to arrest him and had him clapd up in prison but however she was a very kind jailor it is a custom having the force of the law in the netherlands that when a debtor is kept in prison it shall be at the charges of the creditors in which also they observe a kind of proportion that a gentleman is to be allowd like a gentleman and a mechanick is to be content with a smaller allowance the lady complyd very willingly with the custom and her prisoner being reputed a person of quality it was an excellent disguise to show her liberality but afterwards being weary of the charge and finding by the information of several englishmen that passd thro antwerp that her prisoner was not the person he pretended to be but a meer sharper and knight of the post she slackend in her charity and gradually brought him down to a common allowance and at last dischargd him his life after that was a meer romance he first went into gaunt here he took up a large apartment of four or five rooms well furnishd which he sold after a fortnight taking an advantage of the landladys abscence with the strength of this plunder he made a figure for two or three months at brussels where he fought a duel with hs an english gentleman this accident drove him from brussels but finding he was not secure in the spanish flanders he crossed the lines spent the remainder of his substance at lisle and he directed his course to dunkirk from whence tis said he designd to take shipping for england but here he finishd his misfortunes as i was informd upon the spot by a merchant who resided in that town and saw his exit this english merchant walking upon the key according to custom observd a young gentleman walking in a melancholy posture and thinking he knew him though the poor dress he was in would not suffer him to make a positive judgment however he stept up towards him and upon a nearer view was convincd he was the person he took him for this merchant had been acquainted with him at antwerp when he bore the character of an english nobleman and lived with great splendor the gentleman more dashd as i suppose to jump upon one who had heard of his tricks than for the meanness of his circumstances told the merchant he was an unfortunate man and things were now so desperate with him that he had no way left to relieve himself but by a halter the merchant having a charitable regard for his circumstance though he knew him to be a very undeserving object told him he woud provide him with a lodging and diet till he had a return of money the gentleman answerd frankly he expected no returns nor did he know of any body that woud assist him nor youd he make any demands this account encouragd the merchant to be more charitable so he conducted him to an inn desiring the master of the house to furnish him with diet and lodging till further orders two days after the merchant coming to visit him about ten in the morning when they imagind he was still in bed a servant being sent up to call him he was hangd upon the beam in one corner of his chamber the merchant had a great curiosity to find out the pedigree of this romantick gentleman but youd get no authentick account i told him i was informd at antwerp that he was footman to a person of quality and that he had robbd his master and fled into the netherlands to escape justice which made him always unwilling to think of returning home  the peace of reswick was a ratifying king jamess abdication and enrolling in the french archives what was before declard in the convention at westminster it was now no time to expostulate with lewis xiv why he had concluded a peace without mentioning the person upon whose account he had began the war the titular king of st germains and the real one at whitehall were not irreconcileable and the continuation of the pension was regarded as an unquestionable mark of the french kings sincerity and the unthinking crew spoke well of the master that crammd them never dreaming that they were but fattend for slaughter and that under the disguise of succouring their persons he might prey upon their interest the spanish monarchy was what france had in their eye by the peace of reswick and the restoring of king james was decreed to be the motive of a war when they came to a rupture upon the decease of the king of spain lewis xiv diverted europe with a fresh scene of politicks he convincd em that what he had done at reswick was a meer decoy to gain time and breath and bring greater designs about the allies saw clearly he had been jugling with two sham treaties of partition but was underhand working to engross the whole and that the son and father at st germains were always to serve to the same purposes and stand in the first line of his manifesto to make the war plausible and raise factions in the territories of greatbritain this was fact for no sooner were things ready in spain and flanders but king james ii departed this life which opportunity the french monarch snatched and in a studied royal transport exalted the young striplings expectations at st germains by a solemn protestation that he woud never sheath his sword till he saw him upon the throne of his ancestors by which i suppose he understood no more than that titular inauguration which was settled upon his father at the peace of reswick for had not the affair of the spanish monarchy prompted france to this generous declaration in favour of the son tis highly probable the gallick sword woud have rusted in the scabbard as it was lockd up by the treaty of reswick nor had it been now drawn but upon a more beneficial provocation than restoring king james for if it was the interest of france to let the father sit down quietly with the title nothing coud supervene to give the son the reality upon this basis the war was renewed again on both sides and the juggle was kept on with the court of st jamess and great pains were taken by the emissaries of france to buoy up king jamess friends both at home and abroad that lewis xiv was sincere and woud exert himself sooner and later in their cause  the world needs not be put in mind what service king james ii troops did to france during the war every action spoke their bravery but the grand reform that was made upon the peace was a sorry recompence for their service france woud not entertain em and a halter was their doom if they returnd home this was an odd way of obliging king james i speak not so much upon my own account though i was reducd at the same time because i had a sufficiency elsewhere to keep me from starving but it was but a melancholly sight to behold poor men strolling upon the road not knowing which way to direct their course and begging alms through those towns in which a little before they had triumphd in victory but the rod is often thrown away and burnt after the child is whipd upon this occasion it was that i took leave of mars resolving to make use of this interval of peace to satisfy an old curiosity to see england a place as yet i never had beheld some acquaintance i had contracted at dunkirk made me willing to take shipping there besides the hopes i had of decoying a pleasant gentleman for my companion and upon my arrival i found him in a good humour so we set sail about three in the morning and came under north foreland point about seven the same day the master of the vessel though he was an old coaster was not willing to trust himself among the flats in a dark moon so we lay at anchor all night and in the morning by peep of day the wind being pretty favourable we weighd and pursud our voyage up the river but being a little too soon for the tyde we struck upon a sand bed and obligd to remain ther till the rise of the water i was all alone in the masters cabin when this accident happend but being very intent upon a book i was not sensible whether we movd or stood still a lady who was with the rest of the passengers upon deck coming hastily down sir said she do you sit quietly here and we are struck upon a sandbed madame said i i did suppose such a thing but the tyde will cast us off you supposd such a thing said she why sir we shall certainly be drownd come let us to prayers i was not very much accustomd to the sea yet i imagind there could be no great danger as long as we had a flowing tyde and that it did not blow a storm had the water been ebbing and a storm ensud upon it tis probable our ship being none of the strongest might have been beaten to pieces among those sands however i stepd upon deck to see how things went there was a profound silence every where the passengers were scatterd here and there looking one at another but not speaking a word the master was walking with his arms across without fear but not without concern in his countenance i askd him how he came to be mistaken in the tyde he answerd accidents would happend sometimes but there was no danger then running on in a strain of sailors cant he said god was at sea as well as at land that the lord woud protect em if they did but put their trust in him and love him as they ought in the middle of this moral lesson the ship was gently wafted off the sands by the tyde and sails being abroad spread the ship saild merrily along twas surprizing to observe the alteration in every bodies countenance the women began to laugh and giggle the men began to rally one another for want of courage the sailors began to raise their note higher and higher and the master of the ship turnd his sermon into a volley of oaths and curses against his crew and thus in an instant from a profound silence we recoverd our selves again to noise and hurry that day brought us to gravesend where we took boat and so arrivd safe at london though i was not very well pleasd with those small boats people usually pass in from gravesend to london for i understood they were often overset by sudden gusts of wind which blow from the shoar  london is a place above my description and though i lost no time the six months i remaind there to view what curiosities were to be seen yet tis probable many things worthy of observation escaped my diligence i took a particular care not to make my self public but passd at my lodgings under disguise of a merchant yet abroad i acted the marquess not to be deprivd of the means of introducing my self into the best of company i found they were much divided in england as to the french politicks some were of opinion that lewis xiv was serious in king jamess cause but these were persons who had no notion of foreign affairs and judgd of matters according to their first appearance for others who had studied the interest of nations and how their pretensions he in regard of one another had no notion of the french kings sincerity either towards king james or any other prince he dealt with and there is not one instance i have mentiond in these memoirs in order to demonstrate the infatuated state of the court of st germains but i heard it frequently urgd to the same purpose by the most intelligent persons as well friends as enemies to king james while i was diverting my self at london i receivd a letter from paris that there was a lieutenant collonels place vacant which i might easily be promoted to in case i woud be at the trouble to make use of what interest i might reasonably command but i quickly understood that by my interest was meant my money so employing my amsterdam stock that way i might very probably by a french piece of civility live to want both my money and a commission i returnd a thousand thanks to my friends for their diligence in my absence but told em i had rather wait till another war broke out and their would be more choice of promotions and i might please my self because i was somewhat curious what regiment i engagd in  it was a tedious journey to go into scotland by land otherwise i was very much disposed to see my own country once more and apprehending besides there might be some danger upon account of being engaged in the french service during this late war i laid these thoughts aside and contented my self with making a small tour twenty or thirty miles distance from london in which progrination i saw windsor greenwich hamptoncourt and some other places of note but in one of these jaunts i had like to have paid very dear for my curiosity the neighbourhood of london is much infested with highwaymen and if a gentleman rides not with pistols tis very probable he will be attackd unacquainted with these customs the day i went to windsor i had in company with me an irish gentleman we made use of nothing but common hacks nor had any other arms but our swords about the middle of honslow heath we met two gentlemen well mounted who passd by us unsuspected but turning suddenly upon us again with each of em a small pistol cockd they very civilly demanded our money gentlemen said i i am a stranger no gentlemen said they come quickly deliver what you have we are in a publick road and cant stand arguing but finding us a little dilatory they whipd the bridles from our horfes cut our garths and so dismounted us and so i and my companion were very dexterously stripd of what they found in our pockets which was all i had about me but my friend reservd two or three guineas in his fob when they had finishd their business they gallopd different ways cross the heath and left us like a couple of asses to drive our horses to the next town and carry the saddles under our arms but by the invention of our garters and some other such like tackle we halterd our steeds till we coud refit our selves better what we lost was but a trifle and twas done in so small a space of time that appeard like a dream or passing thought it was happy either for us or them that this happend in the morning when our heads were cool for had they attackd us when warmd up with good liquor i believe i should have had little regard to those popguns they threatened us with when we came to the next town and gave the people an account of our disaster the landlord of the inn askd us if we had ever been upon that road before and we informd him this was the first time then said i have authority to enroll you as freemen upon the small fee of each a bottle of wine and this i take to be no imposition because i am placd here in a convenient part of the country to advance a small sum to such as are robbd of all they have and cannot pursue their journey so gentlemen if that be your condition i have a couple of guineas ready for you which i will lend upon honour but in case it be not a clean robbery what you have conceald from the diligent highwaymen is the landlords fee as far as each a bottle of wine this merry landlord i thought was very conveniently posted to divert people after their misfortunes we never went about to examine him whether his demand was customary or only a piece of shire wit and an extemporary instance of his prolifick genius but sat down and made our selves most immoderately drunk the landlord discanted very copiously upon the ancient and modern practise of robbing upon the road and seemd very much inclind to lessen the crime formerly said he no body robbd upon the road but base scoundrel fellows but now tis become a gentlemanlike employment and young brothers of very good families are not ashamd to spend their time that way besides the practise is very much refind as to the manner theres no fighting or hectoring during the performance but these gentlemen approach you decently and submissive with their hat in their hand to know your pleasure and what you can well afford to support them in that dignity they live in tis true says he they often for form sake have a pistol in their hand which is part of their riding furniture but that is only in the nature of a petition to let you know they are orphans of providence just fallen under your protection in a word demanding money upon the road is now so agreeably performd that tis much the same with asking an alms the poor beggar woud rob you if he durst and the gentleman beggar will not rob you if you will but give a decent alms suitable to his quality i thought my time so well spent to hear this landlord plead in favour of padding that i told my companion i had often known the time that i woud have willingly have parted with more money than i was stripd of upon the heath to have some melancholly thoughts driven away by such a merry companion  the time drawing near that i prescribed to my self to remain in england we were now advisd to return by the short sea which we performd without any let or remarkable accident i have observd towards the beginning of these memoirs that the war begun in 1688 was undertaken in defence of cardinal fastenberg to the electorate of cologn the next war was for the mornarchy of spain but the restoration of king james was always a material article and a very useful circumstance of the war i need not acquaint the reader how france was reduced in this last bloody war her best troops ruind incapable to win a battle every campaign carryd two or three of their best towns the nation dispirited and credit sunk and nothing but a dismal scene of poverty and misery and yet in the midst of all this misery as the spanish beggars are said to strut about in their cloak and bilboes at their side so this gasping monarch had the assurance not only to talk of making a descent but actually equippd a small nimble fleet with a body of men and persuaded the pretender to go upon the foolish errand as if he youd have any prospect of conquering the three kingdoms who was in danger every moment of having his capital sackd and himself turnd out of his throne coud there be a more romantick undertaking or more unintelligible in all its circumstances than the pretenders descent upon scotland the deluded youth was carryd to the coast of scotland but upon what design is a secret to this day he was made to believe at his departure from dunkirk that scotland was dissatisfyd to a man upon account of the union and that it woud be an easie matter to conquer england by putting himself at the head of a scotch army but when he desired to be landed to put the project in execution the french general told him he had orders from his great master that there should be no landing now whether this was part of the old game and only in order to make a diversion or to surprize edinburgh castle where most of the specie of scotland was said to be lodgd at that time is various alledgd by men of speculation that there was no appearance of succeeding in the main is pretty plain from many circumstances england with their allies at that time were in a capacity to spare 50000 men against which a few poor scrambling highland foot woud but have made a very bad resistance i am not willing to think france would send princes a pilfering or that the pretender was designd to steal the money out of edinburgh castle a stratagem much more decently committed to some partisan or three or four dunkirk privateers so i think it more suitable to the prudence and for the honour of the french court to mention this designd descent only as a diversion to amuse and employ the british troops at home that they might not annoy the enemy in flanders but how this affair will be reconcild to that affection and friendship lewis xiv seemd to have at that time for the pretender i am at a loss with the rest of mankind to account for since it was exposing him to the greatest of hazards for a trifle and throwing up the cause at once had he fallen into the hands of his enemies and tis not the least miracle of his life that he escapd them i was invited to have gone abroad with the pretender upon this expedition being than free but the project appeard to me so full of inconsistencies i have frequently since enlargd upon my own politicks and foresight in that affair  thus much i must say for the jacobite party never were men more baffled and rallied oftner upon projects or hopes but the unwholesome diet never turn into the substance but infects the body with peccant humours which now and then are dischargd by phlegbotomy and then they turn to a gangreen by amputation jacobitism i speak of it in relation to the strong hopes they have of succeeding by a french power is an uncurable distemper i have often wonderd to hear persons otherwise of great penetration and sense grow constantly delirious upon this topick the wagers that have been lost upon that very prospect woud have purchasd him a little kingdom time has opend a great many peoples eyes but there is a set of men who are enslaved to the french projects and so far infatuated that nothing can cure them if fooling him with sham descents neglecting all opportunities of assisting if banishing him excluding him by solemn articles will not satisfy em as to this particular tis my opinion they woud not be convincd if they should see france chaffering for his head and finish the twenty eight years old politicks with 100000l being what is set upon it there is no extraordinary difference between disposing of another mans right and disposing of his person there was a time when france gloried in the ostentatious title of being the assylum of distressd monarchs and i remember i was once disposd to have almost deifyd their monarch upon that score but when i took the frame of his politics and examind every wheel and spring by which they moved i rescued my self from the prejudices i had been nursd up in and though i always pursud the same end yet i was a constant enemy to their method which i was convincd were all directed another way and that a restoration upon a french footing was a chimerical project and that if it had taken effect by their arms england must have had another doomsdaybook and have sufferd once more under an arbitary discipline more dreadful than that of william the conqueror from whom england has been struggling to retrieve her self ever since i had formerly made a resolution with my self not to hearken to a loveintrigue but upon a prospect of putting an end to such amusements the long time i had been out of the army gave me several opportunities to make enquiry after a person who was capable of making me happy in that respect i took a singular care when any thing was offerd that way to consult my reason more than my passions and had fixd before my eyes the perplexd state i livd in those weeks i held a correspondence with the spanish lady tis a dangerous practice when a person shuts his eyes among precipices and neglects consultation where the choice is hazardous there livd in paris a collonels widow neither very young nor very handsome the intimacy i had with her husband who was killd in italy brought me first acquainted with her her discreet carriage in a great variety of intricate circumstances had often charmd me there was no difficulty in a marriage state but she had struggled with it a morose husband the death of an only child the gripes of poverty when her consort was in the army and lavishd away his income were great tryals in which she always triumphd and wore a stoical constancy without any reservedness she had a large pension allowd her for life upon account of her husbands merits who had done great service during the wars under these circumstances i attackd rather like a judicious than a passionate lover the method i took with her was quite different to what i observd in pursuing my spanish mistress there was no balls treats nor serenading we both knew the world too well either she to expect or i to offer her such entertainments in a word our whole discourse when i visited ran upon oeconemy and morals it was not long before she understood my meaning and that my repeated visits tended towards marriage she alledgd several things to divert me from it that she was tired with being an officers wife which obligd either to a rambling method of living or to labour under great inconveniences and that i perhaps might not make the best of husbands that state being a lottery full of blanks i had nothing more pertinent to alledge upon this occasion than to assure her that during my absence in the army she should never be unprovided with what would make her easie and for being a good husband i gave her all the assurances that such a matter was capable of and at the same time made her the compliment that in case any misunderstanding should ever happen between us her approvd conduct and discretion would certainly declare me guilty in conclusion i put on the trummels and never questiond but i had made the most prudential choice that any person could do but there is something in womankind which can never be found out by study or reflection tis only experience that can school a husband and can give him a true idea of that mysterious creature for in less than twelve months my thousand pounds which i had so carefully kept unbroke at amsterdam was all disposd of my soldiers pay being my only subsistance for myself and family my wife reserving her own income for pinmony my credit very low my days very irksome upon many accounts and i who had hitherto appeard with assurance in company because of my moneymerit was now neglected for every tradesman began to smell out my poverty i am of opinion it would do posterity no kindness if i shoud discover how i came to be ruind by a prudent wife for no body woud credit me if i should advise em to trust no woman living so as to give her full scope upon an opinion of her conduct i took my self to be as wise upon this head as any man living it had been my study above twenty years there is a secret devil in every woman which is often conjurd down by a husbands temper and though many men may pass for bad husbands by their morose carriage tis less prejudicial than that indulgence which few women have discretion to make use of my wifes first husband was represented as not very kind to her whereas his less obliging temper was the effect of his judgment and a touch of skill he had in managing a woman whom caresses woud have exalted into impertinence c  i would not be understood so upon this subject as if we lived unhappily as to our affections no we regarded each other as two inseparable companions not only whose interest it was not to be at variance but we really did affectionately love each other i coud not so much blame her as my self for if children servants c make a loose from their duty who are chiefly to be blamd but such gentle and restraining methods did not curb em but let em feel they had reins in their hands thus hamperd in wedlock i had nothing to give me ease but that three parts of mankind were in the same if not in a much worse condition however to make our circumstances tollerable for the future i perswaded my consort to abridge her self of some superfluous charge which we coud not well bear any longer first we disposed of our coach and then our acquaintance was reformd of course by degrees a multitude of modish visitors dwindled away into two or three formal matrons which at last ended in a decent apartment in a monastery where she spent her time agreeably enough when i was in the camp hitherto the main matter which palld all my joys was the impossibility of a restoration which now was much lessend by the concurrence of domestick evils and the cares which attend a married state yet when i seriously reflected upon the conduct of france in regard of king james and the pretender i have often observd my self to sweat and fret my self into a violent fever with the very thoughts of it but i never was so sensibly touchd upon this head as after the battle of malplacket which was followd with the surrender of several towns so that there was nothing but the poor barrier of landrecy left to save the capital and by consequence the kingdom of france the french king having now playd away all his leading cards was now put to his trumps he attempts the treacherous and needy ministers with long bags of louisdors which were all ineffectual when his arms coud do no more  tis fresh in every true britains memory what strange methods were taken to bring about the peace which quickly after ensued i shall only mention as much of that affair as is requisite to make it manifest that france had no consideration for the pretenders interest during that treaty the war was begun upon account of the spanish monarchy france was reducd to the last extremity and could hold out no longer now the consequence shoud have been for france to have surrenderd up king philips title but on the contrary it was securd to him and by what any one can conjecture on the equivalent that the pretender should be banishd france and herafter neither directly nor indirectly be assisted by force nay so eagerly was france bent upon this project of securing spain france and neglecting the pretender that tis well known he refusd to be concernd with those in england who were willing to restore the pretender i shall not pretend to dive into the late queens secrets and how she was disposd that way tis well known she was not over real for the hanoverian succession and that the pretenders interest was the only one in competition with it but where was the french zeal for the pretender when he had the generalissimo and his arms the secretary the treasurer c all at his devotion and if the pretender was not actually restord at that juncture the remora coud be no where but on the french side who had a longer reach in their politicks than the restoration of the pretender they saw clearly bringing that about woud create a civil war in england and be an occasion of renewing in germany now their business was a sudden peace and a quiet possession of spain and this is the real spirit of politics that governd the french at the peace of utrecht  this kind of management so disconcerted all the pretenders party who then governd the queen that they flew all in pieces astonishd not to find the french insist upon the pretenders right as they had laid the design they inform against one another and by their unseasonable and discontinued animosities threw the queen into an agony of fear which afterwards usherd in the agony of death in the mean time france smild at the disorder and huggd themselves in the noble project of having lost every battle in that bloody war and yet obtaind what they fought for as they had always been victorious whilst the poor pretender was so little considerd by france that tho the ministry was ready to assert his title yet france wavd it and subscribd to his banishment least that affair should ruin the main project  but what i am in the next place going to observe will make clear that france was not only unwilling to be active in assisting the pretender but that they were scrupulous upon the point and made it their business to disswade him from any such attempt i remember i was my self in lorain when the news of the queens decease was brought the pretender by a servant of lp he was no stranger to the interest he had just before with the ministry who still were most of em in power a ship lay ready for him to waft him over but he was arrested in his journey by the french kings orders and threatened by mt with the bastile if he did not return forthwith to lorain otherwise considering the afteracts of the gentlemen then in play he would very probably been at st jamess several days before king george left his palace at hanover this was so shocking a treatment from the grand protector of distressd monarchs that the queen mother then at chalonois said this was a key to all the mask politics which had been acting 27 years and the very thought of it threw her into such a consternation that she has never since recoverd it i know tis pretended that lewis xiv was now grown more scrupulous than formerly he had been in sticking to the letter of treaties i shall not dispute whether passing through the country without assisting the pretender coud be wrested by any logick to be acting in his favour but if lewis xiv was scrupulous he ought to have been so when he grew nearer his end for tis pretended by those who are willing to represent him as always a friend to king james that in despute of the articles of utrecht he came into the measures of the duke of ormond lord bolinbroke the earl of mar c and had not death in the mean time taken him off woud have furnishd em with all things necessary to have made a head against king george this i say is confidently reported by lewis xivs admirers but then they will have the inconsistancy to account for why he shoud not scruple to raise an army to succour the pretender who a little before scrupled to let him passd with a couple of servants through his country for my own part i am enclind to believe he never was so much his friend but died as he coud a juggler and that if he signd any thing in form of the late insurrection twas in one of his delirious fits which were not infrequent in his latter years if the regent be a just interpreter of his actions  and to come home to the present time has not france still the same regardless dispositions towards the pretender are they not ready to enter into any engagement whatever to stand by the articles of utrecht to the greatest nicety i know it has been aprised about that france was in the design against king george but as the regent replyd very pertinently to the earl of stairss memorial there needs no more convincing proof that france has not been meddling than to understand that both in scotland and england the rebels have been destitute both of arms and money the customhouse officers of greatbritain have no authority to search french ships as they go out of their own ports and had it not been an easy matter to have sent what arms they pleasd into scotland what occasion was their for the pretender to have sculkd so long upon the shoar and stolen privately out of one of their havens if the regent had encouragd him  it was no secret to me and several others above twenty eight years ago that france was never sincere in this affair but as their projects came nearer to a conclusion they took less care to conceal the secret till they had a prospect of settling the spanish monarchy in the house of bourbon they were loud and high in their demands concerning king james but the hopes they conceivd that way made em clap up a peace at reswick and lay king jamess interest to sleep when the spanish project was ripe and the wealth of the indies ready to drop into their lap and that they were actually to be put into possession of it the allies were amused with two partition treaties and the pretender sacrificd to the same politicks at the treaty of utrecht yes he was neglected despised banishd out of france forcd out of lorain a free state threatend at avignon a sanction never yet violated and now he and his adherents are preparing themselves to be thrust into the jaws of the turk unless the regent out of pity deliver him up in hope of the 100000l and finish the character of succouring distressd monarchs by being the occasion of losing his head on towerhill rather than being impaild at constantinople  but before i dismiss this matter i am to account for several things which will argue the court of st germains guilty of the greatest ingratitude unless they acknowledge the endless obligations they lie under to france has he not fed a distressed people almost twenty years and that two in a royal and princely manner did he not entertain above 15000 irish troops who were dismissd ireland by the treaty of limerick has he not constantly payd all the respect imaginable to the court of st germains promisd king james upon his deathbed he woud never desist assurd the son he woud draw his sword and it should neer be sheathd till he had fixd him in his throne has he not made several chargeable attempts to make good his promise such panegyricks as these have often rung in my ears when the french were bent upon extolling the religious disposition of the monarch in protecting an unfortunate prince and the expedient was not unserviceable in regard of the generality of the people who easily were blinded with the glaring object but let us take this oeconomy to pieces and examine every wheel and spring for my part i can regard this boasted liberality no otherwise than a very imperfect restitution did not k james both ruin himself and thousands of families meerly by going into french measures i heard the court of france was obligd to feed all the posterity of that unfortunate misled multitude who have been deluded this twenty nine years by their politicks tis what i believe what the loosest of their casuists woud not refuse to oblige em to upon a fair hearing of the case but that the entertaining the irish troops shoud be mentiond as an instance of french charity is a very remarkable piece of assurance the swiss and other states are considerd with large annual pensions for the privilege of listing men besides double pay during the time of their service but the irish and all the rest of king jamess subjects poor fools must think themselves happy to bear the brunt of every siege and engagement for half pay be regarded as beggars living upon charity be reformd and abandond when they are no further useful the honour purchasd by these distressd people at cremina luzara spireback almaza friburg c have merrited better articles and the blood they have lost is a large disbursement for the expences at st germains a few french compliments paid once a week at st germains is but a poor recompence for a ruind people especially when the origin and motive of their misfortunes are lookd into and the gasconades and politick promises made both to the father and the son of never sheathing the sword with the sham attempts in their favour will be recorded in antiquity not as arguments of his christianity but strong lines of policy how a prince is to make use of all occurrences to promote the welfare of his own people nothing being more successful in such junctures than a pretence of religion and assisting persons in distress  having brought my remarks to this period i designd to have dropd my pen immediately but considering that a judicious reader will expect i should advance something by way of principle to justify the reflexions i have made i must add a word or two more concerning the unjust as well as unpolitick proceedings of those who have been deluded by a foreign power to bring destruction to their own native country and in the first place i must deliver my thoughts as to the cause in general the question of hereditary was not so well cleard at the revolution but that many very discerning and well meaning men might be drawn into a belief that lineal and immediate right was part of the divine law and so not dispensable this was my opinion in the beginning and it was a principle which carried me through the wars this twenty nine years in favour of king james even at those times when i was fully convincd that france had no real design to reestablish him but afterwards when i began to look narrowly into the question of hereditary right and saw that the notion of jure divino was only an assumd principle to buoy up the faction i by degrees slackend in my zeal and having no other nation of government then by submitting to the supream national power where the law of god was silent i found this an effectual means to quiet my conscience however i still persisted and followd the pretenders cause the success of the romancatholick interest provoking me to it for i imagind that salvo ought to weigh down in practise where other matters relating to succession were still under controversy but when i took under serious consideration the practise of our ancestors and how in all ages both church and state came frequently into nonhereditary measures where i run over the string of disappointments king james had met withal by the politic management of france when i reflected what misery had befallen and was like to befall these kings by adhering to the besoted notion of hereditary right i put the whole controversy upon the issue of religion and it plainly appeard to me that no roman catholick was obligd to oppose the revolutionary measures in conscience much less in policy i was fully satisfyd in the first part of the enquiry by that unanswerable piece lately printed calld a roman catholick system of allegiance as for the latter part let the tory and roman catholick party sum up their losses since 1688 and it will convince em how foolishly they acted thus settled in my principles in regard of loyalty i designd to pay an intire and unlimited obedience to the present constitution as to my religion which i own is not conformable to that by law established i will make a discreet use of that indulgence the government is pleasd to allow and if providence thinks fit to make me suffer upon that score no rational man will blame my zeal till he does convince me of my mistake  finis
