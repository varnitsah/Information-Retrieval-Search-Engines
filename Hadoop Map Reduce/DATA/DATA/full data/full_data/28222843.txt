 lay of the last minstrel    introduction   the novel or romance of waverley made its way to the public slowly of course at first but afterwards with such accumulating popularity as to encourage the author to a second attempt he looked about for a name and a subject and the manner in which the novels were composed cannot be better illustrated than by reciting the simple narrative on which guy mannering was originally founded but to which in the progress of the work the production ceased to bear any even the most distant resemblance the tale was originally told me by an old servant of my fathers an excellent old highlander without a fault unless a preference to mountain dew over less potent liquors be accounted one he believed as firmly in the story as in any part of his creed  a grave and elderly person according to old john mackinlays account while travelling in the wilder parts of galloway was benighted with difficulty he found his way to a country seat where with the hospitality of the time and country he was readily admitted the owner of the house a gentleman of good fortune was much struck by the reverend appearance of his guest and apologised to him for a certain degree of confusion which must unavoidably attend his reception and could not escape his eye the lady of the house was he said confined to her apartment and on the point of making her husband a father for the first time though they had been ten years married at such an emergency the laird said he feared his guest might meet with some apparent neglect  not so sir said the stranger my wants are few and easily supplied and i trust the present circumstances may even afford an opportunity of showing my gratitude for your hospitality let me only request that i may be informed of the exact minute of the birth and i hope to be able to put you in possession of some particulars which may influence in an important manner the future prospects of the child now about to come into this busy and changeful world i will not conceal from you that i am skilful in understanding and interpreting the movements of those planetary bodies which exert their influences on the destiny of mortals it is a science which i do not practise like others who call themselves astrologers for hire or reward for i have a competent estate and only use the knowledge i possess for the benefit of those in whom i feel an interest the laird bowed in respect and gratitude and the stranger was accommodated with an apartment which commanded an ample view of the astral regions  the guest spent a part of the night in ascertaining the position of the heavenly bodies and calculating their probable influence until at length the result of his observations induced him to send for the father and conjure him in the most solemn manner to cause the assistants to retard the birth if practicable were it but for five minutes the answer declared this to be impossible and almost in the instant that the message was returned the father and his guest were made acquainted with the birth of a boy  the astrologer on the morrow met the party who gathered around the breakfast table with looks so grave and ominous as to alarm the fears of the father who had hitherto exulted in the prospects held out by the birth of an heir to his ancient property failing which event it must have passed to a distant branch of the family he hastened to draw the stranger into a private room  i fear from your looks said the father that you have bad tidings to tell me of my young stranger perhaps god will resume the blessing he has bestowed ere he attains the age of manhood or perhaps he is destined to be unworthy of the affection which we are naturally disposed to devote to our offspring  neither the one nor the other answered the stranger unless my judgment greatly err the infant will survive the years of minority and in temper and disposition will prove all that his parents can wish but with much in his horoscope which promises many blessings there is one evil influence strongly predominant which threatens to subject him to an unhallowed and unhappy temptation about the time when he shall attain the age of twentyone which period the constellations intimate will be the crisis of his fate in what shape or with what peculiar urgency this temptation may beset him my art cannot discover  your knowledge then can afford us no defence said the anxious father against the threatened evil  pardon me answered the stranger it can the influence of the constellations is powerful but he who made the heavens is more powerful than all if his aid be invoked in sincerity and truth you ought to dedicate this boy to the immediate service of his maker with as much sincerity as samuel was devoted to the worship in the temple by his parents you must regard him as a being separated from the rest of the world in childhood in boyhood you must surround him with the pious and virtuous and protect him to the utmost of your power from the sight or hearing of any crime in word or action he must be educated in religious and moral principles of the strictest description let him not enter the world lest he learn to partake of its follies or perhaps of its vices in short preserve him as far as possible from all sin save that of which too great a portion belongs to all the fallen race of adam with the approach of his twentyfirst birthday comes the crisis of his fate if he survive it he will be happy and prosperous on earth and a chosen vessel among those elected for heaven but if it be otherwise the astrologer stopped and sighed deeply  sir replied the parent still more alarmed than before your words are so kind your advice so serious that i will pay the deepest attention to your behests but can you not aid me farther in this most important concern believe me i will not be ungrateful  i require and deserve no gratitude for doing a good action said the stranger in especial for contributing all that lies in my power to save from an abhorred fate the harmless infant to whom under a singular conjunction of planets last night gave life there is my address you may write to me from time to time concerning the progress of the boy in religious knowledge if he be bred up as i advise i think it will be best that he come to my house at the time when the fatal and decisive period approaches that is before he has attained his twentyfirst year complete if you send him such as i desire i humbly trust that god will protect his own through whatever strong temptation his fate may subject him to he then gave his host his address which was a country seat near a post town in the south of england and bid him an affectionate farewell  the mysterious stranger departed but his words remained impressed upon the mind of the anxious parent he lost his lady while his boy was still in infancy this calamity i think had been predicted by the astrologer and thus his confidence which like most people of the period he had freely given to the science was riveted and confirmed the utmost care therefore was taken to carry into effect the severe and almost ascetic plan of education which the sage had enjoined a tutor of the strictest principles was employed to superintend the youths education he was surrounded by domestics of the most established character and closely watched and looked after by the anxious father himself  the years of infancy childhood and boyhood passed as the father could have wished a young nazarene could not have been bred up with more rigour all that was evil was withheld from his observation he only heard what was pure in precept he only witnessed what was worthy in practice  but when the boy began to be lost in the youth the attentive father saw cause for alarm shades of sadness which gradually assumed a darker character began to overcloud the young mans temper tears which seemed involuntary broken sleep moonlight wanderings and a melancholy for which he could assign no reason seemed to threaten at once his bodily health and the stability of his mind the astrologer was consulted by letter and returned for answer that this fitful state of mind was but the commencement of his trial and that the poor youth must undergo more and more desperate struggles with the evil that assailed him there was no hope of remedy save that he showed steadiness of mind in the study of the scriptures he suffers continued the letter of the sage from the awakening of those harpies the passions which have slept with him as with others till the period of life which he has now attained better far better that they torment him by ungrateful cravings than that he should have to repent having satiated them by criminal indulgence  the dispositions of the young man were so excellent that he combated by reason and religion the fits of gloom which at times overcast his mind and it was not till he attained the commencement of his twentyfirst year that they assumed a character which made his father tremble for the consequences it seemed as if the gloomiest and most hideous of mental maladies was taking the form of religious despair still the youth was gentle courteous affectionate and submissive to his fathers will and resisted with all his power the dark suggestions which were breathed into his mind as it seemed by some emanation of the evil principle exhorting him like the wicked wife of job to curse god and die  the time at length arrived when he was to perform what was then thought a long and somewhat perilous journey to the mansion of the early friend who had calculated his nativity his road lay through several places of interest and he enjoyed the amusement of travelling more than he himself thought would have been possible thus he did not reach the place of his destination till noon on the day preceding his birthday it seemed as if he had been carried away with an unwonted tide of pleasurable sensation so as to forget in some degree what his father had communicated concerning the purpose of his journey he halted at length before a respectable but solitary old mansion to which he was directed as the abode of his fathers friend  the servants who came to take his horse told him he had been expected for two days he was led into a study where the stranger now a venerable old man who had been his fathers guest met him with a shade of displeasure as well as gravity on his brow young man he said wherefore so slow on a journey of such importance i thought replied the guest blushing and looking downward that there was no harm in travelling slowly and satisfying my curiosity providing i could reach your residence by this day for such was my fathers charge you were to blame replied the sage in lingering considering that the avenger of blood was pressing on your footsteps but you are come at last and we will hope for the best though the conflict in which you are to be engaged will be found more dreadful the longer it is postponed but first accept of such refreshments as nature requires to satisfy but not to pamper the appetite  the old man led the way into a summer parlour where a frugal meal was placed on the table as they sat down to the board they were joined by a young lady about eighteen years of age and so lovely that the sight of her carried off the feelings of the young stranger from the peculiarity and mystery of his own lot and riveted his attention to everything she did or said she spoke little and it was on the most serious subjects she played on the harpsichord at her fathers command but it was hymns with which she accompanied the instrument at length on a sign from the sage she left the room turning on the young stranger as she departed a look of inexpressible anxiety and interest  the old man then conducted the youth to his study and conversed with him upon the most important points of religion to satisfy himself that he could render a reason for the faith that was in him during the examination the youth in spite of himself felt his mind occasionally wander and his recollections go in quest of the beautiful vision who had shared their meal at noon on such occasions the astrologer looked grave and shook his head at this relaxation of attention yet on the whole he was pleased with the youths replies  at sunset the young man was made to take the bath and having done so he was directed to attire himself in a robe somewhat like that worn by armenians having his long hair combed down on his shoulders and his neck hands and feet bare in this guise he was conducted into a remote chamber totally devoid of furniture excepting a lamp a chair and a table on which lay a bible here said the astrologer i must leave you alone to pass the most critical period of your life if you can by recollection of the great truths of which we have spoken repel the attacks which will be made on your courage and your principles you have nothing to apprehend but the trial will be severe and arduous his features then assumed a pathetic solemnity the tears stood in his eyes and his voice faltered with emotion as he said dear child at whose coming into the world i foresaw this fatal trial may god give thee grace to support it with firmness  the young man was left alone and hardly did he find himself so when like a swarm of demons the recollection of all his sins of omission and commission rendered even more terrible by the scrupulousness with which he had been educated rushed on his mind and like furies armed with fiery scourges seemed determined to drive him to despair as he combated these horrible recollections with distracted feelings but with a resolved mind he became aware that his arguments were answered by the sophistry of another and that the dispute was no longer confined to his own thoughts the author of evil was present in the room with him in bodily shape and potent with spirits of a melancholy cast was impressing upon him the desperation of his state and urging suicide as the readiest mode to put an end to his sinful career amid his errors the pleasure he had taken in prolonging his journey unnecessarily and the attention which he had bestowed on the beauty of the fair female when his thoughts ought to have been dedicated to the religious discourse of her father were set before him in the darkest colours and he was treated as one who having sinned against light was therefore deservedly left a prey to the prince of darkness  as the fated and influential hour rolled on the terrors of the hateful presence grew more confounding to the mortal senses of the victim and the knot of the accursed sophistry became more inextricable in appearance at least to the prey whom its meshes surrounded he had not power to explain the assurance of pardon which he continued to assert or to name the victorious name in which he trusted but his faith did not abandon him though he lacked for a time the power of expressing it say what you will was his answer to the tempter i know there is as much betwixt the two boards of this book as can ensure me forgiveness for my transgressions and safety for my soul as he spoke the clock which announced the lapse of the fatal hour was heard to strike the speech and intellectual powers of the youth were instantly and fully restored he burst forth into prayer and expressed in the most glowing terms his reliance on the truth and on the author of the gospel the demon retired yelling and discomfited and the old man entering the apartment with tears congratulated his guest on his victory in the fated struggle  the young man was afterwards married to the beautiful maiden the first sight of whom had made such an impression on him and they were consigned over at the close of the story to domestic happiness so ended john mackinlays legend  the author of waverley had imagined a possibility of framing an interesting and perhaps not an unedifying tale out of the incidents of the life of a doomed individual whose efforts at good and virtuous conduct were to be for ever disappointed by the intervention as it were of some malevolent being and who was at last to come off victorious from the fearful struggle in short something was meditated upon a plan resembling the imaginative tale of sintram and his companions by mons le baron de la motte fouque although if it then existed the author had not seen it  the scheme projected may be traced in the three or four first chapters of the work but farther consideration induced the author to lay his purpose aside it appeared on mature consideration that astrology though its influence was once received and admitted by bacon himself does not now retain influence over the general mind sufficient even to constitute the mainspring of a romance besides it occurred that to do justice to such a subject would have required not only more talent than the author could be conscious of possessing but also involved doctrines and discussions of a nature too serious for his purpose and for the character of the narrative in changing his plan however which was done in the course of printing the early sheets retained the vestiges of the original tenor of the story although they now hang upon it as an unnecessary and unnatural incumbrance the cause of such vestiges occurring is now explained and apologised for  it is here worthy of observation that while the astrological doctrines have fallen into general contempt and been supplanted by superstitions of a more gross and far less beautiful character they have even in modern days retained some votaries  one of the most remarkable believers in that forgotten and despised science was a late eminent professor of the art of legerdemain one would have thought that a person of this description ought from his knowledge of the thousand ways in which human eyes could be deceived to have been less than others subject to the fantasies of superstition perhaps the habitual use of those abstruse calculations by which in a manner surprising to the artist himself many tricks upon cards etc are performed induced this gentleman to study the combination of the stars and planets with the expectation of obtaining prophetic communications  he constructed a scheme of his own nativity calculated according to such rules of art as he could collect from the best astrological authors the result of the past he found agreeable to what had hitherto befallen him but in the important prospect of the future a singular difficulty occurred there were two years during the course of which he could by no means obtain any exact knowledge whether the subject of the scheme would be dead or alive anxious concerning so remarkable a circumstance he gave the scheme to a brother astrologer who was also baffled in the same manner at one period he found the native or subject was certainly alive at another that he was unquestionably dead but a space of two years extended between these two terms during which he could find no certainty as to his death or existence  the astrologer marked the remarkable circumstance in his diary and continued his exhibitions in various parts of the empire until the period was about to expire during which his existence had been warranted as actually ascertained at last while he was exhibiting to a numerous audience his usual tricks of legerdemain the hands whose activity had so often baffled the closest observer suddenly lost their power the cards dropped from them and he sunk down a disabled paralytic in this state the artist languished for two years when he was at length removed by death it is said that the diary of this modern astrologer will soon be given to the public  the fact if truly reported is one of those singular coincidences which occasionally appear differing so widely from ordinary calculation yet without which irregularities human life would not present to mortals looking into futurity the abyss of impenetrable darkness which it is the pleasure of the creator it should offer to them were everything to happen in the ordinary train of events the future would be subject to the rules of arithmetic like the chances of gaming but extraordinary events and wonderful runs of luck defy the calculations of mankind and throw impenetrable darkness on future contingencies  to the above anecdote another still more recent may be here added the author was lately honoured with a letter from a gentleman deeply skilled in these mysteries who kindly undertook to calculate the nativity of the writer of guy mannering who might be supposed to be friendly to the divine art which he professed but it was impossible to supply data for the construction of a horoscope had the native been otherwise desirous of it since all those who could supply the minutiae of day hour and minute have been long removed from the mortal sphere  having thus given some account of the first idea or rude sketch of the story which was soon departed from the author in following out the plan of the present edition has to mention the prototypes of the principal characters in guy mannering  some circumstances of local situation gave the author in his youth an opportunity of seeing a little and hearing a great deal about that degraded class who are called gipsies who are in most cases a mixed race between the ancient egyptians who arrived in europe about the beginning of the fifteenth century and vagrants of european descent  the individual gipsy upon whom the character of meg merrilies was founded was well known about the middle of the last century by the name of jean gordon an inhabitant of the village of kirk yetholm in the cheviot hills adjoining to the english border the author gave the public some account of this remarkable person in one of the early numbers of blackwoods magazine to the following purpose  my father remembered old jean gordon of yetholm who had great sway among her tribe she was quite a meg merrilies and possessed the savage virtue of fidelity in the same perfection having been often hospitably received at the farmhouse of lochside near yetholm she had carefully abstained from committing any depredations on the farmers property but her sons nine in number had not it seems the same delicacy and stole a broodsow from their kind entertainer jean was mortified at this ungrateful conduct and so much ashamed of it that she absented herself from lochside for several years  it happened in course of time that in consequence of some temporary pecuniary necessity the goodman of lochside was obliged to go to newcastle to raise some money to pay his rent he succeeded in his purpose but returning through the mountains of cheviot he was benighted and lost his way  a light glimmering through the window of a large waste barn which had survived the farmhouse to which it had once belonged guided him to a place of shelter and when he knocked at the door it was opened by jean gordon her very remarkable figure for she was nearly six feet high and her equally remarkable features and dress rendered it impossible to mistake her for a moment though he had not seen her for years and to meet with such a character in so solitary a place and probably at no great distance from her clan was a grievous surprise to the poor man whose rent to lose which would have been ruin was about his person  jean set up a loud shout of joyful recognition  eh sirs the winsome gudeman of lochside light down light down for ye maunna gang farther the night and a friends house sae near the farmer was obliged to dismount and accept of the gipsys offer of supper and a bed there was plenty of meat in the barn however it might be come by and preparations were going on for a plentiful repast which the farmer to the great increase of his anxiety observed was calculated for ten or twelve guests of the same description probably with his landlady  jean left him in no doubt on the subject she brought to his recollection the story of the stolen sow and mentioned how much pain and vexation it had given her like other philosophers she remarked that the world grew worse daily and like other parents that the bairns got out of her guiding and neglected the old gipsy regulations which commanded them to respect in their depredations the property of their benefactors the end of all this was an inquiry what money the farmer had about him and an urgent request or command that he would make her his pursekeeper since the bairns as she called her sons would be soon home the poor farmer made a virtue of necessity told his story and surrendered his gold to jeans custody she made him put a few shillings in his pocket observing it would excite suspicion should he be found travelling altogether penniless  this arrangement being made the farmer lay down on a sort of shakedown as the scotch call it or bedclothes disposed upon some straw but as will easily be believed slept not  about midnight the gang returned with various articles of plunder and talked over their exploits in language which made the farmer tremble they were not long in discovering they had a guest and demanded of jean whom she had got there  een the winsome gudeman of lochside poor body replied jean hes been at newcastle seeking for siller to pay his rent honest man but deilbelickit hes been able to gather in and sae hes gaun een hame wi a toom purse and a sair heart  that may be jean replied one of the banditti but we maun ripe his pouches a bit and see if the tale be true or no jean set up her throat in exclamations against this breach of hospitality but without producing any change in their determination the farmer soon heard their stifled whispers and light steps by his bedside and understood they were rummaging his clothes when they found the money which the providence of jean gordon had made him retain they held a consultation if they should take it or no but the smallness of the booty and the vehemence of jeans remonstrances determined them in the negative they caroused and went to rest as soon as day dawned jean roused her guest produced his horse which she had accommodated behind the hallan and guided him for some miles till he was on the highroad to lochside she then restored his whole property nor could his earnest entreaties prevail on her to accept so much as a single guinea  i have heard the old people at jedburgh say that all jeans sons were condemned to die there on the same day it is said the jury were equally divided but that a friend to justice who had slept during the whole discussion waked suddenly and gave his vote for condemnation in the emphatic words hang them a unanimity is not required in a scottish jury so the verdict of guilty was returned jean was present and only said the lord help the innocent in a day like this her own death was accompanied with circumstances of brutal outrage of which poor jean was in many respects wholly undeserving she had among other demerits or merits as the reader may choose to rank it that of being a stanch jacobite she chanced to be at carlisle upon a fair or marketday soon after the year 1746 where she gave vent to her political partiality to the great offence of the rabble of that city being zealous in their loyalty when there was no danger in proportion to the tameness with which they had surrendered to the highlanders in 1745 the mob inflicted upon poor jean gordon no slighter penalty than that of ducking her to death in the eden it was an operation of some time for jean was a stout woman and struggling with her murderers often got her head above water and while she had voice left continued to exclaim at such intervals charlie yet charlie yet when a child and among the scenes which she frequented i have often heard these stories and cried piteously for poor jean gordon  before quitting the border gipsies i may mention that my grandfather while riding over charterhouse moor then a very extensive common fell suddenly among a large band of them who were carousing in a hollow of the moor surrounded by bushes they instantly seized on his horses bridle with many shouts of welcome exclaiming for he was well known to most of them that they had often dined at his expense and he must now stay and share their good cheer my ancestor was a little alarmed for like the goodman of lochside he had more money about his person than he cared to risk in such society however being naturally a bold livelyspirited man he entered into the humour of the thing and sate down to the feast which consisted of all the varieties of game poultry pigs and so forth that could be collected by a wide and indiscriminate system of plunder the dinner was a very merry one but my relative got a hint from some of the older gipsies to retire just when       the mirth and fun grew fast and furious  and mounting his horse accordingly he took a french leave of his entertainers but without experiencing the least breach of hospitality i believe jean gordon was at this festivalfootnote blackwoods magazine vol i p 54  notwithstanding the failure of jeans issue for which       weary fa the waefu wuddie  a granddaughter survived her whom i remember to have seen that is as dr johnson had a shadowy recollection of queen anne as a stately lady in black adorned with diamonds so my memory is haunted by a solemn remembrance of a woman of more than female height dressed in a long red cloak who commenced acquaintance by giving me an apple but whom nevertheless i looked on with as much awe as the future doctor high church and tory as he was doomed to be could look upon the queen i conceive this woman to have been madge gordon of whom an impressive account is given in the same article in which her mother jean is mentioned but not by the present writer  the late madge gordon was at this time accounted the queen of the yetholm clans she was we believe a granddaughter of the celebrated jean gordon and was said to have much resembled her in appearance the following account of her is extracted from the letter of a friend who for many years enjoyed frequent and favourable opportunities of observing the characteristic peculiarities of the yetholm tribesmadge gordon was descended from the faas by the mothers side and was married to a young she was a remarkable personageof a very commanding presence and high stature being nearly six feet high she had a large aquiline nose penetrating eyes even in her old age bushy hair that hung around her shoulders from beneath a gipsy bonnet of straw a short cloak of a peculiar fashion and a long staff nearly as tall as herself i remember her well every week she paid my father a visit for her awmous when i was a little boy and i looked upon madge with no common degree of awe and terror when she spoke vehemently for she made loud complaints she used to strike her staff upon the floor and throw herself into an attitude which it was impossible to regard with indifference she used to say that she could bring from the remotest parts of the island friends to revenge her quarrel while she sat motionless in her cottage and she frequently boasted that there was a time when she was of still more considerable importance for there were at her wedding fifty saddled asses and unsaddled asses without number if jean gordon was the prototype of the character of meg merrilies i imagine madge must have sat to the unknown author as the representative of her personfootnote blackwoods magazine vol i p 56  how far blackwoods ingenious correspondent was right how far mistaken in his conjecture the reader has been informed  to pass to a character of a very different description dominie sampsonthe reader may easily suppose that a poor modest humble scholar who has won his way through the classics yet has fallen to leeward in the voyage of life is no uncommon personage in a country where a certain portion of learning is easily attained by those who are willing to suffer hunger and thirst in exchange for acquiring greek and latin but there is a far more exact prototype of the worthy dominie upon which is founded the part which he performs in the romance and which for certain particular reasons must be expressed very generally  such a preceptor as mr sampson is supposed to have been was actually tutor in the family of a gentleman of considerable property the young lads his pupils grew up and went out in the world but the tutor continued to reside in the family no uncommon circumstance in scotland in former days where food and shelter were readily afforded to humble friends and dependents the lairds predecessors had been imprudent he himself was passive and unfortunate death swept away his sons whose success in life might have balanced his own bad luck and incapacity debts increased and funds diminished until ruin came the estate was sold and the old man was about to remove from the house of his fathers to go he knew not whither when like an old piece of furniture which left alone in its wonted corner may hold together for a long while but breaks to pieces on an attempt to move it he fell down on his own threshold under a paralytic affection  the tutor awakened as from a dream he saw his patron dead and that his patrons only remaining child an elderly woman now neither graceful nor beautiful if she ever had been either the one or the other had by this calamity become a homeless and penniless orphan he addressed her nearly in the words which dominie sampson uses to miss bertram and professed his determination not to leave her accordingly roused to the exercise of talents which had long slumbered he opened a little school and supported his patrons child for the rest of her life treating her with the same humble observance and devoted attention which he had used towards her in the days of her prosperity  such is the outline of dominie sampsons real story in which there is neither romantic incident nor sentimental passion but which perhaps from the rectitude and simplicity of character which it displays may interest the heart and fill the eye of the reader as irresistibly as if it respected distresses of a more dignified or refined character  these preliminary notices concerning the tale of guy mannering and some of the characters introduced may save the author and reader in the present instance the trouble of writing and perusing a long string of detached notes  abbotsford january 1829     addendum i may add that the motto of this novel was taken from the lay of the last minstrel to evade the conclusions of those who began to think that as the author of waverley never quoted the works of sir walter scott he must have reason for doing so and that the circumstances might argue an identity between them  abbotsford august 1 1829      additional note   galwegian localities and personages which have been supposed to be alluded to in the novel   an old english proverb says that more know tom fool than tom fool knows and the influence of the adage seems to extend to works composed under the influence of an idle or foolish planet many corresponding circumstances are detected by readers of which the author did not suspect the existence he must however regard it as a great compliment that in detailing incidents purely imaginary he has been so fortunate in approximating reality as to remind his readers of actual occurrences it is therefore with pleasure he notices some pieces of local history and tradition which have been supposed to coincide with the fictitious persons incidents and scenery of guy mannering  the prototype of dirk hatteraick is considered as having been a dutch skipper called yawkins this man was well known on the coast of galloway and dumfriesshire as sole proprietor and master of a buckkar or smuggling lugger called the black prince being distinguished by his nautical skill and intrepidity his vessel was frequently freighted and his own services employed by french dutch manx and scottish smuggling companies  a person well known by the name of buckkartea from having been a noted smuggler of that article and also by that of bogle bush the place of his residence assured my kind informant mr train that he had frequently seen upwards of two hundred lingtow men assemble at one time and go off into the interior of the country fully laden with contraband goods  in those halcyon days of the free trade the fixed price for carrying a box of tea or bale of tobacco from the coast of galloway to edinburgh was fifteen shillings and a man with two horses carried four such packages the trade was entirely destroyed by mr pitts celebrated commutation law which by reducing the duties upon excisable articles enabled the lawful dealer to compete with the smuggler the statute was called in galloway and dumfriesshire by those who had thriven upon the contraband trade the burning and starving act  sure of such active assistance on shore yawkins demeaned himself so boldly that his mere name was a terror to the officers of the revenue he availed himself of the fears which his presence inspired on one particular night when happening to be ashore with a considerable quantity of goods in his sole custody a strong party of excisemen came down on him far from shunning the attack yawkins sprung forward shouting come on my lads yawkins is before you the revenue officers were intimidated and relinquished their prize though defended only by the courage and address of a single man on his proper element yawkins was equally successful on one occasion he was landing his cargo at the manxmans lake near kirkcudbright when two revenue cutters the pigmy and the dwarf hove in sight at once on different tacks the one coming round by the isles of fleet the other between the point of rueberry and the muckle ron the dauntless freetrader instantly weighed anchor and bore down right between the luggers so close that he tossed his hat on the deck of the one and his wig on that of the other hoisted a cask to his maintop to show his occupation and bore away under an extraordinary pressure of canvass without receiving injury to account for these and other hairbreadth escapes popular superstition alleged that yawkins insured his celebrated buckkar by compounding with the devil for onetenth of his crew every voyage how they arranged the separation of the stock and tithes is left to our conjecture the buckkar was perhaps called the black prince in honour of the formidable insurer  the black prince used to discharge her cargo at luce balcarry and elsewhere on the coast but her owners favourite landingplaces were at the entrance of the dee and the cree near the old castle of rueberry about six miles below kirkcudbright there is a cave of large dimensions in the vicinity of rueberry which from its being frequently used by yawkins and his supposed connexion with the smugglers on the shore is now called dirk hatteraicks cave strangers who visit this place the scenery of which is highly romantic are also shown under the name of the gaugers loup a tremendous precipice being the same it is asserted from which kennedy was precipitated  meg merrilies is in galloway considered as having had her origin in the traditions concerning the celebrated flora marshal one of the royal consorts of willie marshal more commonly called the caird of barullion king of the gipsies of the western lowlands that potentate was himself deserving of notice from the following peculiaritieshe was born in the parish of kirkmichael about the year 1671 and as he died at kirkcudbright 23d november 1792 he must then have been in the one hundred and twentieth year of his age it cannot be said that this unusually long lease of existence was noted by any peculiar excellence of conduct or habits of life willie had been pressed or enlisted in the army seven times and had deserted as often besides three times running away from the naval service he had been seventeen times lawfully married and besides such a reasonably large share of matrimonial comforts was after his hundredth year the avowed father of four children by less legitimate affections he subsisted in his extreme old age by a pension from the present earl of selkirks grandfather will marshal is buried in kirkcudbright church where his monument is still shown decorated with a scutcheon suitably blazoned with two tups horns and two cutty spoons  in his youth he occasionally took an evening walk on the highway with the purpose of assisting travellers by relieving them of the weight of their purses on one occasion the caird of barullion robbed the laird of bargally at a place between carsphairn and dalmellington his purpose was not achieved without a severe struggle in which the gipsy lost his bonnet and was obliged to escape leaving it on the road a respectable farmer happened to be the next passenger and seeing the bonnet alighted took it up and rather imprudently put it on his own head at this instant bargally came up with some assistants and recognising the bonnet charged the farmer of bantoberick with having robbed him and took him into custody there being some likeness between the parties bargally persisted in his charge and though the respectability of the farmers character was proved or admitted his trial before the circuit court came on accordingly the fatal bonnet lay on the table of the court bargally swore that it was the identical article worn by the man who robbed him and he and others likewise deponed that they had found the accused on the spot where the crime was committed with the bonnet on his head the case looked gloomily for the prisoner and the opinion of the judge seemed unfavourable but there was a person in court who knew well both who did and who did not commit the crime this was the caird of barullion who thrusting himself up to the bar near the place where bargally was standing suddenly seized on the bonnet put it on his head and looking the laird full in the face asked him with a voice which attracted the attention of the court and crowded audiencelook at me sir and tell me by the oath you have swornam not i the man who robbed you between carsphairn and dalmellington bargally replied in great astonishment by heaven you are the very man you see what sort of memory this gentleman has said the volunteer pleader he swears to the bonnet whatever features are under it if you yourself my lord will put it on your head he will be willing to swear that your lordship was the party who robbed him between carsphairn and dalmellington the tenant of bantoberick was unanimously acquitted and thus willie marshal ingeniously contrived to save an innocent man from danger without incurring any himself since bargallys evidence must have seemed to every one too fluctuating to be relied upon  while the king of the gipsies was thus laudably occupied his royal consort flora contrived it is said to steal the hood from the judges gown for which offence combined with her presumptive guilt as a gipsy she was banished to new england whence she never returned  now i cannot grant that the idea of meg merrilies was in the first concoction of the character derived from flora marshal seeing i have already said she was identified with jean gordon and as i have not the laird of bargallys apology for charging the same fact on two several individuals yet i am quite content that meg should be considered as a representative of her sect and class in general flora as well as others  the other instances in which my gallovidian readers have obliged me by assigning to       airy nothing      a local habitation and a name  shall also be sanctioned so far as the author may be entitled to do so i think the facetious joe miller records a case pretty much in point where the keeper of a museum while showing as he said the very sword with which balaam was about to kill his ass was interrupted by one of the visitors who reminded him that balaam was not possessed of a sword but only wished for one true sir replied the readywitted cicerone but this is the very sword he wished for the author in application of this story has only to add that though ignorant of the coincidence between the fictions of the tale and some real circumstances he is contented to believe he must unconsciously have thought or dreamed of the last while engaged in the composition of guy mannering       editors introduction  to  guy mannering   the second essay in fiction of an author who has triumphed in his first romance is a doubtful and perilous adventure the writer is apt to become selfconscious to remember the advice of his criticsa fatal errorand to tremble before the shadow of his own success he knows that he will have many enemies that hundreds of people will be ready to find fault and to vow that he is written out scott was not unacquainted with these apprehensions after publishing marmion he wrote thus to lady abercorn  no one acquires a certain degree of popularity without exciting an equal degree of malevolence among those who either from rivalship or from the mere wish to pull down what others have set up are always ready to catch the first occasion to lower the favoured individual to what they call his real standard of this i have enough of experience and my political interferences however useless to my friends have not failed to make me more than the usual number of enemies i am therefore bound in justice to myself and to those whose good opinion has hitherto protected me not to peril myself too frequently the naturalists tell us that if you destroy the web which the spider has just made the insect must spend many days in inactivity till he has assembled within his person the materials necessary to weave another now after writing a work of imagination one feels in nearly the same exhausted state as the spider i believe no man now alive writes more rapidly than i do no great recommendation but i never think of making verses till i have a sufficient stock of poetical ideas to supply themi would as soon join the israelites in egypt in their heavy task of making bricks without clay besides i know as a small farmer that good husbandry consists in not taking the same crop too frequently from the same soil and as turnips come after wheat according to the best rules of agriculture i take it that an edition of swift will do well after such a scourging crop as marmiou  march 13 1808 copied from the collection of lady napier and ettrick  these fears of the brave then were not unfamiliar to scott but he audaciously disregarded all of them in the composition of guy mannering he had just spun his web like the spider of his simile he had just taken off his intellectual fields the scourging crop of the lord of the isles he had just received the discouraging news of its comparative failure when he buckled to achieved guy mannering in six weeks and published it moliere tells us that he wrote les facheux in a fortnight and a french critic adds that it reads indeed as if it had been written in a fortnight perhaps a selfconfident censor might venture a similar opinion about guy mannering it assuredly shows traces of haste the plot wanders at its own will and we may believe that the author oftendid not see his own way out of the wood but there is little harm in that if i do not know what is coming next a modern novelist has remarked how can the public know curiosity at least is likely to be excited by this happygolucky manner of scotts the worst of it is as he wrote to lady abercorn about his poems june 91808 that i am not very good or patient in slow and careful composition and sometimes i remind myself of the drunken man who could run long after he could not walk scott could certainly run very well though averse to a plodding motion  he was probably thinking of a famous edinburgh character singing jamie balfour jamie was found very drunk and adhering to the pavement one night he could not raise himself but when helped to his feet ran his preserver a race to the tavern and won  the account of the years work which preceded guy mannering is given by lockhart and is astounding in 1814 scott had written lockhart believes the greater part of the life of swift most of waverley and the lord of the isles he had furnished essays to the encyclopaedia and had edited the memorie of the somervilles the spider might well seem spun out the tilth exhausted but scott had a fertility a spontaneity of fancy equalled only if equalled at all by alexandre dumas  on november 7 of this laborious year 1814 scott was writing to mr joseph train thanking him for a parcel of legendary lore including the galloway tale of the wandering astrologer and a budget of gypsy traditions  falling in the rich soil of scotts imagination the tale of the astrologer yielded a name and an opening to guy mannering while the gypsy lore blossomed into the legend of meg merrilies the seed of the novel was now sown but between november 11 and december 25 scott was writing the three last cantos of the lord of the isles yet before the lord of the isles was published jan 18 1815 two volumes of guy mannering were in print  letter to morritt jan 17 1815 the novel was issued on feb 14 1815 scott as he says somewhere was like the turnspit dog into whose wheel a hot cinder is dropped to encourage his activity scott needed hot cinders in the shape of proofsheets fresh from the press and he worked most busily when the printers devil was waiting in this case not only the printers devil but the wolf was at the door the affairs of the ballantynes clamoured for moneys in their necessity and his own scott wrote at the rate of a volume in ten days and for some financial reason published guy mannering with messrs longmans not with constable scott was at this moment facing creditors and difficulties as napoleon faced the armies of the alliespresent everywhere everywhere daring and successful true his lord of the isles was a disappointment as james ballantyne informed him well james so be it but you know we must not droop for we cannot afford to give over since one line has failed we must just stick to something else and so he dismissed me and resumed his novel  in these circumstances far from inspiring was guy mannering written and hurried through the press the story has its own history one can watch the various reminiscences and experiences of life that crystallized together in scotts mind and grouped themselves fantastically into his unpremeditated plot sir walter gives in the preface of 1829 the legend which he heard from john mackinlay his fathers highland servant and on which he meant to found a tale more in hawthorns manner than in his own that plan he changed in the course of printing leaving only just enough of astrology to annoy pedantic reviewers and foolish puritans whence came the rest of the plotthe tale of the longlost heir and so on the true heir kept out of his own and returning in disguise has been a favourite character ever since homer sang of odysseus and probably long before that but it is just possible that scott had a certain modern instance in his mind in turning over the old manuscript diary at branxholme park mentioned in a note to waverley the editor lighted on a singular tale which in the diarists opinion might have suggested guy mannering to sir walter the resemblance between the story of vanbeest brown and the hero of the diarist was scanty but in a long letter of scotts to lady abercorn may 21 1813 a the editor finds sir walter telling his correspondent the very narrative recorded in the branxholme park diary singular things happen sir walter says and he goes on to describe a case just heard in the court where he is sitting as clerk of sessions briefly the anecdote is this a certain mr carruthers of dormont had reason to suspect his wifes fidelity while proceedings for a divorce were pending mrs carruthers bore a daughter of whom her husband of course was legally the father but he did not believe in the relationship and sent the infant girl to be brought up in ignorance of her origin and in seclusion among the cheviot hills here she somehow learned the facts of her own story she married a mr routledge the son of a yeoman and compounded her rights but not those of her issue for a small sung of ready money paid by old dormont she bears a boy then she and her husband died in poverty their son was sent by a friend to the east indies and was presented with a packet of papers which he left unopened at a lawyers the young man made a fortune in india returned to scotland and took a shooting in dumfriesshire near bormont his ancestral home he lodged at a small inn hard by and the landlady struck by his name began to gossip with him about his family history he knew nothing of the facts which the landlady disclosed but impressed by her story sent for and examined his neglected packet of papers then he sought legal opinion and was advised by president blair that he had a claim worth presenting on the estate of dormont the first decision of the cause writes scott was favourable the true heir celebrated his legal victory by a dinnerparty and his friends saluted him as dormont next morning he was found dead such is the true tale as it occupied scotts mind in 1813 and as he wrote guy mannering in 181415 it is not impossible that he may have borrowed his wandering heir who returns by pure accident to his paternal domains and there learns his origin at a womans lips from the dormont case the resemblance of the stories at least was close enough to strike a shrewd observer some seventy years ago  another possible source of the plota more romantic origin certainlyis suggested by mr robert chambers in illustrations of the author of waverley a maxwell of glenormiston a religious and bigoted recluse sent his only son and heir to a jesuit college in flanders left his estate in his brothers management and died the wicked uncle alleged that the heir was also dead the child ignorant of his birth grew up ran away from the jesuits at the age of sixteen enlisted in the french army fought at fontenoy got his colours and later landed in the moray firth as a french officer in 1745 he went through the campaign was in hiding in lochaber after drumossie and in making for a galloway port was seized and imprisoned in dumfries here an old woman of his fathers household recognized him by a mark which she remembered on his body his cause was taken up by friends but the usurping uncle died and sir robert maxwell recovered his estates without a lawsuit this anecdote is quoted from the new monthly magazine june 1819 there is nothing to prove that scott was acquainted with this adventure scotts own experience as usual supplied him with hints for his characters the phrase of dominie sampsons father please god my bairn may live to wag his pow in a pulpit was uttered in his own hearing there was a bluegown or bedesman like edie ochiltree who had a son at edinburgh college scott was kind to the son the bluegown asked him to dinner and at this meal the old man made the remark about the pulpit and the pow a similar tale is told by scott in the introduction to the antiquary 1830 as for the good dominie scott remarks that for certain particular reasons he must say what he has to say about his prototype very generally mr chambers finds the prototype in a mr james sanson tutor in the house of mr thomas scott sir walters uncle it seems very unlike sir walter to mention this excellent man almost by his name and the tale about his devotion to his patrons daughter cannot apparently be true of mr james sanson the prototype of pleydell according to sir walter himself journal june 19 1830 was my old friend adam rolland esq in external circumstances but not in frolic or fancy mr chambers however finds the original in mr andrew crosbie an advocate of great talents who frolicked to ruin and died in 1785 scott may have heard tales of this patron of high jinks but cannot have known him much personally dandie dinmont is simply the typical border farmer mr shortreed scotts companion in his liddesdale raids thought that willie elliot in millburnholm was the great original scott did not meet mr james davidson in hindlee owner of all the mustards and peppers till some years after the novel was written guy mannering when read to him sent mr davidson to sleep the kind and manly character of dandie the gentle and delicious one of his wife and the circumstances of their home were suggested lockhart thinks by scotts friend steward and amanuensis mr william laidlaw by mrs laidlaw and by their farm among the braes of yarrow in truth the border was peopled then by dandies and ailies nor is the race even now extinct in liddesdale and teviotdale in ettrick and yarrow as for mustard and pepper their offspring too is powerful in the land and is the deadly foe of vermin the curious may consult mr cooks work on the dandie dinmont terrier the duke of buccleughs breed still resembles the fine example painted by gainsborough in his portrait of the duke of scotts time tod gabbie again as lockhart says was studied from tod willie the huntsman of the hills above loch skene as for the galloway scenery scott did not know it well having only visited the kingdom in 1793 when he was defending the too frolicsome mr mcnaught minister of girthon the beautiful and lonely wilds of the glenkens in central galloway where traditions yet linger were unluckily terra incognita to scott a galloway story of a murder and its detection by the prints of the assassins boots inspired the scene where dirk hatteraick is traced by similar means in colonel mannering by the way the ettrick shepherd recognized walter scott painted by himself  the reception of guy mannering was all that could be wished william erskine and ballantyne were of opinion that it is much more interesting than waverley mr morritt march 1815 pronounced himself to be quite charmed with dandie meg merrilies and dirk hatteraickcharacters as original as true to nature and as forcibly conceived as i had almost said could have been drawn by shakspeare himself the public were not less appreciative two thousand copies at a guinea were sold the day after publication and three thousand more were disposed of in three months the professional critics acted just as scott speaking in general terms had prophesied that they would let us quote the british critic 1815  there are few spectacles in the literary world more lamentable than to view a successful author in his second appearance before the public limping lamely after himself and treading tediously and awkwardly in the very same round which in his first effort he had traced with vivacity and applause we would not be harsh enough to say that the author of waverley is in this predicament but we are most unwillingly compelled to assert that the second effort falls far below the standard of the first in waverley there was brilliancy of genius in guy mannering there is little else beyond the wild sallies of an original genius the bold and irregular efforts of a powerful but an exhausted mind time enough has not been allowed him to recruit his resources both of anecdote and wit but encouraged by the credit so justly bestowed upon one of then most finished portraits ever presented to the world he has followed up the exhibition with a careless and hurried sketch which betrays at once the weakness and the strength of its author  the character of dirk hatteraick is a faithful copy from natureit is one of those moral monsters which make us almost ashamed of our kind still amidst the ruffian and murderous brutality of the smuggler some few feelings of our common nature are thrown in with no less ingenuity than truth    the remainder of the personages are very little above the cast of a common lively novel    the edinburgh lawyer is perhaps the most original portrait nor are the saturnalia of the saturday evenings described without humour the dominie is overdrawn and inconsistent while the young ladies present nothing above par     there are parts of this novel which none but one endowed with the sublimity of genius could have dictated there are others which any ordinary character cobbler might as easily have stitched together there are sparks both of pathos and of humour even in the dullest parts which could be elicited from none but the author of waverley    if indeed we have spoken in a manner derogatory to this his later effort our censure arises only from its comparison with the former    we cannot however conclude this article without remarking the absurd influence which our author unquestionably attributes to the calculations of judicial astrology no power of chance alone could have fulfilled the joint predictions both of guy mannering and meg merrilies we cannot suppose that the author can be endowed with sufficient folly to believe in the influence of planetary conjunctions himself nor to have so miserable an idea of the understanding of his readers as to suppose them capable of a similar belief we must also remember that the time of this novel is not in the dark ages but scarcely forty years since no aid therefore can be derived from the general tendency of popular superstition what the clew may be to this apparent absurdity we cannot imagine whether the author be in jest or earnest we do not know and we are willing to suppose in this dilemma that he does not know himself  the monthly review sorrowed like the british over the encouragement given to the follies of astrology the critical review must lament that guy mannering is too often written in language unintelligible to all except the scotch the critical monthly also had scruples about morality the novel advocates duelling encourages a taste for peeping into the futurea taste by far too prevalentand it is not over nice on religious subjects  the quarterly review distinguished itself by stupidity if not by spite the language of guy mannering though characteristic is mean the state of society though peculiar is vulgar meg merrilies is swelled into a very unnatural importance the speech of meg merrilies to ellangowan is one of the few which affords an intelligible extract the author does not even scruple to overturn the laws of naturebecause colonel mannering resides in the neighbourhood of ellangowan the author either gravely believes what no other man alive believes or he has of malice prepense committed so great an offence against good taste as to build his story on what he must know to be a contemptible absurdity    the greater part of the characters their manners and dialect are at once barbarous and vulgar extravagant and mean    the work would be on the whole improved by being translated into english though we cannot on the whole speak of the novel with approbation we will not affect to deny that we read it with interest and that it repaid us with amusement  it is in reviewing the antiquary that the immortal idiot of the quarterly complains about the dark dialect of anglified erse published criticism never greatly affected scotts spiritsprobably he very seldom read it he knew that the public like constables friend mrs stewart were reading guy mannering all day and dreaming of it all night  indeed it is much better to read guy mannering than to criticise it a book written in six weeks a book whose whole plot and conception was changed in the printing must have its faults of construction thus we meet mannering first as a youthful lover a wanderer at adventure an amateur astrologer and suddenly we lose sight of him and only recover him as a disappointed disilluded and weary though still vigorous veteran this is the inevitable result of a novel based on a prediction either you have to leap some twenty years just when you are becoming familiar with the persons or you have to begin in the midst of the events foreseen and then make a tedious return to explain the prophecy again it was necessary for scott to sacrifice frank kennedy who is rather a taking adventurer like bothwell in old mortality readers regret the necessity which kills kennedy the whole fortunes of vanbeest brown his duel with the colonel and his fortunate appearance in the nick of time seem too rich in coincidences still as the dormont case and the ormiston case have shown coincidences as unlooked for do occur a fastidious critic has found fault with browns flageolet it is a modest instrument but what was he to play upona lute a concertina a barrelorgan  the characters of the young ladies have not always been applauded taste in the matter of heroines varies greatly sir walter had no high opinion of his own skill in delineating them but julia mannering is probably a masterly picture of a girl of that agea girl with some silliness and more gaiety with wit love of banter and in the last resort sense and good feeling she is particularly good when in fear and trembling she teases her imposing father  i expect says colonel mannering that you will pay to this young lady that attention which is due to misfortune and virtue certainly sir is my future friend redhaired miss mannering is very capable of listening to browns flageolet from the balcony but not of accompanying brown should he desire it in the boat as for brown himself he is one of sir walters usual young menbrave handsome not too cleverthe despair of their humorous creator once you come to forty year as thackeray sings then youll know that a lad is an ass and scott had come to that age and perhaps entertained that theory of a jeune premier when he wrote guy mannering in that novel as always he was most himself when dealing either with homely scottish characters of everyday life with exaggerated types of humorous absurdity and with wildly adventurous banditti who appealed to the old strain of the border reiver in his blood the wandering plot of guy mannering enabled him to introduce examples of all these sorts the goodhumoured dull dawdling ellangowan a laird half dwindled to a yeoman is a sketch absolutely accurate and wonderfully touched with pathos the landladies mrs maccandlish and tib mumps are little masterpieces so is macmorlan the foil to glossin and so is pleydell allowing for the manner of the age glossin himself is best when least villanous sir robert hazlewood is hardly a success but as to jock jabos a southern scot may say that he knows jock jabos in the flesh so persistent is the type of that charioteer it is partly scotts good fortune partly it is his evil luck to be so inimitably and intimately true in his pictures of scottish character this wins the heart of his countrymen indeed but the stranger can never know how good scott really is any more than a frenchman can appreciate falstaff thus the alien may be vexed by what he thinks the mere clannish enthusiasm of praise in scotts countrymen every little sketch of a passing face is exquisite in scotts work when he is at his best for example dandie dinmonts children are only indicated with a dusty roll of the brush but we recognize at once the large shy kindly families of the border dandie himself as the edinburgh review said 1817 is beyond all question the best rustic portrait that has ever yet been exhibited to the publicthe most honourable to rustics and the most creditable to the heart as well as to the genius of the author the truest to nature the most complete in all its lineaments dandie is always delightfulwhether at mumpss hall or on the lonely moor or at home in charlieshope or hunting or leistering fish or entering terriers at vermin or fighting or going to law or listening to the reading of a disappointing will or entertaining the orphan whom others neglect always delightful he is always generous always true always the border farmer there is no better stock of men none less devastated by the modern spirit his wife is worthy of him and has that singular gentleness kindliness and dignity which prevail on the border even in households far less prosperous than that of dandie dinmontdr john browns ailie in rab and his friends will naturally occur to the mind of every reader  among scotts character parts or types broadly humorous few have been more popular than dominie sampson his ungainly goodness unwieldy strength and inaccessible learning have made great sport especially when guy mannering was terryfied for the stage  as miss bertram remarks in that singular piecewhere even jock jabos wins till his english like elspeth in the antiquarythe dominie rather forces a tear from the eye of sentiment than a laugh from the lungs of ribaldry in the play however he sits down to read a folio on some bandboxes which very naturally give way under him as he has just asked mrs maccandlish after the health of both her husbands who are both dead the lungs of ribaldry are more exercised than the fine eye of sentiment we scarcely care to see our dominie treated thus his creator had the very lowest opinion of the modern playwrights craft and probably held that stage humour could not be too palpable and practical lockhart writes v 130 what share the novelist himself had in this first specimen of what he used to call the art of terryfying i cannot exactly say but his correspondence shows that the pretty song of the lullaby was not his only contribution to it and i infer that he had taken the trouble to modify the plot and rearrange for stage purposes a considerable part of the original dialogue friends of the dominie may be glad to know perhaps on scotts own testimony that he was an alumnus of st andrews i was boarded for twenty pence a week at luckie sourkails in the high street of st andrews he was also fortunate enough to hold a bursary in st leonards college which however is a blunder st leonards and st salvators had already been merged in the united college 1747 all this is in direct contradiction to the evidence in the novel which makes the dominie a glasgow man yet the change seems to be due to scott rather than to terry it is certain that colonel mannering would not have approved of the treatment which the dominie undergoes in a play whereof the plot and conduct fall little short of the unintelligible  against the character of pleydell a few murmurs of pedantic criticism as lockhart says were uttered and it was natural that pleydell should seem an incredible character to english readers but there is plenty of evidence that his high jinks were not exaggerated  there remains the heroine of the novel as mr ruskin not incorrectly calls her meg merrilies the sybil who so captivated the imagination of keats among scotts many weird women she is the most romantic with her loyal heart and that fiery natural eloquence which as scott truly observed does exist ready for moments of passion even among the reticent lowlanders the child of a mysterious wandering race meg has a double claim to utter such speeches as she addresses to ellangowan after the eviction of her tribe her death as mr ruskin says is selfdevoted heroic in the highest and happy the devotion of meg merrilies the grandeur of her figure the music of her songs more than redeem the character of dirk hatteraick even if we hold with the edinburgh reviewer that he is a vulgar bandit of the german school just as the insipidity and flageolet of the hero are redeemed by the ballad sung in the moment of recognition          are these the links of forth she said           or are they the crooks of dee           or the bonnie woods of warroch head           that i so fain would see guy mannering according to lockhart was pronounced by acclamation fully worthy to share the honours of waverley one star differeth from another in glory and guy mannering has neither that vivid picture of clannish manners nor that noble melancholy of a gallant and forlorn endeavour of the lost cause               when all was done that man may do                and all was done in vain which give dignity to waverley yet with lockhart we may admire in guy mannering the rapid everheightening interest of the narrative the unaffected kindliness of feeling the manly purity of thought everywhere mingled with a gentle humour and homely sagacity but above all the rich variety and skilful contrast of character and manners at once fresh in fiction and stamped with the unforgeable seal of truth and nature  andrew lang       guy mannering  or  the astrologer       chapter i      he could not deny that looking round upon the dreary region      and seeing nothing but bleak fields and naked trees hills      obscured by fogs and flats covered with inundations he did      for some time suffer melancholy to prevail upon him and      wished himself again safe at home            travels of will marvel idler no 49 it was in the beginning of the month of november 17when a young english gentleman who had just left the university of oxford made use of the liberty afforded him to visit some parts of the north of england and curiosity extended his tour into the adjacent frontier of the sister country he had visited on the day that opens our history some monastic ruins in the county of dumfries and spent much of the day in making drawings of them from different points so that on mounting his horse to resume his journey the brief and gloomy twilight of the season had already commenced his way lay through a wide tract of black moss extending for miles on each side and before him little eminences arose like islands on its surface bearing here and there patches of corn which even at this season was green and sometimes a hut or farmhouse shaded by a willow or two and surrounded by large elderbushes these insulated dwellings communicated with each other by winding passages through the moss impassable by any but the natives themselves the public road however was tolerably well made and safe so that the prospect of being benighted brought with it no real danger still it is uncomfortable to travel alone and in the dark through an unknown country and there are few ordinary occasions upon which fancy frets herself so much as in a situation like that of mannering  as the light grew faint and more faint and the morass appeared blacker and blacker our traveller questioned more closely each chance passenger on his distance from the village of kippletringan where he proposed to quarter for the night his queries were usually answered by a counterchallenge respecting the place from whence he came while sufficient daylight remained to show the dress and appearance of a gentleman these cross interrogatories were usually put in the form of a case supposed as yell hae been at the auld abbey o halycross sir theres mony english gentlemen gang to see thator your honour will become frae the house o pouderloupat but when the voice of the querist alone was distinguishable the response usually was where are ye coming frae at sic a time o night as the like o thisor yell no be o this country freend the answers when obtained were neither very reconcilable to each other nor accurate in the information which they afforded kippletringan was distant at first a gey bit then the gey bit was more accurately described as ablins three mile then the three mile diminished into like a mile and a bittock then extended themselves into four mile or thereawa and lastly a female voice having hushed a wailing infant which the spokeswoman carried in her arms assured guy mannering it was a weary lang gate yet to kippletringan and unco heavy road for foot passengers the poor hack upon which mannering was mounted was probably of opinion that it suited him as ill as the female respondent for he began to flag very much answered each application of the spur with a groan and stumbled at every stone and they were not few which lay in his road  mannering now grew impatient he was occasionally betrayed into a deceitful hope that the end of his journey was near by the apparition of a twinkling light or two but as he came up he was disappointed to find that the gleams proceeded from some of those farmhouses which occasionally ornamented the surface of the extensive bog at length to complete his perplexity he arrived at a place where the road divided into two if there had been light to consult the relics of a fingerpost which stood there it would have been of little avail as according to the good custom of north britain the inscription had been defaced shortly after its erection our adventurer was therefore compelled like a knighterrant of old to trust to the sagacity of his horse which without any demur chose the lefthand path and seemed to proceed at a somewhat livelier pace than before affording thereby a hope that he knew he was drawing near to his quarters for the evening this hope however was not speedily accomplished and mannering whose impatience made every furlong seem three began to think that kippletringan was actually retreating before him in proportion to his advance  it was now very cloudy although the stars from time to time shed a twinkling and uncertain light hitherto nothing had broken the silence around him but the deep cry of the bogblitter or bullofthebog a large species of bittern and the sighs of the wind as it passed along the dreary morass to these was now joined the distant roar of the ocean towards which the traveller seemed to be fast approaching this was no circumstance to make his mind easy many of the roads in that country lay along the seabeach and were liable to be flooded by the tides which rise with great height and advance with extreme rapidity others were intersected with creeks and small inlets which it was only safe to pass at particular times of the tide neither circumstance would have suited a dark night a fatigued horse and a traveller ignorant of his road mannering resolved therefore definitively to halt for the night at the first inhabited place however poor he might chance to reach unless he could procure a guide to this unlucky village of kippletringan  a miserable hut gave him an opportunity to execute his purpose he found out the door with no small difficulty and for some time knocked without producing any other answer than a duet between a female and a curdog the latter yelping as if he would have barked his heart out the other screaming in chorus by degrees the human tones predominated but the angry bark of the cur being at the instant changed into a howl it is probable something more than fair strength of lungs had contributed to the ascendency  sorrow be in your thrapple then these were the first articulate words will ye no let me hear what the man wants wi your yaffing  am i far from kippletringan good dame  frae kippletringan in an exalted tone of wonder which we can but faintly express by three points of admiration ow man ye should hae hadden eassel to kippletringan ye maun gae back as far as the whaap and baud the whaap till ye come to ballenloan and then  this will never

quarters at the place ise warrant theyll tak ye in whether ye be gentle or semple  simple enough to be wandering here at such a time of night thought mannering who was ignorant of the meaning of the phrase but how shall i get to the place as you call it  ye maun baud wessel by the end o the loan and take tent o the jawhole  o if ye get to eassel and wessel again i am undone is there nobody that could guide me to this place i will pay him handsomely  the word pay operated like magic jock ye villain exclaimed the voice from the interior are ye lying routing there and a young gentleman seeking

ye ll be come in the canny moment im thinking for the lairds servantthats no to say his bodyservant but the helper likerade express by this een to fetch the houdie and he just staid the drinking o twa pints o tippenny to tell us how my leddy was taen wi her pains  perhaps said mannering at such a time a strangers arrival might be inconvenient  hout na ye needna be blate about that their house is muckle eneugh and decking times aye canty time  by this time jock had found his way into all the intricacies of a tattered doublet and more tattered pair of breeches and sallied forth a great whiteheaded barelegged lubberly boy of twelve years old so exhibited by the glimpse of a rushlight which his halfnaked mother held in such a manner as to get a peep at the stranger without greatly exposing herself to view in return jock moved on westward by the end of the house leading mannerings horse by the bridle and piloting with some dexterity along the little path which bordered the formidable jawhole whose vicinity the stranger was made sensible of by means of more organs than one his guide then dragged the weary hack along a broken and stony carttrack next over a ploughed field then broke down a slap as he called it in a drystone fence and lugged the unresisting animal through the breach about a rood of the simple masonry giving way in the splutter with which he passed finally he led the way through a wicket into something which had still the air of an avenue though many of the trees were felled the roar of the ocean was now near and full and the moon which began to make her appearance gleamed on a turreted and apparently a ruined mansion of considerable extent mannering fixed his eyes upon it with a disconsolate sensation  why my little fellow he said this is a ruin not a house  ah but the lairds lived there langsyne thats ellangowan auld place theres a hantle bogles about it but ye needna be feared i never saw ony mysell and were just at the door o the new place  accordingly leaving the ruins on the right a few steps brought the traveller in front of a modern house of moderate size at which his guide rapped with great importance mannering told his circumstances to the servant and the gentleman of the house who heard his tale from the parlour stepped forward and welcomed the stranger hospitably to ellangowan the boy made happy with halfacrown was dismissed to his cottage the weary horse was conducted to a stall and mannering found himself in a few minutes seated by a comfortable supper for which his cold ride gave him a hearty appetite       chapter  ii       comes me cranking in      and cuts me from the best of all my land      a huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out            henry iv part 1 the company in the parlour at ellangowan consisted of the laird and a sort of person who might be the village schoolmaster or perhaps the ministers assistant his appearance was too shabby to indicate the minister considering he was on a visit to the laird  the laird himself was one of those secondrate sort of persons that are to be found frequently in rural situations fielding has described one class as feras consumere nati but the love of fieldsports indicates a certain activity of mind which had forsaken mr bertram if ever he possessed it a goodhumoured listlessness of countenance formed the only remarkable expression of his features although they were rather handsome than otherwise in fact his physiognomy indicated the inanity of character which pervaded his life i will give the reader some insight into his state and conversation before he has finished a long lecture to mannering upon the propriety and comfort of wrapping his stirrupirons round with a wisp of straw when he had occasion to ride in a chill evening  godfrey bertram of ellangowan succeeded to a long pedigree and a short rentroll like many lairds of that period his list of forefathers ascended so high that they were lost in the barbarous ages of galwegian independence so that his genealogical tree besides the christian and crusading names of godfreys and gilberts and dennises and rolands without end bore heathen fruit of yet darker agesarths and knarths and donagilds and hanlons in truth they had been formerly the stormy chiefs of a desert but extensive domain and the heads of a numerous tribe called macdingawaie though they afterwards adopted the norman surname of bertram they had made war raised rebellions been defeated beheaded and hanged as became a family of importance for many centuries but they had gradually lost ground in the world and from being themselves the heads of treason and traitorous conspiracies the bertrams or macdingawaies of ellangowan had sunk into subordinate accomplices their most fatal exhibitions in this capacity took place in the seventeenth century when the foul fiend possessed them with a spirit of contradiction which uniformly involved them in controversy with the ruling powers they reversed the conduct of the celebrated vicar of bray and adhered as tenaciously to the weaker side as that worthy divine to the stronger and truly like him they had their reward        allan bertram of ellangowan who flourished tempore caroli primi was says my authority sir robert douglas in his scottish baronage see the title ellangowan a steady loyalist and full of zeal for the cause of his sacred majesty in which he united with the great marquis of montrose and other truly zealous and honourable patriots and sustained great losses in that behalf he had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him by his most sacred majesty and was sequestrated as a malignant by the parliament 1642 and afterwards as a resolutioner in the year 1648 these two crossgrained epithets of malignant and resolutioner cost poor sir allan one half of the family estate his son dennis bertram married a daughter of an eminent fanatic who had a seat in the council of state and saved by that union the remainder of the family property but as ill chance would have it he became enamoured of the ladys principles as well as of her charms and my author gives him this character he was a man of eminent parts and resolution for which reason he was chosen by the western counties one of the committee of noblemen and gentlemen to report their griefs to the privy council of charles ii anent the coming in of the highland host in 1678 for undertaking this patriotic task he underwent a fine to pay which he was obliged to mortgage half of the remaining moiety of his paternal property this loss he might have recovered by dint of severe economy but on the breaking out of argyles rebellion dennis bertram was again suspected by government apprehended sent to dunnotar castle on the coast of the mearns and there broke his neck in an attempt to escape from a subterranean habitation called the whigs vault in which he was confined with some eighty of the same persuasion the apprizer therefore as the holder of a mortgage was then called entered upon possession and in the language of hotspur came me cranking in and cut the family out of another monstrous cantle of their remaining property  donohoe bertram with somewhat of an irish name and somewhat of an irish temper succeeded to the diminished property of ellangowan he turned out of doors the reverend aaron macbriar his mothers chaplain it is said they quarrelled about the good graces of a milkmaid drank himself daily drunk with brimming healths to the king council and bishops held orgies with the laird of lagg theophilus oglethorpe and sir james turner and lastly took his grey gelding and joined clavers at killiecrankie at the skirmish of dunkeld 1689 he was shot dead by a cameronian with a silver button being supposed to have proof from the evil one against lead and steel and his grave is still called the wicked lairds lair  his son lewis had more prudence than seems usually to have belonged to the family he nursed what property was yet left to him for donohoes excesses as well as fines and forfeitures had made another inroad upon the estate and although even he did not escape the fatality which induced the lairds of ellangowan to interfere with politics he had yet the prudence ere he went out with lord kenmore in 1715 to convey his estate to trustees in order to parry pains and penalties in case the earl of mar could not put down the protestant succession but scylla and charybdisa word to the wisehe only saved his estate at expense of a lawsuit which again subdivided the family property he was however a man of resolution he sold part of the lands evacuated the old cattle where the family lived in their decadence as a mouse said an old farmer lives under a firlot pulling down part of these venerable ruins he built with the stones a narrow house of three stories high with a front like a grenadiers cap having in the very centre a round window like the single eye of a cyclops two windows on each side and a door in the middle leading to a parlour and withdrawingroom full of all manner of cross lights  this was the new place of ellangowan in which we left our hero better amused perhaps than our readers and to this lewis bertram retreated full of projects for reestablishing the prosperity of his family he took some land into his own hand rented some from neighbouring proprietors bought and sold highland cattle and cheviot sheep rode to fairs and trysts fought hard bargains and held necessity at the staffs end as well as he might but what he gained in purse he lost in honour for such agricultural and commercial negotiations were very ill looked upon by his brother lairds who minded nothing but cockfighting hunting coursing and horseracing with now and then the alternative of a desperate duel the occupations which he followed encroached in their opinion upon the article of ellangowans gentry and he found it necessary gradually to estrange himself from their society and sink into what was then a very ambiguous character a gentleman farmer in the midst of his schemes death claimed his tribute and the scanty remains of a large property descended upon godfrey bertram the present possessor his only son  the danger of the fathers speculations was soon seen deprived of laird lewiss personal and active superintendence all his undertakings miscarried and became either abortive or perilous without a single spark of energy to meet or repel these misfortunes godfrey put his faith in the activity of another he kept neither hunters nor hounds nor any other southern preliminaries to ruin but as has been observed of his countrymen he kept a man of business who answered the purpose equally well under this gentlemans supervision small debts grew into large interests were accumulated upon capitals movable bonds became heritable and law charges were heaped upon all though ellangowan possessed so little the spirit of a litigant that he was on two occasions charged to make payment of the expenses of a long lawsuit although he had never before heard that he had such cases in court meanwhile his neighbours predicted his final ruin those of the higher rank with some malignity accounted him already a degraded brother the lower classes seeing nothing enviable in his situation marked his embarrassments with more compassion he was even a kind of favourite with them and upon the division of a common or the holding of a blackfishing or poaching court or any similar occasion when they conceived themselves oppressed by the gentry they were in the habit of saying to each other ah if ellangowan honest man had his ain that his forbears had afore him he wadna see the puir folk trodden down this gait meanwhile this general good opinion never prevented their taking advantage of him on all possible occasions turning their cattle into his parks stealing his wood shooting his game and so forth for the laird honest man hell never find it he never minds what a puir body does pedlars gipsies tinkers vagrants of all descriptions roosted about his outhouses or harboured in his kitchen and the laird who was nae nice body but a thorough gossip like most weak men found recompense for his hospitality in the pleasure of questioning them on the news of the country side  a circumstance arrested ellangowans progress on the highroad to ruin this was his marriage with a lady who had a portion of about four thousand pounds nobody in the neighbourhood could conceive why she married him and endowed him with her wealth unless because he had a tall handsome figure a good set of features a genteel address and the most perfect goodhumour it might be some additional consideration that she was herself at the reflecting age of twentyeight and had no near relations to control her actions or choice  it was in this ladys behalf confined for the first time after her marriage that the speedy and active express mentioned by the old dame of the cottage had been despatched to kippletringan on the night of mannerings arrival  though we have said so much of the laird himself it still remains that we make the reader in some degree acquainted with his companion this was abel sampson commonly called from his occupation as a pedagogue dominie sampson he was of low birth but having evinced even from his cradle an uncommon seriousness of disposition the poor parents were encouraged to hope that their bairn as they expressed it might wag his pow in a pulpit yet with an ambitious view to such a consummation they pinched and pared rose early and lay down late ate dry bread and drank cold water to secure to abel the means of learning meantime his tall ungainly figure his taciturn and grave manners and some grotesque habits of swinging his limbs and screwing his visage while reciting his task made poor sampson the ridicule of all his schoolcompanions the same qualities secured him at glasgow college a plentiful share of the same sort of notice half the youthful mob of the yards used to assemble regularly to see dominie sampson for he had already attained that honourable title descend the stairs from the greek class with his lexicon under his arm his long misshapen legs sprawling abroad and keeping awkward time to the play of his immense shoulderblades as they raised and depressed the loose and threadbare black coat which was his constant and only wear when he spoke the efforts of the professor professor of divinity though he was were totally inadequate to restrain the inextinguishable laughter of the students and sometimes even to repress his own the long sallow visage the goggle eyes the huge underjaw which appeared not to open and shut by an act of volition but to be dropped and hoisted up again by some complicated machinery within the inner man the harsh and dissonant voice and the screechowl notes to which it was exalted when he was exhorted to pronounce more distinctlyall added fresh subject for mirth to the torn cloak and shattered shoe which have afforded legitimate subjects of raillery against the poor scholar from juvenals time downward it was never known that sampson either exhibited irritability at this ill usage or made the least attempt to retort upon his tormentors he slunk from college by the most secret paths he could discover and plunged himself into his miserable lodging where for eighteenpence a week he was allowed the benefit of a straw mattress and if his landlady was in good humour permission to study his task by her fire under all these disadvantages he obtained a competent knowledge of greek and latin and some acquaintance with the sciences  in progress of time abel sampson probationer of divinity was admitted to the privileges of a preacher but alas partly from his own bashfulness partly owing to a strong and obvious disposition to risibility which pervaded the congregation upon his first attempt he became totally incapable of proceeding in his intended discourse gasped grinned hideously rolled his eyes till the congregation thought them flying out of his head shut the bible stumbled down the pulpitstairs trampling upon the old women who generally take their station there and was ever after designated as a stickit minister and thus he wandered back to his own country with blighted hopes and prospects to share the poverty of his parents as he had neither friend nor confidant hardly even an acquaintance no one had the means of observing closely how dominie sampson bore a disappointment which supplied the whole town with a weeks sport it would be endless even to mention the numerous jokes to which it gave birth from a ballad called sampsons riddle written upon the subject by a smart young student of humanity to the sly hope of the principal that the fugitive had not in imitation of his mighty namesake taken the college gates along with him in his retreat  to all appearance the equanimity of sampson was unshaken he sought to assist his parents by teaching a school and soon had plenty of scholars but very few fees in fact he taught the sons of farmers for what they chose to give him and the poor for nothing and to the shame of the former be it spoken the pedagogues gains never equalled those of a skilful ploughman he wrote however a good hand and added something to his pittance by copying accounts and writing letters for ellangowan by degrees the laird who was much estranged from general society became partial to that of dominie sampson conversation it is true was out of the question but the dominie was a good listener and stirred the fire with some address he attempted even to snuff the candles but was unsuccessful and relinquished that ambitious post of courtesy after having twice reduced the parlour to total darkness so his civilities thereafter were confined to taking off his glass of ale in exactly the same time and measure with the laird and in uttering certain indistinct murmurs of acquiescence at the conclusion of the long and winding stories of ellangowan  on one of these occasions he presented for the first time to mannering his tall gaunt awkward bony figure attired in a threadbare suit of black with a coloured handkerchief not over clean about his sinewy scraggy neck and his nether person arrayed in grey breeches darkblue stockings clouted shoes and small copper buckles  such is a brief outline of the lives and fortunes of those two persons in whose society mannering now found himself comfortably seated       chapter  iii      do not the histries of all ages      relate miraculous presages      of strange turns in the worlds affairs      foreseen by astrologers soothsayers      chaldeans learned genethliacs      and some that have writ almanacks            hudibras   the circumstances of the landlady were pleaded to mannering first as an apology for her not appearing to welcome her guest and for those deficiencies in his entertainment which her attention might have supplied and then as an excuse for pressing an extra bottle of good wine i cannot weel sleep said the laird with the anxious feelings of a father in such a predicament till i hear shes gotten ower with it and if you sir are not very sleepery and would do me and the dominie the honour to sit up wi us i am sure we shall not detain you very late luckie howatson is very expeditious there was ance a lass that was in that way she did not live far from hereaboutsye needna shake your head and groan dominie i am sure the kirk dues were a weel paid and what can man do mairit was laid till her ere she had a sark ower her head and the man that she since wadded does not think her a pin the waur for the misfortune they live mr mannering by the shoreside at annan and a mair decent orderly couple with six as fine bairns as ye would wish to see plash in a saltwater dub and little curlie godfreythats the eldest the come o will as i may sayhes on board an excise yacht i hae a cousin at the board of excise thats commissioner bertram he got his commissionership in the great contest for the county that ye must have heard of for it was appealed to the house of commons now i should have voted there for the laird of balruddery but ye see my father was a jacobite and out with kenmore so he never took the oaths and i ken not weel how it was but all that i could do and say they keepit me off the roll though my agent that had a vote upon my estate ranked as a good vote for auld sir thomas kittlecourt but to return to what i was saying luckie howatson is very expeditious for this lass  here the desultory and longwinded narrative of the laird was interrupted by the voice of some one ascending the stairs from the kitchen story and singing at full pitch of voice the high notes were too shrill for a man the low seemed too deep for a woman the words as far as mannering could distinguish them seemed to run thus      canny moment lucky fit     is the lady lighter yet     be it lad or be it lass     sign wi cross and sain wi mass  its meg merrilies the gipsy as sure as i am a sinner said mr bertram the dominie groaned deeply uncrossed his legs drew in the huge splay foot which his former posture had extended placed it perpendicularly and stretched the other limb over it instead puffing out between whiles huge volumes of tobacco smoke what needs ye groan dominie i am sure megs sangs do nae ill  nor good neither answered dominie sampson in a voice whose untuneable harshness corresponded with the awkwardness of his figure they were the first words which mannering had heard him speak and as he had been watching with some curiosity when this eating drinking moving and smoking automaton would perform the part of speaking he was a good deal diverted with the harsh timber tones which issued from him but at this moment the door opened and meg merrilies entered  her appearance made mannering start she was full six feet high wore a mans greatcoat over the rest of her dress had in her hand a goodly sloethorn cudgel and in all points of equipment except her petticoats seemed rather masculine than feminine her dark elflocks shot out like the snakes of the gorgon between an oldfashioned bonnet called a bongrace heightening the singular effect of her strong and weatherbeaten features which they partly shadowed while her eye had a wild roll that indicated something like real or affected insanity  aweel ellangowan she said wad it no hae been a bonnie thing an the leddy had been brought to bed and me at the fair o drumshourloch no kenning nor dreaming a

it by the stars  certainly sir said mannering entering into the simple humour of his landlord i will calculate his nativity according to the rule of the triplicities as recommended by pythagoras hippocrates diocles and avicenna or i will begin ab hora questionis as haly messahala ganwehis and guido bonatus have recommended  one of sampsons great recommendations to the favour of mr bertram was that he never detected the most gross attempt at imposition so that the laird whose humble efforts at jocularity were chiefly confined to what were then called bites and bams since denominated hoaxes and quizzes had the fairest possible subject of wit in the unsuspecting dominie it is true he never laughed or joined in the laugh which his own simplicity affordednay it is said he never laughed but once in his life and on that memorable occasion his landlady miscarried partly through surprise at the event itself and partly from terror at the hideous grimaces which attended this unusual cachinnation the only effect which the discovery of such impositions produced upon this saturnine personage was to extort an ejaculation of prodigious or very facetious pronounced syllabically but without moving a muscle of his own countenance  on the present occasion he turned a gaunt and ghastly stare upon the youthful astrologer and seemed to doubt if he had rightly understood his answer to his patron  i am afraid sir said mannering turning towards him you may be one of those unhappy persons who their dim eyes being unable to penetrate the starry spheres and to discern therein the decrees of heaven at a distance have their hearts barred against conviction by prejudice and misprision  truly said sampson i opine with sir isaac newton knight and umwhile master of his majestys mint that the pretended science of astrology is altogether vain frivolous and unsatisfactory and here he reposed his oracular jaws  really resumed the traveller i am sorry to see a gentleman of your learning and gravity labouring under such strange blindness and delusion will you place the brief the modern and as i may say the vernacular name of isaac newton in opposition to the grave and sonorous authorities of dariot bonatus ptolemy haly eztler dieterick naibob harfurt zael taustettor agrippa duretus maginus origen and argol do not christians and heathens and jews and gentiles and poets and philosophers unite in allowing the starry influences  communis errorit is a general mistake answered the inflexible dominie sampson  not so replied the young englishman it is a general and wellgrounded belief  it is the resource of cheaters knaves and cozeners said sampson  abusus non tollit usumthe abuse of anything doth not abrogate the lawful use thereof  during this discussion ellangowan was somewhat like a woodcock caught in his own springe he turned his face alternately from the one spokesman to the other and began from the gravity with which mannering plied his adversary and the learning which he displayed in the controversy to give him credit for being half serious as for meg she fixed her bewildered eyes upon the astrologer overpowered by a jargon more mysterious than her own  mannering pressed his advantage and ran over all the hard terms of art which a tenacious memory supplied and which from circumstances hereafter to be noticed had been familiar to him in early youth  signs and planets in aspects sextile quartile trine conjoined or opposite houses of heaven with their cusps hours and minutes almuten almochoden anabibazon catabibazon a thousand terms of equal sound and significance poured thick and threefold upon the unshrinking dominie whose stubborn incredulity bore him out against the pelting of this pitiless storm  at length the joyful annunciation that the lady had presented her husband with a fine boy and was of course as well as could be expected broke off this intercourse mr bertram hastened to the ladys apartment meg merrilies descended to the kitchen to secure her share of the groaning malt and the kenno footnote see note i and mannering after looking at his watch and noting with great exactness the hour and minute of the birth requested with becoming gravity that the dominie would conduct him to some place where he might have a view of the heavenly bodies  the schoolmaster without further answer rose and threw open a door half sashed with glass which led to an oldfashioned terracewalk behind the modern house communicating with the platform on which the ruins of the ancient castle were situated the wind had arisen and swept before it the clouds which had formerly obscured the sky the moon was high and at the full and all the lesser satellites of heaven shone forth in cloudless effulgence the scene which their light presented to mannering was in the highest degree unexpected and striking  we have observed that in the latter part of his journey our traveller approached the seashore without being aware how nearly he now perceived that the ruins of ellangowan castle were situated upon a promontory or projection of rock which formed one side of a small and placid bay on the seashore the modern mansion was placed lower though closely adjoining and the ground behind it descended to the sea by a small swelling green bank divided into levels by natural terraces on which grew some old trees and terminating upon the white sand the other side of the bay opposite to the old castle was a sloping and varied promontory covered chiefly with copsewood which on that favoured coast grows almost within watermark a fishermans cottage peeped from among the trees even at this dead hour of night there were lights moving upon the shore probably occasioned by the unloading a smuggling lugger from the isle of man which was lying in the bay on the light from the sashed door of the house being observed a halloo from the vessel of ware hawk douse the glim alarmed those who were on shore and the lights instantly disappeared  it was one hour after midnight and the prospect around was lovely the grey old towers of the ruin partly entire partly broken here bearing the rusty weatherstains of ages and there partially mantled with ivy stretched along the verge of the dark rock which rose on mannerings right hand in his front was the quiet bay whose little waves crisping and sparkling to the moonbeams rolled successively along its surface and dashed with a soft and murmuring ripple against the silvery beach to the left the woods advanced far into the ocean waving in the moonlight along ground of an undulating and varied form and presenting those varieties of light and shade and that interesting combination of glade and thicket upon which the eye delights to rest charmed with what it sees yet curious to pierce still deeper into the intricacies of the woodland scenery above rolled the planets each by its own liquid orbit of light distinguished from the inferior or more distant stars so strangely can imagination deceive even those by whose volition it has been excited that mannering while gazing upon these brilliant bodies was half inclined to believe in the influence ascribed to them by superstition over human events but mannering was a youthful lover and might perhaps be influenced by the feelings so exquisitely expressed by a modern poet       for fable is loves world his home his birthplace      delightedly dwells he mong fays and talismans      and spirits and delightedly believes      divinities being himself divine      the intelligible forms of ancient poets      the fair humanities of old religion      the powerthe beauty and the majesty      that had their haunts in dale or piny mountain      or forest by slow stream or pebbly spring      or chasms and watry depthsall these have vanishd      they live no longer in the faith of reason      but still the heart doth need a language still      doth the old instinct bring back the old names      and to yon starry world they now are gone      spirits or gods that used to share this earth      with man as with their friend and to the lover      yonder they move from yonder visible sky      shoot influence down and even at this day      t is jupiter who brings whateer is great      and venus who brings everything thats fair  such musings soon gave way to others alas he muttered my good old tutor who used to enter so deep into the controversy between heydon and chambers on the subject of astrology he would have looked upon the scene with other eyes and would have seriously endeavoured to discover from the respective positions of these luminaries their probable effects on the destiny of the newborn infant as if the courses or emanations of the stars superseded or at least were coordinate with divine providence well rest be with him he instilled into me enough of knowledge for erecting a scheme of nativity and therefore will i presently go about it so saying and having noted the position of the principal planetary bodies guy mannering returned to the house the laird met him in the parlour and acquainting him with great glee that the boy was a fine healthy little fellow seemed rather disposed to press further conviviality he admitted however mannerings plea of weariness and conducting him to his sleeping apartment left him to repose for the evening       chapter  iv     come and see trust thine own eyes     a fearful sign stands in the house of life     an enemy a fiend lurks close behind     the radiance of thy planet o be warned           coleridge from schiller   the belief in astrology was almost universal in the middle of the seventeenth century it began to waver and become doubtful towards the close of that period and in the beginning of the eighteenth the art fell into general disrepute and even under general ridicule yet it still retained many partizans even in the seats of learning grave and studious men were both to relinquish the calculations which had early become the principal objects of their studies and felt reluctant to descend from the predominating height to which a supposed insight into futurity by the power of consulting abstract influences and conjunctions had exalted them over the rest of mankind  among those who cherished this imaginary privilege with undoubting faith was an old clergyman with whom mannering was placed during his youth he wasted his eyes in observing the stars and his brains in calculations upon their various combinations his pupil in early youth naturally caught some portion of his enthusiasm and laboured for a time to make himself master of the technical process of astrological research so that before he became convinced of its absurdity william lilly himself would have allowed him a curious fancy and piercing judgment in resolving a question of nativity  on the present occasion he arose as early in the morning as the shortness of the day permitted and proceeded to calculate the nativity of the young heir of ellangowan he undertook the task secundum artem as well to keep up appearances as from a sort of curiosity to know whether he yet remembered and could practise the imaginary science he accordingly erected his scheme or figure of heaven divided into its twelve houses placed the planets therein according to the ephemeris and rectified their position to the hour and moment of the nativity without troubling our readers with the general prognostications which judicial astrology would have inferred from these circumstances in this diagram there was one significator which pressed remarkably upon our astrologers attention mars having dignity in the cusp of the twelfth house threatened captivity or sudden and violent death to the native and mannering having recourse to those further rules by which diviners pretend to ascertain the vehemency of this evil direction observed from the result that three periods would be particularly hazardoushis fifth his tenth his twentyfirst year  it was somewhat remarkable that mannering had once before tried a similar piece of foolery at the instance of sophia wellwood the young lady to whom he was attached and that a similar conjunction of planetary influence threatened her with death or imprisonment in her thirtyninth year she was at this time eighteen so that according to the result of the scheme in both cases the same year threatened her with the same misfortune that was presaged to the native or infant whom that night had introduced into the world struck with this coincidence mannering repeated his calculations and the result approximated the events predicted until at length the same month and day of the month seemed assigned as the period of peril to both  it will be readily believed that in mentioning this circumstance we lay no weight whatever upon the pretended information thus conveyed but it often happens such is our natural love for the marvellous that we willingly contribute our own efforts to beguile our better judgments whether the coincidence which i have mentioned was really one of those singular chances which sometimes happen against all ordinary calculations or whether mannering bewildered amid the arithmetical labyrinth and technical jargon of astrology had insensibly twice followed the same clue to guide him out of the maze or whether his imagination seduced by some point of apparent resemblance lent its aid to make the similitude between the two operations more exactly accurate than it might otherwise have been it is impossible to guess but the impression upon his mind that the results exactly corresponded was vividly and indelibly strong  he could not help feeling surprise at a coincidence so singular and unexpected does the devil mingle in the dance to avenge himself for our trifling with an art said to be of magical origin or is it possible as bacon and sir thomas browne admit that there is some truth in a sober and regulated astrology and that the influence of the stars is not to be denied though the due application of it by the knaves who pretend to practise the art is greatly to be suspected a moments consideration of the subject induced him to dismiss this opinion as fantastical and only sanctioned by those learned men either because they durst not at once shock the universal prejudices of their age or because they themselves were not altogether freed from the contagious influence of a prevailing superstition yet the result of his calculations in these two instances left so unpleasing an impression on his mind that like prospero he mentally relinquished his art and resolved neither in jest nor earnest ever again to practise judicial astrology  he hesitated a good deal what he should say to the laird of ellangowan concerning the horoscope of his firstborn and at length resolved plainly to tell him the judgment which he had formed at the same time acquainting him with the futility of the rules of art on which he had proceeded with this resolution he walked out upon the terrace  if the view of the scene around ellangowan had been pleasing by moonlight it lost none of its beauty by the light of the morning sun the land even in the month of november smiled under its influence a steep but regular ascent led from the terrace to the neighbouring eminence and conducted mannering to the front of the old castle it consisted of two massive round towers projecting deeply and darkly at the extreme angles of a curtain or flat wall which united them and thus protecting the main entrance that opened through a lofty arch in the centre of the curtain into the inner court of the castle the arms of the family carved in freestone frowned over the gateway and the portal showed the spaces arranged by the architect for lowering the portcullis and raising the drawbridge a rude farmgate made of young firtrees nailed together now formed the only safeguard of this once formidable entrance the esplanade in front of the castle commanded a noble prospect  the dreary scene of desolation through which mannerings road had lain on the preceding evening was excluded from the view by some rising ground and the landscape showed a pleasing alternation of hill and dale intersected by a river which was in some places visible and hidden in others where it rolled betwixt deep and wooded banks the spire of a church and the appearance of some houses indicated the situation of a village at the place where the stream had its junction with the ocean the vales seemed well cultivated the little inclosures into which they were divided skirting the bottom of the hills and sometimes carrying their lines of straggling hedgerows a little way up the ascent above these were green pastures tenanted chiefly by herds of black cattle then the staple commodity of the country whose distant low gave no unpleasing animation to the landscape the remoter hills were of a sterner character and at still greater distance swelled into mountains of dark heath bordering the horizon with a screen which gave a defined and limited boundary to the cultivated country and added at the same time the pleasing idea that it was sequestered and solitary the seacoast which mannering now saw in its extent corresponded in variety and beauty with the inland view in some places it rose into tall rocks frequently crowned with the ruins of old buildings towers or beacons which according to tradition were placed within sight of each other that in times of invasion or civil war they might communicate by signal for mutual defence and protection ellangowan castle was by far the most extensive and important of these ruins and asserted from size and situation the superiority which its founders were said once to have possessed among the chiefs and nobles of the district in other places the shore was of a more gentle description indented with small bays where the land sloped smoothly down or sent into the sea promontories covered with wood        a scene so different from what last nights journey had presaged produced a proportional effect upon mannering beneath his eye lay the modern housean awkward mansion indeed in point of architecture but well situated and with a warm pleasant exposure how happily thought our hero would life glide on in such a retirement on the one hand the striking remnants of ancient grandeur with the secret consciousness of family pride which they inspire on the other enough of modern elegance and comfort to satisfy every moderate wish here then and with thee sophia  we shall not pursue a lovers daydream any farther mannering stood a minute with his arms folded and then turned to the ruined castle  on entering the gateway he found that the rude magnificence of the inner court amply corresponded with the grandeur of the exterior on the one side ran a range of windows lofty and large divided by carved mullions of stone which had once lighted the great hall of the castle on the other were various buildings of different heights and dates yet so united as to present to the eye a certain general effect of uniformity of front the doors and windows were ornamented with projections exhibiting rude specimens of sculpture and tracery partly entire and partly broken down partly covered by ivy and trailing plants which grew luxuriantly among the ruins that end of the court which faced the entrance had also been formerly closed by a range of buildings but owing it was said to its having been battered by the ships of the parliament under deane during the long civil war this part of the castle was much more ruinous than the rest and exhibited a great chasm through which mannering could observe the sea and the little vessel an armed lugger which retained her station in the centre of the bay footnote the outline of the above description as far as the supposed ruins are concerned will be found somewhat to resemble the noble remains of carlaverock castle six or seven miles from dumfries and near to lochar moss while mannering was gazing round the ruins he heard from the interior of an apartment on the left hand the voice of the gipsy he had seen on the preceding evening he soon found an aperture through which he could observe her without being himself visible and could not help feeling that her figure her employment and her situation conveyed the exact impression of an ancient sibyl  she sate upon a broken cornerstone in the angle of a paved apartment part of which she had swept clean to afford a smooth space for the evolutions of her spindle a strong sunbeam through a lofty and narrow window fell upon her wild dress and features and afforded her light for her occupation the rest of the apartment was very gloomy equipt in a habit which mingled the national dress of the scottish common people with something of an eastern costume she spun a thread drawn from wool of three different colours black white and grey by assistance of those ancient implements of housewifery now almost banished from the land the distaff and spindle as she spun she sung what seemed to be a charm mannering after in vain attempting to make himself master of the exact words of her song afterwards attempted the following paraphrase of what from a few intelligible phrases he concluded to be its purport       twist ye twine ye even so      mingle shades of joy and woe      hope and fear and peace and strife      in the thread of human life       while the mystic twist is spinning      and the infants life beginning      dimly seen through twilight bending      lo what varied shapes attending       passions wild and follies vain      pleasures soon exchanged for pain      doubt and jealousy and fear      in the magic dance appear       now they wax and now they dwindle      whirling with the whirling spindle      twist ye twine ye even so      mingle human bliss and woe  ere our translator or rather our free imitator had arranged these stanzas in his head and while he was yet hammering out a rhyme for dwindle the task of the sibyl was accomplished or her wool was expended she took the spindle now charged with her labours and undoing the thread gradually measured it by casting it over her elbow and bringing each loop round between her forefinger and thumb when she had measured it out she muttered to herselfa hank but not a haill

the waves with which it mingled hallooed twice and with increasing impatiencemeg meg merrilies gipsyhagtausend deyvils  i am coming i am coming captain answered meg and in a moment or two the impatient commander whom she addressed made his appearance from the broken part of the ruins  he was apparently a seafaring man rather under the middle size and with a countenance bronzed by a thousand conflicts with the northeast wind his frame was prodigiously muscular strong and thickset so that it seemed as if a man of much greater height would have been an inadequate match in any close personal conflict he was hardfavoured and which was worse his face bore nothing of the insouciance the careless frolicsome jollity and vacant curiosity of a sailor on shore these qualities perhaps as much as any others contribute to the high popularity of our seamen and the general good inclination which our society expresses towards them their gallantry courage and hardihood are qualities which excite reverence and perhaps rather humble pacific landsmen in their presence and neither respect nor a sense of humiliation are feelings easily combined with a familiar fondness towards those who inspire them but the boyish frolics the exulting high spirits the unreflecting mirth of a sailor when enjoying himself on shore temper the more formidable points of his character there was nothing like these in this mans face on the contrary a surly and even savage scowl appeared to darken features which would have been harsh and unpleasant under any expression or modification where are you mother deyvilson he said with somewhat of a foreign accent though speaking perfectly good english donner and blitzen we have been staying this halfhour come bless the good ship and the voyage and be cursed to ye for a hag of satan  at this moment he noticed mannering who from the position which he had taken to watch meg merriliess incantations had the appearance of some one who was concealing himself being half hidden by the buttress behind which he stood the captain for such he styled himself made a sudden and startled pause and thrust his right hand into his bosom between his jacket and waistcoat as if to draw some weapon what cheer brother you seem on the outlook eh ere mannering somewhat struck by the mans gesture and insolent tone of voice had made any answer the gipsy emerged from her vault and joined the stranger he questioned her in an undertone looking at manneringa shark alongside eh  she answered in the same tone of underdialogue using the cant language of her

man which was inexpressibly disgusting his manners were those of a ruffian conscious of the suspicion attending his character yet aiming to bear it down by the affectation of a careless and hardy familiarity mannering briefly rejected his proffered civilities and after a surly goodmorning hatteraick retired with the gipsy to that part of the ruins from which he had first made his appearance a very narrow staircase here went down to the beach intended probably for the convenience of the garrison during a siege by this stair the couple equally amiable in appearance and respectable by profession descended to the seaside the soidisant captain embarked in a small boat with two men who appeared to wait for him and the gipsy remained on the shore reciting or singing and gesticulating with great vehemence       chapter  iv      you have fed upon my seignories      disparkd my parks and felld my forest woods      from mine own windows torn my household coat      razed out my impress

accomplished that task the sails began to ascend and the ship was got under way she fired three guns as a salute to the house of ellangowan and then shot away rapidly before the wind which blew off shore under all the sail she could crowd  ay ay said the laird who had sought mannering for some time and now joined him there they gothere go the freetradersthere go captain dirk hatteraick and the

terror of all the excise and customhouse cruisers they can make nothing of him he drubs them or he distances themand speaking of excise i come to bring you to breakfast and you shall have some tea that  mannering by this time was aware that one thought linked strangely on to another in the concatenation of worthy mr bertrams ideas  like orient pearls at random strung  and therefore before the current of his associations had drifted farther from the point he had left he brought him back by some inquiry about dirk hatteraick  o hes aagude sort of blackguard fellow eneugh naebody cares to trouble himsmuggler when his guns are in ballastprivateer or pirate faith when he gets them mounted he has done more mischief to the revenue folk than ony rogue that ever came out of ramsay  but my good sir such being his character i wonder he has any protection and encouragement on this coast  why mr mannering people must have brandy and tea and theres none in the country but what comes this way and then theres short accounts and maybe a keg or two or a dozen pounds left at your stabledoor instead of a dd lang account at christmas from duncan robb the grocer at kippletringan who has aye a sum to make up and either wants ready money or a shortdated bill now hatteraick will take wood or hell take bark or hell take barley or hell take just whats convenient at the time ill tell you a gude story about that there was ance a lairdthats macfie of gudgeonfordhe had a great number of kain hensthats hens that the tenant pays to the landlord like a sort of rent in kind they aye feed mine very ill luckie finniston sent up three that were a shame to be seen only last week and yet she has twelve bows sowing of victual indeed her goodman duncan finnistonthats him thats gonewe must all die mr mannering thats ower trueand speaking of that let us live in the meanwhile for heres breakfast on the table and the dominie ready to say the grace  the dominie did accordingly pronounce a benediction that exceeded in length any speech which mannering had yet heard him utter the tea which of course belonged to the noble captain hatteraicks trade was pronounced excellent still mannering hinted though with due delicacy at the risk of encouraging such desperate characters were it but in justice to the revenue i should have supposed  ah the revenue ladsfor mr bertram never embraced a general or abstract idea and his notion of the revenue was personified in the commissioners surveyors comptrollers and riding officers whom he happened to knowthe revenue lads can look sharp eneugh out for themselves no ane needs to help them and they have a the soldiers to assist them besides and as to justiceyou ll be surprised to hear it mr mannering but i am not a justice of peace  mannering assumed the expected look of surprise but thought within himself that the worshipful bench suffered no great deprivation from wanting the assistance of his goodhumoured landlord mr bertram had now hit upon one of the few subjects on which he felt sore and went on with some energy  no sir the name of godfrey bertram of ellangowan is not in the last commission though theres scarce a carle in the country that has a ploughgate of land but what he must ride to quartersessions and write jp after his name i ken fu weel whom i am obliged tosir thomas kittlecourt as good as telld me he would sit in my skirts if he had not my interest at the last election and because i chose to go with my own blood and third cousin the laird of balruddery they keepit me off the roll of freeholders and now there comes a new nomination of justices and i am left out and whereas they pretend it was because i let david macguffog the constable draw the warrants and manage the business his ain gate as if i had been a nose o wax its a main untruth for i granted but seven warrants in my life and the dominie wrote every one of themand if it had not been that unlucky business of sandy macgruthars that the constables should have keepit twa or three days up yonder at the auld castle just till they could get conveniency to send him to the county jailand that cost me eneugh o siller but i ken what sir thomas wants very weelit was just sic and siclike about the seat in the kirk o kilmagirdlewas i not entitled to have the front gallery facing the minister rather than maccrosskie of creochstone the son of deacon maccrosskie the dumfries weaver  mannering expressed his acquiescence in the justice of these various complaints  and then mr mannering there was the story about the road and the faulddike i ken sir thomas was behind there and i said plainly to the clerk to the trustees that i saw the cloven foot let them take that as they like would any gentleman or set of gentlemen go and drive a road right through the corner of a faulddike and take away as my agent observed to them like twa roods of gude moorland pasture and there was the story about choosing the collector of the cess  certainly sir it is hard you should meet with any neglect in a country where to judge from the extent of their residence your ancestors must have made a very important figure  very true mr mannering i am a plain man and do not dwell on these things and i must needs say i have little memory for them but i wish ye could have heard my fathers stories about the auld fights of the macdingawaiesthats the bertrams that now iswi the irish and wi the highlanders that came here in their berlings from ilay and cantire and how they went to the holy landthat is to jerusalem and jericho wi a their clan at their heelsthey had better have gaen to jamaica like sir thomas kittlecourts uncleand how they brought hame relics like those that catholics have and a flag thats up yonder in the garret if they had been casks of muscavado and puncheons of rum it would have been better for the estate at this day but theres little comparison between the auld keep at kittlecourt and the castle o ellangowan i doubt if the keeps forty feet of front but ye make no breakfast mr mannering yere no eating your meat allow me to recommend some of the kipper it was john hay that catcht it saturday was three weeks down at the stream below hempseed ford etc etc etc  the laird whose indignation had for some time kept him pretty steady to one topic now launched forth into his usual roving style of conversation which gave mannering ample time to reflect upon the disadvantages attending the situation which an hour before he had thought worthy of so much envy here was a country gentleman whose most estimable quality seemed his perfect goodnature secretly fretting himself and murmuring against others for causes which compared with any real evil in life must weigh like dust in the balance but such is the equal distribution of providence to those who lie out of the road of great afflictions are assigned petty vexations which answer all the purpose of disturbing their serenity and every reader must have observed that neither natural apathy nor acquired philosophy can render country gentlemen insensible to the grievances which occur at elections quartersessions and meetings of trustees  curious to investigate the manners of the country mannering took the advantage of a pause in good mr bertrams string of stories to inquire what captain hatteraick so earnestly wanted with the gipsy woman  o to bless his ship i suppose you must know mr mannering that these freetraders whom the law calls smugglers having no religion make it all up in superstition and they have as many spells and charms and nonsense  vanity and waur said the dominie it is a trafficking with the evil one spells periapts and charms are of his devicechoice arrows out of apollyons quiver  hold your peace dominie yere speaking for everby the way they were the first words the poor man had uttered that morning excepting that he said grace and returned thanksmr mannering cannot get in a word for ye and so mr mannering talking of astronomy and spells and these matters have ye been so kind as to consider what we were speaking about last night  i begin to think mr bertram with your worthy friend here that i have been rather jesting with edgetools and although neither you nor i nor any sensible man can put faith in the predictions of astrology yet as it has sometimes happened that inquiries into futurity undertaken in jest have in their results produced serious and unpleasant effects both upon actions and characters i really wish you would dispense with my replying to your question  it was easy to see that this evasive answer only rendered the lairds curiosity more uncontrollable mannering however was determined in his own mind not to expose the infant to the inconveniences which might have arisen from his being supposed the object of evil prediction he therefore delivered the paper into mr bertrams hand and requested him to keep it for five years with the seal unbroken until the month of november was expired after that date had intervened he left him at liberty to examine the writing trusting that the first fatal period being then safely overpassed no credit would be paid to its farther contents this mr bertram was content to promise and mannering to ensure his fidelity hinted at misfortunes which would certainly take place if his injunctions were neglected the rest of the day which mannering by mr bertrams invitation spent at ellangowan passed over without anything remarkable and on the morning of that which followed the traveller mounted his palfrey bade a courteous adieu to his hospitable landlord and to his clerical attendant repeated his good wishes for the prosperity of the family and then turning his horses head towards england disappeared from the sight of the inmates of ellangowan he must also disappear from that of our readers for it is to another and later period of his life that the present narrative relates     chapter  vi       next the justice      in fair round belly with good capon lined      with eyes severe and beard of formal cut      full of wise saws and modern instances      and so he plays his part          as you like it   when mrs bertram of ellangowan was able to hear the news of what had passed during her confinement her apartment rung with all manner of gossiping respecting the handsome young student from oxford who had told such a fortune by the stars to the young laird blessings on his dainty face the form accent and manners of the stranger were expatiated upon his horse bridle saddle and stirrups did not remain unnoticed all this made a great impression upon the mind of mrs bertram for the good lady had no small store of superstition  her first employment when she became capable of a little work was to make a small velvet bag for the scheme of nativity which she had obtained from her husband her fingers itched to break the seal but credulity proved stronger than curiosity and she had the firmness to inclose it in all its integrity within two slips of parchment which she sewed round it to prevent its being chafed the whole was then put into the velvet bag aforesaid and hung as a charm round the neck of the infant where his mother resolved it should remain until the period for the legitimate satisfaction of her curiosity should arrive  the father also resolved to do his part by the child in securing him a good education and with the view that it should commence with the first dawnings of reason dominie sampson was easily induced to renounce his public profession of parish schoolmaster make his constant residence at the place and in consideration of a sum not quite equal to the wages of a footman even at that time to undertake to communicate to the future laird of ellangowan all the erudition which he had and all the graces and accomplishments whichhe had not indeed but which he had never discovered that he wanted in this arrangement the laird found also his private advantage securing the constant benefit of a patient auditor to whom he told his stories when they were alone and at whose expense he could break a sly jest when he had company  about four years after this time a great commotion took place in the county where ellangowan is situated  those who watched the signs of the times had long been of opinion that a change of ministry was about to take place and at length after a due proportion of hopes fears and delays rumours from good authority and bad authority and no authority at all after some clubs had drank up with this statesman and others down with him after riding and running and posting and addressing and counteraddressing and proffers of lives and fortunes the blow was at length struck the administration of the day was dissolved and parliament as a natural consequence was dissolved also  sir thomas kittlecourt like other members in the same situation posted down to his county and met but an indifferent reception he was a partizan of the old administration and the friends of the new had already set about an active canvass in behalf of john featherhead esq who kept the best hounds and hunters in the shire among others who joined the standard of revolt was gilbert glossin writer in agent for the laird of ellangowan this honest gentleman had either been refused some favour by the old member or what is as probable he had got all that he had the most distant pretension to ask and could only look to the other side for fresh advancement mr glossin had a vote upon ellangowans property and he was now determined that his patron should have one also there being no doubt which side mr bertram would embrace in the contest he easily persuaded ellangowan that it would be creditable to him to take the field at the head of as strong a party as possible and immediately went to work making votes as every scotch lawyer knows how by splitting and subdividing the superiorities upon this ancient and once powerful barony these were so extensive that by dint of clipping and paring here adding and eking there and creating overlords upon all the estate which bertram held of the crown they advanced at the day of contest at the head of ten as good men of parchment as ever took the oath of trust and possession this strong reinforcement turned the dubious day of battle the principal and his agent divided the honour the reward fell to the latter exclusively mr gilbert glossin was made clerk of the peace and godfrey bertram had his name inserted in a new commission of justices issued immediately upon the sitting of the parliament  this had been the summit of mr bertrams ambition not that he liked either the trouble or the responsibility of the office but he thought it was a dignity to which he was well entitled and that it had been withheld from him by malice prepense but there is an old and true scotch proverb fools should not have chapping sticks that is weapons of offence mr bertram was no sooner possessed of the judicial authority which he had so much longed for than he began to exercise it with more severity than mercy and totally belied all the opinions which had hitherto been formed of his inert goodnature we have read somewhere of a justice of peace who on being nominated in the commission wrote a letter to a bookseller for the statutes respecting his official duty in the following orthographyplease send the ax relating to a gustus pease no doubt when this learned gentleman had possessed himself of the axe he hewed the laws with it to some purpose mr bertram was not quite so ignorant of english grammar as his worshipful predecessor but augustus pease himself could not have used more indiscriminately the weapon unwarily put into his hand  in good earnest he considered the commission with which he had been entrusted as a personal mark of favour from his sovereign forgetting that he had formerly thought his being deprived of a privilege or honour common to those of his rank was the result of mere party cabal he commanded his trusty aiddecamp dominie sampson to read aloud the commission and at the first words the king has been pleased to appointpleased he exclaimed in a transport of gratitude honest gentleman im sure he cannot be better pleased than i am  accordingly unwilling to confine his gratitude to mere feelings or verbal expressions he gave full current to the newborn zeal of office and endeavoured to express his sense of the honour conferred upon him by an unmitigated activity in the discharge of his duty new brooms it is said sweep clean and i myself can bear witness that on the arrival of a new housemaid the ancient hereditary and domestic spiders who have spun their webs over the lower division of my bookshelves consisting chiefly of law and divinity during the peaceful reign of her predecessor fly at full speed before the probationary inroads of the new mercenary even so the laird of ellangowan ruthlessly commenced his magisterial reform at the expense of various established and superannuated pickers and stealers who had been his neighbours for half a century he wrought his miracles like a second duke humphrey and by the influence of the beadles rod caused the lame to walk the blind to see and the palsied to labour he detected poachers blackfishers orchardbreakers and pigeonshooters had the applause of the bench for his reward and the public credit of an active magistrate  all this good had its rateable proportion of evil even an admitted nuisance of ancient standing should not be abated without some caution the zeal of our worthy friend now involved in great distress sundry personages whose idle and mendicant habits his own lachesse had contributed to foster until these habits had become irreclaimable or whose real incapacity for exertion rendered them fit objects in their own phrase for the charity of all welldisposed christians the longremembered beggar who for twenty years had made his regular rounds within the neighbourhood received rather as an humble friend than as an object of charity was sent to the neighbouring workhouse the decrepit dame who travelled round the parish upon a handbarrow circulating from house to house like a bad shilling which every one is in haste to pass to his neighbourshe who used to call for her bearers as loud or louder than a traveller demands posthorseseven she shared the same disastrous fate the daft jock who half knave half idiot had been the sport of each succeeding race of village children for a good part of a century was remitted to the county bridewell where secluded from free air and sunshine the only advantages he was capable of enjoying he pined and died in the course of six months the old sailor who had so long rejoiced the smoky rafters of every kitchen in the country by singing captain ward and bold admiral benbow was banished from the county for no better reason than that he was supposed to speak with a strong irish accent even the annual rounds of the pedlar were abolished by the justice in his hasty zeal for the administration of rural police  these things did not pass without notice and censure we are not made of wood or stone and the things which connect themselves with our hearts and habits cannot like bark or lichen be rent away without our missing them the farmers dame lacked her usual share of intelligence perhaps also the selfapplause which she had felt while distributing the awmous alms in shape of a gowpen handful of oatmeal to the mendicant who brought the news the cottage felt inconvenience from interruption of the petty trade carried on by the itinerant dealers the children lacked their supply of sugarplums and toys the young women wanted pins ribbons combs and ballads and the old could no longer barter their eggs for salt snuff and tobacco all these circumstances brought the busy laird of ellangowan into discredit which was the more general on account of his former popularity even his lineage was brought up in judgment against him they thought naething of what the like of greenside or burnville or viewforth might do that were strangers in the country but ellangowan that had been a name amang them since the mirk monanday and lang beforehim to be grinding the puir at that rate they cad his grandfather the wicked laird but though he was whiles fractious aneuch when he got into roving company and had taen the drap drink he would have scorned to gang on at this gate na na the muckle chumlay in the auld place reeked like a killogie in his time and there were as mony puir folk riving at the banes in the court and about the door as there were gentles in the ha and the leddy on ilka christmas night as it came round gae twelve siller pennies to ilka puir body about in honour of the twelve apostles like they were fond to ca it papistrie but i think our great folk might take a lesson frae the papists whiles they gie another sort o help to puir folk than just dinging down a saxpence in the brod on the sabbath and kilting and scourging and drumming them a the sax days o the week besides  such was the gossip over the good twopenny in every alehouse within three or four miles of ellangowan that being about the diameter of the orbit in which our friend godfrey bertram esq j p must be considered as the principal luminary still greater scope was given to evil tongues by the removal of a colony of gipsies with one of whom our reader is somewhat acquainted and who had for a great many years enjoyed their chief settlement upon the estate of ellangowan       chapter  vii      come princes of the ragged regiment      you of the blood prigs my most upright lord      and these what name or title eer they bear      jarkman or patrico cranke or clapperdudgeon      prater or abrammani speak of all            beggars bush   although the character of those gipsy tribes which formerly inundated most of the nations of europe and which in some degree still subsist among them as a distinct people is generally understood the reader will pardon my saying a few words respecting their situation in scotland  it is well known that the gipsies were at an early period acknowledged as a separate and independent race by one of the scottish monarchs and that they were less favourably distinguished by a subsequent law which rendered the character of gipsy equal in the judicial balance to that of common and habitual thief and prescribed his punishment accordingly notwithstanding the severity of this and other statutes the fraternity prospered amid the distresses of the country and received large accessions from among those whom famine oppression or the sword of war had deprived of the ordinary means of subsistence they lost in a great measure by this intermixture the national character of egyptians and became a mingled race having all the idleness and predatory habits of their eastern ancestors with a ferocity which they probably borrowed from the men of the north who joined their society they travelled in different bands and had rules among themselves by which each tribe was confined to its own district the slightest invasion of the precincts which had been assigned to another tribe produced desperate skirmishes in which there was often much blood shed  the patriotic fletcher of saltoun drew a picture of these banditti about a century ago which my readers will peruse with astonishment  there are at this day in scotland besides a great many poor families very meanly provided for by the church boxes with others who by living on bad food fall into various diseases two hundred thousand people begging from door to door these are not only no way advantageous but a very grievous burden to so poor a country and though the number of them be perhaps double to what it was formerly by reason of this present great distress yet in all times there have been about one hundred thousand of those vagabonds who have lived without any regard or subjection either to the laws of the land or even those of god and nature    no magistrate could ever discover or be informed which way one in a hundred of these wretches died or that ever they were baptized many murders have been discovered among them and they are not only a most unspeakable oppression to poor tenants who if they give not bread or some kind of provision to perhaps forty such villains in one day are sure to be insulted by them but they rob many poor people who live in houses distant from any neighbourhood in years of plenty many thousands of them meet together in the mountains where they feast and riot for many days and at country weddings markets burials and other the like public occasions they are to be seen both man and woman perpetually drunk cursing blaspheming and fighting together  notwithstanding the deplorable picture presented in this extract and which fletcher himself though the energetic and eloquent friend of freedom saw no better mode of correcting than by introducing a system of domestic slavery the progress of time and increase both of the means of life and of the power of the laws gradually reduced this dreadful evil within more narrow bounds the tribes of gipsies jockies or cairdsfor by all these denominations such banditti were knownbecame few in number and many were entirely rooted out still however a sufficient number remained to give occasional alarm and constant vexation some rude handicrafts were entirely resigned to these itinerants particularly the art of trenchermaking of manufacturing hornspoons and the whole mystery of the tinker to these they added a petty trade in the coarse sorts of earthenware such were their ostensible means of livelihood each tribe had usually some fixed place of rendezvous which they occasionally occupied and considered as their standing camp and in the vicinity of which they generally abstained from depredation they had even talents and accomplishments which made them occasionally useful and entertaining many cultivated music with success and the favourite fiddler or piper of a district was often to be found in a gipsy town they understood all outofdoor sports especially otterhunting fishing or finding game they bred the best and boldest terriers and sometimes had good pointers for sale in winter the women told fortunes the men showed tricks of legerdemain and these accomplishments often helped to while away a weary or stormy evening in the circle of the farmers ha the wildness of their character and the indomitable pride with which they despised all regular labour commanded a certain awe which was not diminished by the consideration that these strollers were a vindictive race and were restrained by no check either of fear or conscience from taking desperate vengeance upon those who had offended them these tribes were in short the pariahs of scotland living like wild indians among european settlers and like them judged of rather by their own customs habits and opinions than as if they had been members of the civilised part of the community some hordes of them yet remain chiefly in such situations as afford a ready escape either into a waste country or into another jurisdiction nor are the features of their character much softened their numbers however are so greatly diminished that instead of one hundred thousand as calculated by fletcher it would now perhaps be impossible to collect above five hundred throughout all scotland  a tribe of these itinerants to whom meg merrilies appertained had long been as stationary as their habits permitted in a glen upon the estate of ellangowan they had there erected a few huts which they denominated their city of refuge and where when not absent on excursions they harboured unmolested as the crows that roosted in the old ashtrees around them they had been such long occupants that they were considered in some degree as proprietors of the wretched shealings which they inhabited this protection they were said anciently to have repaid by service to the laird in war or more frequently by infesting or plundering the lands of those neighbouring barons with whom he chanced to be at feud latterly their services were of a more pacific nature the women spun mittens for the lady and knitted boothose for the laird which were annually presented at christmas with great form the aged sibyls blessed the bridal bed of the laird when he married and the cradle of the heir when born the men repaired her ladyships cracked china and assisted the laird in his sporting parties wormed his dogs and cut the ears of his terrier puppies the children gathered nuts in the woods and cranberries in the moss and mushrooms on the pastures for tribute to the place these acts of voluntary service and acknowledgments of dependence were rewarded by protection on some occasions connivance on others and broken victuals ale and brandy when circumstances called for a display of generosity and this mutual intercourse of good offices which had been carried on for at least two centuries rendered the inhabitants of derncleugh a kind of privileged retainers upon the estate of ellangowan the knaves were the lairds exceeding good friends and he would have deemed himself very ill used if his countenance could not now and then have borne them out against the law of the country and the local magistrate but this friendly union was soon to be dissolved  the community of derncleugh who cared for no rogues but their own were wholly without alarm at the severity of the justices proceedings towards other itinerants they had no doubt that he determined to suffer no mendicants or strollers in the country but what resided on his own property and practised their trade by his immediate permission implied or expressed nor was mr bertram in a hurry to exert his newlyacquired authority at the expense of these old settlers but he was driven on by circumstances  at the quartersessions our new justice was publicly upbraided by a gentleman of the opposite party in county politics that while he affected a great zeal for the public police and seemed ambitious of the fame of an active magistrate he fostered a tribe of the greatest rogues in the country and permitted them to harbour within a mile of the house of ellangowan to this there was no reply for the fact was too evident and well known the laird digested the taunt as he best could and in his way home amused himself with speculations on the easiest method of ridding himself of these vagrants who brought a stain upon his fair fame as a magistrate just as he had resolved to take the first opportunity of quarrelling with the pariahs of derncleugh a cause of provocation presented itself  since our friends advancement to be a conservator of the peace he had caused the gate at the head of his avenue which formerly having only one hinge remained at all times hospitably openhe had caused this gate i say to be newly hung and handsomely painted he had also shut up with paling curiously twisted with furze certain holes in the fences adjoining through which the gipsy boys used to scramble into the plantations to gather birds nests the seniors of the village to make a short cut from one point to another and the lads and lasses for evening rendezvousall without offence taken or leave asked but these halcyon days were now to have an end and a minatory inscription on one side of the gate intimated prosecution according to law the painter had spelt it persecutionlun vaut bien lautre to all who should be found trespassing on these inclosures on the other side for uniformitys sake was a precautionary annunciation of springguns and mantraps of such formidable powers that said the rubrick with an emphatic nota beneif a man goes in they will break a horses leg  in defiance of these threats six wellgrown gipsy boys and girls were riding cockhorse upon the new gate and plaiting mayflowers which it was but too evident had been gathered within the forbidden precincts with as much anger as he was capable of feeling or perhaps of assuming the laird commanded them to descendthey paid no attention to his mandate he then began to pull them down one after anotherthey resisted passively at least each sturdy bronzed varlet making himself as heavy as he could or climbing up as fast as he was dismounted  the laird then called in the assistance of his servant a surly fellow who had immediate recourse to his horsewhip a few lashes sent the party ascampering and thus commenced the first breach of the peace between the house of ellangowan and the gipsies of derncleugh  the latter could not for some time imagine that the war was real until they found that their children were horsewhipped by the grieve when found trespassing that their asses were poinded by the groundofficer when left in the plantations or even when turned to graze by the roadside against the provision of the turnpike acts that the constable began to make curious inquiries into their mode of gaining a livelihood and expressed his surprise that the men should sleep in the hovels all day and be abroad the greater part of the night  when matters came to this point the gipsies without scruple entered upon measures of retaliation ellangowans henroosts were plundered his linen stolen from the lines or bleachingground his fishings poached his dogs kidnapped his growing trees cut or barked much petty mischief was done and some evidently for the mischiefs sake on the other hand warrants went forth without mercy to pursue search for take and apprehend and notwithstanding their dexterity one or two of the depredators were unable to avoid conviction one a stout young fellow who sometimes had gone to sea afishing was handed over to the captain of the impress service at d two children were soundly flogged and one egyptian matron sent to the house of correction  still however the gipsies made no motion to leave the spot which they had so long inhabited and mr bertram felt an unwillingness to deprive them of their ancient city of refuge so that the petty warfare we have noticed continued for several months without increase or abatement of hostilities on either side       chapter  viii      so the red indian by ontarios side      nursed hardy on the brindled panthers hide      as fades his swarthy race with anguish sees      the white mans cottage rise beneath the trees      he leaves the shelter of his native wood      he leaves the murmur of ohios flood      and forward rushing in indignant grief      where never foot has trod the fallen leaf      he bends his course where twilight reigns sublime      oer forests silent since the birth of time            scenes of infancy   in tracing the rise and progress of the scottish maroon war we must not omit to mention that years had rolled on and that little harry bertram one of the hardiest and most lively children that ever made a sword and grenadiers cap of rushes now approached his fifth revolving birthday a hardihood of disposition which early developed itself made him already a little wanderer he was well acquainted with every patch of lea ground and dingle around ellangowan and could tell in his broken language upon what baulks grew the bonniest flowers and what copse had the ripest nuts he repeatedly terrified his attendants by clambering about the ruins of the old castle and had more than once made a stolen excursion as far as the gipsy hamlet  on these occasions he was generally brought back by meg merrilies who though she could not be prevailed upon to enter the place of ellangowan after her nephew had been given up to the pressgang did not apparently extend her resentment to the child on the contrary she often contrived to waylay him in his walks sing him a gipsy song give him a ride upon her jackass and thrust into his pocket a piece of gingerbread or a redcheeked apple this womans ancient attachment to the family repelled and checked in every other direction seemed to rejoice in having some object on which it could yet repose and expand itself she prophesied a hundred times that young mr harry would be the pride o the family and there hadna been sic a sprout frae the auld aik since the death of arthur macdingawaie that was killed in the battle o the bloody bay as for the present stick it was good for nothing but firewood on one occasion when the child was ill she lay all night below the window chanting a rhyme which she believed sovereign as a febrifuge and could neither be prevailed upon to enter the house nor to leave the station she had chosen till she was informed that the crisis was over  the affection of this woman became matter of suspicion not indeed to the laird who was never hasty in suspecting evil but to his wife who had indifferent health and poor spirits she was now far advanced in a second pregnancy and as she could not walk abroad herself and the woman who attended upon harry was young and thoughtless she prayed dominie sampson to undertake the task of watching the boy in his rambles when he should not be otherwise accompanied the dominie loved his young charge and was enraptured with his own success in having already brought him so far in his learning as to spell words of three syllables the idea of this early prodigy of erudition being carried off by the gipsies like a second adam smithfootnote the father of economical philosophy was when a child actually carried off by gipsies and remained some hours in their possession was not to be tolerated and accordingly though the charge was contrary to all his habits of life he readily undertook it and might be seen stalking about with a mathematical problem in his head and his eye upon a child of five years old whose rambles led him into a hundred awkward situations twice was the dominie chased by a crossgrained cow once he fell into the brook crossing at the steppingstones and another time was bogged up to the middle in the slough of lochend in attempting to gather a waterlily for the young laird it was the opinion of the village matrons who relieved sampson on the latter occasion that the laird might as weel trust the care o his bairn to a potatoe bogle but the good dominie bore all his disasters with gravity and serenity equally imperturbable prodigious was the only ejaculation they ever extorted from the muchenduring man        the laird had by this time determined to make rootandbranch work with the maroons of derncleugh the old servants shook their heads at his proposal and even dominie sampson ventured upon an indirect remonstrance as however it was couched in the oracular phrase ne moveas camerinam neither the allusion nor the language in which it was expressed were calculated for mr bertrams edification and matters proceeded against the gipsies in form of law every door in the hamlet was chalked by the groundofficer in token of a formal warning to remove at next term still however they showed no symptoms either of submission or of compliance at length the termday the fatal martinmas arrived and violent measures of ejection were resorted to a strong posse of peaceofficers sufficient to render all resistance vain charged the inhabitants to depart by noon and as they did not obey the officers in terms of their warrant proceeded to unroof the cottages and pull down the wretched doors and windowsa summary and effectual mode of ejection still practised in some remote parts of scotland when a tenant proves refractory the gipsies for a time beheld the work of destruction in sullen silence and inactivity then set about saddling and loading their asses and making preparations for their departure these were soon accomplished where all had the habits of wandering tartars and they set forth on their journey to seek new settlements where their patrons should neither be of the quorum nor custos rotulorum  certain qualms of feeling had deterred ellangowan from attending in person to see his tenants expelled he left the executive part of the business to the officers of the law under the immediate direction of frank kennedy a supervisor or ridingofficer belonging to the excise who had of late become intimate at the place and of whom we shall have more to say in the next chapter mr bertram himself chose that day to make a visit to a friend at some distance but it so happened notwithstanding his precautions that he could not avoid meeting his late tenants during their retreat from his property  it was in a hollow way near the top of a steep ascent upon the verge of the ellangowan estate that mr bertram met the gipsy procession four or five men formed the advanced guard wrapped in long loose greatcoats that hid their tall slender figures as the large slouched hats drawn over their brows concealed their wild features dark eyes and swarthy faces two of them carried long fowlingpieces one wore a broadsword without a sheath and all had the highland dirk though they did not wear that weapon openly or ostentatiously behind them followed the train of laden asses and small carts or tumblers as they were called in that country on which were laid the decrepit and the helpless the aged and infant part of the exiled community the women in their red cloaks and straw hats the elder children with bare heads and bare feet and almost naked bodies had the immediate care of the little caravan the road was narrow running between two broken banks of sand and mr bertrams servant rode forward smacking his whip with an air of authority and motioning to the drivers to allow free passage to their betters his signal was unattended to he then called to the men who lounged idly on before stand to your beasts heads and make room for the laird to pass  he shall have his share of the road answered a male gipsy from under his slouched and largebrimmed hat and without raising his face and he shall have nae mair the highway is as free to our cuddies as to his gelding  the tone of the man being sulky and even menacing mr bertram thought it best to put his dignity in his pocket and pass by the procession quietly on such space as they chose to leave for his accommodation which was narrow enough to cover with an appearance of indifference his feeling of the want of respect with which he was treated he addressed one of the men as he passed him without any show of greeting salute or recognitiongiles baillie he said have you heard that your son gabriel is well the question respected the young man who had been pressed  if i had heard otherwise said the old man looking up with a stern and menacing countenance you should have heard of it too and he plodded on his way tarrying no further question footnote this anecdote is a literal fact when the laird had pressed on with difficulty among a crowd of familiar faces which had on all former occasions marked his approach with the reverence due to that of a superior being but in which he now only read hatred and contempt and had got clear of the throng he could not help turning his horse and looking back to mark the progress of their march the group would have been an excellent subject for the pencil of calotte the van had already reached a small and stunted thicket which was at the bottom of the hill and which gradually hid the line of march until the last stragglers disappeared  his sensations were bitter enough the race it is true which he had thus summarily dismissed from their ancient place of refuge was idle and vicious but had he endeavoured to render them otherwise they were not more irregular characters now than they had been while they were admitted to consider themselves as a sort of subordinate dependents of his family and ought the mere circumstance of his becoming a magistrate to have made at once such a change in his conduct towards them some means of reformation ought at least to have been tried before sending seven families at once upon the wide world and depriving them of a degree of countenance which withheld them at least from atrocious guilt there was also a natural yearning of heart on parting with so many known and familiar faces and to this feeling godfrey bertram was peculiarly accessible from the limited qualities of his mind which sought its principal amusements among the petty objects around him as he was about to turn his horses head to pursue his journey meg merrilies who had lagged behind the troop unexpectedly presented herself  she was standing upon one of those high precipitous banks which as we before noticed overhung the road so that she was placed considerably higher than ellangowan even though he was on horseback and her tall figure relieved against the clear blue sky seemed almost of supernatural stature we have noticed that there was in her general attire or rather in her mode of adjusting it somewhat of a foreign costume artfully adopted perhaps for the purpose of adding to the effect of her spells and predictions or perhaps from some traditional notions respecting the dress of her ancestors on this occasion she had a large piece of red cotton cloth rolled about her head in the form of a turban from beneath which her dark eyes flashed with uncommon lustre her long and tangled black hair fell in elflocks from the folds of this singular headgear her attitude was that of a sibyl in frenzy and she stretched out in her right hand a sapling bough which seemed just pulled  ill be dd said the groom if she has not been cutting the young ashes in the dukit park the laird made no answer but continued to look at the figure which was thus perched above his path        ride your ways said the gipsy ride your ways laird of ellangowan ride your ways godfrey bertram this day have

ride een your ways for these are the last words yell ever hear meg merrilies speak and this is the last reise that ill ever cut in the bonny woods of ellangowan  so saying she broke the sapling she held in her hand and flung it into the road margaret of anjou bestowing on her triumphant foes her keenedged malediction could not have turned from them with a gesture more proudly contemptuous the laird was clearing his voice to speak and thrusting his hand in his pocket to find a halfcrown the gipsy waited neither for his reply nor his donation but strode down the hill to overtake the caravan  ellangowan rode pensively home and it was remarkable that he did not mention this interview to any of his family the groom was not so reserved he told the story at great length to a full audience in the kitchen and concluded by swearing that if ever the devil spoke by the mouth of a woman he had spoken by that of meg merrilies that blessed day       chapter  ix      paint scotland greeting ower her thrissle      her mutchkin stoup as tooms a whistle      and dnd excisemen in a bustle      seizing a stell      triumphant crushint like a mussel      or lampit shell           burns   during the period of mr bertrams active magistracy he did not forget the affairs of the revenue smuggling for which the isle of man then afforded peculiar facilities was general or rather universal all along the southwestern coast of scotland almost all the common people were engaged in these practices the gentry connived at them and the officers of the revenue were frequently discountenanced in the exercise of their duty by those who should have protected them  there was at this period employed as a ridingofficer or supervisor in that part of the country a certain francis kennedy already named in our narrativea stout resolute and active man who had made seizures to a great amount and was proportionally hated by those who had an interest in the fair trade as they called the pursuit of these contraband adventurers this person was natural son to a gentleman of good family owing to which circumstance and to his being of a jolly convivial disposition and singing a good song he was admitted to the occasional society of the gentlemen of the country and was a member of several of their clubs for practising athletic games at which he was particularly expert  at ellangowan kennedy was a frequent and always an acceptable guest his vivacity relieved mr bertram of the trouble of thought and the labour which it cost him to support a detailed communication of ideas while the daring and dangerous exploits which he had undertaken in the discharge of his office formed excellent conversation to all these revenue adventures did the laird of ellangowan seriously incline and the amusement which he derived from kennedys society formed an excellent reason for countenancing and assisting the narrator in the execution of his invidious and hazardous duty  frank kennedy he said was a gentleman though on the wrang side of the blanket he was connected with the family of ellangowan through the house of glengubble the last laird of glengubble would have brought the estate into the ellangowan line but happening to go to harrigate he there met with miss jean hadawayby the by the green dragon at harrigate is the best house of the twabut for frank kennedy hes in one sense a gentleman born and its a shame not to support him against these blackguard smugglers  after this league had taken place between judgment and execution it chanced that captain dirk hatteraick had landed a cargo of spirits and other contraband goods upon the beach not far from ellangowan and confiding in the indifference with which the laird had formerly regarded similar infractions of the law he was neither very anxious to conceal nor to expedite the transaction the consequence was that mr frank kennedy armed with a warrant from ellangowan and supported by some of the lairds people who knew the country and by a party of military poured down upon the kegs bales and bags and after a desperate affray in which severe wounds were given and received succeeded in clapping the broad arrow upon the articles and bearing them off in triumph to the next customhouse dirk hatteraick vowed in dutch german and english a deep and full revenge both against the gauger and his abettors and all who knew him thought it likely he would keep his word  a few days after the departure of the gipsy tribe mr bertram asked his lady one morning at breakfast whether this was not little harrys birthday  five years auld exactly this blessed day answered the lady so we may look into the english gentlemans paper  mr bertram liked to show his authority in trifles no my dear not till tomorrow the last time i was at quartersessions the sheriff told us that diesthat dies inceptusin short you dont understand latin but it means that a termday is not begun till its ended  that sounds like nonsense my dear  may be so my dear but it may be very good law for all that i am sure speaking of termdays i wish as frank kennedy says that whitsunday would kill martinmas and be hanged for the murder for there i have got a letter about that interest of jenny cairnss and deil a tenants been at the place yet wi a boddle of rent nor will not till candlemas but speaking of frank kennedy i daresay hell be here the day for he was away round to wigton to warn a kings ship thats lying in the bay about dirk hatteraicks lugger being on the coast again and hell be back this day so well have a bottle of claret and drink little harrys health  i wish replied the lady frank kennedy would let dirk hatteraick alane what needs he make himself mair busy than other folk cannot he sing his sang and take his drink and draw his salary like collector snail honest man that never fashes ony body and i wonder at you laird for meddling and making did we ever want to send for tea or brandy frae the boroughtown when dirk hatteraick used to come quietly into the bay  mrs bertram you know nothing of these matters do you think it becomes a magistrate to let his own house be made a receptacle for smuggled goods frank kennedy will show you the penalties in the act and ye ken yoursell they used to put their run goods into the auld place of ellangowan up by there  oh dear mr bertram and what the waur were the was and the vault o the auld castle for having a whin kegs o brandy in them at an orra time i am sure ye were not obliged to ken ony thing about it and what the waur was the king that the lairds here got a soup o drink and the ladies their drap o tea at a reasonable rateits a shame to them to pit such taxes on themand was na i much the better of these flanders head and pinners that dirk hatteraick sent me a the way from antwerp it will be lang or the king sends me ony thing or frank kennedy either and then ye would quarrel with these gipsies too i expect every day to hear the barnyards in a low  i tell you once more my dear you dont understand these thingsand theres frank kennedy coming galloping up the avenue  aweel aweel ellangowan said the lady raising her voice as the laird left the room i wish ye may understand them yoursell thats a  from this nuptial dialogue the laird joyfully escaped to meet his faithful friend mr kennedy who arrived in high spirits for the love of life ellangowan he said get up to the castle youll see that old fox dirk hatteraick and his majestys hounds in full cry after him so saying he flung his horses bridle to a boy and ran up the ascent to the old castle followed by the laird and indeed by several others of the family alarmed by the sound of guns from the sea now distinctly heard  on gaining that part of the ruins which commanded the most extensive outlook they saw a lugger with all her canvass crowded standing across the bay closely pursued by a sloop of war that kept firing upon the chase from her bows which the lugger returned with her sternchasers theyre but at long bowls yet cried kennedy in great exultation but they will be closer by and by dn him hes starting his cargo i see the good nantz pitching overboard keg after keg thats a dd ungenteel thing of mr hatteraick as i shall let him know by and by now now theyve got the wind of him thats it thats it hark to him hark to him now my dogs now my dogs hark to ranger hark  i think said the old gardener to one of the maids the gangers fie by which word the common people express those violent spirits which they think a presage of death  meantime the chase continued the lugger being piloted with great ability and using every nautical shift to make her escape had now reached and was about to double the headland which formed the extreme point of land on the left side of the bay when a ball having hit the yard in the slings the mainsail fell upon the deck the consequence of this accident appeared inevitable but could not be seen by the spectators for the vessel which had just doubled the headland lost steerage and fell out of their sight behind the promontory the sloop of war crowded all sail to pursue but she had stood too close upon the cape so that they were obliged to wear the vessel for fear of going ashore and to make a large tack back into the bay in order to recover searoom enough to double the headland  they ll lose her by cargo and lugger one or both said kennedy i must gallop away to the point of warroch this was the headland so often mentioned and make them a signal where she has drifted to on the other side goodbye for an hour ellangowan get out the gallon punchbowl and plenty of lemons ill stand for the french article by the time i come back and well drink the young lairds health in a bowl that would swim the collectors yawl so saying he mounted his horse and galloped off  about a mile from the house and upon the verge of the woods which as we have said covered a promontory terminating in the cape called the point of warroch kennedy met young harry bertram attended by his tutor dominie sampson he had often promised the child a ride upon his galloway and from singing dancing and playing punch for his amusement was a particular favourite he no sooner came scampering up the path than the boy loudly claimed his promise and kennedy who saw no risk in indulging him and wished to tease the dominie in whose visage he read a remonstrance caught up harry from the ground placed him before him and continued his route sampsons peradventure master kennedy being lost in the clatter of his horses feet the pedagogue hesitated a moment whether he should go after them but kennedy being a person in full confidence of the family and with whom he himself had no delight in associating being that he was addicted unto profane and scurrilous jests he continued his own walk at his own pace till he reached the place of ellangowan  the spectators from the ruined walls of the castle were still watching the sloop of war which at length but not without the loss of considerable time recovered searoom enough to weather the point of warroch and was lost to their sight behind that wooded promontory some time afterwards the discharges of several cannon were heard at a distance and after an interval a still louder explosion as of a vessel blown up and a cloud of smoke rose above the trees and mingled with the blue sky all then separated on their different occasions auguring variously upon the fate of the smuggler but the majority insisting that her capture was inevitable if she had not already gone to the bottom  it is near our dinnertime my dear said mrs bertram to her husband will it be lang before mr kennedy comes back  i expect him every moment my dear said the laird perhaps he is bringing some of the officers of the sloop with him  my stars mr bertram why did not ye tell me this before that we might have had the large round table and then theyre a tired o saut meat and to tell you the plain truth a rump o beef is the best part of your dinner and then i wad have put on another gown and ye wadna have been the waur o a clean neckcloth yoursell but ye delight in surprising and hurrying one i am sure i am no to baud out for ever against this sort of going on but when folks missed then they are moaned  pshaw pshaw deuce take the beef and the gown and table and the neckcloth we shall do all very well wheres the dominie john to a servant who was busy about the table wheres the dominie and little harry  mr sampsons been at hame these twa hours and mair but i dinna think mr harry cam hame wi him  not come hame wi him said the lady desire mr sampson to step this way directly  mr sampson said she upon his entrance is it not the most extraordinary thing in this world wide that you that have free upputtingbed board and washingand twelve pounds sterling a year just to look after that boy should let him out of your sight for twa or three hours  sampson made a bow of humble acknowledgment at each pause which the angry lady made in her enumeration of the advantages of his situation in order to give more weight to her remonstrance and then in words which we will not do him the injustice to imitate told how mr francis kennedy had assumed spontaneously the charge of master harry in despite of his remonstrances in the contrary  i am very little obliged to mr francis kennedy for his pains said the lady peevishly suppose he lets the boy drop from his horse and lames him or suppose one of the cannons comes ashore and kills him or suppose  or suppose my dear said ellangowan what is much more likely than anything else that they have gone aboard the sloop or the prize and are to come round the point with the tide  and then they may be drowned said the lady  verily said sampson i thought mr kennedy had returned an hour since of a surety i deemed i heard his horses feet  that said john with a broad grin was grizzel chasing the humblecow out of the close  sampson coloured up to the eyes not at the implied taunt which he would never have discovered or resented if he had but at some idea which crossed his own mind i have been in an error he said of a surety i should have tarried for the babe so saying he snatched his boneheaded cane and hat and hurried away towards warroch wood faster than he was ever known to walk before or after  the laird lingered some time debating the point with the lady at length he saw the sloop of war again make her appearance but without approaching the shore she stood away to the westward with all her sails set and was soon out of sight the ladys state of timorous and fretful apprehension was so habitual that her fears went for nothing with her lord and master but an appearance of disturbance and anxiety among the servants now excited his alarm especially when he was called out of the room and told in private that mr kennedys horse had come to the stable door alone with the saddle turned round below its belly and the reins of the bridle broken and that a farmer had informed them in passing that there was a smuggling lugger burning like a furnace on the other side of the point of warroch and that though he had come through the wood he had seen or heard nothing of kennedy or the young laird only there was dominie sampson gaun rampauging about like mad seeking for them  all was now bustle at ellangowan the laird and his servants male and female hastened to the wood of warroch the tenants and cottagers in the neighbourhood lent their assistance partly out of zeal partly from curiosity boats were manned to search the seashore which on the other side of the point rose into high and indented rocks a vague suspicion was entertained though too horrible to be expressed that the child might have fallen from one of these cliffs  the evening had begun to close when the parties entered the wood and dispersed different ways in quest of the boy and his companion the darkening of the atmosphere and the hoarse sighs of the november wind through the naked trees the rustling of the withered leaves which strewed the glades the repeated halloos of the different parties which often drew them together in expectation of meeting the objects of their search gave a cast of dismal sublimity to the scene  at length after a minute and fruitless investigation through the wood the searchers began to draw together into one body and to compare notes the agony of the father grew beyond concealment yet it scarcely equalled the anguish of the tutor would to god i had died for him the affectionate creature repeated in notes of the deepest distress those who were less interested rushed into a tumultuary discussion of chances and possibilities each gave his opinion and each was alternately swayed by that of the others some thought the objects of their search had gone aboard the sloop some that they had gone to a village at three miles distance some whispered they might have been on board the lugger a few planks and beams of which the tide now drifted ashore  at this instant a shout was heard from the beach so loud so shrill so piercing so different from every sound which the woods that day had rung to that nobody hesitated a moment to believe that it conveyed tidings and tidings of dreadful import all hurried to the place and venturing without scruple upon paths which at another time they would have shuddered to look at descended towards a cleft of the rock where one boats crew was already landed here sirs here this way for gods sake this way this way was the reiterated cry ellangowan broke through the throng which had already assembled at the fatal spot and beheld the object of their terror it was the dead body of kennedy at first sight he seemed to have perished by a fall from the rocks which rose above the spot on which he lay in a perpendicular precipice of a hundred feet above the beach the corpse was lying half in half out of the water the advancing tide raising the arm and stirring the clothes had given it at some distance the appearance of motion so that those who first discovered the body thought that life remained but every spark had been long extinguished  my bairn my bairn cried the distracted father where can he be a dozen mouths were opened to communicate hopes which no one felt some one at length mentionedthe gipsies in a moment ellangowan had reascended the cliffs flung himself upon the first horse he met and rode furiously to the huts at derncleugh all was there dark and desolate and as he dismounted to make more minute search he stumbled over fragments of furniture which had been thrown out of the cottages and the broken wood and thatch which had been pulled down by his orders at that moment the prophecy or anathema of meg merrilies fell heavy on his mind you have stripped the thatch from seven cottages see that the rooftree of your own house stand the surer  restore he cried restore my bairn bring me back my son and all shall be forgot and forgiven as he uttered these words in a sort of frenzy his eye caught a glimmering of light in one of the dismantled cottages it was that in which meg merrilies formerly resided the light which seemed to proceed from fire glimmered not only through the window but also through the rafters of the hut where the roofing had been torn off  he flew to the place the entrance was bolted despair gave the miserable father the strength of ten men he rushed against the door with such violence that it gave way before the momentum of his weight and force the cottage was empty but bore marks of recent habitation there was fire on the hearth a kettle and some preparation for food as he eagerly gazed around for something that might confirm his hope that his child yet lived although in the power of those strange people a man entered the hut  it was his old gardener o sir said the old man such a night as this i trusted never to live to see ye maun come to the place directly  is my boy found is he alive have ye found harry bertram andrew have ye found harry bertram  no sir but  then he is kidnapped i am sure of it andrew as sure as that i tread upon earth she has stolen him and i will never stir from this place till i have tidings of my bairn  o but ye maun come hame sir ye maun come hame we have sent for the sheriff and well seta watch here a night in case the gipsies return but youye maun come hame sir for my ladys in the deadthraw  bertram turned a stupefied and unmeaning eye on the messenger who uttered this calamitous news and repeating the words in the deadthraw as if he could not comprehend their meaning suffered the old man to drag him towards his horse during the ride home he only said wife and bairn baithmother and son baithsair sair to abide  it is needless to dwell upon the new scene of agony which awaited him the news of kennedys fate had been eagerly and incautiously communicated at ellangowan with the gratuitous addition that doubtless he had drawn the young laird over the craig with him though the tide had swept away the childs body he was light puir thing and would flee farther into the surf  mrs bertram heard the tidings she was far advanced in her pregnancy she fell into the pains of premature labour and ere ellangowan had recovered his agitated faculties so as to comprehend the full distress of his situation he was the father of a female infant and a widower       chapter  x      but see his face is black and full of blood      his eyeballs farther out than when he lived      staring full ghastly like a strangled man      his hair upreard his nostrils stretch d with struggling      his hands abroad displayd as one that graspd      and tuggd for life and was by strength subdued           henry vi part ii   the sheriffdepute of the county arrived at ellangowan next morning by daybreak to this provincial magistrate the law of scotland assigns judicial powers of considerable extent and the task of inquiring into all crimes committed within his jurisdiction the apprehension and commitment of suspected persons and so forth footnote the scottish sheriff discharges on such occasions as that now mentioned pretty much the same duty as a coroner  the gentleman who held the office in the shire ofat the time of this catastrophe was well born and well educated and though somewhat pedantic and professional in his habits he enjoyed general respect as an active and intelligent magistrate his first employment was to examine all witnesses whose evidence could throw light upon this mysterious event and make up the written report proces verbal or precognition as it is technically called which the practice of scotland has substituted for a coroners inquest under the sheriffs minute and skilful inquiry many circumstances appeared which seemed incompatible with the original opinion that kennedy had accidentally fallen from the cliffs we shall briefly detail some of these  the body had been deposited in a neighbouring fisherhut but without altering the condition in which it was found this was the first object of the sheriffs examination though fearfully crushed and mangled by the fall from such a height the corpse was found to exhibit a deep cut in the head which in the opinion of a skilful surgeon must have been inflicted by a broadsword or cutlass the experience of this gentleman discovered other suspicious indications the face was much blackened the eyes distorted and the veins of the neck swelled a coloured handkerchief which the unfortunate man had worn round his neck did not present the usual appearance but was much loosened and the knot displaced and dragged extremely tight the folds were also compressed as if it had been used as a means of grappling the deceased and dragging him perhaps to the precipice  on the other hand poor kennedys purse was found untouched and what seemed yet more extraordinary the pistols which he usually carried when about to encounter any hazardous adventure were found in his pockets loaded this appeared particularly strange for he was known and dreaded by the contraband traders as a man equally fearless and dexterous in the use of his weapons of which he had given many signal proofs the sheriff inquired whether kennedy was not in the practice of carrying any other arms most of mr bertrams servants recollected that he generally had a couteau de chasse or short hanger but none such was found upon the dead body nor could those who had seen him on the morning of the fatal day take it upon them to assert whether he then carried that weapon or not  the corpse afforded no other indicia respecting the fate of kennedy for though the clothes were much displaced and the limbs dreadfully fractured the one seemed the probable the other the certain consequences of such a fall the hands of the deceased were clenched fast and full of turf and earth but this also seemed equivocal  the magistrate then proceeded to the place where the corpse was first discovered and made those who had found it give upon the spot a particular and detailed account of the manner in which it was lying a large fragment of the rock appeared to have accompanied or followed the fall of the victim from the cliff above it was of so solid and compact a substance that it had fallen without any great diminution by splintering so that the sheriff was enabled first to estimate the weight by measurement and then to calculate from the appearance of the fragment what portion of it had been bedded into the cliff from which it had descended this was easily detected by the raw appearance of the stone where it had not been exposed to the atmosphere they then ascended the cliff and surveyed the place from whence the stony fragment had fallen it seemed plain from the appearance of the bed that the mere weight of one man standing upon the projecting part of the fragment supposing it in its original situation could not have destroyed its balance and precipitated it with himself from the cliff at the same time it appeared to have lain so loose that the use of a lever or the combined strength of three or four men might easily have hurled it from its position the short turf about the brink of the precipice was much trampled as if stamped by the heels of men in a mortal struggle or in the act of some violent exertion traces of the same kind less visibly marked guided the sagacious investigator to the verge of the copsewood which in that place crept high up the bank towards the top of the precipice  with patience and perseverance they traced these marks into the thickest part of the copse a route which no person would have voluntarily adopted unless for the purpose of concealment here they found plain vestiges of violence and struggling from space to space small boughs were torn down as if grasped by some resisting wretch who was dragged forcibly along the ground where in the least degree soft or marshy showed the print of many feet there were vestiges also which might be those of human blood at any rate it was certain that several persons must have forced their passage among the oaks hazels and underwood with which they were mingled and in some places appeared traces as if a sack full of grain a dead body or something of that heavy and solid description had been dragged along the ground in one part of the thicket there was a small swamp the clay of which was whitish being probably mixed with marl the back of kennedys coat appeared besmeared with stains of the same colour  at length about a quarter of a mile from the brink of the fatal precipice the traces conducted them to a small open space of ground very much trampled and plainly stained with blood although withered leaves had been strewed upon the spot and other means hastily taken to efface the marks which seemed obviously to have been derived from a desperate affray on one side of this patch of open ground was found the sufferers naked hanger which seemed to have been thrown into the thicket on the other the belt and sheath which appeared to have been hidden with more leisurely care and precaution  the magistrate caused the footprints which marked this spot to be carefully measured and examined some corresponded to the foot of the unhappy victim some were larger some less indicating that at least four or five men had been busy around him above all here and here only were observed the vestiges of a childs foot and as it could be seen nowhere else and the hard horsetrack which traversed the wood of warroch was contiguous to the spot it was natural to think that the boy might have escaped in that direction during the confusion but as he was never heard of the sheriff who made a careful entry of all these memoranda did not suppress his opinion that the deceased had met with foul play and that the murderers whoever they were had possessed themselves of the person of the child harry bertram  every exertion was now made to discover the criminals suspicion hesitated between the smugglers and the gipsies the fate of dirk hatteraicks vessel was certain two men from the opposite side of warroch bay so the inlet on the southern side of the point of warroch is called had seen though at a great distance the lugger drive eastward after doubling the headland and as they judged from her manoeuvres in a disabled state shortly after they perceived that she grounded smoked and finally took fire she was as one of them expressed himself in a light low bright flame when they observed a kings ship with her colours up heave in sight from behind the cape the guns of the burning vessel discharged themselves as the fire reached them and they saw her at length blow up with a great explosion the sloop of war kept aloof for her own safety and after hovering till the other exploded stood away southward under a press of sail the sheriff anxiously interrogated these men whether any boats had left the vessel they could not say they had seen none but they might have put off in such a direction as placed the burning vessel and the thick smoke which floated landward from it between their course and the witnesses observation  that the ship destroyed was dirk hatteraicks no one doubted his lugger was well known on the coast and had been expected just at this time a letter from the commander of the kings sloop to whom the sheriff made application put the matter beyond doubt he sent also an extract from his logbook of the transactions of the day which intimated their being on the outlook for a smuggling lugger dirk hatteraick master upon the information and requisition of francis kennedy of his majestys excise service and that kennedy was to be upon the outlook on the shore in case hatteraick who was known to be a desperate fellow and had been repeatedly outlawed should attempt to run his sloop aground about nine oclock am they discovered a sail which answered the description of hatteraicks vessel chased her and after repeated signals to her to show colours and bringto fired upon her the chase then showed hamburgh colours and returned the fire and a running fight was maintained for three hours when just as the lugger was doubling the point of warroch they observed that the mainyard was shot in the slings and that the vessel was disabled it was not in the power of the manofwars men for some time to profit by this circumstance owing to their having kept too much in shore for doubling the headland after two tacks they accomplished this and observed the chase on fire and apparently deserted the fire having reached some casks of spirits which were placed on the deck with other combustibles probably on purpose burnt with such fury that no boats durst approach the vessel especially as her shotted guns were discharging one after another by the heat the captain had no doubt whatever that the crew had set the vessel on fire and escaped in their boats after watching the conflagration till the ship blew up his majestys sloop the shark stood towards the isle of man with the purpose of intercepting the retreat of the smugglers who though they might conceal themselves in the woods for a day or two would probably take the first opportunity of endeavouring to make for this asylum but they never saw more of them than is above narrated  such was the account given by william pritchard master and commander of his majestys sloop of war shark who concluded by regretting deeply that he had not had the happiness to fall in with the scoundrels who had had the impudence to fire on his majestys flag and with an assurance that should he meet mr dirk hatteraick in any future cruise he would not fail to bring him into port under his stern to answer whatever might be alleged against him  as therefore it seemed tolerably certain that the men on board the lugger had escaped the death of kennedy if he fell in with them in the woods when irritated by the loss of their vessel and by the share he had in it was easily to be accounted for and it was not improbable that to such brutal tempers rendered desperate by their own circumstances even the murder of the child against whose father as having become suddenly active in the prosecution of smugglers hatteraick was known to have uttered deep threats would not appear a very heinous crime  against this hypothesis it was urged that a crew of fifteen or twenty men could not have lain hidden upon the coast when so close a search took place immediately after the destruction of their vessel or at least that if they had hid themselves in the woods their boats must have been seen on the beach that in such precarious circumstances and when all retreat must have seemed difficult if not impossible it was not to be thought that they would have all united to commit a useless murder for the mere sake of revenge those who held this opinion supposed either that the boats of the lugger had stood out to sea without being observed by those who were intent upon gazing at the burning vessel and so gained safe distance before the sloop got round the headland or else that the boats being staved or destroyed by the fire of the shark during the chase the crew had obstinately determined to perish with the vessel what gave some countenance to this supposed act of desperation was that neither dirk hatteraick nor any of his sailors all wellknown men in the fair trade were again seen upon that coast or heard of in the isle of man where strict inquiry was made on the other hand only one dead body apparently that of a seaman killed by a cannonshot drifted ashore so all that could be done was to register the names description and appearance of the individuals belonging to the ships company and offer a reward for the apprehension of them or any one of them extending also to any person not the actual murderer who should give evidence tending to convict those who had murdered francis kennedy  another opinion which was also plausibly supported went to charge this horrid crime upon the late tenants of derncleugh they were known to have resented highly the conduct of the laird of ellangowan towards them and to have used threatening expressions which every one supposed them capable of carrying into effect the kidnapping the child was a crime much more consistent with their habits than with those of smugglers and his temporary guardian might have fallen in an attempt to protect him besides it was remembered that kennedy had been an active agent two or three days before in the forcible expulsion of these people from derncleugh and that harsh and menacing language had been exchanged between him and some of the egyptian patriarchs on that memorable occasion  the sheriff received also the depositions of the unfortunate father and his servant concerning what had passed at their meeting the caravan of gipsies as they left the estate of ellangowan the speech of meg merrilies seemed particularly suspicious there was as the magistrate observed in his law language damnum minatuma damage or evil turn threatenedand malum secutuman evil of the very kind predicted shortly afterwards following a young woman who had been gathering nuts in warroch wood upon the fatal day was also strongly of opinion though she declined to make positive oath that she had seen meg merriliesat least a woman of her remarkable size and appearancestart suddenly out of a thicket she said she had called to her by name but as the figure turned from her and made no answer she was uncertain if it were the gipsy or her wraith and was afraid to go nearer to one who was always reckoned in the vulgar phrase no canny this vague story received some corroboration from the circumstance of a fire being that evening found in the gipsys deserted cottage to this fact ellangowan and his gardener bore evidence yet it seemed extravagant to suppose that had this woman been accessory to such a dreadful crime she would have returned that very evening on which it was committed to the place of all others where she was most likely to be sought after  meg merrilies was however apprehended and examined she denied strongly having been either at derncleugh or in the wood of warroch upon the day of kennedys death and several of her tribe made oath in her behalf that she had never quitted their encampment which was in a glen about ten miles distant from ellangowan their oaths were indeed little to be trusted to but what other evidence could be had in the circumstances there was one remarkable fact and only one which arose from her examination her arm appeared to be slightly wounded by the cut of a sharp weapon and was tied up with a handkerchief of harry bertrams but the chief of the horde acknowledged he had corrected her that day with his whinger she herself and others gave the same account of her hurt and for the handkerchief the quantity of linen stolen from ellangowan during the last months of their residence on the estate easily accounted for it without charging meg with a more heinous crime  it was observed upon her examination that she treated the questions respecting the death of kennedy or the gauger as she called him with indifference but expressed great and emphatic scorn and indignation at being supposed capable of injuring little harry bertram she was long confined in jail under the hope that something might yet be discovered to throw light upon this dark and bloody transaction nothing however occurred and meg was at length liberated but under sentence of banishment from the county as a vagrant common thief and disorderly person no traces of the boy could ever be discovered and at length the story after making much noise was gradually given up as altogether inexplicable and only perpetuated by the name of the gaugers loup which was generally bestowed on the cliff from which the unfortunate man had fallen or been precipitated       chapter  xi     enter time as chorus     i that please some try all both joy and terror     of good and bad that make and unfold error     now take upon me in the name of time     to use my wings impute it not a crime     to me or my swift passage that i slide     oer sixteen years and leave the growth untried     of that wide gap           winters tale   our narration is now about to make a large stride and omit a space of nearly seventeen years during which nothing occurred of any particular consequence with respect to the story we have undertaken to tell the gap is a wide one yet if the readers experience in life enables him to look back on so many years the space will scarce appear longer in his recollection than the time consumed in turning these pages  it was then in the month of november about seventeen years after the catastrophe related in the last chapter that during a cold and stormy night a social group had closed around the kitchenfire of the gordon arms at kippletringan a small but comfortable inn kept by mrs maccandlish in that village the conversation which passed among them will save me the trouble of telling the few events occurring during this chasm in our history with which it is necessary that the reader should be acquainted  mrs maccandlish throned in a comfortable easychair lined with black leather was regaling herself and a neighbouring gossip or two with a cup of genuine tea and at the same time keeping a sharp eye upon her domestics as they went and came in prosecution of their various duties and commissions the clerk and precentor of the parish enjoyed at a little distance his saturday nights pipe and aided its bland fumigation by an occasional sip of brandy and water deacon bearcliff a man of great importance in the village combined the indulgence of both parties he had his pipe and his teacup the latter being laced with a little spirits one or two clowns sat at some distance drinking their twopenny ale  are ye sure the parlours ready for them and the fire burning clear and the chimney no smoking said the hostess to a chambermaid  she was answered in the affirmative ane wadna be uncivil to them especially in their distress said she turning to the deacon  assuredly not mrs maccandlish assuredly not i am sure ony sma thing they might want frae my shop under seven or eight or ten pounds i would book them as readily for it as the first in the

produced an instantaneous effect in his favour he was a handsome tall thin figure dressed in black as appeared when he laid aside his ridingcoat his age might be between forty and fifty his cast of features grave and interesting and his air somewhat military every point of his appearance and address bespoke the gentleman long habit had given mrs maccandlish an acute tact in ascertaining the quality of her visitors and proportioning her reception accordingly       to every guest the appropriate speech was made      and every duty with distinction paid      respectful easy pleasant or polite      your honours servant mister smith goodnight  on the present occasion she was low in her courtesy and profuse in her apologies the stranger begged his horse might be attended to she went out herself to school the hostler  there was never a prettier bit o horseflesh in the stable o the gordon arms said the man which information increased the landladys respect for the rider finding on her return that the stranger declined to go into another apartment which indeed she allowed would be but cold and smoky till the fire bleezed up she installed her guest hospitably by the fireside and offered what refreshment her house afforded  a cup of your tea maam if you will favour me  mrs maccandlish bustled about reinforced her teapot with hyson and proceeded in her duties with her best

know that the worshipful laird of ellangowan was not so preceese as he might have been in clearing his land of witches concerning whom it is said thou shalt not suffer a witch to live nor of those who had familiar spirits and consulted with divination and sorcery and lots which is the fashion with the egyptians as they ca themsells and other unhappy bodies in this our country and the laird was three years married without having a family and he was sae left to himsell that it was thought he held ower muckle troking and communing wi that meg merrilies wha was the maist notorious witch in a galloway and dumfriesshire baith  aweel i wot theres something in that said mrs maccandlish ive kennd him order her twa glasses o brandy in this very house  aweel gudewife then the less i lee sae the lady was wi bairn at last and in the night when she should have been delivered there comes to the door of the ha housethe place of ellangowan as they cadan ancient man strangely habited and asked for quarters his head and his legs and his arms were bare although it was winter time o the year and he had a grey beard threequarters lang weel he was admitted and when the lady was delivered he craved to know the very moment of the hour of the birth and he went out and consulted the stars and when he came back he telld the laird that the evil one wad have power over the knavebairn that was that night born and he charged him that the babe should be bred up in the ways of piety and that he should aye hae a godly minister at his elbow to pray wi the bairn and for him and the aged man vanished away and no man of this country ever saw mair o him  now that will not pass said the postilion who at a respectful distance was listening to the conversation begging mr skreighs and the companys pardon there was no sae mony hairs on the warlocks face as theres on lettergaes footnote the precentor is called by allan ramsay the lettergae of haly rhyme ain at this moment and he had as gude a pair o boots as a man need streik on his legs and gloves too and i should understand boots by this time i think  whisht jock said the landlady  ay and what do ye ken o the matter friend jabos said the precentor contemptuously  no muckle to be sure mr skreigh only that i lived within a pennystane cast o the head o the avenue at ellangowan when a man cam jingling to our door that night the young laird was born and my mother sent me that was a hafflin callant to show the stranger the gate to the place which if he had been sic a warlock he might hae kennd himsell ane wad think and he was a young weelfaured weeldressed lad like an englishman and i tell ye he had as gude a hat and boots and gloves as ony gentleman need to have to be sure he did gie an awesome glance up at the auld castle and there was some spaewark gaed on i aye heard that but as for his vanishing i held the stirrup mysell when he gaed away and he gied me a round halfcrown he was riding on a haick they cad souple sam it belanged to the george at dumfries it was a bloodbay beast very ill o the spavin i hae seen the beast baith before and since  aweel aweel jock answered mr skreigh with a tone of mild solemnity our accounts differ in no material particulars but i had no knowledge that ye had seen the man so ye see my friends that this soothsayer having prognosticated evil to the boy his father engaged a godly minister to be with him morn and night  ay that was him they cad dominie sampson said the postilion  hes but a dumb dog that observed the deacon i have heard that he never could preach five words of a sermon endlang for as lang as he has been licensed  weel but said the precentor waving his hand as if eager to retrieve the command of the discourse he waited on the young laird by night and day now it chanced when the bairn was near five years auld that the laird had a sight of his errors and determined to put these egyptians aff his ground and he caused them to remove and that frank kennedy that was a rough swearing fellow he was sent to turn them off and he cursed and damned at them and they swure at him and that meg merrilies that was the maist powerfu with the enemy of mankind she as gude as said she would have him body and soul before three days were ower his head and i have it from a sure hand and thats ane wha saw it and thats john wilson that was the lairds groom that meg appeared to the laird as he was riding hame from singleside over gibbies know and threatened him wi what she wad do to his family but whether it was meg or something waur in her likeness for it seemed bigger than ony mortal creature john could not say  aweel said the postilion it might be sae i canna say against it for i was not in the country at the time but john wilson was a blustering kind of chield without the heart of a sprug  and what was the end of all this said the stranger with some impatience  ou the event and upshot of it was sir said the precentor that while they were all looking on beholding a kings ship chase a smuggler this kennedy suddenly brake away frae them without ony reason that could be descriedropes nor tows wad not hae held himand made for the wood of warroch as fast as his beast could carry him and by the way he met the young laird and his governor and he snatched up the bairn and swure if he was bewitched the bairn should have the same luck as him and the minister followed as fast as he could and almaist as fast as them for he was wonderfully swift of foot and he saw meg the witch or her master in her similitude rise suddenly out of the ground and claught the bairn suddenly out of the gangers arms and then he rampauged and drew his sword for ye ken a fie man and a cusser fearsna the deil  i believe thats very true said the postilion  so sir she grippit him and clodded him like a stane from the sling ower the craigs of warroch head where he was found that evening but what became of the babe frankly i cannot say but he that was minister here then thats now in a better place had an opinion that the bairn was only conveyed to fairyland for a season  the stranger had smiled slightly at some parts of this recital but ere he could answer the clatter of a horses hoofs was heard and a smart servant handsomely dressed with a cockade in his hat bustled into the kitchen with make a little room good people when observing the stranger he descended at once into the modest and civil domestic his hat sunk down by his side and he put a letter into his masters hands the family at ellangowan sir are in great distress and unable to receive any visits  i know it replied his master and now madam if you will have the goodness to allow me to occupy the parlour you mentioned as you are disappointed of your guests  certainly sir said mrs maccandlish and hastened to light the way with all the imperative bustle which an active landlady loves to display on such occasions  young man said the deacon to the servant filling a glass yell no be the waur o this after your ride  not a feather sir thank ye your very good health sir  and wha may your master be friend  what the gentleman that was here thats the famous colonel mannering sir from the east indies  what him we read of in the newspapers  ay ay just the same it was he relieved cuddieburn and defended chingalore and defeated the great mahratta chief ram jolli bundleman i was with him in most of his campaigns  lord safe us said the landlady i must go see what he would have for supper that i should set him down here  o he likes that all the better mother you never saw a plainer creature in your life than our old colonel and yet he has a spice of the devil in him too  the rest of the evenings conversation below stairs tending little to edification we shall with the readers leave step up to the parlour       chapter  xii      reputation thats mans idol      set up against god the maker of all laws      who hath commanded us we should not kill      and yet we say we must for reputation      what honest man can either fear his own      or else will hurt anothers reputation      fear to do base unworthy things is valour      if they be done to us to suffer them      is valour too            ben jonson   the colonel was walking pensively up and down the parlour when the officious landlady reentered to take his commands having given them in the manner he thought would be most acceptable for the good of the house he begged to detain her a moment  i think he said madam if i understood the good people right mr bertram lost his son in his fifth year  o ay sir theres nae doubt o that though there are mony idle clashes about the way and manner for its an auld story now and everybody tells it as we were doing their ain way by the ingleside but lost the bairn was in his fifth year as your honour says colonel and the news being rashly telld to the leddy then great with child cost her her life that samyn night and the laird never throve after that day but was just careless of everything though when his daughter miss lucy grew up she tried to keep order within doors but what could she do poor thing so now theyre out of house and hauld  can you recollect madam about what time of the year the child was lost the landlady after a pause and some recollection answered she was positive it was about this season and added some local recollections that fixed the date in her memory as occurring about the beginning of november 17  the stranger took two or three turns round the room in silence but signed to mrs maccandlish not to leave it  did i rightly apprehend he said that the estate of ellangowan is in the market  in the market it will be selld the morn to the highest bidderthats no the morn lord help me which is the sabbath but on monday the first free day and the furniture and stocking is to be roupit at the same time on the ground its the opinion of the haill country that the sale has been shamefully forced on at this time when theres sae little money stirring in scotland wi this weary american war that somebody may get the land a bargain deil be in them that i should say saethe good ladys wrath rising at the supposed injustice  and where will the sale take place  on the premises as the advertisement says thats at the house of ellangowan your honour as i understand it  and who exhibits the titledeeds rentroll and plan  a very decent man sir the sheriffsubstitute of the county who has authority from the court of session hes in the town just now if your honour would like to see him and he can tell you mair about the loss of the bairn than ony body for the sheriffdepute thats his principal like took much pains to come at the truth o that matter as i have heard  and this gentlemans name is  macmorlan sir hes a man o character and weel spoken o  send my complimentscolonel mannerings compliments to him and i would be glad he would do me the pleasure of supping with me and bring these papers with him and i beg good madam you will say nothing of this to any one else  me sir neer a word shall i say i wish your honour a courtesy or ony honourable gentleman thats fought for his country another courtesy had the land since the auld family maun quit a sigh rather than that wily scoundrel glossin thats risen on the ruin of the best friend he ever had and now i think ont ill slip on my hood and pattens and gang to mr macmorlan mysell hes at hame een now its hardly a step  do so my good landlady and many thanks and bid my servant step here with my portfolio in the meantime  in a minute or two colonel mannering was quietly seated with his writing materials before him we have the privilege of looking over his shoulder as he writes and we willingly communicate its substance to our readers the letter was addressed to arthur mervyn esq of mervyn hall llanbraithwaite westmoreland it contained some account of the writers previous journey since parting with him and then proceeded as follows  and now why will you still upbraid me with my melancholy mervyn do you think after the lapse of twentyfive years battles wounds imprisonment misfortunes of every description i can be still the same lively unbroken guy mannering who climbed skiddaw with you or shot grouse upon crossfell that you who have remained in the bosom of domestic happiness experience little change that your step is as light and your fancy as full of sunshine is a blessed effect of health and temperament cooperating with content and a smooth current down the course of life but my career has been one of difficulties and doubts and errors from my infancy i have been the sport of accident and though the wind has often borne me into harbour it has seldom been into that which the pilot destined let me recall to youbut the task must be briefthe odd and wayward fates of my youth and the misfortunes of my manhood  the former you will say had nothing very appalling all was not for the best but all was tolerable my father the eldest son of an ancient but reduced family left me with little save the name of the head of the house to the protection of his more fortunate brothers they were so fond of me that they almost quarrelled about me my uncle the bishop would have had me in orders and offered me a living my uncle the merchant would have put me into a countinghouse and proposed to give me a share in the thriving concern of mannering and marshall in lombard street so between these two stools or rather these two soft easy wellstuffed chairs of divinity and commerce my unfortunate person slipped down and pitched upon a dragoon saddle again the bishop wished me to marry the niece and heiress of the dean of lincoln and my uncle the alderman proposed to me the only daughter of old sloethorn the great winemerchant rich enough to play at spancounter with moidores and make threadpapers of banknotes and somehow i slipped my neck out of both nooses and marriedpoor poor sophia wellwood  you will say my military career in india when i followed my regiment there should have given me some satisfaction and so it assuredly has you will remind me also that if i disappointed the hopes of my guardians i did not incur their displeasure that the bishop at his death bequeathed me his blessing his manuscript sermons and a curious portfolio containing the heads of eminent divines of the church of england and that my uncle sir paul mannering left me sole heir and executor to his large fortune yet this availeth me nothing i told you i had that upon my mind which i should carry to my grave with me a perpetual aloes in the draught of existence i will tell you the cause more in detail than i had the heart to do while under your hospitable roof you will often hear it mentioned and perhaps with different and unfounded circumstances i will therefore speak it out and then let the event itself and the sentiments of melancholy with which it has impressed me never again be subject of discussion between us  sophia as you well know followed me to india she was as innocent as gay but unfortunately for us both as gay as innocent my own manners were partly formed by studies i had forsaken and habits of seclusion not quite consistent with my situation as commandant of a regiment in a country where universal hospitality is offered and expected by every settler claiming the rank of a gentleman in a moment of peculiar pressure you know how hard we were sometimes run to obtain white faces to countenance our lineofbattle a young man named brown joined our regiment as a volunteer and finding the military duty more to his fancy than commerce in which he had been engaged remained with us as a cadet let me do my unhappy victim justice he behaved with such gallantry on every occasion that offered that the first vacant commission was considered as his due i was absent for some weeks upon a distant expedition when i returned i found this young fellow established quite as the friend of the house and habitual attendant of my wife and daughter it was an arrangement which displeased me in many particulars though no objection could be made to his manners or character yet i might have been reconciled to his familiarity in my family but for the suggestions of another if you read overwhat i never dare openthe play of othello you will have some idea of what followedi mean of my motives my actions thank god were less reprehensible there was another cadet ambitious of the vacant situation he called my attention to what he led me to term coquetry between my wife and this young man sophia was virtuous but proud of her virtue and irritated by my jealousy she was so imprudent as to press and encourage an intimacy which she saw i disapproved and regarded with suspicion between brown and me there existed a sort of internal dislike he made an effort or two to overcome my prejudice but prepossessed as i was i placed them to a wrong motive feeling himself repulsed and with scorn he desisted and as he was without family and friends he was naturally more watchful of the deportment of one who had both  it is odd with what torture i write this letter i feel inclined nevertheless to protract the operation just as if my doing so could put off the catastrophe which has so long embittered my life butit must be told and it shall be told briefly  my wife though no longer young was still eminently handsome andlet me say thus far in my own justificationshe was fond of being thought soi am repeating what i said before in a word of her virtue i never entertained a doubt but pushed by the artful suggestions of archer i thought she cared little for my peace of mind and that the young fellow brown paid his attentions in my despite and in defiance of me he perhaps considered me on his part as an oppressive aristocratic man who made my rank in society and in the army the means of galling those whom circumstances placed beneath me and if he discovered my silly jealousy he probably considered the fretting me in that sore point of my character as one means of avenging the petty indignities to which i had it in my power to subject him yet an acute friend of mine gave a more harmless or at least a less offensive construction to his attentions which he conceived to be meant for my daughter julia though immediately addressed to propitiate the influence of her mother this could have been no very flattering or pleasing enterprise on the part of an obscure and nameless young man but i should not have been offended at this folly as i was at the higher degree of presumption i suspected offended however i was and in a mortal degree  a very slight spark will kindle a flame where everything lies open to catch it i have absolutely forgot the proximate cause of quarrel but it was some trifle which occurred at the cardtable which occasioned high words and a challenge we met in the morning beyond the walls and esplanade of the fortress which i then commanded on the frontiers of the settlement this was arranged for browns safety had he escaped i almost wish he had though at my own expense but he fell by the first fire we strove to assist him but some of these looties a species of native banditti who were always on the watch for prey poured in upon us archer and i gained our horses with difficulty and cut our way through them after a hard conflict in the course of which he received some desperate wounds to complete the misfortunes of this miserable day my wife who suspected the design with which i left the fortress had ordered her palanquin to follow me and was alarmed and almost made prisoner by another troop of these plunderers she was quickly released by a party of our cavalry but i cannot disguise from myself that the incidents of this fatal morning gave a severe shock to health already delicate the confession of archer who thought himself dying that he had invented some circumstances and for his purposes put the worst construction upon others and the full explanation and exchange of forgiveness with me which this produced could not check the progress of her disorder she died within about eight months after this incident bequeathing me only the girl of whom mrs mervyn is so good as to undertake the temporary charge julia was also extremely ill so much so that i was induced to throw up my command and return to europe where her native air time and the novelty of the scenes around her have contributed to dissipate her dejection and restore her health  now that you know my story you will no longer ask me the reason of my melancholy but permit me to brood upon it as i may there is surely in the above narrative enough to embitter though not     to poison the chalice which the fortune and fame you so often mention had prepared to regale my years of retirement  i could add circumstances which our old tutor would have quoted as instances of day fatalityyou would laugh were i to mention such particulars especially as you know i put no faith in them yet since i have come to the very house from which i now write i have learned a singular coincidence which if i find it truly established by tolerable evidence will serve as hereafter for subject of curious discussion but i will spare you at present as i expect a person to speak about a purchase of property now open in this part of the country it is a place to which i have a foolish partiality and i hope my purchasing may be convenient to those who are parting with it as there is a plan for buying it under the value my respectful compliments to mrs mervyn and i will trust you though you boast to be so lively a young gentleman to kiss julia for me adieu dear mervynthine ever guy mannering  mr macmorlan now entered the room the wellknown character of colonel mannering at once disposed this gentleman who was a man of intelligence and probity to be open and confidential he explained the advantages and disadvantages of the property it was settled he said the greater part of it at least upon heirsmale and the purchaser would have the privilege of retaining in his hands a large proportion of the price in case of the reappearance within a certain limited term of the child who had disappeared  to what purpose then force forward a sale said mannering macmorlan smiled ostensibly he answered to substitute the interest of money instead of the illpaid and precarious rents of an unimproved estate but chiefly it was believed to suit the wishes and views of a certain intended purchaser who had become a principal creditor and forced himself into the management of the affairs by means best known to himself and who it was thought would find it very convenient to purchase the estate without paying down the price  mannering consulted with mr macmorlan upon the steps for thwarting this unprincipled attempt they then conversed long on the singular disappearance of harry bertram upon his fifth birthday verifying thus the random prediction of mannering of which however it will readily be supposed he made no boast mr macmorlan was not himself in office when that incident took place but he was well acquainted with all the circumstances and promised that our hero should have them detailed by the sheriffdepute himself if as he proposed he should become a settler in that part of scotland with this assurance they parted well satisfied with each other and with the evenings conference  on the sunday following colonel mannering attended the parish church with great decorum none of the ellangowan family were present and it was understood that the old laird was rather worse than better jock jabos once more despatched for him returned once more without his errand but on the following day miss bertram hoped he might be removed       chapter  xiii      they told me by the sentence of the law      they had commission to seize all thy fortune      here stood a ruffian with a horrid face      lording it oer a pile of massy plate      tumbled into a heap for public sale      there was another making villainous jests      at thy undoing he had taen possession      of all thy ancient most domestic ornaments            otway   early next morning mannering mounted his horse and accompanied by his servant took the road to ellangowan he had no need to inquire the way a sale in the country is a place of public resort and amusement and people of various descriptions streamed to it from all quarters  after a pleasant ride of about an hour the old towers of the ruin presented themselves in the landscape the thoughts with what different feelings he had lost sight of them so many years before thronged upon the mind of the traveller the landscape was the same but how changed the feelings hopes and views of the spectator then life and love were new and all the prospect was gilded by their rays and now disappointed in affection sated with fame and what the world calls success his mind goaded by bitter and repentant recollection his best hope was to find a retirement in which he might nurse the melancholy that was to accompany him to his grave yet why should an individual mourn over the instability of his hopes and the vanity of his prospects the ancient chiefs who erected these enormous and massive towers to be the fortress of their race and the seat of their powercould they have dreamed the day was to come when the last of their descendants should be expelled a ruined wanderer from his possessions but natures bounties are unaltered the sun will shine as fair on these ruins whether the property of a stranger or of a sordid and obscure trickster of the abused law as when the banners of the founder first waved upon their battlements  these reflections brought mannering to the door of the house which was that day open to all he entered among others who traversed the apartments some to select articles for purchase others to gratify their curiosity there is something melancholy in such a scene even under the most favourable circumstances the confused state of the furniture displaced for the convenience of being easily viewed and carried off by the purchasers is disagreeable to the eye those articles which properly and decently arranged look creditable and handsome have then a paltry and wretched appearance and the apartments stripped of all that render them commodious and comfortable have an aspect of ruin and dilapidation it is disgusting also to see the scenes of domestic society and seclusion thrown open to the gaze of the curious and the vulgar to hear their coarse speculations and brutal jests upon the fashions and furniture to which they are unaccustomeda frolicsome humour much cherished by the whisky which in scotland is always put in circulation on such occasions all these are ordinary effects of such a scene as ellangowan now presented but the moral feeling that in this case they indicated the total ruin of an ancient and honourable family gave them treble weight and poignancy  it was some time before colonel mannering could find any one disposed to answer his reiterated questions concerning ellangowan himself at length an old maidservant who held her apron to her eyes as she spoke told him the laird was something better and they hoped he would be able to leave the house that day miss lucy expected the chaise every moment and as the day was fine for the time oyear they had carried him in his easychair up to the green before the auld castle to be out of the way of this unco spectacle thither colonel mannering went in quest of him and soon came in sight of the little group which consisted of four persons the ascent was steep so that he had time to reconnoitre them as he advanced and to consider in what mode he should make his address  mr bertram paralytic and almost incapable of moving occupied his easychair attired in his nightcap and a loose camlet coat his feet wrapped in blankets behind him with his hands crossed on the cane upon which he rested stood dominie sampson whom mannering recognised at once time had made no change upon him unless that his black coat seemed more brown and his gaunt cheeks more lank than when mannering last saw him on one side of the old man was a sylphlike forma young woman of about seventeen whom the colonel accounted to be his daughter she was looking from time to time anxiously towards the avenue as if expecting the postchaise and between whiles busied herself in adjusting the blankets so as to protect her father from the cold and in answering inquiries which he seemed to make with a captious and querulous manner she did not trust herself to look towards the place although the hum of the assembled crowd must have drawn her attention in that direction the fourth person of the group was a handsome and genteel young man who seemed to share miss bertrams anxiety and her solicitude to soothe and accommodate her parent  this young man was the first who observed colonel mannering and immediately stepped forward to meet him as if politely to prevent his drawing nearer to the distressed group mannering instantly paused and explained he was he said a stranger to whom mr bertram had formerly shown kindness and hospitality he would not have intruded himself upon him at a period of distress did it not seem to be in some degree a moment also of desertion he wished merely to offer such services as might be in his power to mr bertram and the young lady  he then paused at a little distance from the chair his old acquaintance gazed at him with lacklustre eye that intimated no tokens of recognition the dominie seemed too deeply sunk in distress even to observe his presence the young man spoke aside with miss bertram who advanced timidly and thanked colonel mannering for his goodness but she said the tears gushing fast into her eyes her father she feared was not so much himself as to be able to remember him  she then retreated towards the chair accompanied by the colonel father she said this is mr mannering an old friend come to inquire after you  hes very heartily welcome said the old man raising himself in his chair and attempting a gesture of courtesy while a gleam of hospitable satisfaction seemed to pass over his faded features but lucy my dear let us go down to the house you should not keep the gentleman here in the cold dominie take the key of the winecooler mr aathe gentleman will surely take something after his ride  mannering was unspeakably affected by the contrast which his recollection made between this reception and that with which he had been greeted by the same individual when they last met he could not restrain his tears and his evident emotion at once attained him the confidence of the friendless young lady  alas she said this is distressing even to a stranger but it may be better for my poor father to be in this way than if he knew and could feel all  a servant in livery now came up the path and spoke in an undertone to the young gentlemanmr charles my ladys wanting you yonder sadly to bid for her for the black ebony cabinet and lady jean devorgoil is wi her an a ye maun come away directly  tell them you could not find me tom or staysay i am looking at the horses  no no no said lucy bertram earnestly if you would not add to the misery of this miserable moment go to the company directly this gentleman i am sure will see us to the carriage  unquestionably madam said mannering your young friend may rely on my attention  farewell then said young hazlewood and whispered a word in her ear then ran down the steep hastily as if not trusting his resolution at a slower pace  wheres charles hazlewood running said the invalid who apparently was accustomed to his presence and attentions wheres charles hazlewood running what takes him away now  hell return in a little while said lucy gently  the sound of voices was now heard from the ruins the reader may remember there was a communication between the castle and the beach up which the speakers had ascended  yes theres a plenty of shells and seaware for manure as you observe and if one inclined to build a new house which might indeed be necessary theres a great deal of good hewn stone about this old dungeon for the devil here  good god said miss bertram hastily to sampson t is that wretch glossins voice if my father sees him it will kill him outright  sampson wheeled perpendicularly round and moved with long strides to confront the attorney as he issued from beneath the portal arch of the ruin avoid ye he said avoid ye wouldst thou kill and take possession  come come master dominie sampson answered glossin insolently if ye cannot preach in the pulpit well have no preaching here we go by the law my good friend we leave the gospel to you  the very mention of this mans name had been of late a subject of the most violent irritation to the unfortunate patient the sound of his voice now produced an instantaneous effect mr bertram started up without assistance and turned round towards him the ghastliness of his features forming a strange contrast with the violence of his exclamationsout of my sight ye viper ye frozen viper that i warmed till ye stung me art thou not afraid that the walls of my fathers dwelling should fall and crush thee limb and bone are ye not afraid the very lintels of the door of ellangowan castle should break open and swallow you up were ye not friendless houseless penniless when i took ye by the hand and are ye not expelling meme and that innocent girlfriendless houseless and penniless from the house that has sheltered us and ours for a thousand years  had glossin been alone he would probably have slunk off but the consciousness that a stranger was present besides the person who came with him a sort of landsurveyor determined him to resort to impudence the task however was almost too hard even for his effronterysirsirmr bertram sir you should not blame me but your own imprudence sir  the indignation of mannering was mounting very high sir he said to glossin without entering into the merits of this controversy i must inform you that you have chosen a very improper place time and presence for it and you will oblige me by withdrawing without more words  glossin being a tall strong muscular man was not unwilling rather to turn upon the stranger whom he hoped to bully than maintain his wretched cause against his injured patroni do not know who you are sir he said and i shall permit no man to use such dd freedom with me  mannering was naturally hottempered his eyes flashed a dark light he compressed his nether lip so closely that the blood sprung and approaching glossinlook you sir he said that you do not know me is of little consequence i know you and if you do not instantly descend that bank without uttering a single syllable by the heaven that is above us you shall make but one step from the top to the bottom  the commanding tone of rightful anger silenced at once the ferocity of the bully he hesitated turned on his heel and muttering something between his teeth about unwillingness to alarm the lady relieved them of his hateful company  mrs maccandlishs postilion who had come up in time to hear what passed said aloud if he had stuck by the way i would have lent him a heezie the dirty scoundrel as willingly as ever i pitched a boddle  he then stepped forward to announce that his horses were in readiness for the invalid and his daughter but they were no longer necessary the debilitated frame of mr bertram was exhausted by this last effort of indignant anger and when he sunk again upon his chair he expired almost without a struggle or groan so little alteration did the extinction of the vital spark make upon his external appearance that the screams of his daughter when she saw his eye fix and felt his pulse stop first announced his death to the spectators       chapter  xiv      the bell strikes one we take no note of time      but from its loss to give it then a tongue      is wise in man as if an angel spoke      i feel the solemn sound             young   the moral which the poet has rather quaintly deduced from the necessary mode of measuring time may be well applied to our feelings respecting that portion of it which constitutes human life we observe the aged the infirm and those engaged in occupations of immediate hazard trembling as it were upon the very brink of nonexistence but we derive no lesson from the precariousness of their tenure until it has altogether failed then for a moment at least  our hopes and fears start up alarmd and oer lifes narrow verge look downon what a fathomless abyss a dark eternity how surely ours  the crowd of assembled gazers and idlers at ellangowan had followed the views of amusement or what they called business which brought them there with little regard to the feelings of those who were suffering upon that occasion few indeed knew anything of the family the father betwixt seclusion misfortune and imbecility had drifted as it were for many years out of the notice of his contemporaries the daughter had never been known to them but when the general murmur announced that the unfortunate mr bertram had broken his heart in the effort to leave the mansion of his forefathers there poured forth a torrent of sympathy like the waters from the rock when stricken by the wand of the prophet the ancient descent and unblemished integrity of the family were respectfully remembered above all the sacred veneration due to misfortune which in scotland seldom demands its tribute in vain then claimed and received it  mr macmorlan hastily announced that he would suspend all farther proceedings in the sale of the estate and other property and relinquish the possession of the premises to the young lady until she could consult with her friends and provide for the burial of her father  glossin had cowered for a few minutes under the general expression of sympathy till hardened by observing that no appearance of popular indignation was directed his way he had the audacity to require that the sale should proceed  i will take it upon my own authority to adjourn it said the sheriffsubstitute and will be responsible for the consequences i will also give due notice when it is again to go forward it is for the benefit of all concerned that the lands should bring the highest price the state of the market will admit and this is surely no time to expect it i will take the responsibility upon myself  glossin left the room and the house too with secrecy and despatch and it was probably well for him that he did so since our friend jock jabos was already haranguing a numerous tribe of barelegged boys on the propriety of pelting him off the estate  some of the rooms were hastily put in order for the reception of the young lady and of her fathers dead body mannering now found his farther interference would be unnecessary and might be misconstrued he observed too that several families connected with that of ellangowan and who indeed derived their principal claim of gentility from the alliance were now disposed to pay to their trees of genealogy a tribute which the adversity of their supposed relatives had been inadequate to call forth and that the honour of superintending the funeral rites of the dead godfrey bertram as in the memorable case of homers birthplace was likely to be debated by seven gentlemen of rank and fortune none of whom had offered him an asylum while living he therefore resolved as his presence was altogether useless to make a short tour of a fortnight at the end of which period the adjourned sale of the estate of ellangowan was to proceed  but before he departed he solicited an interview with the dominie the poor man appeared on being informed a gentleman wanted to speak to him with some expression of surprise in his gaunt features to which recent sorrow had given an expression yet more grisly he made two or three profound reverences to mannering and then standing erect patiently waited an explanation of his commands  you are probably at a loss to guess mr sampson said mannering what a stranger may have to say to you  unless it were to request that i would undertake to train up some youth in polite letters and humane learning but i cannoti cannot i have yet a task to perform  no mr sampson my wishes are not so ambitious i have no son and my only daughter i presume you would not consider as a fit pupil  of a surety no replied the simpleminded sampson nathless it was i who did educate miss lucy in all useful learning albeit it was the housekeeper who did teach her those unprofitable exercises of hemming and shaping  well sir replied mannering it is of miss lucy i meant to speak you have i presume no recollection of me  sampson always sufficiently absent in mind neither remembered the astrologer of past years nor even the stranger who had taken his patrons part against glossin so much had his friends sudden death embroiled his ideas  well that does not signify pursued the colonel i am an old acquaintance of the late mr bertram able and willing to assist his daughter in her present circumstances besides i have thoughts of making this purchase and i should wish things kept in order about the place will you have the goodness to apply this small sum in the usual family expenses he put into the dominies hand a purse containing some gold  prodigious exclaimed dominie sampson but if your honour would tarry  impossible sir impossible said mannering making his escape from him  prodigious again exclaimed sampson following to the head of the stairs still holding out the purse but as touching this coined money  mannering escaped downstairs as fast as possible  prodigious exclaimed dominie sampson yet the third time now standing at the front door but as touching this specie  but mannering was now on horseback and out of hearing the dominie who had never either in his own right or as trustee for another been possessed of a quarter part of this sum though it was not above twenty guineas took counsel as he expressed himself how he should demean himself with respect unto the fine gold thus left in his charge fortunately he found a disinterested adviser in macmorlan who pointed out the most proper means of disposing of it for contributing to miss bertrams convenience being no doubt the purpose to which it was destined by the bestower  many of the neighbouring gentry were now sincerely eager in pressing offers of hospitality and kindness upon miss bertram but she felt a natural reluctance to enter any family for the first time as an object rather of benevolence than hospitality and determined to wait the opinion and advice of her fathers nearest female relation mrs margaret bertram of singleside an old unmarried lady to whom she wrote an account of her present distressful situation  the funeral of the late mr bertram was performed with decent privacy and the unfortunate young lady was now to consider herself as but the temporary tenant of the house in which she had been born and where her patience and soothing attentions had so long rocked the cradle of declining age her communication with mr macmorlan encouraged her to hope that she would not be suddenly or unkindly deprived of this asylum but fortune had ordered otherwise  for two days before the appointed day for the sale of the lands and estate of ellangowan macmorlan daily expected the appearance of colonel mannering or at least a letter containing powers to act for him but none such arrived mr macmorlan waked early in the morning walked over to the postofficethere were no letters for him he endeavoured to persuade himself that he should see colonel mannering to breakfast and ordered his wife to place her best china and prepare herself accordingly but the preparations were in vain could i have foreseen this he said i would have travelled scotland over but i would have found some one to bid against glossin alas such reflections were all too late the appointed hour arrived and the parties met in the masons lodge at kippletringan being the place fixed for the adjourned sale macmorlan spent as much time in preliminaries as decency would permit and read over the articles of sale as slowly as if he had been reading his own deathwarrant he turned his eye every time the door of the room opened with hopes which grew fainter and fainter he listened to every noise in the street of the village and endeavoured to distinguish in it the sound of hoofs or wheels it was all in vain a bright idea then occurred that colonel mannering might have employed some other person in the transaction he would not have wasted a moments thought upon the want of confidence in himself which such a manoeuvre would have evinced but this hope also was groundless after a solemn pause mr glossin offered the upset price for the lands and barony of ellangowan no reply was made and no competitor appeared so after a lapse of the usual interval by the running of a sandglass upon the intended purchaser entering the proper sureties mr macmorlan was obliged in technical terms to find and declare the sale lawfully completed and to prefer the said gilbert glossin as the purchaser of the said lands and estate the honest writer refused to partake of a splendid entertainment with which gilbert glossin esquire now of ellangowan treated the rest of the company and returned home in huge bitterness of spirit which he vented in complaints against the fickleness and caprice of these indian nabobs who never knew what they would be at for ten days together fortune generously determined to take the blame upon herself and cut off even this vent of macmorlans resentment  an express arrived about six oclock at night very particularly drunk the maidservant said with a packet from colonel mannering dated four days back at a town about a hundred miles distance from kippletringan containing full powers to mr macmorlan or any one whom he might employ to make the intended purchase and stating that some family business of consequence called the colonel himself to westmoreland where a letter would find him addressed to the care of arthur mervyn esq of mervyn hall  macmorlan in the transports of his wrath flung the power of attorney at the head of the innocent maidservant and was only forcibly withheld from horsewhipping the rascally messenger by whose sloth and drunkenness the disappointment had taken place       chapter  xv      my gold is gone my money is spent      my land now take it unto thee      give me thy gold good john o the scales      and thine for aye my land shall be       then john he did him to record draw      and john he caste him a godspennie      but for every pounde that john agreed      the land i wis was well worth three            heir of linne   the galwegian john o the scales was a more clever fellow than his prototype he contrived to make himself heir of linne without the disagreeable ceremony of telling down the good red gold miss bertram no sooner heard this painful and of late unexpected intelligence than she proceeded in the preparations she had already made for leaving the mansionhouse immediately mr macmorlan assisted her in these arrangements and pressed upon her so kindly the hospitality and protection of his roof until she should receive an answer from her cousin or be enabled to adopt some settled plan of life that she felt there would be unkindness in refusing an invitation urged with such earnestness mrs macmorlan was a ladylike person and well qualified by birth and manners to receive the visit and to make her house agreeable to miss bertram a home therefore and an hospitable reception were secured to her and she went on with better heart to pay the wages and receive the adieus of the few domestics of her fathers family  where there are estimable qualities on either side this task is always affecting the present circumstances rendered it doubly so all received their due and even a trifle more and with thanks and good wishes to which some added tears took farewell of their young mistress there remained in the parlour only mr macmorlan who came to attend his guest to his house dominie sampson and miss bertram and now said the poor girl i must bid farewell to one of my oldest and kindest friends god bless you mr sampson and requite to you all the kindness of your instructions to your poor pupil and your friendship to him that is gone i hope i shall often hear from you she slid into his hand a paper containing some pieces of gold and rose as if to leave the room  dominie sampson also rose but it was to stand aghast with utter astonishment the idea of parting from miss lucy go where she might had never once occurred to the simplicity of his understanding he laid the money on the table it is certainly inadequate said macmorlan mistaking his meaning but the circumstances  mr sampson waved his hand impatientlyit is not the lucre it is not the lucre but that i that have ate of her fathers loaf and drank of his cup for twenty years and moreto think that i am going to leave her and to leave her in distress and dolour no miss lucy you need never think it you would not consent to put forth your fathers poor dog and would you use me waur than a messan no miss lucy bertram while i live i will not separate from you ill be no burden i have thought how to prevent that but as ruth said unto naomi entreat me not to leave thee nor to depart from thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou dwellest i will dwell thy people shall be my people and thy god shall be my god where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if aught but death do part thee and me  during this speech the longest ever dominie sampson was known to utter the affectionate creatures eyes streamed with tears and neither lucy nor macmorlan could refrain from sympathising with this unexpected burst of feeling and attachment mr sampson said macmorlan after having had recourse to his snuffbox and handkerchief alternately my house is large enough and if you will accept of a bed there while miss bertram honours us with her residence i shall think myself very happy and my roof much favoured by receiving a man of your worth and fidelity and then with a delicacy which was meant to remove any objection on miss bertrams part to bringing with her this unexpected satellite he added my business requires my frequently having occasion for a better accountant than any of my present clerks and i should be glad to have recourse to your assistance in that way now and then  of a surety of a surety said sampson eagerly i understand bookkeeping by double entry and the italian method  our postilion had thrust himself into the room to announce his chaise and horses he tarried unobserved during this extraordinary scene and assured mrs maccandlish it was the most moving thing he ever saw the death of the grey mare puir hizzie was naething tillt this trifling circumstance afterwards had consequences of greater moment to the dominie  the visitors were hospitably welcomed by mrs macmorlan to whom as well as to others her husband intimated that he had engaged dominie sampsons assistance to disentangle some perplexed accounts during which occupation he would for convenience sake reside with the family mr macmorlans knowledge of the world induced him to put this colour upon the matter aware that however honourable the fidelity of the dominies attachment might be both to his own heart and to the family of ellangowan his exterior ill qualified him to be asquire of dames and rendered him upon the whole rather a ridiculous appendage to a beautiful young woman of seventeen  dominie sampson achieved with great zeal such tasks as mr macmorlan chose to entrust him with but it was speedily observed that at a certain hour after breakfast he regularly disappeared and returned again about dinnertime the evening he occupied in the labour of the office on saturday he appeared before macmorlan with a look of great triumph and laid on the table two pieces of gold what is this for dominie said macmorlan  first to indemnify you of your charges in my behalf worthy sir and the balance for the use of miss lucy bertram  but mr sampson your labour in the office much more than recompenses me i am your debtor my good friend  then be it all said the dominie waving his hand for miss lucy bertrams behoof  well but dominie this money  it is honestly come by mr macmorlan it is the bountiful reward of a young gentleman to whom i am teaching the tongues reading with him three hours daily  a few more questions extracted from the dominie that this liberal pupil was young hazlewood and that he met his preceptor daily at the house of mrs maccandlish whose proclamation of sampsons disinterested attachment to the young lady had procured him this indefatigable and bounteous scholar  macmorlan was much struck with what he heard dominie sampson was doubtless a very good scholar and an excellent man and the classics were unquestionably very well worth reading yet that a young man of twenty should ride seven miles and back again each day in the week to hold this sort of teteatete of three hours was a zeal for literature to which he was not prepared to give entire credit little art was necessary to sift the dominie for the honest mans head never admitted any but the most direct and simple ideas does miss bertram know how your time is engaged my good friend  surely not as yet mr charles recommended it should be concealed from her lest she should scruple to accept of the small assistance arising from it but he added it would not be possible to conceal it long since mr charles proposed taking his lessons occasionally in this house  o he does said macmorlan yes yes i can understand that better and pray mr sampson are these three hours entirely spent inconstruing and translating  doubtless no we have also colloquial intercourse to sweeten study neque semper arcum tendit apollo  the querist proceeded to elicit from this galloway phoebus what their discourse chiefly turned upon  upon our past meetings at ellangowan and truly i think very often we discourse concerning miss lucy for mr charles hazlewood in that particular resembleth me mr macmorlan when i begin to speak of her i never know when to stop and as i say jocularly she cheats us out of half our lessons  o ho thought macmorlan sits the wind in that quarter ive heard something like this before  he then began to consider what conduct was safest for his protegee and even for himself for the senior mr hazlewood was powerful wealthy ambitious and vindictive and looked for both fortune and title in any connexion which his son might form at length having the highest opinion of his guests good sense and penetration he determined to take an opportunity when they should happen to be alone to communicate the matter to her as a simple piece of intelligence he did so in as natural a manner as he could i wish you joy of your friend mr sampsons good fortune miss bertram he has got a pupil who pays him two guineas for twelve lessons of greek and latin  indeed i am equally happy and surprised who can be so liberal is colonel mannering returned  no no not colonel mannering but what do you think of your acquaintance mr charles hazlewood he talks of taking his lessons here i wish we may have accommodation for him  lucy blushed deeply for heavens sake no mr macmorlan do not let that be charles hazlewood has had enough of mischief about that already  about the classics my dear young lady wilfully seeming to misunderstand her most young gentlemen have so at one period or another sure enough but his present studies are voluntary  miss bertram let the conversation drop and her host made no effort to renew it as she seemed to pause upon the intelligence in order to form some internal resolution  the next day miss bertram took an opportunity of conversing with mr sampson expressing in the kindest manner her grateful thanks for his disinterested attachment and her joy that he had got such a provision she hinted to him that his present mode of superintending charles hazlewoods studies must be so inconvenient to his pupil that while that engagement lasted he had better consent to a temporary separation and reside either with his scholar or as near him as might be sampson refused as indeed she had expected to listen a moment to this proposition he would not quit her to be made preceptor to the prince of wales but i see he added you are too proud to share my pittance and peradventure i grow wearisome unto you  no indeed you were my fathers ancient almost his only friend i am not proud god knows i have no reason to be so you shall do what you judge best in other matters but oblige me by telling mr charles hazlewood that you had some conversation with me concerning his studies and that i was of opinion that his carrying them on in this house was altogether impracticable and not to be thought of  dominie sampson left her presence altogether crestfallen and as he shut the door could not help muttering the varium et mutabile of virgil next day he appeared with a very rueful visage and tendered miss bertram a letter mr hazlewood he said was to discontinue his lessons though he had generously made up the pecuniary loss but how will he make up the loss to himself of the knowledge he might have acquired under my instruction even in that one article of writinghe was an hour before he could write that brief note and destroyed many scrolls four quills and some good white paper i would have taught him in three weeks a firm current clear and legible hand he should have been a calligrapherbut gods will be done  the letter contained but a few lines deeply regretting and murmuring against miss bertrams cruelty who not only refused to see him but to permit him in the most indirect manner to hear of her health and contribute to her service but it concluded with assurances that her severity was vain and that nothing could shake the attachment of charles hazlewood  under the active patronage of mrs maccandlish sampson picked up some other scholarsvery different indeed from charles hazlewood in rank and whose lessons were proportionally unproductive still however he gained something and it was the glory of his heart to carry it to mr macmorlan weekly a slight peculium only subtracted to supply his snuffbox and tobaccopouch  and here we must leave kippletringan to look after our hero lest our readers should fear they are to lose sight of him for another quarter of a century       chapter  xvi      our polly is a sad slut nor heeds what we have taught her      i wonder any man alive will ever rear a daughter      for when shes drest with care and cost all tempting fine        and gay      as men should serve a cucumber she flings herself away            beggars opera   after the death of mr bertram mannering had set out upon a short tour proposing to return to the neighbourhood of ellangowan before the sale of that property should take place he went accordingly to edinburgh and elsewhere and it was in his return towards the southwestern district of scotland in which our scene lies that at a posttown about a hundred miles from kippletringan to which he had requested his friend mr mervyn to address his letters he received one from that gentleman which contained rather unpleasing intelligence we have assumed already the privilege of acting a secretis to this gentleman and therefore shall present the reader with an extract from this epistle  i beg your pardon my dearest friend for the pain i have given you in forcing you to open wounds so festering as those your letter referred to i have always heard though erroneously perhaps that the attentions of mr brown were intended for miss mannering but however that were it could not be supposed that in your situation his boldness should escape notice and chastisement wise men say that we resign to civil society our natural rights of selfdefence only on condition that the ordinances of law should protect us where the price cannot be paid the resignation becomes void for instance no one supposes that i am not entitled to defend my purse and person against a highwayman as much as if i were a wild indian who owns neither law nor magistracy the question of resistance or submission must be determined by my means and situation but if armed and equal in force i submit to injustice and violence from any man high or low i presume it will hardly be attributed to religious or moral feeling in me or in any one but a quaker an aggression on my honour seems to me much the same the insult however trifling in itself is one of much deeper consequence to all views in life than any wrong which can be inflicted by a depredator on the highway and to redress the injured party is much less in the power of public jurisprudence or rather it is entirely beyond its reach if any man chooses to rob arthur mervyn of the contents of his purse supposing the said arthur has not means of defence or the skill and courage to use them the assizes at lancaster or carlisle will do him justice by tucking up the robber yet who will say i am bound to wait for this justice and submit to being plundered in the first instance if i have myself the means and spirit to protect my own property but if an affront is offered to me submission under which is to tarnish my character for ever with men of honour and for which the twelve judges of england with the chancellor to boot can afford me no redress by what rule of law or reason am i to be deterred from protecting what ought to be and is so infinitely dearer to every man of honour than his whole fortune of the religious views of the matter i shall say nothing until i find a reverend divine who shall condemn selfdefence in the article of life and property if its propriety in that case be generally admitted i suppose little distinction can be drawn between defence of person and goods and protection of reputation that the latter is liable to be assailed by persons of a different rank in life untainted perhaps in morals and fair in character cannot affect my legal right of selfdefence i may be sorry that circumstances have engaged me in personal strife with such an individual but i should feel the same sorrow for a generous enemy who fell under my sword in a national quarrel i shall leave the question with the casuists however only observing that what i have written will not avail either the professed duellist or him who is the aggressor in a dispute of honour i only presume to exculpate him who is dragged into the field by such an offence as submitted to in patience would forfeit for ever his rank and estimation in society  i am sorry you have thoughts of settling in scotland and yet glad that you will still be at no immeasurable distance and that the latitude is all in our favour to move to westmoreland from devonshire might make an eastindian shudder but to come to us from galloway or dumfriesshire is a step though a short one nearer the sun besides if as i suspect the estate in view be connected with the old haunted castle in which you played the astrologer in your northern tour some twenty years since i have heard you too often describe the scene with comic unction to hope you will be deterred from making the purchase i trust however the hospitable gossiping laird has not run himself upon the shallows and that his chaplain whom you so often made us laugh at is still in rerum natura  and here dear mannering i wish i could stop for i have incredible pain in telling the rest of my story although i am sure i can warn you against any intentional impropriety on the part of my temporary ward julia mannering but i must still earn my college nickname of downright dunstable in one word then here is the matter  your daughter has much of the romantic turn of your disposition with a little of that love of admiration which all pretty women share less or more she will besides apparently be your heiress a trifling circumstance to those who view julia with my eyes but a prevailing bait to the specious artful and worthless you know how i have jested with her about her soft melancholy and lonely walks at morning before any one is up and in the moonlight when all should be gone to bed or set down to cards which is the same thing the incident which follows may not be beyond the bounds of a joke but i had rather the jest upon it came from you than me  two or three times during the last fortnight i heard at a late hour in the night or very early in the morning a flageolet play the little hindu tune to which your daughter is so partial i thought for some time that some tuneful domestic whose taste for music was laid under constraint during the day chose that silent hour to imitate the strains which he had caught up by the ear during his attendance in the drawingroom but last night i sat late in my study which is immediately under miss mannerings apartment and to my surprise i not only heard the flageolet distinctly but satisfied myself that it came from the lake under the window curious to know who serenaded us at that unusual hour i stole softly to the window of my apartment but there were other watchers than me you may remember miss mannering preferred that apartment on account of a balcony which opened from her window upon the lake well sir i heard the sash of her window thrown up the shutters opened and her own voice in conversation with some person who answered from below this is not much ado about nothing i could not be mistaken in her voice and such tones so soft so insinuating and to say the truth the accents from below were in passions tenderest cadence toobut of the sense i can say nothing i raised the sash of my own window that i might hear something more than the mere murmur of this spanish rendezvous but though i used every precaution the noise alarmed the speakers down slid the young ladys casement and the shutters were barred in an instant the dash of a pair of oars in the water announced the retreat of the male person of the dialogue indeed i saw his boat which he rowed with great swiftness and dexterity fly across the lake like a twelveoared barge next morning i examined some of my domestics as if by accident and i found the gamekeeper when making his rounds had twice seen that boat beneath the house with a single person and had heard the flageolet i did not care to press any farther questions for fear of implicating julia in the opinions of those of whom they might be asked next morning at breakfast i dropped a casual hint about the serenade of the evening before and i promise you miss mannering looked red and pale alternately i immediately gave the circumstance such a turn as might lead her to suppose that my observation was merely casual i have since caused a watchlight to be burnt in my library and have left the shutters open to deter the approach of our nocturnal guest and i have stated the severity of approaching winter and the rawness of the fogs as an objection to solitary walks miss mannering acquiesced with a passiveness which is no part of her character and which to tell you the plain truth is a feature about the business which i like least of all julia has too much of her own dear papas disposition to be curbed in any of her humours were there not some little lurking consciousness that it may be as prudent to avoid debate  now my story is told and you will judge what you ought to do i have not mentioned the matter to my good woman who a faithful secretary to her sexs foibles would certainly remonstrate against your being made acquainted with these particulars and might instead take it into her head to exercise her own eloquence on miss mannering a faculty which however powerful when directed against me its legitimate object might i fear do more harm than good in the case supposed perhaps even you yourself will find it most prudent to act without remonstrating or appearing to be aware of this little anecdote julia is very like a certain friend of mine she has a quick and lively imagination and keen feelings which are apt to exaggerate both the good and evil they find in life she is a charming girl however as generous and spirited as she is lovely i paid her the kiss you sent her with all my heart and she rapped my ringers for my reward with all hers pray return as soon as you can meantime rely upon the care of yours faithfully arthur mervyn  psyou will naturally wish to know if i have the least guess concerning the person of the serenader in truth i have none there is no young gentleman of these parts who might be in rank or fortune a match for miss julia that i think at all likely to play such a character but on the other side of the lake nearly opposite to mervyn hall is a dd cakehouse the resort of walking gentlemen of all descriptionspoets players painters musicianswho come to rave and recite and madden about this picturesque land of ours it is paying some penalty for its beauties that they are the means of drawing this swarm of coxcombs together but were julia my daughter it is one of those sort of fellows that i should fear on her account she is generous and romantic and writes six sheets a week to a female correspondent and its a sad thing to lack a subject in such a case either for exercise of the feelings or of the pen adieu once more were i to treat this matter more seriously than i have done i should do injustice to your feelings were i altogether to overlook it i should discredit my own  the consequence of this letter was that having first despatched the faithless messenger with the necessary powers to mr macmorlan for purchasing the estate of ellangowan colonel mannering turned his horses head in a more southerly direction and neither stinted nor staid until he arrived at the mansion of his friend mr mervyn upon the banks of one of the lakes of westmoreland       chapter  xvii      heaven first in its mercy taught mortals their letters      for ladies in limbo and lovers in fetters      or some author who placing his persons before ye      ungallantly leaves them to write their own story            pope imitated   when mannering returned to england his first object had been to place his daughter in a seminary for female education of established character not however finding her progress in the accomplishments which he wished her to acquire so rapid as his impatience expected he had withdrawn miss mannering from the school at the end of the first quarter so she had only time to form an eternal friendship with miss matilda marchmont a young lady about her own age which was nearly eighteen to her faithful eye were addressed those formidable quires which issued forth from mervyn hall on the wings of the post while miss mannering was a guest there the perusal of a few short extracts from these may be necessary to render our story intelligible  first extract  alas my dearest matilda what a tale is mine to tell misfortune from the cradle has set her seal upon your unhappy friend that we should be severed for so slight a causean ungrammatical phrase in my italian exercise and three false notes in one of paisiellos sonatas but it is a part of my fathers character of whom it is impossible to say whether i love admire or fear him the most his success in life and in war his habit of making every obstacle yield before the energy of his exertions even where they seemed insurmountableall these have given a hasty and peremptory cast to his character which can neither endure contradiction nor make allowance for deficiencies then he is himself so very accomplished do you know there was a murmur half confirmed too by some mysterious words which dropped from my poor mother that he possesses other sciences now lost to the world which enable the possessor to summon up before him the dark and shadowy forms of future events does not the very idea of such a power or even of the high talent and commanding intellect which the world may mistake for itdoes it not dear matilda throw a mysterious grandeur about its possessor you will call this romantic but consider i was born in the land of talisman and spell and my childhood lulled by tales which you can only enjoy through the gauzy frippery of a french translation o matilda i wish you could have seen the dusky visages of my indian attendants bending in earnest devotion round the magic narrative that flowed half poetry half prose from the lips of the taleteller no wonder that european fiction sounds cold and meagre after the wonderful effects which i have seen the romances of the east produce upon their hearers  second extract  you are possessed my dear matilda of my bosomsecret in those sentiments with which i regard brown i will not say his memory i am convinced he lives and is faithful his addresses to me were countenanced by my deceased parent imprudently countenanced perhaps considering the prejudices of my father in favour of birth and rank but i then almost a girl could not be expected surely to be wiser than her under whose charge nature had placed me my father constantly engaged in military duty i saw but at rare intervals and was taught to look up to him with more awe than confidence would to heaven it had been otherwise it might have been better for us all at this day  third extract  you ask me why i do not make known to my father that brown yet lives at least that he survived the wound he received in that unhappy duel and had written to my mother expressing his entire convalescence and his hope of speedily escaping from captivity a soldier that in the trade of war has oft slain men feels probably no uneasiness at reflecting upon the supposed catastrophe which almost turned me into stone and should i show him that letter does it not follow that brown alive and maintaining with pertinacity the pretensions to the affections of your poor friend for which my father formerly sought his life would be a more formidable disturber of colonel mannerings peace of mind than in his supposed grave if he escapes from the hands of these marauders i am convinced he will soon be in england and it will be then time to consider how his existence is to be disclosed to my father but if alas my earnest and confident hope should betray me what would it avail to tear open a mystery fraught with so many painful recollections my dear mother had such dread of its being known that i think she even suffered my father to suspect that browns attentions were directed towards herself rather than permit him to discover their real object and o matilda whatever respect i owe to the memory of a deceased parent let me do justice to a living one i cannot but condemn the dubious policy which she adopted as unjust to my father and highly perilous to herself and me but peace be with her ashes her actions were guided by the heart rather than the head and shall her daughter who inherits all her weakness be the first to withdraw the veil from her defects  fourth extract mervyn hall  if india be the land of magic this my dearest matilda is the country of romance the scenery is such as nature brings together in her sublimest moodssounding cataractshills which rear their scathed heads to the skylakes that winding up the shadowy valleys lead at every turn to yet more romantic recessesrocks which catch the clouds of heaven all the wildness of salvator here and there the fairy scenes of claude i am happy too in finding at least one object upon which my father can share my enthusiasm an admirer of nature both as an artist and a poet i have experienced the utmost pleasure from the observations by which he explains the character and the effect of these brilliant specimens of her power i wish he would settle in this enchanting land but his views lie still farther north and he is at present absent on a tour in scotland looking i believe for some purchase of land which may suit him as a residence he is partial from early recollections to that country so my dearest matilda i must be yet farther removed from you before i am established in a home and o how delighted shall i be when i can say come matilda and be the guest of your faithful julia  i am at present the inmate of mr and mrs mervyn old friends of my father the latter is precisely a good sort of woman ladylike and housewifely but for accomplishments or fancygood lack my dearest matilda your friend might as well seek sympathy from mrs teachemyou see i have not forgot school nicknames mervyn is a differentquite a different being from my father yet he amuses and endures me he is fat and goodnatured gifted with strong shrewd sense and some powers of humour but having been handsome i suppose in his youth has still some pretension to be a beau garcon as well as an enthusiastic agriculturist i delight to make him scramble to the tops of eminences and to the foot of waterfalls and am obliged in turn to admire his turnips his lucerne and his timothy grass he thinks me i fancy a simple romantic miss with somethe word will be outbeauty and some goodnature and i hold that the gentleman has good taste for the female outside and do not expect he should comprehend my sentiments farther so he rallies hands and hobbles for the dear creature has got the gout too and tells old stories of high life of which he has seen a great deal and i listen and smile and look as pretty as pleasant and as simple as i can and we do very well  but alas my dearest matilda how would time pass away even in this paradise of romance tenanted as it is by a pair assorting so ill with the scenes around them were it not for your fidelity in replying to my uninteresting details pray do not fail to write three times a week at least you can be at no loss what to say  fifth extract  how shall i communicate what i have now to tell my hand and heart still flutter so much that the task of writing is almost impossible did i not say that he lived did i not say i would not despair how could you suggest my dear matilda that my feelings considering i had parted from him so young rather arose from the warmth of my imagination than of my heart o i was sure that they were genuine deceitful as the dictates of our bosom so frequently are but to my talelet it be my friend the most sacred as it is the most sincere pledge of our friendship  our hours here are earlyearlier than my heart with its load of care can compose itself to rest i therefore usually take a book for an hour or two after retiring to my own room which i think i have told you opens to a small balcony looking down upon that beautiful lake of which i attempted to give you a slight sketch mervyn hall being partly an ancient building and constructed with a view to defence is situated on the verge of the lake a stone dropped from the projecting balcony plunges into water deep enough to float a skiff i had left my window partly unbarred that before i went to bed i might according to my custom look out and see the moonlight shining upon the lake i was deeply engaged with that beautiful scene in the merchant of venice where two lovers describing the stillness of a summer night enhance on each other its charms and was lost in the associations of story and of feeling which it awakens when i heard upon the lake the sound of a flageolet i have told you it was browns favourite instrument who could touch it in a night which though still and serene was too cold and too late in the year to invite forth any wanderer for mere pleasure i drew yet nearer the window and hearkened with breathless attention the sounds paused a space were then resumed paused again and again reached my ear ever coming nearer and nearer at length i distinguished plainly that little hindu air which you called my favourite i have told you by whom it was taught me the instrument the tones were his own was it earthly music or notes passing on the wind to warn me of his death  it was some time ere i could summon courage to step on the balcony nothing could have emboldened me to do so but the strong conviction of my mind that he was still alive and that we should again meet but that conviction did embolden me and i ventured though with a throbbing heart there was a small skiff with a single person o matilda it was himself i knew his appearance after so long an absence and through the shadow of the night as perfectly as if we had parted yesterday and met again in the broad sunshine he guided his boat under the balcony and spoke to me i hardly knew what he said or what i replied indeed i could scarcely speak for weeping but they were joyful tears we were disturbed by the barking of a dog at some distance and parted but not before he had conjured me to prepare to meet him at the same place and hour this evening  but where and to what is all this tending can i answer this question i cannot heaven that saved him from death and delivered him from captivity that saved my father too from shedding the blood of one who would not have blemished a hair of his head that heaven must guide me out of this labyrinth enough for me the firm resolution that matilda shall not blush for her friend my father for his daughter nor my lover for her on whom he has fixed his affection       chapter  xviii      talk with a man out of a windowa proper saying            much ado about nothing   we must proceed with our extracts from miss mannerings letters which throw light upon natural good sense principle and feelings blemished by an imperfect education and the folly of a misjudging mother who called her husband in her heart a tyrant until she feared him as such and read romances until she became so enamoured of the complicated intrigues which they contain as to assume the management of a little family novel of her own and constitute her daughter a girl of sixteen the principal heroine she delighted in petty mystery and intrigue and secrets and yet trembled at the indignation which these paltry manoeuvres excited in her husbands mind thus she frequently entered upon a scheme merely for pleasure or perhaps for the love of contradiction plunged deeper into it than she was aware endeavoured to extricate herself by new arts or to cover her error by dissimulation became involved in meshes of her own weaving and was forced to carry on for fear of discovery machinations which she had at first resorted to in mere wantonness  fortunately the young man whom she so imprudently introduced into her intimate society and encouraged to look up to her daughter had a fund of principle and honest pride which rendered him a safer intimate than mrs mannering ought to have dared to hope or expect the obscurity of his birth could alone be objected to him in every other respect  with prospects bright upon the world he came pure love of virtue strong desire of fame men watched the way his lofty mind would take and all foretold the progress he would make  but it could not be expected that he should resist the snare which mrs mannerings imprudence threw in his way or avoid becoming attached to a young lady whose beauty and manners might have justified his passion even in scenes where these are more generally met with than in a remote fortress in our indian settlements the scenes which followed have been partly detailed in mannerings letter to mr mervyn and to expand what is there stated into farther explanation would be to abuse the patience of our readers  we shall therefore proceed with our promised extracts from miss mannerings letters to her friend  sixth extract  i have seen him again matildaseen him twice i have used every argument to convince him that this secret intercourse is dangerous to us both i even pressed him to pursue his views of fortune without farther regard to me and to consider my peace of mind as sufficiently secured by the knowledge that he had not fallen under my fathers sword he answersbut how can i detail all he has to answer he claims those hopes as his due which my mother permitted him to entertain and would persuade me to the madness of a union without my fathers sanction but to this matilda i will not be persuaded i have resisted i have subdued the rebellious feelings which arose to aid his plea yet how to extricate myself from this unhappy labyrinth in which fate and folly have entangled us both  i have thought upon it matilda till my head is almost giddy nor can i conceive a better plan than to make a full confession to my father he deserves it for his kindness is unceasing and i think i have observed in his character since i have studied it more nearly that his harsher feelings are chiefly excited where he suspects deceit or imposition and in that respect perhaps his character was formerly misunderstood by one who was dear to him he has too a tinge of romance in his disposition and i have seen the narrative of a generous action a trait of heroism or virtuous selfdenial extract tears from him which refused to flow at a tale of mere distress but then brown urges that he is personally hostile to him and the obscurity of his birth that would be indeed a stumblingblock o matilda i hope none of your ancestors ever fought at poictiers or agincourt if it were not for the veneration which my father attaches to the memory of old sir miles mannering i should make out my explanation with half the tremor which must now attend it  seventh extract  i have this instant received your letteryour most welcome letter thanks my dearest friend for your sympathy and your counsels i can only repay them with unbounded confidence  you ask me what brown is by origin that his descent should be so unpleasing to my father his story is shortly told he is of scottish extraction but being left an orphan his education was undertaken by a family of relations settled in holland he was bred to commerce and sent very early to one of our settlements in the east where his guardian had a correspondent but this correspondent was dead when he arrived in india and he had no other resource than to offer himself as a clerk to a countinghouse the breaking out of the war and the straits to which we were at first reduced threw the army open to all young men who were disposed to embrace that mode of life and brown whose genius had a strong military tendency was the first to leave what might have been the road to wealth and to choose that of fame the rest of his history is well known to you but conceive the irritation of my father who despises commerce though by the way the best part of his property was made in that honourable profession by my greatuncle and has a particular antipathy to the dutchthink with what ear he would be likely to receive proposals for his only child from vanbeest brown educated for charity by the house of vanbeest and vanbruggen o matilda it will never do nay so childish am i i hardly can help sympathising with his aristocratic feelings mrs vanbeest brown the name has little to recommend it to be sure what children we are  eighth extract  it is all over now matilda i shall never have courage to tell my father nay most deeply do i fear he has already learned my secret from another quarter which will entirely remove the grace of my communication and ruin whatever gleam of hope i had ventured to connect with it yesternight brown came as usual and his flageolet on the lake announced his approach we had agreed that he should continue to use this signal these romantic lakes attract numerous visitors who indulge their enthusiasm in visiting the scenery at all hours and we hoped that if brown were noticed from the house he might pass for one of those admirers of nature who was giving vent to his feelings through the medium of music the sounds might also be my apology should i be observed on the balcony but last night while i was eagerly enforcing my plan of a full confession to my father which he as earnestly deprecated we heard the window of mr mervyns library which is under my room open softly i signed to brown to make his retreat and immediately reentered with some faint hopes that our interview had not been observed  but alas matilda these hopes vanished the instant i beheld mr mervyns countenance at breakfast the next morning he looked so provokingly intelligent and confidential that had i dared i could have been more angry than ever i was in my life but i must be on good behaviour and my walks are now limited within his farm precincts where the good gentleman can amble along by my side without inconvenience i have detected him once or twice attempting to sound my thoughts and watch the expression of my countenance he has talked of the flageolet more than once and has at different times made eulogiums upon the watchfulness and ferocity of his dogs and the regularity with which the keeper makes his rounds with a loaded fowlingpiece he mentioned even mantraps and springguns i should be loth to affront my fathers old friend in his own house but i do long to show him that i am my fathers daughter a fact of which mr mervyn will certainly be convinced if ever i trust my voice and temper with a reply to these indirect hints of one thing i am certaini am grateful to him on that accounthe has not told mrs mervyn lord help me i should have had such lectures about the dangers of love and the night air on the lake the risk arising from colds and fortunehunters the comfort and convenience of sackwhey and closed windows i cannot help trifling matilda though my heart is sad enough what brown will do i cannot guess i presume however the fear of detection prevents his resuming his nocturnal visits he lodges at an inn on the opposite shore of the lake under the name he tells me of dawson he has a bad choice in names that must be allowed he has not left the army i believe but he says nothing of his present views  to complete my anxiety my father is returned suddenly and in high displeasure our good hostess as i learned from a bustling conversation between her housekeeper and her had no expectation of seeing him for a week but i rather suspect his arrival was no surprise to his friend mr mervyn his manner to me was singularly cold and constrained sufficiently so to have damped all the courage with which i once resolved to throw myself on his generosity he lays the blame of his being discomposed and out of humour to the loss of a purchase in the southwest of scotland on which he had set his heart but i do not suspect his equanimity of being so easily thrown off its balance his first excursion was with mr mervyns barge across the lake to the inn i have mentioned you may imagine the agony with which i waited his return had he recognized brown who can guess the consequence he returned however apparently without having made any discovery i understand that in consequence of his late disappointment he means now to hire a house in the neighbourhood of this same ellangowan of which i am doomed to hear so much he seems to think it probable that the estate for which he wishes may soon be again in the market i will not send away this letter until i hear more distinctly what are his intentions  i have now had an interview with my father as confidential as i presume he means to allow me he requested me today after breakfast to walk with him into the library my knees matilda shook under me and it is no exaggeration to say i could scarce follow him into the room i feared i knew not what from my childhood i had seen all around him tremble at his frown he motioned me to seat myself and i never obeyed a command so readily for in truth i could hardly stand he himself continued to walk up and down the room you have seen my father and noticed i recollect the remarkably expressive cast of his features his eyes are naturally rather light in colour but agitation or anger gives them a darker and more fiery glance he has a custom also of drawing in his lips when much moved which implies a combat between native ardour of temper and the habitual power of selfcommand this was the first time we had been alone since his return from scotland and as he betrayed these tokens of agitation i had little doubt that he was about to enter upon the subject i most dreaded  to my unutterable relief i found i was mistaken and that whatever he knew of mr mervyns suspicions or discoveries he did not intend to converse with me on the topic coward as i was i was inexpressibly relieved though if he had really investigated the reports which may have come to his ear the reality could have been nothing to what his suspicions might have conceived but though my spirits rose high at my unexpected escape i had not courage myself to provoke the discussion and remained silent to receive his commands  julia he said my agent writes me from scotland that he has been able to hire a house for me decently furnished and with the necessary accommodation for my family it is within three miles of that i had designed to purchase then he made a pause and seemed to expect an answer  whatever place of residence suits you sir must be perfectly agreeable to me  umph i do not propose however julia that you shall reside quite alone in this house during the winter  mr and mrs mervyn thought i to myselfwhatever company is agreeable to you sir i answered aloud  o there is a little too much of this universal spirit of submission an excellent disposition in action but your constantly repeating the jargon of it puts me in mind of the eternal salaams of our black dependents in the east in short julia i know you have a relish for society and i intend to invite a young person the daughter of a deceased friend to spend a few months with us  not a governess for the love of heaven papa exclaimed poor i my fears at that moment totally getting the better of my prudence  no not a governess miss mannering replied the colonel somewhat sternly but a young lady from whose excellent example bred as she has been in the school of adversity i trust you may learn the art to govern yourself  to answer this was trenching upon too dangerous ground so there was a pause  is the young lady a scotchwoman papa  yesdrily enough  has she much of the accent sir  much of the devil answered my father hastily do you think i care about as and aas and is and ees i tell you julia i am serious in the matter you have a genius for friendship that is for running up intimacies which you call such was not this very harshly said matilda now i wish to give you an opportunity at least to make one deserving friend and therefore i have resolved that this young lady shall be a member of my family for some months and i expect you will pay to her that attention which is due to misfortune and virtue  certainly sir is my future friend redhaired  he gave me one of his stern glances you will say perhaps i deserved it but i think the deuce prompts me with teasing questions on some occasions  she is as superior to you my love in personal appearance as in prudence and affection for her friends  lord papa do you think that superiority a recommendation well sir but i see you are going to take all this too seriously whatever the young lady may be i am sure being recommended by you she shall have no reason to complain of my want of attention after a pausehas she any attendant because you know i must provide for her proper accommodation if she is without one  nnono not properly an attendant the chaplain who lived with her father is a very good sort of man and i believe i shall make room for him in the house  chaplain papa lord bless us  yes miss mannering chaplain is there anything very new in that word had we not a chaplain at the residence when we were in india  yes papa but you was a commandant then  so i will be now miss mannering in my own family at least  certainly sir but will he read us the church of england service  the apparent simplicity with which i asked this question got the better of his gravity come julia he said you are a sad girl but i gain nothing by scolding you of these two strangers the young lady is one whom you cannot fail i think to love the person whom for want of a better term i called chaplain is a very worthy and somewhat ridiculous personage who will never find out you laugh at him if you dont laugh very loud indeed  dear papa i am delighted with that part of his character but pray is the house we are going to as pleasantly situated as this  not perhaps as much to your taste there is no lake under the windows and you will be under the necessity of having all your music within doors  this last coup de main ended the keen encounter of our wits for you may believe matilda it quelled all my courage to reply  yet my spirits as perhaps will appear too manifest from this dialogue have risen insensibly and as it were in spite of myself brown alive and free and in england embarrassment and anxiety i can and must endure we leave this in two days for our new residence i shall not fail to let you know what i think of these scotch inmates whom i have but too much reason to believe my father means to quarter in his house as a brace of honourable spies a sort of female rozencrantz and reverend guildenstern one in tartan petticoats the other in a cassock what a contrast to the society i would willingly have secured to myself i shall write instantly on my arriving at our new place of abode and acquaint my dearest matilda with the farther fates ofher  julia mannering       chapter  xix      which sloping hills around inclose      where many a beech and brown oak grows      beneath whose dark and branching bowers      its tides a farfamd river pours      by natures beauties taught to please      sweet tusculan of rural easel            warton   woodbourne the habitation which mannering by mr macmorlans mediation had hired for a season was a large comfortable mansion snugly situated beneath a hill covered with wood which shrouded the house upon the north and east the front looked upon a little lawn bordered by a grove of old trees beyond were some arable fields extending down to the river which was seen from the windows of the house a tolerable though oldfashioned garden a wellstocked dovecot and the possession of any quantity of ground which the convenience of the family might require rendered the place in every respect suitable as the advertisements have it for the accommodation of a genteel family  here then mannering resolved for some time at least to set up the staff of his rest though an eastindian he was not partial to an ostentatious display of wealth in fact he was too proud a man to be a vain one he resolved therefore to place himself upon the footing of a country gentleman of easy fortune without assuming or permitting his household to assume any of the faste which then was considered as characteristic of a nabob  he had still his eye upon the purchase of ellangowan which macmorlan conceived mr glossin would be compelled to part with as some of the creditors disputed his title to retain so large a part of the purchasemoney in his own hands and his power to pay it was much questioned in that case macmorlan was assured he would readily give up his bargain if tempted with something above the price which he had stipulated to pay it may seem strange that mannering was so much attached to a spot which he had only seen once and that for a short time in early life but the circumstances which passed there had laid a strong hold on his imagination there seemed to be a fate which conjoined the remarkable passages of his own family history with those of the inhabitants of ellangowan and he felt a mysterious desire to call the terrace his own from which he had read in the book of heaven a fortune strangely accomplished in the person of the infant heir of that family and corresponding so closely with one which had been strikingly fulfilled in his own besides when once this thought had got possession of his imagination he could not without great reluctance brook the idea of his plan being defeated and by a fellow like glossin so pride came to the aid of fancy and both combined to fortify his resolution to buy the estate if possible  let us do mannering justice a desire to serve the distressed had also its share in determining him he had considered the advantage which julia might receive from the company of lucy bertram whose genuine prudence and good sense could so surely be relied upon this idea had become much stronger since macmorlan had confided to him under the solemn seal of secrecy the whole of her conduct towards young hazlewood to propose to her to become an inmate in his family if distant from the scenes of her youth and the few whom she called friends would have been less delicate but at woodbourne she might without difficulty be induced to become the visitor of a season without being depressed into the situation of an humble companion lucy bertram with some hesitation accepted the invitation to reside a few weeks with miss mannering she felt too well that however the colonels delicacy might disguise the truth his principal motive was a generous desire to afford her his countenance and protection which his high connexions and higher character were likely to render influential in the neighbourhood  about the same time the orphan girl received a letter from mrs bertram the relation to whom she had written as cold and comfortless as could well be imagined it inclosed indeed a small sum of money but strongly recommended economy and that miss bertram should board herself in some quiet family either at kippletringan or in the neighbourhood assuring her that though her own income was very scanty she would not see her kinswoman want miss bertram shed some natural tears over this coldhearted epistle for in her mothers time this good lady had been a guest at ellangowan for nearly three years and it was only upon succeeding to a property of about l400 a year that she had taken farewell of that hospitable mansion which otherwise might have had the honour of sheltering her until the death of its owner lucy was strongly inclined to return the paltry donation which after some struggles with avarice pride had extorted from the old lady but on consideration she contented herself with writing that she accepted it as a loan which she hoped in a short time to repay and consulted her relative upon the invitation she had received from colonel and miss mannering this time the answer came in course of post so fearful was mrs bertram that some frivolous delicacy or nonsense as she termed it might induce her cousin to reject such a promising offer and thereby at the same time to leave herself still a burden upon her relations lucy therefore had no alternative unless she preferred continuing a burden upon the worthy macmorlans who were too liberal to be rich those kinsfolk who formerly requested the favour of her company had of late either silently or with expressions of resentment that she should have preferred macmorlans invitation to theirs gradually withdrawn their notice  the fate of dominie sampson would have been deplorable had it depended upon any one except mannering who was an admirer of originality for a separation from lucy bertram would have certainly broken his heart macmorlan had given a full account of his proceedings towards the daughter of his patron the answer was a request from mannering to know whether the dominie still possessed that admirable virtue of taciturnity by which he was so notably distinguished at ellangowan macmorlan replied in the affirmative let mr sampson know said the colonels next letter that i shall want his assistance to catalogue and put in order the library of my uncle the bishop which i have ordered to be sent down by sea i shall also want him to copy and arrange some papers fix his salary at what you think befitting let the poor man be properly dressed and accompany his young lady to woodbourne  honest macmorlan received this mandate with great joy but pondered much upon executing that part of it which related to newly attiring the worthy dominie he looked at him with a scrutinising eye and it was but too plain that his present garments were daily waxing more deplorable to give him money and bid him go and furnish himself would be only giving him the means of making himself ridiculous for when such a rare event arrived to mr sampson as the purchase of new garments the additions which he made to his wardrobe by the guidance of his own taste usually brought all the boys of the village after him for many days on the other hand to bring a tailor to measure him and send home his clothes as for a schoolboy would probably give offence at length macmorlan resolved to consult miss bertram and request her interference she assured him that though she could not pretend to superintend a gentlemans wardrobe nothing was more easy than to arrange the dominies  at ellangowan she said whenever my poor father thought any part of the dominies dress wanted renewal a servant was directed to enter his room by night for he sleeps as fast as a dormouse carry off the old vestment and leave the new one nor could any one observe that the dominie exhibited the least consciousness of the change put upon him on such occasions  macmorlan in conformity with miss bertrams advice procured a skilful artist who on looking at the dominie attentively undertook to make for him two suits of clothes one black and one ravengrey and even engaged that they should fit himas well at least so the tailor qualified his enterprise as a man of such an outoftheway build could be fitted by merely human needles and shears when this fashioner had accomplished his task and the dresses were brought home macmorlan judiciously resolving to accomplish his purpose by degrees withdrew that evening an important part of his dress and substituted the new article of raiment in its stead perceiving that this passed totally without notice he next ventured on the waistcoat and lastly on the coat when fully metamorphosed and arrayed for the first time in his life in a decent dress they did observe that the dominie seemed to have some indistinct and embarrassing consciousness that a change had taken place on his outward man whenever they observed this dubious expression gather upon his countenance accompanied with a glance that fixed now upon the sleeve of his coat now upon the knees of his breeches where he probably missed some antique patching and darning which being executed with blue thread upon a black ground had somewhat the effect of embroidery they always took care to turn his attention into some other channel until his garments by the aid of use cleaved to their mould the only remark he was ever known to make on the subject was that the air of a town like kippletringan seemed favourable unto wearing apparel for he thought his coat looked almost as new as the first day he put it on which was when he went to stand trial for his license as a preacher  when the dominie first heard the liberal proposal of colonel mannering he turned a jealous and doubtful glance towards miss bertram as if he suspected that the project involved their separation but when mr macmorlan hastened to explain that she would be a guest at woodbourne for some time he rubbed his huge hands together and burst into a portentous sort of chuckle like that of the afrite in the tale of the caliph vathek after this unusual explosion of satisfaction he remained quite passive in all the rest of the transaction  it had been settled that mr and mrs macmorlan should take possession of the house a few days before mannerings arrival both to put everything in perfect order and to make the transference of miss bertrams residence from their family to his as easy and delicate as possible accordingly in the beginning of the month of december the party were settled at woodbourne       chapter xx     a gigantic genius fit to grapple with whole libraries          boswells life of johnson   the appointed day arrived when the colonel and miss mannering were expected at woodbourne the hour was fast approaching and the little circle within doors had each their separate subjects of anxiety macmorlan naturally desired to attach to himself the patronage and countenance of a person of mannerings wealth and consequence he was aware from his knowledge of mankind that mannering though generous and benevolent had the foible of expecting and exacting a minute compliance with his directions he was therefore racking his recollection to discover if everything had been arranged to meet the colonels wishes and instructions and under this uncertainty of mind he traversed the house more than once from the garret to the stables mrs macmorlan revolved in a lesser orbit comprehending the diningparlour housekeepers room and kitchen she was only afraid that the dinner might be spoiled to the discredit of her housewifely accomplishments even the usual passiveness of the dominie was so far disturbed that he twice went to the window which looked out upon the avenue and twice exclaimed why tarry the wheels of their chariot lucy the most quiet of the expectants had her own melancholy thoughts she was now about to be consigned to the charge almost to the benevolence of strangers with whose character though hitherto very amiably displayed she was but imperfectly acquainted the moments therefore of suspense passed anxiously and heavily  at length the trampling of horses and the sound of wheels were heard the servants who had already arrived drew up in the hall to receive their master and mistress with an importance and empressement which to lucy who had never been accustomed to society or witnessed what is called the manners of the great had something alarming macmorlan went to the door to receive the master and mistress of the family and in a few moments they were in the drawingroom  mannering who had travelled as usual on horseback entered with his daughter hanging upon his arm she was of the middle size or rather less but formed with much elegance piercing dark eyes and jetblack hair of great length corresponded with the vivacity and intelligence of features in which were blended a little haughtiness and a little bashfulness a great deal of shrewdness and some power of humorous sarcasm i shall not like her was the result of lucy bertrams first glance and yet i rather think i shall was the thought excited by the second  miss mannering was furred and mantled up to the throat against the severity of the weather the colonel in his military greatcoat he bowed to mrs macmorlan whom his daughter also acknowledged with a fashionable courtesy not dropped so low as at all to incommode her person the colonel then led his daughter up to miss bertram and taking the hand of the latter with an air of great kindness and almost paternal affection he said julia this is the young lady whom i hope our good friends have prevailed on to honour our house with a long visit i shall be much gratified indeed if you can render woodbourne as pleasant to miss bertram as ellangowan was to me when i first came as a wanderer into this country  the young lady courtesied acquiescence and took her new friends hand mannering now turned his eye upon the dominie who had made bows since his entrance into the room sprawling out his leg and bending his back like an automaton which continues to repeat the same movement until the motion is stopt by the artist my good friend mr sampson said mannering introducing him to his daughter and darting at the same time a reproving glance at the damsel notwithstanding he had himself some disposition to join her too obvious inclination to risibility this gentleman julia is to put my books in order when they arrive and i expect to derive great advantage from his extensive learning  i am sure we are obliged to the gentleman papa and to borrow a ministerial mode of giving thanks i shall never forget the extraordinary countenance he has been pleased to show us but miss bertram continued she hastily for her fathers brows began to darken we have travelled a good way will you permit me to retire before dinner  this intimation dispersed all the company save the dominie who having no idea of dressing but when he was to rise or of undressing but when he meant to go to bed remained by himself chewing the cud of a mathematical demonstration until the company again assembled in the drawingroom and from thence adjourned to the diningparlour  when the day was concluded mannering took an opportunity to hold a minutes conversation with his daughter in private  how do you like your guests julia  o miss bertram of all things but this is a most original parson why dear sir no human being will be able to look at him without laughing  while he is under my roof julia every one must learn to do so  lord papa the very footmen could not keep their gravity  then let them strip off my livery said the colonel and laugh at their leisure mr sampson is a man whom i esteem for his simplicity and benevolence of character  o i am convinced of his generosity too said this lively lady he cannot lift a spoonful of soup to his mouth without bestowing a share on everything round  julia you are incorrigible but remember i expect your mirth on this subject to be under such restraint that it shall neither offend this worthy mans feelings nor those of miss bertram who may be more apt to feel upon his account than he on his own and so goodnight my dear and recollect that though mr sampson has certainly not sacrificed to the graces there are many things in this world more truly deserving of ridicule than either awkwardness of manners or simplicity of character  in a day or two mr and mrs macmorlan left woodbourne after taking an affectionate farewell of their late guest the household were now settled in their new quarters the young ladies followed their studies and amusements together colonel mannering was agreeably surprised to find that miss bertram was well skilled in french and italian thanks to the assiduity of dominie sampson whose labour had silently made him acquainted with most modern as well as ancient languages of music she knew little or nothing but her new friend undertook to give her lessons in exchange for which she was to learn from lucy the habit of walking and the art of riding and the courage necessary to defy the season mannering was careful to substitute for their amusement in the evening such books as might convey some solid instruction with entertainment and as he read aloud with great skill and taste the winter nights passed pleasantly away  society was quickly formed where there were so many inducements most of the families of the neighbourhood visited colonel mannering and he was soon able to select from among them such as best suited his taste and habits charles hazlewood held a distinguished place in his favour and was a frequent visitor not without the consent and approbation of his parents for there was no knowing they thought what assiduous attention might produce and the beautiful miss mannering of high family with an indian fortune was a prize worth looking after dazzled with such a prospect they never considered the risk which had once been some object of their apprehension that his boyish and inconsiderate fancy might form an attachment to the penniless lucy bertram who had nothing on earth to recommend her but a pretty face good birth and a most amiable disposition mannering was more prudent he considered himself acting as miss bertrams guardian and while he did not think it incumbent upon him altogether to check her intercourse with a young gentleman for whom excepting in wealth she was a match in every respect he laid it under such insensible restraints as might prevent any engagement or eclaircissement taking place until the young man should have seen a little more of life and of the world and have attained that age when he might be considered as entitled to judge for himself in the matter in which his happiness was chiefly interested  while these matters engaged the attention of the other members of the woodbourne family dominie sampson was occupied body and soul in the arrangement of the late bishops library which had been sent from liverpool by sea and conveyed by thirty or forty carts from the seaport at which it was landed sampsons joy at beholding the ponderous contents of these chests arranged upon the floor of the large apartment from whence he was to transfer them to the shelves baffles all description he grinned like an ogre swung his arms like the sails of a windmill shouted prodigious till the roof rung to his raptures he had never he said seen so many books together except in the college library and now his dignity and delight in being superintendent of the collection raised him in his own opinion almost to the rank of the academical librarian whom he had always regarded as the greatest and happiest man on earth neither were his transports diminished upon a hasty examination of the contents of these volumes some indeed of belles lettres poems plays or memoirs he tossed indignantly aside with the implied censure ofpshaor frivolous but the greater and bulkier part of the collection bore a very different character the deceased prelate a divine of the old and deeplylearned cast had loaded his shelves with volumes which displayed the antique and venerable attributes so happily described by a modern poet       that weight of wood with leathern coat oerlaid      those ample clasps of solid metal made      the closepressd leaves unoped for many an age      the dull red edging of the wellfilld page      on the broad back the stubborn ridges rolld      where yet the title stands in tarnishd gold  books of theology and controversial divinity commentaries and polyglots sets of the fathers and sermons which might each furnish forth ten brief discourses of modern date books of science ancient and modern classical authors in their best and rarest formssuch formed the late bishops venerable library and over such the eye of dominie sampson gloated with rapture he entered them in the catalogue in his best running hand forming each letter with the accuracy of a lover writing a valentine and placed each individually on the destined shelf with all the reverence which i have seen a lady pay to a jar of old china with all this zeal his labours advanced slowly he often opened a volume when halfway up the library steps fell upon some interesting passage and without shifting his inconvenient posture continued immersed in the fascinating perusal until the servant pulled him by the skirts to assure him that dinner waited he then repaired to the parlour bolted his food down his capacious throat in squares of three inches answered ay and no at random to whatever question was asked at him and again hurried back to the library as soon as his napkin was removed and sometimes with it hanging round his neck like a pinafore       how happily the days of thalaba went by  and having thus left the principal characters of our tale in a situation which being sufficiently comfortable to themselves is of course utterly uninteresting to the reader we take up the history of a person who has as yet only been named and who has all the interest that uncertainty and misfortune can give       chapter  xxi      what sayst thou wise one that all powerful love      can fortunes strong impediments remove      nor is it strange that worth should wed to worth      the pride of genius with the pride of birth            crabbe   v browni will not give at full length his thrice unhappy namehad been from infancy a ball for fortune to spurn at but nature had given him that elasticity of mind which rises higher from the rebound his form was tall manly and active and his features corresponded with his person for although far from regular they had an expression of intelligence and goodhumour and when he spoke or was particularly animated might be decidedly pronounced interesting his manner indicated the military profession which had been his choice and in which he had now attained the rank of captain the person who succeeded colonel mannering in his command having laboured to repair the injustice which brown had sustained by that gentlemans prejudice against him but this as well as his liberation from captivity had taken place after mannering left india brown followed at no distant period his regiment being recalled home his first inquiry was after the family of mannering and easily learning their route northward he followed it with the purpose of resuming his addresses to julia with her father he deemed he had no measures to keep for ignorant of the more venomous belief which had been instilled into the colonels mind he regarded him as an oppressive aristocrat who had used his power as a commanding officer to deprive him of the preferment due to his behaviour and who had forced upon him a personal quarrel without any better reason than his attentions to a pretty young woman agreeable to herself and permitted and countenanced by her mother he was determined therefore to take no rejection unless from the young lady herself believing that the heavy misfortunes of his painful wound and imprisonment were direct injuries received from the father which might dispense with his using much ceremony towards him how far his scheme had succeeded when his nocturnal visit was discovered by mr mervyn our readers are already informed  upon this unpleasant occurrence captain brown absented himself from the inn in which he had resided under the name of dawson so that colonel mannerings attempts to discover and trace him were unavailing he resolved however that no difficulties should prevent his continuing his enterprise while julia left him a ray of hope the interest he had secured in her bosom was such as she had been unable to conceal from him and with all the courage of romantic gallantry he determined upon perseverance but we believe the reader will be as well pleased to learn his mode of thinking and intention from his own communication to his special friend and confidant captain delaserre a swiss gentleman who had a company in his regiment  extract  let me hear from you soon dear delaserre remember i can learn nothing about regimental affairs but through your friendly medium and i long to know what has become of ayres courtmartial and whether elliot gets the majority also how recruiting comes on and how the young officers like the mess of our kind friend the lieutenantcolonel i need ask nothing i saw him as i passed through nottingham happy in the bosom of his family what a happiness it is philip for us poor devils that we have a little restingplace between the camp and the grave if we can manage to escape disease and steel and lead and the effects of hard living a retired old soldier is always a graceful and respected character he grumbles a little now and then but then his is licensed murmuring were a lawyer or a physician or a clergyman to breathe a complaint of hard luck or want of preferment a hundred tongues would blame his own incapacity as the cause but the most stupid veteran that ever faltered out the thricetold tale of a siege and a battle and a cock and a bottle is listened to with sympathy and reverence when he shakes his thin locks and talks with indignation of the boys that are put over his head and you and i delaserre foreigners bothfor what am i the better that i was originally a scotchman since could i prove my descent the english would hardly acknowledge me a countrymanwe may boast that we have fought out our preferment and gained that by the sword which we had not money to compass otherwise the english are a wise people while they praise themselves and affect to undervalue all other nations they leave us luckily trapdoors and backdoors open by which we strangers less favoured by nature may arrive at a share of their advantages and thus they are in some respects like a boastful landlord who exalts the value and flavour of his sixyearsold mutton while he is delighted to dispense a share of it to all the company in short you whose proud family and i whose hard fate made us soldiers of fortune have the pleasant recollection that in the british service stop where we may upon our career it is only for want of money to pay the turnpike and not from our being prohibited to travel the road if therefore you can persuade little weischel to come into ours for gods sake let him buy the ensigncy live prudently mind his duty and trust to the fates for promotion  and now i hope you are expiring with curiosity to learn the end of my romance i told you i had deemed it convenient to make a few days tour on foot among the mountains of westmoreland with dudley a young english artist with whom i have formed some acquaintance a fine fellow this you must know delaserre he paints tolerably draws beautifully converses well and plays charmingly on the flute and though thus well entitled to be a coxcomb of talent is in fact a modest unpretending young man on our return from our little tour i learned that the enemy had been reconnoitring mr mervyns barge had crossed the lake i was informed by my landlord with the squire himself and a visitor  what sort of person landlord  why he was a dark officerlooking mon at they called colonel squoire mervyn questioned me as close as i had been at sizes i had guess mr dawson i told you that was my feigned name but i tould him nought of your vagaries and going out alaking in the mere anoights not i an i can make no sport ise spoil none and squoire mervyns as cross as poycrust too mon hes aye maundering an my guests but land beneath his house though it be marked for the fourth station in the survey noa noa een let un smell things out o themselves for joe hodges  you will allow there was nothing for it after this but paying honest joe hodgess bill and departing unless i had preferred making him my confidant for which i felt in no way inclined besides i learned that our cidevant colonel was on full retreat for scotland carrying off poor julia along with him i understand from those who conduct the heavy baggage that he takes his winter quarters at a place called woodbourne in shire in scotland he will be all on the alert just now so i must let him enter his entrenchments without any new alarm and then my good colonel to whom i owe so many grateful thanks pray look to your defence  i protest to you delaserre i often think there is a little contradiction enters into the ardour of my pursuit i think i would rather bring this haughty insulting man to the necessity of calling his daughter mrs brown than i would wed her with his full consent and with the kings permission to change my name for the style and arms of mannering though his whole fortune went with them there is only one circumstance that chills me a little julia is young and romantic i would not willingly hurry her into a step which her riper years might disapprove nonor would i like to have her upbraid me were it but with a glance of her eye with having ruined her fortunes far less give her reason to say as some have not been slow to tell their lords that had i left her time for consideration she would have been wiser and done better no delaserre this must not be the picture presses close upon me because i am aware a girl in julias situation has no distinct and precise idea of the value of the sacrifice she makes she knows difficulties only by name and if she thinks of love and a farm it is a ferme ornee such as is only to be found in poetic description or in the park of a gentleman of twelve thousand a year she would be ill prepared for the privations of that real swiss cottage we have so often talked of and for the difficulties which must necessarily surround us even before we attained that haven this must be a point clearly ascertained although julias beauty and playful tenderness have made an impression on my heart never to be erased i must be satisfied that she perfectly understands the advantages she foregoes before she sacrifices them for my sake  am i too proud delaserre when i trust that even this trial may terminate favourably to my wishes am i too vain when i suppose that the few personal qualities which i possess with means of competence however moderate and the determination of consecrating my life to her happiness may make amends for all i must call upon her to forego or will a difference of dress of attendance of style as it is called of the power of shifting at pleasure the scenes in which she seeks amusementwill these outweigh in her estimation the prospect of domestic happiness and the interchange of unabating affection i say nothing of her father his good and evil qualities are so strangely mingled that the former are neutralised by the latter and that which she must regret as a daughter is so much blended with what she would gladly escape from that i place the separation of the father and child as a circumstance which weighs little in her remarkable case meantime i keep up my spirits as i may i have incurred too many hardships and difficulties to be presumptuous or confident in success and i have been too often and too wonderfully extricated from them to be despondent  i wish you saw this country i think the scenery would delight you at least it often brings to my recollection your glowing descriptions of your native country to me it has in a great measure the charm of novelty of the scottish hills though born among them as i have always been assured i have but an indistinct recollection indeed my memory rather dwells upon the blank which my youthful mind experienced in gazing on the levels of the isle of zealand than on anything which preceded that feeling but i am confident from that sensation as well as from the recollections which preceded it that hills and rocks have been familiar to me at an early period and that though now only remembered by contrast and by the blank which i felt while gazing around for them in vain they must have made an indelible impression on my infant imagination i remember when we first mounted that celebrated pass in the mysore country while most of the others felt only awe and astonishment at the height and grandeur of the scenery i rather shared your feelings and those of cameron whose admiration of such wild rocks was blended with familiar love derived from early association despite my dutch education a blue hill to me is as a friend and a roaring torrent like the sound of a domestic song that hath soothed my infancy i never felt the impulse so strongly as in this land of lakes and mountains and nothing grieves me so much as that duty prevents your being with me in my numerous excursions among recesses some drawings i have attempted but i succeed vilely dudley on the contrary draws delightfully with that rapid touch which seems like magic while i labour and botch and make this too heavy and that too light and produce at last a base caricature i must stick to the flageolet for music is the only one of the fine arts which deigns to acknowledge me  did you know that colonel mannering was a draughtsman i believe not for he scorned to display his accomplishments to the view of a subaltern he draws beautifully however since he and julia left mervyn hall dudley was sent for there the squire it seems wanted a set of drawings made up of which mannering had done the first four but was interrupted by his hasty departure in his purpose of completing them dudley says he has seldom seen anything so masterly though slight and each had attached to it a short poetical description is saul you will say among the prophets colonel mannering write poetry why surely this man must have taken all the pains to conceal his accomplishments that others do to display theirs how reserved and unsociable he appeared among us how little disposed to enter into any conversation which could become generally interesting and then his attachment to that unworthy archer so much below him in every respect and all this because he was the brother of viscount archerfield a poor scottish peer i think if archer had longer survived the wounds in the affair of cuddyboram he would have told something that might have thrown light upon the inconsistencies of this singular mans character he repeated to me more than once i have that to say which will alter your hard opinion of our late colonel but death pressed him too hard and if he owed me any atonement which some of his expressions seemed to imply he died before it could be made  i propose to make a further excursion through this country while this fine frosty weather serves and dudley almost as good a walker as myself goes with me for some part of the way we part on the borders of cumberland when he must return to his lodgings in marybone up three pair of stairs and labour at what he calls the commercial part of his profession there cannot he says be such a difference betwixt any two portions of existence as between that in which the artist if an enthusiast collects the subjects of his drawings and that which must necessarily be dedicated to turning over his portfolio and exhibiting them to the provoking indifference or more provoking criticism of fashionable amateurs during the summer of my year says dudley i am as free as a wild indian enjoying myself at liberty amid the grandest scenes of nature while during my winters and springs i am not only cabined cribbed and confined in a miserable garret but condemned to as intolerable subservience to the humour of others and to as indifferent company as if i were a literal galley slave i have promised him your acquaintance delaserre you will be delighted with his specimens of art and he with your swiss fanaticism for mountains and torrents  when i lose dudleys company i am informed that i can easily enter scotland by stretching across a wild country in the upper part of cumberland and that route i shall follow to give the colonel time to pitch his camp ere i reconnoitre his position adieu delaserre i shall hardly find another opportunity of writing till i reach scotland       chapter  xxii      jog on jog on the footpath way      and merrily bend the stilea      a merry heart goes all the day      a sad one tires in a milea            winters tale   let the reader conceive to himself a clear frosty november morning the scene an open heath having for the background that huge chain of mountains in which skiddaw and saddleback are preeminent let him look along that blind road by which i mean the track so slightly marked by the passengers footsteps that it can but be traced by a slight shade of verdure from the darker heath around it and being only visible to the eye when at some distance ceases to be distinguished while the foot is actually treading it along this faintlytraced path advances the object of our present narrative his firm step his erect and free carriage have a military air which corresponds well with his wellproportioned limbs and stature of six feet high his dress is so plain and simple that it indicates nothing as to rank it may be that of a gentleman who travels in this manner for his pleasure or of an inferior person of whom it is the proper and usual garb nothing can be on a more reduced scale than his travelling equipment a volume of shakspeare in each pocket a small bundle with a change of linen slung across his shoulders an oaken cudgel in his hand complete our pedestrians accommodations and in this equipage we present him to our readers  brown had parted that morning from his friend dudley and begun his solitary walk towards scotland  the first two or three miles were rather melancholy from want of the society to which he had of late been accustomed but this unusual mood of mind soon gave way to the influence of his natural good spirits excited by the exercise and the bracing effects of the frosty air he whistled as he went along not from want of thought but to give vent to those buoyant feelings which he had no other mode of expressing for each peasant whom he chanced to meet he had a kind greeting or a goodhumoured jest the hardy cumbrians grinned as they passed and said thats a kind heart god bless un and the marketgirl looked more than once over her shoulder at the athletic form which corresponded so well with the frank and blythe address of the stranger a rough terrier dog his constant companion who rivalled his master in glee scampered at large in a thousand wheels round the heath and came back to jump up on him and assure him that he participated in the pleasure of the journey dr johnson thought life had few things better than the excitation produced by being whirled rapidly along in a postchaise but he who has in youth experienced the confident and independent feeling of a stout pedestrian in an interesting country and during fine weather will hold the taste of the great moralist cheap in comparison  part of browns view in choosing that unusual track which leads through the eastern wilds of cumberland into scotland had been a desire to view the remains of the celebrated roman wall which are more visible in that direction than in any other part of its extent his education had been imperfect and desultory but neither the busy scenes in which he had been engaged nor the pleasures of youth nor the precarious state of his own circumstances had diverted him from the task of mental improvement and this then is the roman wall he said scrambling up to a height which commanded the course of that celebrated work of antiquity what a people whose labours even at this extremity of their empire comprehended such space and were executed upon a scale of such grandeur in future ages when the science of war shall have changed how few traces will exist of the labours of vauban and coehorn while this wonderful peoples remains will even then continue to interest and astonish posterity their fortifications their aqueducts their theatres their fountains all their public works bear the grave solid and majestic character of their language while our modern labours like our modern tongues seem but constructed out of their fragments having thus moralised he remembered that he was hungry and pursued his walk to a small publichouse at which he proposed to get some refreshment  the alehouse for it was no better was situated in the bottom of a little dell through which trilled a small rivulet it was shaded by a large ash tree against which the claybuilt shed that served the purpose of a stable was erected and upon which it seemed partly to recline in this shed stood a saddled horse employed in eating his corn the cottages in this part of cumberland partake of the rudeness which characterises those of scotland the outside of the house promised little for the interior notwithstanding the vaunt of a sign where a tankard of ale voluntarily decanted itself into a tumbler and a hieroglyphical scrawl below attempted to express a promise of good entertainment for man and horse brown was no fastidious traveller he stopped and entered the cabaret footnote see note 2  the first object which caught his eye in the kitchen was a tall stout countrylooking man in a large jockey greatcoat the owner of the horse which stood in the shed who was busy discussing huge slices of cold boiled beef and casting from time to time an eye through the window to see how his steed sped with his provender a large tankard of ale flanked his plate of victuals to which he applied himself by intervals the good woman of the house was employed in baking the fire as is usual in that country was on a stone hearth in the midst of an immensely large chimney which had two seats extended beneath the vent on one of these sat a remarkably tall woman in a red cloak and slouched bonnet having the appearance of a tinker or beggar she was busily engaged with a short black tobaccopipe  at the request of brown for some food the landlady wiped with her mealy apron one corner of the deal table placed a wooden trencher and knife and fork before the traveller pointed to the round of beef recommended mr dinmonts good example and finally filled a brown pitcher with her homebrewed brown lost no time in doing ample credit to both for a while his opposite neighbour and he were too busy to take much notice of each other except by a goodhumoured nod as each in turn raised the tankard to his head at length when our pedestrian began to supply the wants of little wasp the scotch storefarmer for such was mr dinmont found himself at leisure to enter into conversation  a bonny terrier that sir and a fell chield at the vermin i warrant him that is if hes been weel entered for it a lies in that  really sir said brown his education has been somewhat neglected and his chief property is being a pleasant companion  ay sir thats a pity begging your

while he drew the girths of his saddle adjusted the walise and put on the bridle still plied him with questions concerning mr bertrams death and the fate of his daughter on which however she could

lost on brown but while he paid his reckoning he could not avoid repeatedly fixing his eyes on meg merrilies she was in all respects the same witchlike figure as when we first introduced her at ellangowan place time had grizzled her raven locks and added wrinkles to her wild features but her height remained erect and her activity was unimpaired it was remarked of this woman as of others of the same description that a life of action though not of labour gave her the perfect command of her limbs and figure so that the attitudes into which she most naturally threw herself were free unconstrained and picturesque at present she stood by the window of the cottage her person drawn up so as to show to full advantage her masculine stature and her head somewhat thrown back that the large bonnet with which her face was shrouded might not interrupt her steady gaze at brown at every gesture he made and every tone he uttered she seemed to give an almost imperceptible start on his part he was surprised to find that he could not look upon this singular figure without some emotion have i dreamed of such a figure he said to himself or does this wild and singularlooking woman recall to my recollection some of the strange figures i have seen in our indian pagodas  while he embarrassed himself with these discussions and the hostess was engaged in rummaging out silver in change of halfaguinea the gipsy suddenly made two strides and seized browns hand he expected of course a display of her skill in palmistry but she seemed agitated by other feelings  tell me she said tell me in the name of god young man what is your name and whence you came  my name is brown mother and i come from the east indies  from the east indies dropping his hand with a sigh it cannot be then i am such an auld fool that everything i look on seems the thing i want maist to see but the east indies that cannot be weel be what ye will ye hae a face and a tongue that puts me in mind of auld times good day make haste on your road and if ye see ony of our folk meddle not and make not and theyll do you nae harm  brown who had by this time received his change put a shilling into her hand bade his hostess farewell and taking the route which the farmer had gone before walked briskly on with the advantage of being guided by the fresh hoofprints of his horse meg merrilies looked after him for some time and then muttered to herself i maun see that lad again and i maun gang back to ellangowan too the lairds dead aweel death pays a scores he was a kind man ance the sheriffs flitted and i can keep canny in the bush so theres no muckle hazard o scouring the crampring i would like to see bonny ellangowan again or i die  brown meanwhile proceeded northward at a round pace along the moorish tract called the waste of cumberland he passed a solitary house towards which the horseman who preceded him had apparently turned up for his horses tread was evident in that direction a little farther he seemed to have returned again into the road mr dinmont had probably made a visit there either of business or pleasure i wish thought brown the good farmer had staid till i came up i should not have been sorry to ask him a few questions about the road which seems to grow wilder and wilder  in truth nature as if she had designed this tract of country to be the barrier between two hostile nations has stamped upon it a character of wildness and desolation the hills are neither high nor rocky but the land is all heath and morass the huts poor and mean and at a great distance from each other immediately around them there is generally some little attempt at cultivation but a halfbred foal or two straggling about with shackles on their hind legs to save the trouble of inclosures intimate the farmers chief resource to be the breeding of horses the people too are of a ruder and more inhospitable class than are elsewhere to be found in cumberland arising partly from their own habits partly from their intermixture with vagrants and criminals who make this wild country a refuge from justice so much were the men of these districts in early times the objects of suspicion and dislike to their more polished neighbours that there was and perhaps still exists a bylaw of the corporation of newcastle prohibiting any freeman of that city to take for apprentice a native of certain of these dales it is pithily said give a dog an ill name and hang him and it may be added if you give a man or race of men an ill name they are very likely to do something that deserves hanging of this brown had heard something and suspected more from the discourse between the landlady dinmont and the gipsy but he was naturally of a fearless disposition had nothing about him that could tempt the spoiler and trusted to get through the waste with daylight in this last particular however he was likely to be disappointed the way proved longer than he had anticipated and the horizon began to grow gloomy just as he entered upon an extensive morass  choosing his steps with care and deliberation the young officer proceeded along a path that sometimes sunk between two broken black banks of moss earth sometimes crossed narrow but deep ravines filled with a consistence between mud and water and sometimes along heaps of gravel and stones which had been swept together when some torrent or waterspout from the neighbouring hills overflowed the marshy ground below he began to ponder how a horseman could make his way through such broken ground the traces of hoofs however were still visible he even thought he heard their sound at some distance and convinced that mr dinmonts progress through the morass must be still slower than his own he resolved to push on in hopes to overtake him and have the benefit of his knowledge of the country at this moment his little terrier sprung forward barking most furiously  brown quickened his pace and attaining the summit of a small rising ground saw the subject of the dogs alarm in a hollow about a gunshot below him a man whom he easily recognised to be dinmont was engaged with two others in a desperate struggle he was dismounted and defending himself as he best could with the butt of his heavy whip our traveller hastened on to his assistance but ere he could get up a stroke had levelled the farmer with the earth and one of the robbers improving his victory struck him some merciless blows on the head the other villain hastening to meet brown called to his companion to come along for that ones content meaning probably past resistance or complaint one ruffian was armed with a cutlass the other with a bludgeon but as the road was pretty narrow bar firearms thought brown and i may manage them well enough they met accordingly with the most murderous threats on the part of the ruffians they soon found however that their new opponent was equally stout and resolute and after exchanging two or three blows one of them told him to follow his nose over the heath in the devils name for they had nothing to say to him  brown rejected this composition as leaving to their mercy the unfortunate man whom they were about to pillage if not to murder outright and the skirmish had just recommenced when dinmont unexpectedly recovered his senses his feet and his weapon and hastened to the scene of action as he had been no easy antagonist even when surprised and alone the villains did not choose to wait his joining forces with a man who had singly proved a match for them both but fled across the bog as fast as their feet could carry them pursued by wasp who had acted gloriously during the skirmish annoying the heels of the enemy and repeatedly effecting a moments diversion in his masters favour  deil but your dogs weel entered wi the vermin now sir were the first words uttered by the jolly farmer as he came up his head streaming with blood and recognised his deliverer and his little attendant  i hope sir you are not hurt dangerously  o deil a bit my head can stand a gay clour nae thanks to them though and mony to you but now hinney ye maun help me to catch the beast and ye maun get on behind me for we maun off like whittrets before the whole clanjamfray be doun upon us the rest o them will no be far off the galloway was by good fortune easily caught and brown made some apology for overloading the animal  deil a fear man answered the proprietor dumple could carry six folk if his back was lang eneugh but gods sake haste ye get on for i see some folk coming through the slack yonder that it may be just as weel no to wait for  brown was of opinion that this apparition of five or six men with whom the other villains seemed to join company coming across the moss towards them should abridge ceremony he therefore mounted dumple en croupe and the little spirited nag cantered away with two men of great size and strength as if they had been children of six years old the rider to whom the paths of these wilds seemed intimately known pushed on at a rapid pace managing with much dexterity to choose the safest route in which he was aided by the sagacity of the galloway who never failed to take the difficult passes exactly at the particular spot and in the special manner by which they could be most safely crossed yet even with these advantages the road was so broken and they were so often thrown out of the direct course by various impediments that they did not gain much on their pursuers never mind said the undaunted scotchman to his companion if we were ance by withershins latch the roads no near sae soft and well show them fair play fort  they soon came to the place he named a narrow channel through which soaked rather than flowed a small stagnant stream mantled over with bright green mosses dinmont directed his steed towards a pass where the water appeared to flow with more freedom over a harder bottom but dumple backed from the proposed crossingplace put his head down as if to reconnoitre the swamp more nearly stretching forward his forefeet and stood as fast as if he had been cut out of stone  had we not better said brown dismount and leave him to his fate or can you not urge him through the swamp  na na said his pilot we maun cross dumple at no rate he has mair sense than mony a christian so saying he relaxed the reins and shook them loosely come now lad take your ain way ot lets see where yell take us through  dumple left to the freedom of his own will trotted briskly to another part of the latch less promising as brown thought in appearance but which the animals sagacity or experience recommended as the safer of the two and where plunging in he attained the other side with little difficulty  im glad were out o that moss said dinmont where theres mair stables for horses than changehouses for men we have the maidenway to help us now at ony rate accordingly they speedily gained a sort of rugged causeway so called being the remains of an old roman road which traverses these wild regions in a due northerly direction here they got on at the rate of nine or ten miles an hour dumple seeking no other respite than what arose from changing his pace from canter to trot i could gar him show mair action said his master but we are twa langlegged chields after a and it would be a pity to stress dumple there wasna the like o him at staneshiebank fair the day  brown readily assented to the propriety of sparing the horse and added that as they were now far out of the reach of the rogues he thought mr dintnont had better tie a handkerchief round his head for fear of the cold frosty air aggravating the wound  what would i do that for answered the hardy farmer the best ways to let the blood barken upon the cut that saves plasters hinney  brown who in his military profession had seen a great many hard blows pass could not help remarking he had never known such severe strokes received with so much apparent indifference  hout tout man i would never be making a humdudgeon about a scart on the pow but well be in scotland in five minutes now and ye maun gang up to charlies hope wi me thats a clear case  brown readily accepted the offered hospitality night was now falling when they came in sight of a pretty river winding its way through a pastoral country the hills were greener and more abrupt than those which brown had lately passed sinking their grassy sides at once upon the river they had no pretensions to magnificence of height or to romantic shapes nor did their smooth swelling slopes exhibit either rocks or woods yet the view was wild solitary and pleasingly rural no inclosures no roads almost no tillage it seemed a land which a patriarch would have chosen to feed his flocks and herds the remains of here and there a dismantled and ruined tower showed that it had once harboured beings of a very different description from its present inhabitants those freebooters namely to whose exploits the wars between england and scotland bear witness  descending by a path towards a wellknown ford dumple crossed the small river and then quickening his pace trotted about a mile briskly up its banks and approached two or three low thatched houses placed with their angles to each other with a great contempt of regularity this was the farmsteading of charlies hope or in the language of the country the town a most furious barking was set up at their approach by the whole three generations of mustard and pepper and a number of allies names unknown the farmer footnote see note 3 made his wellknown voice lustily heard to restore order the door opened and a halfdressed ewemilker who had done that good office shut it in their faces in order that she might run ben the house to cry mistress mistress its the master and another man wi him dumple turned loose walked to his own stabledoor and there pawed and whinnied for admission in strains which were answered by his acquaintances from the interior amid this bustle brown was fain to secure wasp from the other dogs who with ardour corresponding more to their own names than to the hospitable temper of their owner were much disposed to use the intruder roughly  in about a minute a stout labourer was patting dumple and introducing him into the stable while mrs dinmont a wellfavoured buxom dame welcomed her husband with unfeigned rapture eh sirs gudeman ye hae been a weary while away       chapter  xxiv      liddell till now except in doric lays      tuned to her murmurs by her lovesick swains      unknown in song though not a purer stream      rolls towards the western main            art of preserving health   the present storefarmers of the south of scotland are a much more refined race than their fathers and the manners i am now to describe have either altogether disappeared or are greatly modified without losing the rural simplicity of manners they now cultivate arts unknown to the former generation not only in the progressive improvement of their possessions but in all the comforts of life their houses are more commodious their habits of life regulated so as better to keep pace with those of the civilised world and the best of luxuries the luxury of knowledge has gained much ground among their hills during the last thirty years deep drinking formerly their greatest failing is now fast losing ground and while the frankness of their extensive hospitality continues the same it is generally speaking refined in its character and restrained in its excesses  deils in the wife said dandie dinmont shaking off his spouses embrace but gently and with a look of great affection deils in ye ailie dye no see the stranger gentleman  ailie turned to make her apologytroth i was sae weel pleased to see the gudeman thatbut gude gracious whats the matter wi ye baith for they were now in her little parlour and the candle showed the streaks of blood which dinmonts wounded head had plentifully imparted to the clothes of his companion as well as to his own yeve been fighting again dandie wi some o the bewcastle horsecoupers wow man a married man wi a bonny family like yours should ken better what a fathers lifes worth in the warld the tears stood in the good womans eyes as she spoke  whisht whisht gudewife said her husband with a smack that had much more affection than ceremony in it never mind never mind theres a gentleman that will tell you that just when i had gaen up to lourie lowthers and had bidden the drinking of twa cheerers and gotten just in again upon the

troth gudewife if this honest gentleman hadna come up i would have gotten mair licks than i like and lost mair siller than i could weel spare so ye maun be thankful to him for it under god with that he drew from his sidepocket a large greasy leather pocketbook and bade the gudewife lock it up in her kist  god bless the gentleman and een god bless him wi a my heart but what can we do for him but to gie him the meat and quarters we wadna refuse to the poorest body on earthunless her eye directed to the pocketbook but with a feeling of natural propriety which made the inference the most delicate possible unless there was ony other way brown saw and estimated at its due rate the mixture of simplicity and grateful generosity which took the downright way of expressing itself yet qualified with so much delicacy he was aware his own appearance plain at best and now torn and spattered with blood made him an object of pity at least and perhaps of charity he hastened to say his name was brown a captain in theregiment of cavalry travelling for pleasure and on foot both from motives of independence and economy and he begged his kind landlady would look at her husbands wounds the state of which he had refused to permit him to examine mrs dinmont was used to her husbands broken heads more than to the presence of a captain of dragoons she therefore glanced at a tablecloth not quite clean and conned over her proposed supper a minute or two before patting her husband on the shoulder she bade him sit down for a hardheaded loon that was aye bringing himsell and other folk into collieshangies  when dandie dinmont after executing two or three caprioles and cutting the highland fling by way of ridicule of his wifes anxiety at last deigned to sit down and commit his round black shaggy bullet of a head to her inspection brown thought he had seen the regimental surgeon look grave upon a more trifling case the gudewife however showed some knowledge of chirurgery she cut away with her scissors the gory locks whose stiffened and coagulated clusters interfered with her operations and clapped on the wound some lint besmeared with a vulnerary salve esteemed sovereign by the whole dale which afforded upon fair nights considerable experience of such cases she then fixed her plaster with a bandage and spite of her patients resistance pulled over all a nightcap to keep everything in its right place some contusions on the brow and shoulders she fomented with brandy which the patient did not permit till the medicine had paid a heavy toll to his mouth mrs dinmont then simply but kindly offered her assistance to brown  he assured her he had no occasion for anything but the accommodation of a basin and towel  and thats what i should have thought of sooner she said and i did think ot but i durst na open the door for theres a the bairns poor things sae keen to see their father  this explained a great drumming and whining at the door of the little parlour which had somewhat surprised brown though his kind landlady had only noticed it by fastening the bolt as soon as she heard it begin but on her opening the door to seek the basin and towel for she never thought of showing the guest to a separate room a whole tide of whiteheaded urchins streamed in some from the stable where they had been seeing dumple and giving him a welcome home with part of their fourhours scones others from the kitchen where they had been listening to old elspeths tales and ballads and the youngest halfnaked out of bed all roaring to see daddy and to inquire what he had brought home for them from the various fairs he had visited in his peregrinations our knight of the broken head first kissed and hugged them all round then distributed whistles pennytrumpets and gingerbread and lastly when the tumult of their joy and welcome got beyond bearing exclaimed to his guestthis is a the gudewifes fault captain she will gie the bairns a their ain way  me lord help me said ailie who at that instant entered with the basin and ewer how can i help it i have naething else to gie them poor things  dinmont then exerted himself and between coaxing threats and shoving cleared the room of all the intruders excepting a boy and girl the two eldest of the family who could as he observed behave themselves distinctly for the same reason but with less ceremony all the dogs were kicked out excepting the venerable patriarchs old pepper and mustard whom frequent castigation and the advance of years had inspired with such a share of passive hospitality that after mutual explanation and remonstrance in the shape of some growling they admitted wasp who had hitherto judged it safe to keep beneath his masters chair to a share of a driedwedders skin which with the wool uppermost and unshorn served all the purposes of a bristol hearthrug  the active bustle of the mistress so she was called in the kitchen and the gudewife in the parlour had already signed the fate of a couple of fowls which for want of time to dress them otherwise soon appeared reeking from the gridiron or brander as mrs dinmont denominated it a huge piece of cold beefham eggs butter cakes and barleymeal bannocks in plenty made up the entertainment which was to be diluted with homebrewed ale of excellent quality and a casebottle of brandy few soldiers would find fault with such cheer after a days hard exercise and a skirmish to boot accordingly brown did great honour to the eatables while the gudewife partly aided partly instructed a great stout servant girl with cheeks as red as her topknot to remove the supper matters and supply sugar and hot water which in the damsels anxiety to gaze upon an actual live captain she was in some danger of forgetting brown took an opportunity to ask his host whether he did not repent of having neglected the gipsys hint  wha kens answered he theyre queer deevils maybe i might just have scaped ae gang to meet the other and yet i ll no say that neither for if that randy wife was coming to charlies hope she should have a pint bottle o brandy and a pound o tobacco to wear her through the winter theyre queer deevils as my auld father used to say theyre warst where theyre warst guided after a theres baith gude and ill about the gipsies  this and some other desultory conversation served as a shoeinghorn to draw on another cup of ale and another cheerer as dinmont termed it in his country phrase of brandy and water brown then resolutely declined all further conviviality for that evening pleading his own weariness and the effects of the skirmish being well aware that it would have availed nothing to have remonstrated with his host on the danger that excess might have occasioned to his own raw wound and bloody coxcomb a very small bedroom but a very clean bed received the traveller and the sheets made good the courteous vaunt of the hostess that they would be as pleasant as he could find ony gate for they were washed wi the fairywell water and bleached on the bonny white gowans and bittled by nelly and herself and what could woman if she was a queen do mair for them  they indeed rivalled snow in whiteness and had besides a pleasant fragrance from the manner in which they had been bleached little wasp after licking his masters hand to ask leave couched himself on the coverlet at his feet and the travellers senses were soon lost in grateful oblivion       chapter  xxv      give ye britons then      your sportive fury pitiless to pour      loose on the nightly robber of the fold      him from his craggy winding haunts unearthd      let all the thunder of the chase pursue             thomsons seasons   brown rose early in the morning and walked out to look at the establishment of his new friend all was rough and neglected in the neighbourhood of the housea paltry garden no pains taken to make the vicinity dry or comfortable and a total absence of all those little neatnesses which give the eye so much pleasure in looking at an english farmhouse there were notwithstanding evident signs that this arose only from want of taste or ignorance not from poverty or the negligence which attends it on the contrary a noble cowhouse well filled with good milkcows a feedinghouse with ten bullocks of the most approved breed a stable with two good teams of horses the appearance of domestics active industrious and apparently contented with their lot in a word an air of liberal though sluttish plenty indicated the wealthy fanner the situation of the house above the river formed a gentle declivity which relieved the inhabitants of the nuisances that might otherwise have stagnated around it at a little distance was the whole band of children playing and building houses with peats around a huge doddered oaktree which was called charlies bush from some tradition respecting an old freebooter who had once inhabited the spot between the farmhouse and the hillpasture was a deep morass termed in that country a slack it had once been the defence of a fortalice of which no vestiges now remained but which was said to have been inhabited by the same doughty hero we have now alluded to brown endeavoured to make some acquaintance with the children but the rogues fled from him like quicksilver though the two eldest stood peeping when they had got to some distance the traveller then turned his course towards the hill crossing the foresaid swamp by a range of steppingstones neither the broadest nor steadiest that could be imagined he had not climbed far up the hill when he met a man descending  he soon recognised his worthy host though a maud as it is called or a grey shepherds plaid supplied his travelling jockeycoat and a cap faced with wildcats fur more comrhodiously covered his bandaged head than a hat would have done as he appeared through the morning mist brown accustomed to judge of men by their thewes and sinews could not help admiring his height the breadth of his shoulders and the steady firmness of his step dinmont internally paid the same compliment to brown whose athletic form he now perused somewhat more at leisure than he had done formerly after the usual greetings of the morning the guest inquired whether his host found any inconvenient consequences from the last nights affray  i had maist forgottent said the hardy borderer but i think this morning now that i am fresh and sober if you and i were at the withershins latch wi ilka ane a gude oak souple in his hand we wadna turn back no for half a dizzen o yon scaffraff  but are you prudent my good sir said brown not to take an hour or twos repose after receiving such severe contusions  confusions replied the farmer laughing in derision lord captain naething confuses my head i ance jumped up and laid the dogs on the fox after i had tumbled from the tap o christenbury craig and that might have confused me to purpose na naething confuses me unless it be a screed o drink at an orra time besides i behooved to be round the hirsel this morning and see how the herds were coming on theyre apt to be negligent wi their footballs and fairs and trysts when anes away and there i met wi tarn o todshaw and a wheen o the rest o the billies on the water side theyre a for a foxhunt this morningyell gang i ll gie ye dumple and take the brood mare mysell  but i fear i must leave you this morning mr dinmont replied brown  the fient a bit o that exclaimed the borderer ill no part wi ye at ony rate for a fortnight mair na na we dinna meet sic friends as you on a bewcastle moss every night  brown had not designed his journey should be a speedy one he therefore readily compounded with this hearty invitation by agreeing to pass a week at charlies hope  on their return to the house where the goodwife presided over an ample breakfast she heard news of the proposed foxhunt not indeed with approbation but without alarm or surprise dand yere the auld man yet naething will make ye take warning till yere brought hame some day wi your feet foremost  tut lass answered dandle ye ken yoursell i am never a prin the waur o my rambles  so saying he exhorted brown to be hasty in despatching his breakfast as the frost having given way the scent would lie this morning primely  out they sallied accordingly for otterscope scaurs the farmer leading the way they soon quitted the little valley and involved themselves among hills as steep as they could be without being precipitous the sides often presented gullies down which in the winter season or after heavy rain the torrents descended with great fury some dappled mists still floated along the peaks of the hills the remains of the morning clouds for the frost had broken up with a smart shower through these fleecy screens were seen a hundred little temporary streamlets or rills descending the sides of the mountains like silver threads by small sheeptracks along these steeps over which dinmont trotted with the most fearless confidence they at length drew near the scene of sport and began to see other men both on horse and foot making toward the place of rendezvous brown was puzzling himself to conceive how a foxchase could take place among hills where it was barely possible for a pony accustomed to the ground to trot along but where quitting the track for half a yards breadth the rider might be either bogged or precipitated down the bank this wonder was not diminished when he came to the place of action  they had gradually ascended very high and now found themselves on a mountainridge overhanging a glen of great depth but extremely narrow here the sportsmen had collected with an apparatus which would have shocked a member of the pychely hunt for the object being the removal of a noxious and destructive animal as well as the pleasures of the chase poor reynard was allowed much less fair play than when pursued in form through an open country the strength of his habitation however and the nature of the ground by which it was surrounded on all sides supplied what was wanting in the courtesy of his pursuers the sides of the glen were broken banks of earth and rocks of rotten stone which sunk sheer down to the little winding stream below affording here and there a tuft of scathed brushwood or a patch of furze along the edges of this ravine which as we have said was very narrow but of profound depth the hunters on horse and foot ranged themselves almost every farmer had with him at least a brace of large and fierce greyhounds of the race of those deerdogs which were formerly used in that country but greatly lessened in size from being crossed with the common breed the huntsman a sort of provincial officer of the district who receives a certain supply of meal and a reward for every fox he destroys was already at the bottom of the dell whose echoes thundered to the chiding of two or three brace of foxhounds terriers including the whole generation of pepper and mustard were also in attendance having been sent forward under the care of a shepherd mongrel whelp and cur of low degree filled up the burden of the chorus the spectators on the brink of the ravine or glen held their greyhounds in leash in readiness to slip them at the fox as soon as the activity of the party below should force him to abandon his cover  the scene though uncouth to the eye of a professed sportsman had something in it wildly captivating the shifting figures on the mountainridge having the sky for their background appeared to move in the air the dogs impatient of their restraint and maddened with the baying beneath sprung here and there and strained at the slips which prevented them from joining their companions looking down the view was equally striking the thin mists were not totally dispersed in the glen so that it was often through their gauzy medium that the eye strove to discover the motions of the hunters below sometimes a breath of wind made the scene visible the blue rill glittering as it twined itself through its rude and solitary dell they then could see the shepherds springing with fearless activity from one dangerous point to another and cheering the dogs on the scent the whole so diminished by depth and distance that they looked like pigmies again the mists close over them and the only signs of their continued exertions are the halloos of the men and the clamours of the hounds ascending as it were out of the bowels of the earth when the fox thus persecuted from one stronghold to another was at length oblged to abandon his valley and to break away for a more distant retreat those who watched his motions from the top slipped their greyhounds which excelling the fox in swiftness and equalling him in ferocity and spirit soon brought the plunderer to his lifes end  in this way without any attention to the ordinary rules and decorums of sport but apparently as much to the gratification both of bipeds and quadrupeds as if all due ritual had been followed four foxes were killed on this active morning and even brown himself though he had seen the princely sports of india and ridden atigerhunting upon an elephant with the nabob of arcot professed to have received an excellent mornings amusement when the sport was given up for the day most of the sportsmen according to the established hospitality of the country went to dine at charlies hope  during their return homeward brown rode for a short time beside the huntsman and asked him some questions concerning the mode in which he exercised his profession the man showed an unwillingness to meet his eye and a disposition to be rid of his company and conversation for which brown could not easily account he was a thin dark active fellow well framed for the hardy profession which he exercised but his face had not the frankness of the jolly hunter he was downlooked embarrassed and avoided the eyes of those who looked hard at him after some unimportant observations on the success of the day brown gave him a trifling gratuity and rode on with his landlord they found the goodwife prepared for their reception the fold and the poultryyard furnished the entertainment and the kind and hearty welcome made amends for all deficiencies in elegance and fashion       chapter  xxvi      the elliots and armstrongs did convene      they were a gallant company            ballad of johnnie armstrong   without noticing the occupations of an intervening day or two which as they consisted of the ordinary silvan amusements of shooting and coursing have nothing sufficiently interesting to detain the reader we pass to one in some degree peculiar to scotland which may be called a sort of salmonhunting this chase in which the fish is pursued and struck with barbed spears or a sort of longshafted trident called a waster is much practised at the mouth of the esk and in the other salmon rivers of scotland the sport is followed by day and night but most commonly in the latter when the fish are discovered by means of torches or firegrates filled with blazing fragments of tarbarrels which shed a strong though partial light upon the water on the present occasion the principal party were embarked in a crazy boat upon a part of the river which was enlarged and deepened by the restraint of a millwear while others like the ancient bacchanals in their gambols ran along the banks brandishing their torches and spears and pursuing the salmon some of which endeavoured to escape up the stream while others shrouding themselves under roots of trees fragments of stones and large rocks attempted to conceal themselves from the researches of the fishermen these the party in the boat detected by the slightest indications the twinkling of a fin the rising of an airbell was sufficient to point out to these adroit sportsmen in what direction to use their weapon  the scene was inexpressibly animating to those accustomed to it but as brown was not practised to use the spear he soon tired of making efforts which were attended with no other consequences than jarring his arms against the rocks at the bottom of the river upon which instead of the devoted salmon he often bestowed his blow nor did he relish though he concealed feelings which would not have been understood being quite so near the agonies of the expiring salmon as they lay flapping about in the boat which they moistened with their blood he therefore requested to be put ashore and from the top of a heugh or broken bank enjoyed the scene much more to his satisfaction often he thought of his friend dudley the artist when he observed the effect produced by the strong red glare on the romantic banks under which the boat glided now the light diminished to a distant star that seemed to twinkle on the waters like those which according to the legends of the country the waterkelpy sends for the purpose of indicating the watery grave of his victims then it advanced nearer brightening and enlarging as it again approached till the broad flickering flame rendered bank and rock and tree visible as it passed tingeing them with its own red glare of dusky light and resigning them gradually to darkness or to pale moonlight as it receded by this light also were seen the figures in the boat now holding high their weapons now stooping to strike now standing upright bronzed by the same red glare into a colour which might have befitted the regions of pandemonium  having amused himself for some time with these effects of light and shadow brown strolled homewards towards the farmhouse gazing in his way at the persons engaged in the sport two or three of whom are generally kept together one holding the torch the others with their spears ready to avail themselves of the light it affords to strike their prey as he observed one man struggling with a very weighty salmon which he had speared but was unable completely to raise from the water brown advanced close to the bank to see the issue of his exertions the man who held the torch in this instance was the huntsman whose sulky demeanour brown had already noticed with surprise come here sir come here sir look at this ane he turns up a side like a sow such was the cry from the assistants when some of them observed brown advancing  ground the waster weel man ground the waster weel haud him down ye haena the pith o a cat were the cries of advice encouragement and expostulation from those who were on the bank to the sportsman engaged with the salmon who stood up to his middle in water jingling among broken ice struggling against the force of the fish and the strength of the current and dubious in what manner he should attempt to secure his booty as brown came to the edge of the bank he called outhold up your torch friend huntsman for he had already distinguished his dusky features by the strong light cast upon them by the blaze but the fellow no sooner heard his voice and saw or rather concluded it was brown who approached him than instead of advancing his light he let it drop as if accidentally into the water  the deils in gabriel said the spearman as the fragments of glowing wood floated halfblazing halfsparkling but soon extinguished down the stream the deils in the man ill never master him without the light and a braver kipper could i but land him never reisted abune a pair o cleeksfootnote see note 4 some dashed into the water to lend their assistance and the fish which was afterwards found to weigh nearly thirty pounds was landed in safety  the behaviour of the huntsman struck brown although he had no recollection of his face nor could conceive why he should as it appeared he evidently did shun his observation could he be one of the footpads he had encountered a few days before the supposition was not altogether improbable although unwarranted by any observation he was able to make upon the mans figure and face to be sure the villains wore their hats much slouched and had loose coats and their size was not in any way so peculiarly discriminated as to enable him to resort to that criterion he resolved to speak to his host dinmont on the subject but for obvious reasons concluded it were best to defer the explanation until a cool hour in the morning  the sportsmen returned loaded with fish upwards of one hundred salmon having been killed within the range of their sport the best were selected for the use of the principal farmers the others divided among their shepherds cottars dependents and others of inferior rank who attended these fish dried in the turf smoke of their cabins or shealings formed a savoury addition to the mess of potatoes mixed with onions which was the principal part of their winter food in the meanwhile a liberal distribution of ale and whisky was made among them besides what was called a kettle of fishtwo or three salmon namely plunged into a cauldron and boiled for their supper brown accompanied his jolly landlord and the rest of his friends into the large and smoky kitchen where this savoury mess reeked on an oaken table massive enough to have dined johnnie armstrong and his merrymen all was hearty cheer and huzza and jest and clamorous laughter and bragging alternately and raillery between whiles our traveller looked earnestly around for the dark countenance of the foxhunter but it was nowhere to be seen  at length he hazarded a question concerning him that was an awkward accident my lads of one of you who dropped his torch in the water when his companion was struggling with the large fish  awkward returned a shepherd looking up the same stout young fellow who had speared the salmon he deserved his paiks fort to put out the light when the fish was on anes witters im weel convinced gabriel drapped the roughies in the water on purpose he doesna like to see ony body do a thing better than himsell  ay said another hes sair shamed o himsell else he would have been up here the night gabriel likes a little o the gude thing as weel as ony o us  is he of this country said brown  na na hes been but shortly in office but hes a fell hunter hes frae down the country some gate on the

and i dinna think ony body kens him by ony other name but its no right to rin him doun ahint his back for hes a fell foxhunter though hes maybe no just sae clever as some o the folk hereawa wi the waster  after some further desultory conversation the superior sportsmen retired to conclude the evening after their own manner leaving the others to enjoy themselves unawed by their presence that evening like all those which brown had passed at charlies hope was spent in much innocent mirth and conviviality the latter might have approached to the verge of riot but for the good women for several of the neighbouring mistresses a phrase of a signification how different from what it bears in more fashionable life had assembled at charlies hope to witness the event of this memorable evening finding the punchbowl was so often replenished that there was some danger of their gracious presence being forgotten they rushed in valorously upon the recreant revellers headed by our good mistress ailie so that venus speedily routed bacchus the fiddler and piper next made their appearance and the best part of the night was gallantly consumed in dancing to their music  an otterhunt the next day and a badgerbaiting the day after consumed the time merrily i hope our traveller will not sink in the readers estimation sportsman though he may be when i inform him that on this last occasion after young pepper had lost a forefoot and mustard the second had been nearly throttled he begged as a particular and personal favour of mr dinmont that the poor badger who had made so gallant a defence should be permitted to retire to his earth without farther molestation  the farmer who would probably have treated this request with supreme contempt had it come from any other person was contented in browns case to express the utter extremity of his wonder weel he said thats queer aneugh but since ye take his part deil a tyke shall meddle wi him mair in my day we ll een mark him and ca him the captains brock and im sure im glad i can do ony thing to oblige youbut lord save us to care about a brock  after a week spent in rural sport and distinguished by the most frank attentions on the part of his honest landlord brown bade adieu to the banks of the liddel and the hospitality of charlies hope the children with all of whom he had now become an intimate and a favourite roared manfully in full chorus at his departure and he was obliged to promise twenty times that he would soon return and play over all their favourite tunes upon the flageolet till they had got them by heart come back again captain said one little sturdy fellow and jenny will be your wife jenny was about eleven years old she ran and hid herself behind her mammy  captain come back said a little fat rollabout girl of six holding her mouth up to be kissed and ill be your wife my ainsell  they must be of harder mould than i thought brown who could part from so many kind hearts with indifference the good dame too with matron modesty and an affectionate simplicity that marked the olden time offered her cheek to the departing guest its little the like of us can do she said little indeed but yet if there were but ony thing  now my dear mrs dinmont you embolden me to make a request would you but have the kindness to weave me or work me just such a grey plaid as the goodman wears he had learned the language and feelings of the country even during the short time of his residence and was aware of the pleasure the request would confer  a tait o woo would be scarce amang us said the goodwife brightening if ye shouldna hae that and as gude a tweel as ever cam aff a pirn ill speak to johnnie goodsire the weaver at the castletown the morn fare ye weel sir and may ye be just as happy yoursell as ye like to see a body else and that would be a sair wish to some folk  i must not omit to mention that our traveller left his trusty attendant wasp to be a guest at charlies hope for a season he foresaw that he might prove a troublesome attendant in the event of his being in any situation where secrecy and concealment might be necessary he was therefore consigned to the care of the eldest boy who promised in the words of the old song that he should have      a bit of his supper a bit of his bed and that he should be engaged in none of those perilous pastimes in which the race of mustard and pepper had suffered frequent mutilation brown now prepared for his journey having taken a temporary farewell of his trusty little companion  there is an odd prejudice in these hills in favour of riding every farmer rides well and rides the whole day probably the extent of their large pasture farms and the necessity of surveying them rapidly first introduced this custom or a very zealous antiquary might derive it from the times of the lay of the last minstrel when twenty thousand horsemen assembled at the light of the beaconfires footnote it would be affectation to alter this reference but the reader will understand that it was inserted to keep up the authors incognito as he was not likely to be suspected of quoting his own works this explanation is also applicable to one or two similar passages in this and the other novels introduced for the same reason but the truth is undeniable they like to be on horseback and can be with difficulty convinced that any one chooses walking from other motives than those of convenience or necessity accordingly dinmont insisted upon mounting his guest and accompanying him on horseback as far as the nearest town in dumfriesshire where he had directed his baggage to be sent and from which he proposed to pursue his intended journey towards woodbourne the residence of julia mannering  upon the way he questioned his companion concerning the character of the foxhunter but gained little information as he had been called to that office while dinmont was making the round of the highland fairs he was a shakerag like fellow he said and he dared to say had gipsy blood in his veins but at ony rate he was nane o the smaiks that had been on their quarters in the moss he would ken them weel if he saw them again there are some no bad folk amang the gipsies too to be sic a gang added dandie if ever i see that auld randletree of a wife again i ll gie her something to buy tobacco i have a great notion she meant me very fair after a  when they were about finally to part the good farmer held brown long by the hand and at length said captain the woos sae weel up the year that its paid a the rent and we have naething to do wi the rest o the siller when ailie has had her new gown and the bairns their bits o duds now i was thinking of some safe hand to put it into for its ower muckle to ware on brandy and sugar now i have heard that you army gentlemen can sometimes buy yoursells up a step and if a hundred or twa would help ye on such an occasion the bit scrape o your pen would be as good to me as the siller and ye might just take yer ain time o settling it it wad be a great convenience to me brown who felt the full delicacy that wished to disguise the conferring an obligation under the show of asking a favour thanked his grateful friend most heartily and assured him he would have recourse to his purse without scruple should circumstances ever render it convenient for him and thus they parted with many expressions of mutual regard       chapter  xxvii      if thou hast any love of mercy in thee      turn me upon my face that i may die             joanna ballie   our traveller hired a postchaise at the place where he separated from dinmont with the purpose of proceeding to kippletringan there to inquire into the state of the family at woodbourne before he should venture to make his presence in the country known to miss mannering the stage was a long one of eighteen or twenty miles and the road lay across the country to add to the inconveniences of the journey the snow began to fall pretty quickly the postilion however proceeded on his journey for a good many miles without expressing doubt or hesitation it was not until the night was completely set in that he intimated his apprehensions whether he was in the right road the increasing snow rendered this intimation rather alarming for as it drove full in the lads face and lay whitening all around him it served in two different ways to confuse his knowledge of the country and to diminish the chance of his recovering the right track brown then himself got out and looked round not it may be well imagined from any better hope than that of seeing some house at which he might make inquiry but none appeared he could therefore only tell the lad to drive steadily on the road on which they were ran through plantations of considerable extent and depth and the traveller therefore conjectured that there must be a gentlemans house at no great distance at length after struggling wearily on for about a mile the postboy stopped and protested his horses would not budge a foot farther but he saw he said a light among the trees which must proceed from a house the only way was to inquire the road there accordingly he dismounted heavily encumbered with a long greatcoat and a pair of boots which might have rivalled in thickness the sevenfold shield of ajax as in this guise he was plodding forth upon his voyage of discovery browns impatience prevailed and jumping out of the carriage he desired the lad to stop where he was by the horses and he would himself go to the house a command which the driver most joyfully obeyed  our traveller groped along the side of the inclosure from which the light glimmered in order to find some mode of approaching in that direction and after proceeding for some space at length found a stile in the hedge and a pathway leading into the plantation which in that place was of great extent this promised to lead to the light which was the object of his search and accordingly brown proceeded in that direction but soon totally lost sight of it among the trees the path which at first seemed broad and well marked by the opening of the wood through which it winded was now less easily distinguishable although the whiteness of the snow afforded some reflected light to assist his search directing himself as much as possible through the more open parts of the wood he proceeded almost a mile without either recovering a view of the light or seeing anything resembling a habitation still however he thought it best to persevere in that direction it must surely have been a light in the hut of a forester for it shone too steadily to be the glimmer of an ignis fatuus the ground at length became broken and declined rapidly and although brown conceived he still moved along what had once at least been a pathway it was now very unequal and the snow concealing those breaches and inequalities the traveller had one or two falls in consequence he began now to think of turning back especially as the falling snow which his impatience had hitherto prevented his attending to was coming on thicker and faster  willing however to make a last effort he still advanced a little way when to his great delight he beheld the light opposite at no great distance and apparently upon a level with him he quickly found that this last appearance was deception for the ground continued so rapidly to sink as made it obvious there was a deep dell or ravine of some kind between him and the object of his search taking every precaution to preserve his footing he continued to descend until he reached the bottom of a very steep and narrow glen through which winded a small rivulet whose course was then almost choked with snow he now found himself embarrassed among the ruins of cottages whose black gables rendered more distinguishable by the contrast with the whitened surface from which they rose were still standing the sidewalls had long since given way to time and piled in shapeless heaps and covered with snow offered frequent and embarrassing obstacles to our travellers progress still however he persevered crossed the rivulet not without some trouble and at length by exertions which became both painful and perilous ascended its opposite and very rugged bank until he came on a level with the building from which the gleam proceeded  it was difficult especially by so imperfect a light to discover the nature of this edifice but it seemed a square building of small size the upper part of which was totally ruinous it had perhaps been the abode in former times of some lesser proprietor or a place of strength and concealment in case of need for one of greater importance but only the lower vault remained the arch of which formed the roof in the present state of the building brown first approached the place from whence the light proceeded which was a long narrow slit or loophole such as usually are to be found in old castles impelled by curiosity to reconnoitre the interior of this strange place before he entered brown gazed in at this aperture a scene of greater desolation could not well be imagined there was a fire upon the floor the smoke of which after circling through the apartment escaped by a hole broken in the arch above the walls seen by this smoky light had the rude and waste appearance of a ruin of three centuries old at least a cask or two with some broken boxes and packages lay about the place in confusion but the inmates chiefly occupied browns attention upon a lair composed of straw with a blanket stretched over it lay a figure so still that except that it was not dressed in the ordinary habiliments of the grave brown would have concluded it to be a corpse on a steadier view he perceived it was only on the point of becoming so for he heard one or two of those low deep and harddrawn sighs that precede dissolution when the frame is tenacious of life a female figure dressed in a long cloak sate on a stone by this miserable couch her elbows rested upon her knees and her face averted from the light of an iron lamp beside her was bent upon that of the dying person she moistened his mouth from time to time with some liquid and between whiles sung in a low monotonous cadence one of those prayers or rather spells which in some parts of scotland and the north of england are used by the vulgar and ignorant to speed the passage of a parting spirit like the tolling of the bell in catholic days she accompanied this dismal sound with a slow rocking motion of her body to and fro as if to keep time with her song the words ran nearly thus       wasted weary wherefore stay       wrestling thus with earth and clay       from the body pass away            hark the mass is singing       from thee doff thy mortal weed       mary mother be thy speed       saints to help thee at thy need            hark the knell is ringing       fear not snowdrift driving fast       sleet or hail or levin blast       soon the shroud shall lap thee fast       and the sleep be on thee cast            that shall neer know waking       haste thee haste thee to be gone       earth flits fast and time draws on       gasp thy gasp and groan thy groan            day is near the breaking  the songstress paused and was answered by one or two deep and hollow groans that seemed to proceed from the very agony of the mortal strife it will not be she muttered to herself he cannot pass away with that on his mind it tethers him here       heaven cannot abide it       earth refuses to hide it  footnote see note 6  i must open the door and rising she faced towards the door of the apartment observing heedfully not to turn back her head and withdrawing a bolt or two for notwithstanding the miserable appearance of the place the door was cautiously secured she lifted the latch saying  open lock end strife come death and pass life  brown who had by this time moved from his post stood before her as she opened the door she stepped back a pace and he entered instantly recognising but with no comfortable sensation the same gipsy woman whom he had met in bewcastle she also knew him at once and her attitude figure and the anxiety of her countenance assumed the appearance of the welldisposed ogress of a fairy tale warning a stranger not to enter the dangerous castle of her husband the first words she spoke holding up her hands in a reproving manner were said i not to ye make not meddle not beware of the redding straik footnote the redding straik namely a blow received by a peacemaker who interferes betwixt two combatants to red or separate them is proverbially said to be the most dangerous blow a man can receive you are come to no house o fairstrae death so saying she raised the lamp and turned its light on the dying man whose rude and harsh features were now convulsed with the last agony a roll of linen about his head was stained with blood which had soaked also through the blankets and the straw it was indeed under no natural disease that the wretch was suffering brown started back from this horrible object and turning to the gipsy exclaimed wretched woman who has done this  they that were permitted answered meg merrilies while she scanned with a close and keen glance the features of the expiring man he has had a sair struggle but its passing i kennd he would pass when you came in that was the deathruckle hes dead  sounds were now heard at a distance as of voices they are coming said she to brown you are a dead man if ye had as mony lives as hairs brown eagerly looked round for some weapon of defence there was none near he then rushed to the door with the intention of plunging among the trees and making his escape by flight from what he now esteemed a den of murderers but merrilies held him with a masculine grasp here she said here be still and you are safe stir not whatever you see or hear and nothing shall befall you  brown in these desperate circumstances remembered this womans intimation formerly and thought he had no chance of safety but in obeying her she caused him to couch down among a parcel of straw on the opposite side of the apartment from the corpse covered him carefully and flung over him two or three old sacks which lay about the place anxious to observe what was to happen brown arranged as softly as he could the means of peeping from under the coverings by which he was hidden and awaited with a throbbing heart the issue of this strange and most unpleasant adventure the old gipsy in the meantime set about arranging the dead body composing its limbs and straighting the arms by its side best to do this she muttered ere he stiffen she placed on the dead mans breast a trencher with salt sprinkled upon it set one candle at the head and another at the feet of the body and lighted both then she resumed her song and awaited the approach of those whose voices had been heard without  brown was a soldier and a brave one but he was also a man and at this moment his fears mastered his courage so completely that the cold drops burst out from every pore the idea of being dragged out of his miserable concealment by wretches whose trade was that of midnight murder without weapons or the slightest means of defence except entreaties which would be only their sport and cries for help which could never reach other ear than their own his safety entrusted to the precarious compassion of a being associated with these felons and whose trade of rapine and imposture must have hardened her against every human feelingthe bitterness of his emotions almost choked him he endeavoured to read in her withered and dark countenance as the lamp threw its light upon her features something that promised those feelings of compassion which females even in their most degraded state can seldom altogether smother there was no such touch of humanity about this woman the interest whatever it was that determined her in his favour arose not from the impulse of compassion but from some internal and probably capricious association of feelings to which he had no clue it rested perhaps on a fancied likeness such as lady macbeth found to her father in the sleeping monarch such were the reflections that passed in rapid succession through browns mind as he gazed from his hidingplace upon this extraordinary personage meantime the gang did not yet approach and he was almost prompted to resume his original intention of attempting an escape from the hut and cursed internally his own irresolution which had consented to his being cooped up where he had neither room for resistance nor flight  meg merrilies seemed equally on the watch she bent her ear to every sound that whistled round the old walls then she turned again to the dead body and found something new to arrange or alter in its position hes a bonny corpse she muttered to herself and weel worth the streaking and in this dismal occupation she appeared to feel a sort of professional pleasure entering slowly into all the minutiae as if with the skill and feelings of a connoisseur a long darkcoloured seacloak which she dragged out of a corner was disposed for a pall the face she left bare after closing the mouth and eyes and arranged the capes of the cloak so as to hide the bloody bandages and give the body as she muttered a mair decent appearance  at once three or four men equally ruffians in appearance and dress rushed into the hut meg ye limb of satan how dare you leave the door open was the first salutation of the party  and wha ever heard of a door being barred when a man was in the deadthraw how dye think the spirit was to get awa through bolts and bars like thae  is he dead then said one who went to the side of the couch to look at the body  ay ay dead enough said another but heres what shall give him a rousing lykewake so saying he fetched a keg of spirits from a corner while meg hastened to display pipes and tobacco from the activity with which she undertook the task brown conceived good hope of her fidelity towards her guest it was obvious that she wished to engage the ruffians in their debauch to prevent the discovery which might take place if by accident any of them should approach too nearly the place of browns concealment       chapter  xxviii      nor board nor garner own we now       nor roof nor

it as ye may            joanna baillie   brown could now reckon his foes they were five in number two of them were very powerful men who appeared to be either real seamen or strollers who assumed that character the other three an old man and two lads were slighter made and from their black hair and dark complexion seemed to belong to megs tribe they passed from one to another the cup out of which they drank their spirits heres to his good voyage said one of the seamen drinking a squally night hes got however to drift through the sky in  we omit here various execrations with which these honest gentlemen garnished their discourse retaining only such of their expletives as are least offensive  a does not mind wind and weather a has had many a northeaster in his day  he had his last yesterday

where you were and spaed fortunes to the cumberland flats bing out and tour ye auld devil and see that nobody has scented thats a youre good for now  is that a i am good for now said the indignant matron i was good for mair than that in the great fight between our folk and patrico salmons if i had not helped you with these very fambles holding up her hands jean baillie would have frummagemd you ye feckless dolittle  there was here another laugh at the expense of the hero who had received this amazons assistance  here mother said one of the sailors heres a cup of the right for you and never mind that bullyhuff  meg drank the spirits and withdrawing herself from farther conversation sat down before the spot where brown lay hid in such a posture that it would have been difficult for any one to have approached it without her rising the men however showed no disposition to disturb her  they closed around the fire and held deep consultation together but the low tone in which they spoke and the cant language which they used prevented brown from understanding much of their conversation he gathered in general that they expressed great indignation against some individual he shall have his gruel said one and then whispered something very low into the ear of his comrade  ill have nothing to do with that said the other  are you turned henhearted jack  no by gd no more than yourself but i wont it was something like that stopped all the trade fifteen or twenty years ago you have heard of the loup  i have heard him indicating the corpse by a jerk of his head tell about that job gd how he used to laugh when he showed us how he fetched him off the perch  well but it did up the trade for one while said jack  how should that be asked the surly villain  why replied jack the people got rusty about it and would not deal and they had bought so many brooms that  well for all that said the other i think we should be down upon the fellow one of these darkmans and let him get it well  but old megs asleep now said another she grows a driveller and is afraid of her shadow shell sing out some of these oddcomeshortlies if you dont look sharp  never fear said the old gipsy man megs truebred shes the last in the gang that will start but she has some queer ways and often cuts queer words  with more of this gibberish they continued the conversation rendering it thus even to each other a dark obscure dialect eked out by significant nods and signs but never expressing distinctly or in plain language the subject on which it turned at length one of them observing meg was still fast asleep or appeared to be so desired one of the lads to hand in the black peter that they might flick it open the boy stepped to the door and brought in a portmanteau which brown instantly recognised for his own his thoughts immediately turned to the unfortunate lad he had left with the carriage had the ruffians murdered him was the horrible doubt that crossed his mind the agony of his attention grew yet keener and while the villains pulled out and admired the different articles of his clothes and linen he eagerly listened for some indication that might intimate the fate of the postilion but the ruffians were too much delighted with their prize and too much busied in examining its contents to enter into any detail concerning the manner in which they had acquired it the portmanteau contained various articles of apparel a pair of pistols a leathern case with a few papers and some money etc etc at any other time it would have provoked brown excessively to see the unceremonious manner in which the thieves shared his property and made themselves merry at the expense of the owner but the moment was too perilous to admit any thoughts but what had immediate reference to selfpreservation  after a sufficient scrutiny into the portmanteau and an equitable division of its contents the ruffians applied themselves more closely to the serious occupation of drinking in which they spent the greater part of the night brown was for some time in great hopes that they would drink so deep as to render themselves insensible when his escape would have been an easy matter but their dangerous trade required precautions inconsistent with such unlimited indulgence and they stopped short on this side of absolute intoxication three of them at length composed themselves to rest while the fourth watched he was relieved in this duty by one of the others after a vigil of two hours when the second watch had elapsed the sentinel awakened the whole who to browns inexpressible relief began to make some preparations as if for departure bundling up the various articles which each had appropriated still however there remained something to be done two of them after some rummaging which not a little alarmed brown produced a mattock and shovel another took a pickaxe from behind the straw on which the dead body was extended with these implements two of them left the hut and the remaining three two of whom were the seamen very strong men still remained in garrison  after the space of about half an hour one of those who had departed again returned and whispered the others they wrapped up the dead body in the sea cloak which had served as a pall and went out bearing it along with them the aged sibyl then arose from her real or feigned slumbers she first went to the door as if for the purpose of watching the departure of her late inmates then returned and commanded brown in a low and stifled voice to follow her instantly he obeyed but on leaving the hut he would willingly have repossessed himself of his money or papers at least but this she prohibited in the most peremptory manner it immediately occurred to him that the suspicion of having removed anything of which he might repossess himself would fall upon this woman by whom in all probability his life had been saved he therefore immediately desisted from his attempt contenting himself with seizing a cutlass which one of the ruffians had flung aside among the straw on his feet and possessed of this weapon he already found himself half delivered from the dangers which beset him still however he felt stiffened and cramped both with the cold and by the constrained and unaltered position which he had occupied all night but as he followed the gipsy from the door of the hut the fresh air of the morning and the action of walking restored circulation and activity to his benumbed limbs  the pale light of a winters morning was rendered more clear by the snow which was lying all around crisped by the influence of a severe frost brown cast a hasty glance at the landscape around him that he might be able again to know the spot the little tower of which only a single vault remained forming the dismal apartment in which he had spent this remarkable night was perched on the very point of a projecting rock overhanging the rivulet it was accessible only on one side and that from the ravine or glen below on the other three sides the bank was precipitous so that brown had on the preceding evening escaped more dangers than one for if he had attempted to go round the building which was once his purpose he must have been dashed to pieces the dell was so narrow that the trees met in some places from the opposite sides they were now loaded with snow instead of leaves and thus formed a sort of frozen canopy over the rivulet beneath which was marked by its darker colour as it soaked its way obscurely through wreaths of snow in one place where the glen was a little wider leaving a small piece of flat ground between the rivulet and the bank were situated the ruins of the hamlet in which brown had been involved on the preceding evening the ruined gables the insides of which were japanned with turfsmoke looked yet blacker contrasted with the patches of snow which had been driven against them by the wind and with the drifts which lay around them  upon this wintry and dismal scene brown could only at present cast a very hasty glance for his guide after pausing an instant as if to permit him to indulge his curiosity strode hastily before him down the path which led into the glen he observed with some feelings of suspicion that she chose a track already marked by several feet which he could only suppose were those of the depredators who had spent the night in the vault a moments recollection however put his suspicions to rest it was not to be thought that the woman who might have delivered him up to her gang when in a state totally defenceless would have suspended her supposed treachery until he was armed and in the open air and had so many better chances of defence or escape he therefore followed his guide in confidence and silence they crossed the small brook at the same place where it previously had been passed by those who had gone before the footmarks then proceeded through the ruined village and from thence down the glen which again narrowed to a ravine after the small opening in which they were situated but the gipsy no longer followed the same track she turned aside and led the way by a very rugged and uneven path up the bank which overhung the village although the snow in many places hid the pathway and rendered the footing uncertain and unsafe meg proceeded with a firm and determined step which indicated an intimate knowledge of the ground she traversed at length they gained the top of the bank though by a passage so steep and intricate that brown though convinced it was the same by which he had descended on the night before was not a little surprised how he had accomplished the task without breaking his neck above the country opened wide and uninclosed for about a mile or two on the one hand and on the other were thick plantations of considerable extent  meg however still led the way along the bank of the ravine out of which they had ascended until she heard beneath the murmur of voices she then pointed to a deep plantation of trees at some distance the road to kippletringan she said is on the other side of these inclosures make the speed ye can theres mair rests on your life than other folks but you have lost allstay she fumbled in an immense pocket from which she produced a greasy pursemanys the awmous your house has gien meg and hers and she has lived to pay it back in a small degree and she placed the purse in his hand  the woman is insane thought brown but it was no time to debate the point for the sounds he heard in the ravine below probably proceeded from the banditti how shall i repay this money he said or how acknowledge the kindness you have done me  i hae twa boons to crave answered the sibyl speaking low and hastily one that you will never speak of what you have seen this night the other that you will not leave this country till you see me again and that you leave word at the gordon arms where you are to be heard of and when i next call for you be it in church or market at wedding or at burial sunday or saturday mealtime or fasting that ye leave everything else and come with me  why that will do you little good mother  but twill do yoursell muckle and thats what im thinking o i am not mad although i have had eneugh to make me sae i am not mad nor doating nor drunken i know what i am asking and i know it has been the will of god to preserve you in strange dangers and that i shall be the instrument to set you in your fathers  seat again sae give me your promise and mind that you owe your life to me this blessed night  theres wildness in her manner certainly thought brown and yet it is more like the wildness of energy than of madnesswell mother since you do ask so useless and trifling a favour you have my promise it will at least give me an opportunity to repay your money with additions you are an uncommon kind of creditor no doubt but  away away then said she waving her hand think not about the goud its a your ain but remember your promise and do not dare to follow me or look after me so saying she plunged again into the dell and descended it with great agility the icicles and snowwreaths showering down after her as she disappeared  notwithstanding her prohibition brown endeavoured to gain some point of the bank from which he might unseen gaze down into the glen and with some difficulty for it must be conceived that the utmost caution was necessary he succeeded the spot which he attained for this purpose was the point of a projecting rock which rose precipitously from among the trees by kneeling down among the snow and stretching his head cautiously forward he could observe what was going on in the bottom of the dell he saw as he expected his companions of the last night now joined by two or three others they had cleared away the snow from the foot of the rock and dug a deep pit which was designed to serve the purpose of a grave around this they now stood and lowered into it something wrapped in a naval cloak which brown instantly concluded to be the dead body of the man he had seen expire they then stood silent for half a minute as if under some touch of feeling for the loss of their companion but if they experienced such they did not long remain under its influence for all hands went presently to work to fill up the grave and brown perceiving that the task would be soon ended thought it best to take the gipsy womans hint and walk as fast as possible until he should gain the shelter of the plantation  having arrived under cover of the trees his first thought was of the gipsys purse he had accepted it without hesitation though with something like a feeling of degradation arising from the character of the person by whom he was thus accommodated but it relieved him from a serious though temporary embarrassment his money excepting a very few shillings was in his portmanteau and that was in possession of megs friends some time was necessary to write to his agent or even to apply to his good host at charlies hope who would gladly have supplied him in the meantime he resolved to avail himself of megs subsidy confident he should have a speedy opportunity of replacing it with a handsome gratuity it can be but a trifling sum he said to himself and i daresay the good lady may have a share of my banknotes to make amends  with these reflections he opened the leathern purse expecting to find at most three or four guineas but how much was he surprised to discover that it contained besides a considerable quantity of gold pieces of different coinages and various countries the joint amount of which could not be short of a hundred pounds several valuable rings and ornaments set with jewels and as appeared from the slight inspection he had time to give them of very considerable value  brown was equally astonished and embarrassed by the circumstances in which he found himself possessed as he now appeared to be of property to a much greater amount than his own but which had been obtained in all probability by the same nefarious means through which he had himself been plundered his first thought was to inquire after the nearest justice of peace and to place in his hands the treasure of which he had thus unexpectedly become the depositary telling at the same time his own remarkable story but a moments consideration brought several objections to this mode of procedure in the first place by observing this course he should break his promise of silence and might probably by that means involve the safety perhaps the life of this woman who had risked her own to preserve his and who had voluntarily endowed him with this treasurea generosity which might thus become the means of her ruin this was not to be thought of besides he was a stranger and for a time at least unprovided with means of establishing his own character and credit to the satisfaction of a stupid or obstinate country magistrate i will think over the matter more maturely he said perhaps there may be a regiment quartered at the county town in which case my knowledge of the service and acquaintance with many officers of the army cannot fail to establish my situation and character by evidence which a civil judge could not sufficiently estimate and then i shall have the commanding officers assistance in managing matters so as to screen this unhappy madwoman whose mistake or prejudice has been so fortunate for me a civil magistrate might think himself obliged to send out warrants for her at once and the consequence in case of her being taken is pretty evident no she has been upon honour with me if she were the devil and i will be equally upon honour with her she shall have the privilege of a courtmartial where the point of honour can qualify strict law besides i may see her at this place kipplecouplewhat did she call it and then i can make restitution to her and een let the law claim its own when it can secure her in the meanwhile however i cut rather an awkward figure for one who has the honour to bear his majestys commission being little better than the receiver of stolen goods  with these reflections brown took from the gipsys treasure three or four guineas for the purpose of his immediate expenses and tying up the rest in the purse which contained them resolved not again to open it until he could either restore it to her by whom it was given or put it into the hands of some public functionary he next thought of the cutlass and his first impulse was to leave it in the plantation but when he considered the risk of meeting with these ruffians he could not resolve on parting with his arms his walkingdress though plain had so much of a military character as suited not amiss with his having such a weapon besides though the custom of wearing swords by persons out of uniform had been gradually becoming antiquated it was not yet so totally forgotten as to occasion any particular remark towards those who chose to adhere to it retaining therefore his weapon of defence and placing the purse of the gipsy in a private pocket our traveller strode gallantly on through the wood in search of the promised highroad       chapter  xxix     all school days friendship childhood innocence      we hermia like two artificial gods      have with our needles created both one flower      both on one sampler sitting on one cushion      both warbling of one song both in one key      as if our hands our sides voices and minds      had been incorporate            a midsummer nights dream   julia mannering to matilda marchmont  how can you upbraid me my dearest matilda with abatement in friendship or fluctuation in affection is it possible for me to forget that you are the chosen of my heart in whose faithful bosom i have deposited every feeling which your poor julia dares to acknowledge to herself and you do me equal injustice in upbraiding me with exchanging your friendship for that of lucy bertram i assure you she has not the materials i must seek for in a bosom confidante she is a charming girl to be sure and i like her very much and i confess our forenoon and evening engagements have left me less time for the exercise of my pen than our proposed regularity of correspondence demands but she is totally devoid of elegant accomplishments excepting the knowledge of french and italian which she acquired from the most grotesque monster you ever beheld whom my father has engaged as a kind of librarian and whom he patronises i believe to show his defiance of the worlds opinion colonel mannering seems to have formed a determination that nothing shall be considered as ridiculous so long as it appertains to or is connected with him i remember in india he had picked up somewhere a little mongrel cur with bandy legs a long back and huge flapping ears of this uncouth creature he chose to make a favourite in despite of all taste and opinion and i remember one instance which he alleged of what he called browns petulance was that he had criticised severely the crooked legs and drooping ears of bingo on my word matilda i believe he nurses his high opinion of this most awkward of all pedants upon a similar principle he seats the creature at table where he pronounces a grace that sounds like the scream of the man in the square that used to cry mackerel flings his meat down his throat by shovelfuls like a dustman loading his cart and apparently without the most distant perception of what he is swallowing then bleats forth another unnatural set of tones by way of returning thanks stalks out of the room and immerses himself among a parcel of huge wormeaten folios that are as uncouth as himself i could endure the creature well enough had i anybody to laugh at him along with me but lucy bertram if i but verge on the border of a jest affecting this same mr sampson such is the horrid mans horrid name looks so piteous that it deprives me of all spirit to proceed and my father knits his brow flashes fire from his eye bites his lip and says something that is extremely rude and uncomfortable to my feelings  it was not of this creature however that i meant to speak to you only that being a good scholar in the modern as well as the ancient languages he has contrived to make lucy bertram mistress of the former and she has only i believe to thank her own good sense or obstinacy that the greek latin and hebrew for aught i know were not added to her acquisitions and thus she really has a great fund of information and i assure you i am daily surprised at the power which she seems to possess of amusing herself by recalling and arranging the subjects of her former reading we read together every morning and i begin to like italian much better than when we were teased by that conceited animal cicipici this is the way to spell his name and not chichipichi you see i grow a connoisseur  but perhaps i like miss bertram more for the accomplishments she wants than for the knowledge she possesses she knows nothing of music whatever and no more of dancing than is here common to the meanest peasants who by the way dance with great zeal and spirit so that i am instructor in my turn and she takes with great gratitude lessons from me upon the harpsichord and i have even taught her some of la piques steps and you know he thought me a promising scholar  in the evening papa often reads and i assure you he is the best reader of poetry you ever heard not like that actor who made a kind of jumble between reading and actingstaring and bending his brow and twisting his face and gesticulating as if he were on the stage and dressed out in all his costume my fathers manner is quite different it is the reading of a gentleman who produces effect by feeling taste and inflection of voice not by action or mummery lucy bertram rides remarkably well and i can now accompany her on horseback having become emboldened by example we walk also a good deal in spite of the cold so upon the whole i have not quite so much time for writing as i used to have  besides my love i must really use the apology of all stupid correspondents that i have nothing to say my hopes my fears my anxieties about brown are of a less interesting cast since i know that he is at liberty and in health besides i must own i think that by this time the gentleman might have given me some intimation what he was doing our intercourse may be an imprudent one but it is not very complimentary to me that mr vanbeest brown should be the first to discover that such is the case and to break off in consequence i can promise him that we might not differ much in opinion should that happen to be his for i have sometimes thought i have behaved extremely foolishly in that matter yet i have so good an opinion of poor brown that i cannot but think there is something extraordinary in his silence  to return to lucy bertram no my dearest matilda she can never never rival you in my regard so that all your affectionate jealousy on that account is without foundation she is to be sure a very pretty a very sensible a very affectionate girl and i think there are few persons to whose consolatory friendship i could have recourse more freely in what are called the real evils of life but then these so seldom come in ones way and one wants a friend who will sympathise with distresses of sentiment as well as with actual misfortune heaven knows and you know my dearest matilda that these diseases of the heart require the balm of sympathy and affection as much as the evils of a more obvious and determinate character now lucy bertram has nothing of this kindly sympathy nothing at all my dearest matilda were i sick of a fever she would sit up night after night to nurse me with the most unrepining patience but with the fever of the heart which my matilda has soothed so often she has no more sympathy than her old tutor and yet what provokes me is that the demure monkey actually has a lover of her own and that their mutual affection for mutual i take it to be has a great deal of complicated and romantic interest she was once you must know a great heiress but was ruined by the prodigality of her father and the villainy of a horrid man in whom he confided and one of the handsomest young gentlemen in the country is attached to her but as he is heir to a great estate she discourages his addresses on account of the disproportion of their fortune  but with all this moderation and selfdenial and modesty and so forth lucy is a sly girl i am sure she loves young hazlewood and i am sure he has some guess of that and would probably bring her to acknowledge it too if my father or she would allow him an opportunity but you must know the colonel is always himself in the way to pay miss bertram those attentions which afford the best indirect opportunities for a young gentleman in hazlewoods situation i would have my good papa take care that he does not himself pay the usual penalty of meddling folks i assure you if i were hazlewood i should look on his compliments his bowings his cloakings his shawlings and his handings with some little suspicion and truly i think hazlewood does so too at some odd times then imagine what a silly figure your poor julia makes on such occasions here is my father making the agreeable to my friend there is young hazlewood watching every word of her lips and every motion of her eye and i have not the poor satisfaction of interesting a human being not even the exotic monster of a parson for even he sits with his mouth open and his huge round goggling eyes fixed like those of a statue admiring mess baartram  all this makes me sometimes a little nervous and sometimes a little mischievous i was so provoked at my father and the lovers the other day for turning me completely out of their thoughts and society that i began an attack upon hazlewood from which it was impossible for him in common civility to escape he insensibly became warm in his defencei assure you matilda he is a very clever as well as a very handsome young man and i dont think i ever remember having seen him to the same advantagewhen behold in the midst of our lively conversation a very soft sigh from miss lucy reached my not ungratified ears i was greatly too generous to prosecute my victory any farther even if i had not been afraid of papa luckily for me he had at that moment got into a long description of the peculiar notions and manners of a certain tribe of indians who live far up the country and was illustrating them by making drawings on miss bertrams workpatterns three of which he utterly damaged by introducing among the intricacies of the pattern his specimens of oriental costume but i believe she thought as little of her own gown at the moment as of the indian turbands and cummerbands however it was quite as well for me that he did not see all the merit of my little manoeuvre for he is as sharpsighted as a hawk and a sworn enemy to the slightest shade of coquetry  well matilda hazlewood heard this same halfaudible sigh and instantly repented his temporary attentions to such an unworthy object as your julia and with a very comical expression of consciousness drew near to lucys worktable he made some trifling observation and her reply was one in which nothing but an ear as acute as that of a lover or a curious observer like myself could have distinguished anything more cold and dry than usual but it conveyed reproof to the selfaccusing hero and he stood abashed accordingly you will admit that i was called upon in generosity to act as mediator so i mingled in the conversation in the quiet tone of an unobserving and uninterested third party led them into their former habits of easy chat and after having served awhile as the channel of communication through which they chose to address each other set them down to a pensive game at chess and very dutifully went to tease papa who was still busied with his drawings the chessplayers you must observe were placed near the chimney beside a little worktable which held the board and men the colonel at some distance with lights upon a library table for it is a large oldfashioned room with several recesses and hung with grim tapestry representing what it might have puzzled the artist himself to explain  is chess a very interesting game papa  i am told so without honouring me with much of his notice  i should think so from the attention mr hazlewood and lucy are bestowing on it  he raised his head hastily and held his pencil suspended for an instant apparently he saw nothing that excited his suspicions for he was resuming the folds of a mahrattas turban in tranquillity when i interrupted him withhow old is miss bertram sir  how should i know miss about your own age i suppose  older i should think sir you are always telling me how much more decorously she goes through all the honours of the teatable lord papa what if you should give her a right to preside once and for ever  julia my dear returned papa you are either a fool outright or you are more disposed to make mischief than i have yet believed you  oh my dear sir put your best construction upon it i would not be thought a fool for all the world  then why do you talk like one said my father  lord sir i am sure there is nothing so foolish in what i said just now everybody knows you are a very handsome man a smile was just visible that is for your time of life the dawn was overcast which is far from being advanced and i am sure i dont know why you should not please yourself if you have a mind i am sensible i am but a thoughtless girl and if a graver companion could render you more happy  there was a mixture of displeasure and grave affection in the manner in which my father took my hand that was a severe reproof to me for trifling with his feelings julia he said i bear with much of your petulance because i think i have in some degree deserved it by neglecting to superintend your education sufficiently closely yet i would not have you give it the rein upon a subject so delicate if you do not respect the feelings of your surviving parent towards the memory of her whom you have lost attend at least to the sacred claims of misfortune and observe that the slightest hint of such a jest reaching miss bertrams ears would at once induce her to renounce her present asylum and go forth without a protector into a world she has already felt so unfriendly  what could i say to this matilda i only cried heartily begged pardon and promised to be a good girl in future and so here am i neutralised again for i cannot in honour or common goodnature tease poor lucy by interfering with hazlewood although she has so little confidence in me and neither can i after this grave appeal venture again upon such delicate ground with papa so i burn little rolls of paper and sketch turks heads upon visiting cards with the blackened endi assure you i succeeded in making a superb hyderally last nightand i jingle on my unfortunate harpsichord and begin at the end of a grave book and read it backward after all i begin to be very much vexed about browns silence had he been obliged to leave the country i am sure he would at least have written to me is it possible that my father can have intercepted his letters but no that is contrary to all his principles i dont think he would open a letter addressed to me tonight to prevent my jumping out of window tomorrow what an expression i have suffered to escape my pen i should be ashamed of it even to you matilda and used in jest but i need not take much merit for acting as i ought to do this same mr vanbeest brown is by no means so very ardent a lover as to hurry the object of his attachment into such inconsiderate steps he gives one full time to reflect that must be admitted however i will not blame him unheard nor permit myself to doubt the manly firmness of a character which i have so often extolled to you were he capable of doubt of fear of the shadow of change i should have little to regret  and why you will say when i expect such steady and unalterable constancy from a lover why should i be anxious about what hazlewood does or to whom he offers his attentions i ask myself the question a hundred times a day and it only receives the very silly answer that one does not like to be neglected though one would not encourage a serious infidelity  i write all these trifles because you say that they amuse you and yet i wonder how they should i remember in our stolen voyages to the world of fiction you always admired the grand and the romantictales of knights dwarfs giants and distressed damsels oothsayers visions beckoning ghosts and bloody hands whereas i was partial to the involved intrigues of private life or at farthest to so much only of the supernatural as is conferred by the agency of an eastern genie or a beneficent fairy you would have loved to shape your course of life over the broad ocean with its dead calms and howling tempests its tornadoes and its billows mountainhigh whereas i should like to trim my little pinnace to a brisk breeze in some inland lake or tranquil bay where there was just difficulty of navigation sufficient to give interest and to require skill without any sensible degree of danger so that upon the whole matilda i think you should have had my father with his pride of arms and of ancestry his chivalrous point of honour his high talents and his abstruse and mystic studies you should have had lucy bertram too for your friend whose fathers with names which alike defy memory and orthography ruled over this romantic country and whose birth took place as i have been indistinctly informed under circumstances of deep and peculiar interest you should have had too our scottish residence surrounded by mountains and our lonely walks to haunted ruins and i should have had in exchange the lawns and shrubs and greenhouses and conservatories of pine park with your good quiet indulgent aunt her chapel in the morning her nap after dinner her hand at whist in the evening not forgetting her fat coachhorses and fatter coachman take notice however that brown is not included in this proposed barter of mine his goodhumour lively conversation and open gallantry suit my plan of life as well as his athletic form handsome features and high spirit would accord with a character of chivalry so as we cannot change altogether out and out i think we must een abide as we are   end of volume i         guy mannering  by sir walter scott  volume ii        guy mannering  or  the astrologer   chapter i      i renounce your defiance if you parley so roughly ill      barricade my gates against you do you see yon bay window      storm i care not serving the good duke of norfolk            merry devil of edmonton   julia mannering to matilda marchmont  i rise from a sickbed my dearest matilda to communicate the strange and frightful scenes which have just passed alas how little we ought to jest with futurity i closed my letter to you in high spirits with some flippant remarks on your taste for the romantic and extraordinary in fictitious narrative how little i expected to have had such events to record in the course of a few days and to witness scenes of terror or to contemplate them in description is as different my dearest matilda as to bend over the brink of a precipice holding by the frail tenure of a halfrooted shrub or to admire the same precipice as represented in the landscape of salvator but i will not anticipate my narrative  the first part of my story is frightful enough though it had nothing to interest my feelings you must know that this country is particularly favourable to the commerce of a set of desperate men from the isle of man which is nearly opposite these smugglers are numerous resolute and formidable and have at different times become the dread of the neighbourhood when any one has interfered with their contraband trade the local magistrates from timidity or worse motives have become shy of acting against them and impunity has rendered them equally daring and desperate with all this my father a stranger in the land and invested with no official authority had one would think nothing to do but it must be owned that as he himself expresses it he was born when mars was lord of his ascendant and that strife and bloodshed find him out in circumstances and situations the most retired and pacific  about eleven oclock on last tuesday morning while hazlewood and my father were proposing to walk to a little lake about three miles distance for the purpose of shooting wild ducks and while lucy and i were busied with arranging our plan of work and study for the day we were alarmed by the sound of horses feet advancing very fast up the avenue the ground was hardened by a severe frost which made the clatter of the hoofs sound yet louder and sharper in a moment two or three men armed mounted and each leading a spare horse loaded with packages appeared on the lawn and without keeping upon the road which makes a small sweep pushed right across for the door of the house their appearance was in the utmost degree hurried and disordered and they frequently looked back like men who apprehended a close and deadly pursuit my father and hazlewood hurried to the front door to demand who they were and what was their business they were revenue officers they stated who had seized these horses loaded with contraband articles at a place about three miles off but the smugglers had been reinforced and were now pursuing them with the avowed purpose of recovering the goods and putting to death the officers who had presumed to do their duty the men said that their horses being loaded and the pursuers gaining ground upon them they had fled to woodbourne conceiving that as my father had served the king he would not refuse to protect the servants of government when threatened to be murdered in the discharge of their duty  my father to whom in his enthusiastic feelings of military loyalty even a dog would be of importance if he came in the kings name gave prompt orders for securing the goods in the hall arming the servants and defending the house in case it should be necessary hazlewood seconded him with great spirit and even the strange animal they call sampson stalked out of his den and seized upon a fowlingpiece which my father had laid aside to take what they call a riflegun with which they shoot tigers etc in the east the piece went off in the awkward hands of the poor parson and very nearly shot one of the excisemen at this unexpected and involuntary explosion of his weapon the dominie such is his nickname exclaimed prodigious which is his usual ejaculation when astonished but no power could force the man to part with his discharged piece so they were content to let him retain it with the precaution of trusting him with no ammunition this excepting the alarm occasioned by the report escaped my notice at the time you may easily believe but in talking over the scene afterwards hazlewood made us very merry with the dominies ignorant but zealous valour  when my father had got everything into proper order for defence and his people stationed at the windows with their firearms he wanted to order us out of dangerinto the cellar i believebut we could not be prevailed upon to stir though terrified to death i have so much of his own spirit that i would look upon the peril which threatens us rather than hear it rage around me without knowing its nature or its progress lucy looking as pale as a marble statue and keeping her eyes fixed on hazlewood seemed not even to hear the prayers with which he conjured her to leave the front of the house but in truth unless the halldoor should be forced we were in little danger the windows being almost blocked up with cushions and pillows and what the dominie most lamented with folio volumes brought hastily from the library leaving only spaces through which the defenders might fire upon the assailants  my father had now made his dispositions and we sat in breathless expectation in the darkened apartment the men remaining all silent upon their posts in anxious contemplation probably of the approaching danger my father who was quite at home in such a scene walked from one to another and reiterated his orders that no one should presume to fire until he gave the word hazlewood who seemed to catch courage from his eye acted as his aiddecamp and displayed the utmost alertness in bearing his directions from one place to another and seeing them properly carried into execution our force with the strangers included might amount to about twelve men  at length the silence of this awful period of expectation was broken by a sound which at a distance was like the rushing of a stream of water but as it approached we distinguished the thickbeating clang of a number of horses advancing very fast i had arranged a loophole for myself from which i could see the approach of the enemy the noise increased and came nearer and at length thirty horsemen and more rushed at once upon the lawn you never saw such horrid wretches notwithstanding the severity of the season they were most of them stripped to their shirts and trowsers with silk handkerchiefs knotted about their heads and all well armed with carbines pistols and cutlasses i who am a soldiers daughter and accustomed to see war from my infancy was never so terrified in my life as by the savage appearance of these ruffians their horses reeking with the speed at which they had ridden and their furious exclamations of rage and disappointment when they saw themselves baulked of their prey they paused however when they saw the preparations made to receive them and appeared to hold a moments consultation among themselves at length one of the party his face blackened with gunpowder by way of disguise came forward with a white handkerchief on the end of his carbine and asked to speak with colonel mannering my father to my infinite terror threw open a window near which he was posted and demanded what he wanted we want our goods which we have been robbed of by these sharks said the fellow and our lieutenant bids me say that if they are delivered well go off for this bout without clearing scores with the rascals who took them but if not well burn the house and have the hearts blood of every one in ita threat which he repeated more than once graced by a fresh variety of imprecations and the most horrid denunciations that cruelty could suggest  and which is your lieutenant said my father in reply  that gentleman on the grey horse said the miscreant with the red handkerchief bound about his brow  then be pleased to tell that gentleman that if he and the scoundrels who are with him do not ride off the lawn this instant i will fire upon them without ceremony so saying my father shut the window and broke short the conference  the fellow no sooner regained his troop than with a loud hurra or rather a savage yell they fired a volley against our garrison the glass of the windows was shattered in every direction but the precautions already noticed saved the party within from suffering three such volleys were fired without a shot being returned from within my father then observed them getting hatchets and crows probably to assail the halldoor and called aloud let none fire but hazlewood and me hazlewood mark the ambassador he himself aimed at the man on the grey horse who fell on receiving his shot hazlewood was equally successful he shot the spokesman who had dismounted and was advancing with an axe in his hand their fall discouraged the rest who began to turn round their horses and a few shots fired at them soon sent them off bearing along with them their slain or wounded companions we could not observe that they suffered any farther loss shortly after their retreat a party of soldiers made their appearance to my infinite relief these men were quartered at a village some miles distant and had marched on the first rumour of the skirmish a part of them escorted the terrified revenue officers and their seizure to a neighbouring seaport as a place of safety and at my earnest request two or three files remained with us for that and the following day for the security of the house from the vengeance of these banditti  such dearest matilda was my first alarm i must not forget to add that the ruffians left at a cottage on the roadside the man whose face was blackened with powder apparently because he was unable to bear transportation he died in about half an hour after on examining the corpse it proved to be that of a profligate boor in the neighbourhood a person notorious as a poacher and smuggler we received many messages of congratulation from the neighbouring families and it was generally allowed that a few such instances of spirited resistance would greatly check the presumption of these lawless men my father distributed rewards among his servants and praised hazlewoods courage and coolness to the skies lucy and i came in for a share of his applause because we had stood fire with firmness and had not disturbed him with screams or expostulations as for the dominie my father took an opportunity of begging to exchange snuffboxes with him the honest gentleman was much flattered with the proposal and extolled the beauty of his new snuffbox excessively it looked he said as well as if it were real gold from ophir indeed it would be odd if it should not being formed in fact of that very metal but to do this honest creature justice i believe the knowledge of its real value would not enhance his sense of my fathers kindness supposing it as he does to be pinchbeck gilded he has had a hard task replacing the folios which were used in the barricade smoothing out the creases and dogsears and repairing the other disasters they have sustained during their service in the fortification he brought us some pieces of lead and bullets which these ponderous tomes had intercepted during the action and which he had extracted with great care and were i in spirits i could give you a comic account of his astonishment at the apathy with which we heard of the wounds and mutilation suffered by thomas aquinas or the venerable chrysostom but i am not in spirits and i have yet another and a more interesting incident to communicate i feel however so much fatigued with my present exertion that i cannot resume the pen till tomorrow i will detain this letter notwithstanding that you may not feel any anxiety upon account of your own  julia mannering          chapter ii     heres a good world      knew you of this fair work            king john   julia mannering to matilda marchmont  i must take up the thread of my story my dearest matilda where i broke off yesterday  for two or three days we talked of nothing but our siege and its probable consequences and dinned into my fathers unwilling ears a proposal to go to edinburgh or at least to dumfries where there is remarkably good society until the resentment of these outlaws should blow over he answered with great composure that he had no mind to have his landlords house and his own property at woodbourne destroyed that with our good leave he had usually been esteemed competent to taking measures for the safety or protection of his family that if he remained quiet at home he conceived the welcome the villains had received was not of a nature to invite a second visit but should he show any signs of alarm it would be the sure way to incur the very risk which we were afraid of heartened by his arguments and by the extreme indifference with which he treated the supposed danger we began to grow a little bolder and to walk about as usual only the gentlemen were sometimes invited to take their guns when they attended us and i observed that my father for several nights paid particular attention to having the house properly secured and required his domestics to keep their arms in readiness in case of necessity  but three days ago chanced an occurrence of a nature which alarmed me more by far than the attack of the smugglers  i told you there was a small lake at some distance from woodbourne where the gentlemen sometimes go to shoot wildfowl i happened at breakfast to say i should like to see this place in its present frozen state occupied by skaters and curlers as they call those who play a particular sort of game upon the ice there is snow on the ground but frozen so hard that i thought lucy and i might venture to that distance as the footpath leading there was well beaten by the repair of those who frequented it for pastime hazlewood instantly offered to attend us and we stipulated that he should take his fowlingpiece he laughed a good deal at the idea of going ashooting in the snow but to relieve our tremors desired that a groom who acts as gamekeeper occasionally should follow us with his gun as for colonel mannering he does not like crowds or sights of any kind where human figures make up the show unless indeed it were a military review so he declined the party  we set out unusually early on a fine frosty exhilarating morning and we felt our minds as well as our nerves braced by the elasticity of the pure air our walk to the lake was delightful or at least the difficulties were only such as diverted usa slippery descent for instance or a frozen ditch to cross which made hazlewoods assistance absolutely necessary i dont think lucy liked her walk the less for these occasional embarrassments  the scene upon the lake was beautiful one side of it is bordered by a steep crag from which hung a thousand enormous icicles all glittering in the sun on the other side was a little wood now exhibiting that fantastic appearance which the pine trees present when their branches are loaded with snow on the frozen bosom of the lake itself were a multitude of moving figures some flitting along with the velocity of swallows some sweeping in the most graceful circles and others deeply interested in a less active pastime crowding round the spot where the inhabitants of two rival parishes contended for the prize at curlingan honour of no small importance if we were to judge from the anxiety expressed both by the players and bystanders we walked round the little lake supported by hazlewood who lent us each an arm he spoke poor fellow with great kindness to old and young and seemed deservedly popular among the assembled crowd at length we thought of retiring  why do i mention these trivial occurrences not heaven knows from the interest i can now attach to them but because like a drowning man who catches at a brittle twig i seize every apology for delaying the subsequent and dreadful part of my narrative but it must be communicated i must have the sympathy of at least one friend under this heartrending calamity  we were returning home by a footpath which led through a plantation of firs lucy had quitted hazlewoods arm it is only the plea of absolute necessity which reconciles her to accept his assistance i still leaned upon his other arm lucy followed us close and the servant was two or three paces behind us such was our position when at once and as if he had started out of the earth brown stood before us at a short turn of the road he was very plainly i might say coarsely dressed and his whole appearance had in it something wild and agitated i screamed between surprise and terror hazlewood mistook the nature of my alarm and when brown advanced towards me as if to speak commanded him haughtily to stand back and not to alarm the lady brown replied with equal asperity he had no occasion to take lessons from him how to behave to that or any other lady i rather believe that hazlewood impressed with the idea that he belonged to the band of smugglers and had some bad purpose in view heard and understood him imperfectly he snatched the gun from the servant who had come up on a line with us and pointing the muzzle at brown commanded him to stand off at his peril my screams for my terror prevented my rinding articulate language only hastened the catastrophe brown thus menaced sprung upon hazlewood grappled with him and had nearly succeeded in wrenching the fowlingpiece from his grasp when the gun went off in the struggle and the contents were lodged in hazlewoods shoulder who instantly fell i saw no more for the whole scene reeled before my eyes and i fainted away but by lucys report the unhappy perpetrator of this action gazed a moment on the scene before him until her screams began to alarm the people upon the lake several of whom now came in sight he then bounded over a hedge which divided the footpath from the plantation and has not since been heard of the servant made no attempt to stop or secure him and the report he made of the matter to those who came up to us induced them rather to exercise their humanity in recalling me to life than show their courage by pursuing a desperado described by the groom as a man of tremendous personal strength and completely armed  hazlewood was conveyed home that is to woodbourne in safety i trust his wound will prove in no respect dangerous though he suffers much but to brown the consequences must be most disastrous he is already the object of my fathers resentment and he has now incurred danger from the law of the country as well as from the clamorous vengeance of the father of hazlewood who threatens to move heaven and earth against the author of his sons wound how will he be able to shroud himself from the vindictive activity of the pursuit how to defend himself if taken against the severity of laws which i am told may even affect his life and how can i find means to warn him of his danger then poor lucys illconcealed grief occasioned by her lovers wound is another source of distress to me and everything round me appears to bear witness against that indiscretion which has occasioned this calamity  for two days i was very ill indeed the news that hazlewood was recovering and that the person who had shot him was nowhere to be traced only that for certain he was one of the leaders of the gang of smugglers gave me some comfort the suspicion and pursuit being directed towards those people must naturally facilitate browns escape and i trust has ere this ensured it but patrols of horse and foot traverse the country in all directions and i am tortured by a thousand confused and unauthenticated rumours of arrests and discoveries  meanwhile my greatest source of comfort is the generous candour of hazlewood who persists in declaring that with whatever intentions the person by whom he was wounded approached our party he is convinced the gun went off in the struggle by accident and that the injury he received was undesigned the groom on the other hand maintains that the piece was wrenched out of hazlewoods hands and deliberately pointed at his body and lucy inclines to the same opinion i do not suspect them of wilful exaggeration yet such is the fallacy of human testimony for the unhappy shot was most unquestionably discharged unintentionally perhaps it would be the best way to confide the whole secret to hazlewood but he is very young and i feel the utmost repugnance to communicate to him my folly i once thought of disclosing the mystery to lucy and began by asking what she recollected of the person and features of the man whom we had so unfortunately met but she ran out into such a horrid description of a hedgeruffian that i was deprived of all courage and disposition to own my attachment to one of such appearance as she attributed to him i must say miss bertram is strangely biassed by her prepossessions for there are few handsomer men than poor brown i had not seen him for a long time and even in his strange and sudden apparition on this unhappy occasion and under every disadvantage his form seems to me on reflection improved in grace and his features in expressive dignity shall we ever meet again who can answer that question write to me kindly my dearest matilda but when did you otherwise yet again write to me soon and write to me kindly i am not in a situation to profit by advice or reproof nor have i my usual spirits to parry them by raillery i feel the terrors of a child who has in heedless sport put in motion some powerful piece of machinery and while he beholds wheels revolving chains clashing cylinders rolling around him is equally astonished at the tremendous powers which his weak agency has called into action and terrified for the consequences which he is compelled to await without the possibility of averting them  i must not omit to say that my father is very kind and affectionate the alarm which i have received forms a sufficient apology for my nervous complaints my hopes are that brown has made his escape into the sister kingdom of england or perhaps to ireland or the isle of man in either case he may await the issue of hazlewoods wound with safety and with patience for the communication of these countries with scotland for the purpose of justice is not thank heaven of an intimate nature the consequences of his being apprehended would be terrible at this moment i endeavour to strengthen my mind by arguing against the possibility of such a calamity alas how soon have sorrows and fears real as well as severe followed the uniform and tranquil state of existence at which so lately i was disposed to repine but i will not oppress you any longer with my complaints adieu my dearest matilda julia mannering       chapter iii      a man may see how this world goes with no eyes look with      thine ears see how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief      hark in thine ear change places and handydandy which      is the justice which is the thief            king lear   among those who took the most lively interest in endeavouring to discover the person by whom young charles hazlewood had been waylaid and wounded was gilbert glossin esquire late writer in  now laird of ellangowan and one of the worshipful commission of justices of the peace for the county of  his motives for exertion on this occasion were manifold but we presume that our readers from what they already know of this gentleman will acquit him of being actuated by any zealous or intemperate love of abstract justice  the truth was that this respectable personage felt himself less at ease than he had expected after his machinations put him in possession of his benefactors estate his reflections within doors where so much occurred to remind him of former times were not always the selfcongratulations of successful stratagem and when he looked abroad he could not but be sensible that he was excluded from the society of the gentry of the county to whose rank he conceived he had raised himself he was not admitted to their clubs and at meetings of a public nature from which he could not be altogether excluded he found himself thwarted and looked upon with coldness and contempt both principle and prejudice cooperated in creating this dislike for the gentlemen of the county despised him for the lowness of his birth while they hated him for the means by which he had raised his fortune with the common people his reputation stood still worse they would neither yield him the territorial appellation of ellangowan nor the usual compliment of mr glossin with them he was bare glossin and so incredibly was his vanity interested by this trifling circumstance that he was known to give halfacrown to a beggar because he had thrice called him ellangowan in beseeching him for a penny he therefore felt acutely the general want of respect and particularly when he contrasted his own character and reception in society with those of mr macmorlan who in far inferior worldly circumstances was beloved and respected both by rich and poor and was slowly but securely laying the foundation of a moderate fortune with the general goodwill and esteem of all who knew him  glossin while he repined internally at what he would fain have called the prejudices and prepossessions of the country was too wise to make any open complaint he was sensible his elevation was too recent to be immediately forgotten and the means by which he had attained it too odious to be soon forgiven but time thought he diminishes wonder and palliates misconduct with the dexterity therefore of one who made his fortune by studying the weak points of human nature he determined to lie by for opportunities to make himself useful even to those who most disliked him trusting that his own abilities the disposition of country gentlemen to get into quarrels when a lawyers advice becomes precious and a thousand other contingencies of which with patience and address he doubted not to be able to avail himself would soon place him in a more important and respectable light to his neighbours and perhaps raise him to the eminence sometimes attained by a shrewd worldly bustling man of business when settled among a generation of country gentlemen he becomes in burnss language  the tongue of the trump to them a  the attack on colonel mannerings house followed by the accident of hazlewoods wound appeared to glossin a proper opportunity to impress upon the country at large the service which could be rendered by an active magistrate for he had been in the commission for some time well acquainted with the law and no less so with the haunts and habits of the illicit traders he had acquired the latter kind of experience by a former close alliance with some of the most desperate smugglers in consequence of which he had occasionally acted sometimes as a partner sometimes as legal adviser with these persons but the connexion had been dropped many years nor considering how short the race of eminent characters of this description and the frequent circumstances occur to make them retire from particular scenes of action had he the least reason to think that his present researches could possibly compromise any old friend who might possess means of retaliation the having been concerned in these practices abstractedly was a circumstance which according to his opinion ought in no respect to interfere with his now using his experience in behalf of the public or rather to further his own private views to acquire the good opinion and countenance of colonel mannering would be no small object to a gentleman who was much disposed to escape from coventry and to gain the favour of old hazlewood who was a leading man in the county was of more importance still lastly if he should succeed in discovering apprehending and convicting the culprits he would have the satisfaction of mortifying and in some degree disparaging macmorlan to whom as sheriffsubstitute of the county this sort of investigation properly belonged and who would certainly suffer in public opinion should the voluntary exertions of glossin be more successful than his own  actuated by motives so stimulating and well acquainted with the lower retainers of the law glossin set every spring in motion to detect and apprehend if possible some of the gang who had attacked woodbourne and more particularly the individual who had wounded charles hazlewood he promised high rewards he suggested various schemes and used his personal interest among his old acquaintances who favoured the trade urging that they had better make sacrifice of an understrapper or two than incur the odium of having favoured such atrocious proceedings but for some time all these exertions were in vain the common people of the country either favoured or feared the smugglers too much to afford any evidence against them at length this busy magistrate obtained information that a man having the dress and appearance of the person who had wounded hazlewood had lodged on the evening before the rencontre at the gordon arms in kippletringan thither mr glossin immediately went for the purpose of interrogating our old acquaintance mrs maccandlish  the reader may remember that mr glossin did not according to this good womans phrase stand high in her books she therefore attended his summons to the parlour slowly and reluctantly and on entering the room paid her respects in the coldest possible manner the dialogue then proceeded as follows  a fine frosty morning mrs maccandlish  ay sir the mornings weel eneugh answered the landlady drily  mrs maccandlish i wish to know if the justices are to dine here as usual after the business of the court on tuesday  i believei fancy sae siras usual about to leave the room  stay a moment mrs maccandlish why you are in a prodigious hurry my good friend i have been thinking a club dining here once a month would be a very pleasant thing  certainly sir a club of respectable gentlemen  true true said glossin i mean landed proprietors and gentlemen of weight in the county and i should like to set such a thing agoing  the short dry cough with which mrs maccandlish received this proposal by no means indicated any dislike to the overture abstractedly considered but inferred much doubt how far it would succeed under the auspices of the gentleman by whom it was proposed it was not a cough negative but a cough dubious and as such glossin felt it but it was not his cue to take offence  have there been brisk doings on the road mrs maccandlish plenty of company i suppose  pretty weel sirbut i believe i am wanted at the bar  no no stop one moment cannot you to oblige an old customer pray do you remember a remarkably tall young man who lodged one night in your house last week  troth sir i canna weel say i never take heed whether my company be lang or short if they make a lang bill  and if they do not you can do that for them eh mrs maccandlish ha ha ha but this young man that i inquire after was upwards of six feet high had a dark frock with metal buttons lightbrown hair unpowdered blue eyes and a straight nose travelled on foot had no servant or baggage you surely can remember having seen such a traveller  indeed sir answered mrs maccandlish bent on baffling his inquiries i canna charge my memory about the matter theres mair to do in a house like this i trow than to look after passengers hair or their een or noses either  then mrs maccandlish i must tell you in plain terms that this person is suspected of having been guilty of a crime and it is in consequence of these suspicions that i as a magistrate require this information from you and if you refuse to answer my questions i must put you upon your oath  troth sir i am no free to swear footnote some of the strict dissenters decline taking an oath before a civil magistrate we ay gaed to the antiburgher meeting its very true in bailie maccandlishs time honest man we keepit the kirk whilk was most seemly in his station as having office but after his being called to a better place than kippletringan i hae gaen back to worthy maister macgrainer and so ye see sir i am no clear to swear without speaking to the minister especially against ony sackless puir young thing thats gaun through the country stranger and freendless like  i shall relieve your scruples perhaps without troubling mr macgrainer when i tell you that this fellow whom i inquire after is the man who shot your young friend charles hazlewood  gudeness wha could hae thought the like o that o him na if it had been for debt or een for a bit tuilzie wi the gauger the deil o nelly maccandlishs tongue should ever hae wranged him but if he really shot young hazlewoodbut i canna think it mr glossin this will be some o your skits now i canna think it o sae douce a lad na na this is just some o your auld skits yell be for having a horning or a caption after him  i see you have no confidence in me mrs maccandlish but look at these declarations signed by the persons who saw the crime committed and judge yourself if the description of the ruffian be not that of your guest  he put the papers into her hand which she perused very carefully often taking off her spectacles to cast her eyes up to heaven or perhaps to wipe a tear from them for young hazlewood was an especial favourite with the good dame aweel aweel she said when she had concluded her examination since its een sae i gie him up the villain but o we are erring mortals i never saw a face i liked better or a lad that was mair douce and canny i thought he had been some gentleman under trouble but i gie him up the villain to shoot charles hazlewood and before the young ladies poor innocent things i gie him up  so you admit then that such a person lodged here the night before this vile business  troth did he sir and a the house were taen wi him he was sic a frank pleasant young man it wasna for his spending im sure for he just had a muttonchop and a mug of ale and maybe a glass or twa o wine and i asked him to drink tea wi mysell and didna put that into the bill and he took nae supper for he said he was defeat wi travel a the night afore i daresay now it had been on some hellicat errand or other  did you by any chance learn his name  i wot weel did i said the landlady now as eager to communicate her evidence as formerly desirous to suppress it he telld me his name was brown and he said it was likely that an auld woman like a gipsy wife might be asking for him ay ay tell me your company and ill tell you wha ye are o the villain aweel sir when he gaed away in the morning he paid his bill very honestly and gae something to the chambermaid nae doubt for grizzy has naething frae me by twa pair o new shoo ilka year and maybe a bit compliment at hansel monanday here glossin found it necessary to interfere and bring the good woman back to the point  ou then he just said if there comes such a person to inquire after mr brown you will say i am gone to look at the skaters on loch creeran as you call it and i will be back here to dinner but he never came back though i expected him sae faithfully that i gae a look to making the friars chicken mysell and to the crappitheads too and thats what i dinna do for ordinary mr glossin but little did i think what skating wark he was gaun aboutto shoot mr charles the innocent lamb  mr glossin having like a prudent examinator suffered his witness to give vent to all her surprise and indignation now began to inquire whether the suspected person had left any property or papers about the inn  troth he put a parcela sma parcelunder my charge and he gave me some siller and desired me to get him halfadozen ruffled sarks and peg pasleys in hands wi them een now they may serve him to gang up the lawnmarket footnote the procession of the criminals to the gallows of old took that direction moving as the schoolboy rhyme had it up the lawnmarket down the west bow up the lang ladder and down the little tow in the scoundrel mr glossin then demanded to see the packet but here mine hostess demurred  she didna kenshe wad not say but justice should take its coursebut when a thing was trusted to ane in her way doubtless they were responsible but she suld cry in deacon bearcliff and if mr glossin liked to tak an inventar o the property and gie her a receipt before the deaconor what she wad like muckle better an it could be sealed up and left in deacon bearcliffs handsit wad mak her mind easy she was for naething but justice on a sides  mrs maccandlishs natural sagacity and acquired suspicion being inflexible glossin sent for deacon bearcliff to speak anent the villain that had shot mr charles hazlewood the deacon accordingly made his appearance with his wig awry owing to the hurry with which at this summons of the justice he had exchanged it for the kilmarnock cap in which he usually attended his customers mrs maccandlish then produced the parcel deposited with her by brown in which was found the gipsys purse on perceiving the value of the miscellaneous contents mrs maccandlish internally congratulated herself upon the precautions she had taken before delivering them up to glossin while he with an appearance of disinterested candour was the first to propose they should be properly inventoried and deposited with deacon bearcliff until they should be sent to the crownoffice he did not he observed like to be personally responsible for articles which seemed of considerable value and had doubtless been acquired by the most nefarious practices  he then examined the paper in which the purse had been wrapt up it was the back of a letter addressed to v brown esquire but the rest of the address was torn away the landlady now as eager to throw light upon the criminals escape as she had formerly been desirous of withholding it for the miscellaneous contents of the purse argued strongly to her mind that all was not rightmrs maccandlish i say now gave glossin to understand that her position and hostler had both seen the stranger upon the ice that day when young hazlewood was wounded  our readers old acquaintance jock jabos was first summoned and admitted frankly that he had seen and conversed upon the ice that morning with a stranger who he understood had lodged at the gordon arms the night before  what turn did your conversation take said glossin  turn ou we turned nae gate at a but just keep it straight forward upon the ice like  well but what did ye speak about  ou he just asked questions like ony ither stranger answered the postilion possessed as it seemed with the refractory and uncommunicative spirit which had left his mistress  but about what said glossin  ou just about the folk that was playing at the curling and about auld jock stevenson that was at the cock and about the leddies and sic like  what ladies and what did he ask about them jock said the interrogator  what leddies ou it was miss jowlia mannering and miss lucy bertram that ye ken fu weel yoursell mr glossin they were walking wi the young laird of hazlewood upon the ice  and what did you tell him about them demanded glossin  tut we just said that was miss lucy bertram of ellangowan that should ance have had a great estate in the country and that was miss jowlia mannering that was to be married to young hazlewood see as she was hinging on his arm we just spoke about our country clashes like he was a very frank man  well and what did he say in answer  ou he just stared at the young leddies very keenlike and asked if it was for certain that the marriage was to be between miss mannering and young hazlewood and i answered him that it was for positive and absolute certain as i had an undoubted right to say sae for my third cousin jean clavers shes a relation o your ain mr glossin ye wad ken jean lang syne shes sib to the houskeeper at woodbourne and shes telld me mair than ance that there was naething could be mair likely  and what did the stranger say when you told him all this said glossin  say echoed the postilion he said naething at a he just stared at them as they walked round the loch upon the ice as if he could have eaten them and he never took his ee aff them or said another word or gave another glance at the bonspiel though there was the finest fun amang the curlers ever was seen and he turned round and gaed aff the loch by the kirkstile through woodbourne firplantings and we saw nae mair o him  only think said mrs maccandlish what a hard heart he maun hae had to think o hurting the poor young gentleman in the very presence of the leddy he was to be married to  o mrs maccandlish said glossin theres been many cases such as that on the record doubtless he was seeking revenge where it would be deepest and sweetest  god pity us said deacon bearcliff were puir frail creatures when left to oursells ay he forgot wha said vengeance is mine and i will repay it  weel aweel sirs said jabos whose hardheaded and uncultivated shrewdness seemed sometimes to start the game when others beat the bushweel weel ye may be a mistaen yet ill never believe that a man would lay a plan to shoot another wi his ain gun lord help ye i was the keepers assistant down at the isle mysell and ill uphaud it the biggest man in scotland shouldna take a gun frae me or i had weized the slugs through him though im but sic a little feckless body fit for naething but the outside o a saddle and the foreend o a poschay na na nae living man wad venture on that ill wad my best buckskins and they were new coft at kirkcudbright fair its been a chance job after a but if ye hae naething mair to say to me i am thinking i maun gang and see my beasts fed and he departed accordingly  the hostler who had accompanied him gave evidence to the same purpose he and mrs maccandlish were then reinterrogated whether brown had no arms with him on that unhappy morning none they said but an ordinary bit cutlass or hanger by his side  now said the deacon taking glossin by the button for in considering this intricate subject he had forgot glossins new accession of rankthis is but doubtfu after a maister gilbert for it was not sae dooms likely that he would go down into battle wi sic sma means  glossin extricated himself from the deacons grasp and from the discussion though not with rudeness for it was his present interest to buy golden opinions from all sorts of people he inquired the price of tea and sugar and spoke of providing himself for the year he gave mrs maccandlish directions to have a handsome entertainment in readiness for a party of five friends whom he intended to invite to dine with him at the gordon arms next saturday week and lastly he gave a halfcrown to jock jabos whom the hostler had deputed to hold his steed  weel said the deacon to mrs maccandlish as he accepted her offer of a glass of bitters at the bar the deils no sae ill as hes cad its pleasant to see a gentleman pay the regard to the business o the county that mr glossin does  ay deed ist deacon answered the landlady and yet i wonder our gentry leave their ain wark to the like o him but as lang as sillers current deacon folk maunna look ower nicely at what kings heads ont  i doubt glossin will prove but shand after a mistress said jabos as he passed through the little lobby beside the bar but this is a gude halfcrown ony way       chapter iv      a man that apprehends death to be no more dreadful but as a      drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of whats      past present or to come insensible of mortality and      desperately mortal            measure for measure   glossin had made careful minutes of the information derived from these examinations they threw little light upon the story so far as he understood its purport but the betterinformed reader has received through means of this investigation an account of browns proceedings between the moment when we left him upon his walk to kippletringan and the time when stung by jealousy he so rashly and unhappily presented himself before julia mannering and wellnigh brought to a fatal termination the quarrel which his appearance occasioned  glossin rode slowly back to ellangowan pondering on what he had heard and more and more convinced that the active and successful prosecution of this mysterious business was an opportunity of ingratiating himself with hazlewood and mannering to be on no account neglected perhaps also he felt his professional acuteness interested in bringing it to a successful close it was therefore with great pleasure that on his return to his house from kippletringan he heard his servants announce hastily that macguffog the thieftaker and twa or three concurrents had a man in hands in the kitchen waiting for his honour  he instantly jumped from horseback and hastened into the house send my clerk here directly yell find him copying the survey of the estate in the little green parlour set things to rights in my study and wheel the great leathern chair up to the writingtable set a stool for mr scrow scrow to the clerk as he entered the presencechamber hand down sir george mackenzie on crimes open it at the section vis publica et privata and fold down a leaf at the passage anent the bearing of unlawful weapons now lend me a hand off with my mucklecoat and hang it up in the lobby and bid them bring up the prisoner i trow ill sort him but stay first send up macguffog now macguffog where did ye find this chield  macguffog a stout bandylegged fellow with a neck like a bull a face like a firebrand and a most portentous squint of the left eye began after various contortions by way of courtesy to the justice to tell his story eking it out by sundry sly nods and knowing winks which appeared to bespeak an intimate correspondence of ideas between the narrator and his principal auditor your honour sees i went down to yon place that your honour spoke o thats kept by her that your honour kens o by the seaside so says she what are you wanting here yell be come wi a broom in your pocket frae ellangowanso says i deil a broom will come frae there awa for ye ken says i his honour ellangowan himsell in former times  well well said glossin no occasion to be particular tell the essentials  weel so we sat niffering about some brandy that i said i wanted till he came in  who  he pointing with his thumb inverted to the kitchen where the prisoner was in custody so he had his griego wrapped close round him and i judged he was not dryhanded so i thought it was best to speak proper and so he believed i was a manks man and i kept ay between him and her for fear she had whistled and then we began to drink about and then i betted he would not drink out a quartern of hollands without drawing breath and then he tried it and just then slounging jock and dick spurem came in and we clinked the darbies on him took him as quiet as a lamb and now hes had his bit sleep out and is as fresh as a may gowan to answer what your honour likes to speir this narrative delivered with a wonderful quantity of gesture and grimace received at the conclusion the thanks and praises which the narrator expected  had he no arms asked the justice  ay ay they are never without barkers and slashers  any papers  this bundle delivering a dirty pocketbook  go downstairs then macguffog and be in waiting the officer left the room  the clink of irons was immediately afterwards heard upon the stair and in two or three minutes a man was introduced handcuffed and fettered he was thick brawny and muscular and although his shagged and grizzled hair marked an age somewhat advanced and his stature was rather low he appeared nevertheless a person whom few would have chosen to cope with in personal conflict his coarse and savage features were still flushed and his eye still reeled under the influence of the strong potation which had proved the immediate cause of his seizure but the sleep though short which macguffog had allowed him and still more a sense of the peril of his situation had restored to him the full use of his faculties the worthy judge and the no less estimable captive looked at each other steadily for a long time without speaking glossin apparently recognised his prisoner but seemed at a loss how to proceed with his investigation at length he broke silencesoh captain this is you you have been a stranger on this coast for some years  stranger replied the other strange enough i think for hold me der deyvil if i been ever here before  that wont pass mr captain  that must pass mr justice sapperment  and who will you be pleased to call yourself then for the present said glossin just until i shall bring some other folks to refresh your memory concerning who you are or at least who you have been  what bin i donner and blitzen i bin jans jansen from cuxhaven what sall ich bin  glossin took from a case which was in the apartment a pair of small pocket pistols which he loaded with ostentatious care you may retire said he to his clerk and carry the people with you scrow but wait in the lobby within call  the clerk would have offered some remonstrances to his patron on the danger of remaining alone with such a desperate character although ironed beyond the possibility of active exertion but glossin waved him off impatiently when he had left the room the justice took two short turns through the apartment then drew his chair opposite to the prisoner so as to confront him fully placed the pistols before him in readiness and said in a steady voice you are dirk hatteraick of flushing are you not  the prisoner turned his eye instinctively to the door as if he apprehended some one was listening glossin rose opened the door so that from the chair in which his prisoner sate he might satisfy himself there was no eavesdropper within hearing then shut it resumed his seat and repeated his question you are dirk hatteraick formerly of the yungfrauw haagenslaapen are you not  tousand deyvils and if you know that why ask me said the prisoner  because i am surprised to see you in the very last place where you ought to be if you regard your safety observed glossin coolly  der deyvil no man regards his own safety that speaks so to me  what unarmed and in irons well said captain replied glossin ironically but captain bullying wont do youll hardly get out of this country without accounting for a little accident that happened at warroch point a few years ago  hatteraicks looks grew black as midnight  for my part continued glossin i have no particular wish to be hard upon an old acquaintance but i must do my duty i shall send you off to edinburgh in a postchaise and four this very day  poz donner you would not do that said hatteraick in a lower and more humbled tone why you had the matter of half a cargo in bills on vanbeest and vanbruggen  it is so long since captain hatteraick answered glossin superciliously that i really forget how i was recompensed for my trouble  your trouble your silence you mean  it was an affair in the course of business said glossin and i have retired from business for some time  ay but i have a notion that i could make you go steady about and try the old course again answered dirk hatteraick why man hold me der deyvil but i meant to visit you and tell you something that concerns you  of the boy said glossin eagerly  yaw mynheer replied the captain coolly  he does not live does he  as lifelich as you or i said hatteraick  good god but in india exclaimed glossin  no tousand deyvils here on this dirty coast of yours rejoined the prisoner  but hatteraick thisthat is if it be true which i do not believethis will ruin us both for he cannot but remember your neat job and for me it will be productive of the worst consequences it will ruin us both i tell you  i tell you said the seaman it will ruin none but you for i am done up already and if i must strap for it all shall out  zounds said the justice impatiently what brought you back to this coast like a madman  why all the gelt was gone and the house was shaking and i thought the job was clayed over and forgotten answered the worthy skipper  stay what can be done said glossin anxiously i dare not discharge you but might you not be rescued in the way ay sure a word to lieutenant brown and i would send the people with you by the coastroad  no no that wont do browns dead shot laid in the locker man the devil has the picking of him  dead shot at woodbourne i suppose replied glossin  yaw mynheer  glossin paused the sweat broke upon his brow with the agony of his feelings while the hardfeatured miscreant who sat opposite coolly rolled his tobacco in his cheek and squirted the juice into the firegrate it would be ruin said glossin to himself absolute ruin if the heir should reappear and then what might be the consequence of conniving with these men yet there is so little time to take measures hark you hatteraick i cant set you at liberty but i can put you where you may set yourself at liberty i always like to assist an old friend i shall confine you in the old castle for tonight and give these people double allowance of grog macguffog will fall in the trap in which he caught you the stancheons on the window of the strong room as they call it are wasted to pieces and it is not above twelve feet from the level of the ground without and the snow lies thick  but the darbies said hatteraick looking upon his fetters  hark ye said glossin going to a tool chest and taking out a small filetheres a friend for you and you know the road to the sea by the stairs hatteraick shook his chains in ecstasy as if he were already at liberty and strove to extend his fettered hand towards his protector glossin laid his finger upon his lips with a cautious glance at the door and then proceeded in his instructions when you escape you had better go to the kaim of derncleugh  donner that howff is blown  the devil well then you may steal my skiff that lies on the beach there and away but you must remain snug at the point of warroch till i come to see you  the point of warroch said hatteraick his countenance again falling what in the cave i suppose i would rather it were anywhere else es spuckt da they say for certain that he walks but donner and blitzen i never shunned him alive and i wont shun him dead strafe mich helle it shall never be said dirk hatteraick feared either dog or devil so i am to wait there till i see you  ay ay answered glossin and now i must call in the men he did so accordingly  i can make nothing of captain jansen as he calls himself macguffog and its now too late to bundle him off to the county jail is there not a strong room up yonder in the old castle  ay is there sir my uncle the constable ance kept a man there for three days in auld ellangowans time but there was an unco dust about it it was tried in the inner house afore the feifteen  i know all that but this person will not stay there very long its only a makeshift for a night a mere lockup house till farther examination there is a small room through which it opens you may light a fire for yourselves there and i ll send you plenty of stuff to make you comfortable but be sure you lock the door upon the prisoner and hark ye let him have a fire in the strong room too the season requires it perhaps hell make a clean breast tomorrow  with these instructions and with a large allowance of food and liquor the justice dismissed his party to keep guard for the night in the old castle under the full hope and belief that they would neither spend the night in watching nor prayer  there was little fear that glossin himself should that night sleep oversound his situation was perilous in the extreme for the schemes of a life of villainy seemed at once to be crumbling around and above him he laid himself to rest and tossed upon his pillow for a long time in vain at length he fell asleep but it was only to dream of his patron now as he had last seen him with the paleness of death upon his features then again transformed into all the vigour and comeliness of youth approaching to expel him from the mansionhouse of his fathers then he dreamed that after wandering long over a wild heath he came at length to an inn from which sounded the voice of revelry and that when he entered the first person he met was frank kennedy all smashed and gory as he had lain on the beach at warroch point but with a reeking punchbowl in his hand then the scene changed to a dungeon where he heard dirk hatteraick whom he imagined to be under sentence of death confessing his crimes to a clergyman after the bloody deed was done said the penitent we retreated into a cave close beside the secret of which was known but to one man in the country we were debating what to do with the child and we thought of giving it up to the gipsies when we heard the cries of the pursuers hallooing to each other one man alone came straight to our cave and it was that man who knew the secret but we made him our friend at the expense of half the value of the goods saved by his advice we carried off the child to holland in our consort which came the following night to take us from the coast that man was  no i deny it it was not i said glossin in halfuttered accents and struggling in his agony to express his denial more distinctly he awoke  it was however conscience that had prepared this mental phantasmagoria the truth was that knowing much better than any other person the haunts of the smugglers he had while the others were searching in different directions gone straight to the cave even before he had learned the murder of kennedy whom he expected to find their prisoner he came upon them with some idea of mediation but found them in the midst of their guilty terrors while the rage which had hurried them on to murder began with all but hatteraick to sink into remorse and fear glossin was then indigent and greatly in debt but he was already possessed of mr bertrams ear and aware of the facility of his disposition he saw no difficulty in enriching himself at his expense provided the heirmale were removed in which case the estate became the unlimited property of the weak and prodigal father stimulated by present gain and the prospect of contingent advantage he accepted the bribe which the smugglers offered in their terror and connived at or rather encouraged their intention of carrying away the child of his benefactor who if left behind was old enough to have described the scene of blood which he had witnessed the only palliative which the ingenuity of glossin could offer to his conscience was that the temptation was great and came suddenly upon him embracing as it were the very advantages on which his mind had so long rested and promising to relieve him from distresses which must have otherwise speedily overwhelmed him besides he endeavoured to think that selfpreservation rendered his conduct necessary he was in some degree in the power of the robbers and pleaded hard with his conscience that had he declined their offers the assistance which he could have called for though not distant might not have arrived in time to save him from men who on less provocation had just committed murder  galled with the anxious forebodings of a guilty conscience glossin now arose and looked out upon the night the scene which we have already described in the third chapter of this story was now covered with snow and the brilliant though waste whiteness of the land gave to the sea by contrast a dark and livid tinge a landscape covered with snow though abstractedly it may be called beautiful has both from the association of cold and barrenness and from its comparative infrequency a wild strange and desolate appearance objects well known to us in their common state have either disappeared or are so strangely varied and disguised that we seem gazing on an unknown world but it was not with such reflections that the mind of this bad man was occupied his eye was upon the gigantic and gloomy outlines of the old castle where in a flanking tower of enormous size and thickness glimmered two lights one from the window of the strong room where hatteraick was confined the other from that of the adjacent apartment occupied by his keepers has he made his escape or will he be able to do so have these men watched who never watched before in order to complete my ruin if morning finds him there he must be committed to prison macmorlan or some other person will take the matter up he will be detected convicted and will tell all in revenge  while these racking thoughts glided rapidly through glossins mind he observed one of the lights obscured as by an opaque body placed at the window what a moment of interest he has got clear of his irons he is working at the stancheons of the window they are surely quite decayed they must give way o god they have fallen outward i heard them clink among the stones the noise cannot fail to wake them furies seize his dutch awkwardness the light burns free again they have torn him from the window and are binding him in the room no he had only retired an instant on the alarm of the falling bars he is at the window again and the light is quite obscured now he is getting out  a heavy sound as of a body dropped from a height among the snow announced that hatteraick had completed his escape and shortly after glossin beheld a dark figure like a shadow steal along the whitened beach and reach the spot where the skiff lay new cause for fear his single strength will be unable to float her said glossin to himself i must go to the rascals assistance but no he has got her off and now thank god her sail is spreading itself against the moon ay he has got the breeze now would to heaven it were a tempest to sink him to the bottom  after this last cordial wish he continued watching the progress of the boat as it stood away towards the point of warroch until he could no longer distinguish the dusky sail from the gloomy waves over which it glided satisfied then that the immediate danger was averted he retired with somewhat more composure to his guilty pillow       chapter v      why dost not comfort me and help me out      from this unhallowed and bloodstained hole            titus andronicus   on the next morning great was the alarm and confusion of the officers when they discovered the escape of their prisoner macguffog appeared before glossin with a head perturbed with brandy and fear and incurred a most severe reprimand for neglect of duty the resentment of the justice appeared only to be suspended by his anxiety to recover possession of the prisoner and the thieftakers glad to escape from his awful and incensed presence were sent off in every direction except the right one to recover their prisoner if possible glossin particularly recommended a careful search at the kaim of derncleugh which was occasionally occupied under night by vagrants of different descriptions having thus dispersed his myrmidons in various directions he himself hastened by devious paths through the wood of warroch to his appointed interview with hatteraick from whom he hoped to learn at more leisure than last nights conference admitted the circumstances attending the return of the heir of ellangowan to his native country  with manoeuvres like those of a fox when he doubles to avoid the pack glossin strove to approach the place of appointment in a manner which should leave no distinct track of his course would to heaven it would snow he said looking upward and hide these footprints should one of the officers light upon them he would run the scent up like a bloodhound and surprise us i must get down upon the seabeach and contrive to creep along beneath the rocks  and accordingly he descended from the cliffs with some difficulty and scrambled along between the rocks and the advancing tide now looking up to see if his motions were watched from the rocks above him now casting a jealous glance to mark if any boat appeared upon the sea from which his course might be discovered  but even the feelings of selfish apprehension were for a time superseded as glossin passed the spot where kennedys body had been found it was marked by the fragment of rock which had been precipitated from the cliff above either with the body or after it the mass was now encrusted with small shellfish and tasselled with tangle and seaweed but still its shape and substance were different from those of the other rocks which lay scattered around his voluntary walks it will readily be believed had never led to this spot so that finding himself now there for the first time after the terrible catastrophe the scene at once recurred to his mind with all its accompaniments of horror he remembered how like a guilty thing gliding from the neighbouring place of concealment he had mingled with eagerness yet with caution among the terrified group who surrounded the corpse dreading lest any one should ask from whence he came he remembered too with what conscious fear he had avoided gazing upon that ghastly spectacle the wild scream of his patron my bairn my bairn again rang in his ears good god he exclaimed and is all i have gained worth the agony of that moment and the thousand anxious fears and horrors which have since embittered my life o how i wish that i lay where that wretched man lies and that he stood here in life and health but these regrets are all too late  stifling therefore his feelings he crept forward to the cave which was so near the spot where the body was found that the smugglers might have heard from their hidingplace the various conjectures of the bystanders concerning the fate of their victim but nothing could be more completely concealed than the entrance to their asylum the opening not larger than that of a foxearth lay in the face of the cliff directly behind a large black rock or rather upright stone which served at once to conceal it from strangers and as a mark to point out its situation to those who used it as a place of retreat the space between the stone and the cliff was exceedingly narrow and being heaped with sand and other rubbish the most minute search would not have discovered the mouth of the cavern without removing those substances which the tide had drifted before it for the purpose of further concealment it was usual with the contraband traders who frequented this haunt after they had entered to stuff the mouth with withered seaweed loosely piled together as if carried there by the waves dirk hatteraick had not forgotten this precaution  glossin though a bold and hardy man felt his heart throb and his knees knock together when he prepared to enter this den of secret iniquity in order to hold conference with a felon whom he justly accounted one of the most desperate and depraved of men but he has no interest to injure me was his consolatory reflection he examined his pocketpistols however before removing the weeds and entering the cavern which he did upon hands and knees the passage which at first was low and narrow just admitting entrance to a man in a creeping posture expanded after a few yards into a high arched vault of considerable width the bottom ascending gradually was covered with the purest sand ere glossin had got upon his feet the hoarse yet suppressed voice of hatteraick growled through the recesses of the cave  hagel and donner best du  are you in the dark  dark der deyvil ay said dirk hatteraick where should i have a glim  i have brought light and glossin accordingly produced a tinderbox and lighted a small lantern  you must kindle some fire too for hold mich der deyvil ich bin ganz gefrorne  it is a cold place to be sure said glossin gathering together some decayed staves of barrels and pieces of wood which had perhaps lain in the cavern since hatteraick was there last  cold snowwasser and hagel its perdition i could only keep myself alive by rambling up and down this dd vault and thinking about the merry rouses we have had in it  the flame then began to blaze brightly and hatteraick hung his bronzed visage and expanded his hard and sinewy hands over it with an avidity resembling that of a famished wretch to whom food is exposed the light showed his savage and stern features and the smoke which in his agony of cold he seemed to endure almost to suffocation after circling round his head rose to the dim and rugged roof of the cave through which it escaped by some secret rents or clefts in the rock the same doubtless that afforded air to the cavern when the tide was in at which time the aperture to the sea was filled with water  and now i have brought you some breakfast said glossin producing some cold meat and a flask of spirits the latter hatteraick eagerly seized upon and applied to his mouth and after a hearty draught he exclaimed with great rapture das schmeckt that is good that warms the liver then broke into the fragment of a highdutch song       saufen bier und brantewein      schmeissen alle die fenstern ein      ich bin liederlich      du bist liederlich      sind wir nicht liederlich leute a  well said my hearty captain cried glossin endeavouring to catch the tone of revelry      gin by pailfuls wine in rivers      dash the windowglass to shivers         for three wild lads were we brave boys         and three wild lads were we         thou on the land and i on the sand         and jack on the gallowstree  thats it my bullyboy why youre alive again now and now let us talk about our business  your business if you please said hatteraick hagel and donner mine was done when i got out of the bilboes  have patience my good friend ill convince you our interests are just the same  hatteraick gave a short dry cough and glossin after a pause proceeded  how came you to let the boy escape  why fluch and blitzen he was no charge of mine lieutenant brown gave him to his cousin thats in the middleburgh house of vanbeest and vanbruggen and told him some gooses gazette about his being taken in a skirmish with the landsharks he gave him for a footboy me let him escape the bastard kinchin should have walked the plank ere i troubled myself about him  well and was he bred a footboy then  nein nein the kinchin got about the old mans heart and he gave him his own name and bred him up in the office and then sent him to india i believe he would have packed him back here but his nephew told him it would do up the free trade for many a day if the youngster got back to scotland  do you think the younker knows much of his own origin now  deyvil replied hatteraick how should i tell what he knows now but he remembered something of it long when he was but ten years old he persuaded another satans limb of an english bastard like himself to steal my luggers khanboatwhat do you call it to return to his country as he called it fire him before we could overtake them they had the skiff out of channel as far as the deurloo the boat might have been lost  i wish to heaven she had with him in her ejaculated glossin  why i was so angry myself that sapperment i did give him a tip over the side but split him the comical little devil swam like a duck so i made him swim astern for a mile to teach him manners and then took him in when he was sinking by the knocking nicholas i hell plague you now hes come over the herringpond when he was so high he had the spirit of thunder and lightning  how did he get back from india  why how should i know the house there was done up and that gave us a shake at middleburgh i think so they sent me again to see what could be done among my old acquaintances here for we held old stories were done away and forgotten so i had got a pretty trade on foot within the last two trips but that stupid houndsfoot schelm brown has knocked it on the head again i suppose with getting himself shot by the colonelman  why were not you with them  why you see sapperment i fear nothing but it was too far within land and i might have been scented  true but to return to this youngster  ay ay donner and blitzen hes your affair said the captain  how do you really know that he is in this country  why gabriel saw him up among the hills  gabriel who is he  a fellow from the gipsies that about eighteen years since was pressed on board that dd fellow pritchards sloopofwar it was he came off and gave us warning that the shark was coming round upon us the day kennedy was done and he told us how kennedy had given the information the gipsies and kennedy had some quarrel besides this gab went to the east indies in the same ship with your younker and sapperment knew him well though the other did not remember him gab kept out of his eye though as he had served the states against england and was a deserter to boot and he sent us word directly that we might know of his being here though it does not concern us a ropes end  so then really and in sober earnest he is actually in this country hatteraick between friend and friend asked glossin seriously  wetter and donner yaw what do you take me for  for a bloodthirsty fearless miscreant thought glossin internally but said aloud and which of your people was it that shot young hazlewood  sturmwetter said the captain do ye think we were mad none of us man gott the country was too hot for the trade already with that dd frolic of browns attacking what you call woodbourne house  why i am told said glossin it was brown who shot hazlewood  not our lieutenant i promise you for he was laid six feet deep at derncleugh the day before the thing happened tausend deyvils man do ye think that he could rise out of the earth to shoot another man  a light here began to break upon glossins confusion of ideas did you not say that the younker as you call him goes by the name of brown  of brown yaw vanbeest brown old vanbeest brown of our vanbeest and vanbruggen gave him his own name he did  then said glossin rubbing his hands it is he by heaven who has committed this crime  and what have we to do with that demanded hatteraick  glossin paused and fertile in expedients hastily ran over his project in his own mind and then drew near the smuggler with a confidential air you know my dear hatteraick it is our principal business to get rid of this young man  umph answered dirk hatteraick  not continued glossinnot that i would wish any personal harm to himififif we can do without now he is liable to be seized upon by justice both as bearing the same name with your lieutenant who was engaged in that affair at woodbourne and for firing at young hazlewood with intent to kill or wound  ay ay said dirk hatteraick but what good will that do you hell be loose again as soon as he shows himself to carry other colours  true my dear dirk well noticed my friend hatteraick but there is ground enough for a temporary imprisonment till he fetch his proofs from england or elsewhere my good friend i understand the law captain hatteraick and ill take it upon me simple gilbert glossin of ellangowan justice of peace for the county of to refuse his bail if he should offer the best in the country until he is brought up for a second examination now where dye think ill incarcerate him  hagel and wetter what do i care  stay my friend you do care a great deal do you know your goods that were seized and carried to woodbourne are now lying in the customhouse at portanferry a small fishingtown now i will commit this younker  when you have caught him  ay ay when i have caught him i shall not be long about that i will commit him to the workhouse or bridewell which you know is beside the customhouse  yaw the rasphouse i know it very well  i will take care that the redcoats are dispersed through the country you land at night with the crew of your lugger receive your own goods and carry the younker brown with you back to flushing wont that do  ay carry him to flushing said the captain orto america  ay ay my friend  orto jericho  psha wherever you have a mind  ay orpitch him overboard  nay i advise no violence  nein nein you leave that to me sturmwetter i know you of old but hark ye what am i dirk hatteraick to be the better of this  why is it not your interest as well as mine said glossin besides i set you free this morning  you set me free donner and deyvil i set myself free besides it was all in the way of your profession and happened a long time ago ha ha ha  pshaw pshaw dont let us jest i am not against making a handsome compliment but its your affair as well as mine  what do you talk of my affair is it not you that keep the younkers whole estate from him dirk hatteraick never touched a stiver of his rents  hush hush i tell you it shall be a joint business  why will ye give me half the kitt  what half the estate dye mean we should set up house together at ellangowan and take the barony ridge about  sturmwetter no but you might give me half the valuehalf the gelt live with you nein i would have a lusthaus of mine own on the middleburgh dyke and a blumengarten like a burgomasters  ay and a wooden lion at the door and a painted sentinel in the garden with a pipe in his mouth but hark ye hatteraick what will all the tulips and flowergardens and pleasurehouses in the netherlands do for you if you are hanged here in scotland  hatteraicks countenance fell der deyvil hanged  ay hanged mein herr captain the devil can scarce save dirk hatteraick from being hanged for a murderer and kidnapper if the younker of ellangowan should settle in this country and if the gallant captain chances to be caught here reestablishing his fair trade and i wont say but as peace is now so much talked of their high mightinesses may not hand him over to oblige their new allies even if he remained in faderland  poz hagel blitzen and donner ii doubt you say true  not said glossin perceiving he had made the desired impression not that i am against being civil and he slid into hatteraicks passive hand a banknote of some value  is this all said the smuggler you had the price of half a cargo for winking at our job and made us do your business too  but my good friend you forget in this case you will recover all your own goods  ay at the risk of all our own necks we could do that without you  i doubt that captain hatteraick said glossin drily because you would probably find adozenredcoats at the customhouse whom it must be my business if we agree about this matter to have removed come come i will be as liberal as i can but you should have a conscience  now strafe mich der deyfel this provokes me more than all the rest you rob and you murder and you want me to rob and murder and play the silvercooper or kidnapper as you call it a dozen times over and then hagel and windsturm you speak to me of conscience can you think of no fairer way of getting rid of this unlucky lad  no mein herr but as i commit him to your charge  to my charge to the charge of steel and gunpowder andwell if it must be it must but you have a tolerably good guess whats like to come of it  o my dear friend i trust no degree of severity will be necessary replied glossin  severity said the fellow with a kind of groan i wish you had had my dreams when i first came to this doghole and tried to sleep among the dry seaweed first there was that dd fellow there with his broken back sprawling as he did when i hurled the rock over atop on him ha ha you would have sworn he was lying on the floor where you stand wriggling like a crushed frog and then  nay my friend said glossin interrupting him what signifies going over this nonsense if you are turned chickenhearted why the games up thats all the games up with us both  chickenhearted no i have not lived so long upon the account to start at last neither for devil nor dutchman  well then take another schnaps the colds at your heart still and now tell me are any of your old crew with you  nein all dead shot hanged drowned and damned brown was the last all dead but gipsy gab and he would go off the country for a spill of money or hell be quiet for his own sake or old meg his aunt will keep him quiet for hers  which meg  meg merrilies the old devils limb of a gipsy witch  is she still alive  yaw  and in this country  and in this country she was at the kaim of derncleugh at vanbeest browns last wake as they call it the other night with two of my people and some of her own blasted gipsies  thats another breaker ahead captain will she not squeak think ye  not she she wont start she swore by the salmon footnote the great and invoidable oath of the strolling tribes if we did the kinchin no harm she would never tell how the gauger got it why man though i gave her a wipe with my hanger in the heat of the matter and cut her arm and though she was so long after in trouble about it up at your boroughtown there der deyvil old meg was as true as steel  why thats true as you say replied glossin and yet if she could be carried over to zealand or hamburgh ororanywhere else you know it were as well  hatteraick jumped upright upon his feet and looked at glossin from head to heel i dont see the goats foot he said and yet he must be the very deyvil but meg merrilies is closer yet with the kobold than you are ay and i had never such weather as after having drawn her blood nein nein i ll meddle with her no more shes a witch of the fiend a real deyvils kindbut thats her affair donner and wetter ill neither make nor meddle thats her work but for the restwhy if i thought the trade would not suffer i would soon rid you of the younker if you send me word when hes under embargo  in brief and under tones the two worthy associates concerted their enterprise and agreed at which of his haunts hatteraick should be heard of the stay of his lugger on the coast was not difficult as there were no kings vessels there at the time       chapter vi      you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil      bids you because we come to do you service you think we are      ruffians            othello   when glossin returned home he found among other letters and papers sent to him one of considerable importance it was signed by mr protocol an attorney in edinburgh and addressing him as the agent for godfrey bertram esq late of ellangowan and his representatives acquainted him with the sudden death of mrs margaret bertram of singleside requesting him to inform his clients thereof in case they should judge it proper to have any person present for their interest at opening the repositories of the deceased mr glossin perceived at once that the letterwriter was unacquainted with the breach which had taken place between him and his late patron the estate of the deceased lady should by rights as he well knew descend to lucy bertram but it was a thousand to one that the caprice of the old lady might have altered its destination after running over contingencies and probabilities in his fertile mind to ascertain what sort of personal advantage might accrue to him from this incident he could not perceive any mode of availing himself of it except in so far as it might go to assist his plan of recovering or rather creating a character the want of which he had already experienced and was likely to feel yet more deeply i must place myself he thought on strong ground that if anything goes wrong with dirk hatteraicks project i may have prepossessions in my favour at least besides to do glossin justice bad as he was he might feel some desire to compensate to miss bertram in a small degree and in a case in which his own interest did not interfere with hers the infinite mischief which he had occasioned to her family he therefore resolved early the next morning to ride over to woodbourne  it was not without hesitation that he took this step having the natural reluctance to face colonel mannering which fraud and villainy have to encounter honour and probity but he had great confidence in his own savoir faire his talents were naturally acute and by no means confined to the line of his profession he had at different times resided a good deal in england and his address was free both from country rusticity and professional pedantry so that he had considerable powers both of address and persuasion joined to an unshaken effrontery which he affected to disguise under plainness of manner confident therefore in himself he appeared at woodbourne about ten in the morning and was admitted as a gentleman come to wait upon miss bertram  he did not announce himself until he was at the door of the breakfastparlour when the servant by his desire said aloudmr glossin to wait upon miss bertram lucy remembering the last scene of her fathers existence turned as pale as death and had wellnigh fallen from her chair julia mannering flew to her assistance and they left the room together there remained colonel mannering charles hazlewood with his arm in a sling and the dominie whose gaunt visage and walleyes assumed a most hostile aspect on recognising glossin  that honest gentleman though somewhat abashed by the effect of his first introduction advanced with confidence and hoped he did not intrude upon the ladies colonel mannering in a very upright and stately manner observed that he did not know to what he was to impute the honour of a visit from mr glossin  hem hem i took the liberty to wait upon miss bertram colonel mannering on account of a matter of business  if it can be communicated to mr macmorlan her agent sir i believe it will be more agreeable to miss bertram  i beg pardon colonel mannering said glossin making a wretched attempt at an easy demeanour you are a man of the world there are some cases in which it is most prudent for all parties to treat with principals  then replied mannering with a repulsive air if mr glossin will take the trouble to state his object in a letter i will answer that miss bertram pays proper attention to it  certainly stammered glossin but there are cases in which a viva voce conferencehem i perceivei knowcolonel mannering has adopted some prejudices which may make my visit appear intrusive but i submit to his good sense whether he ought to exclude me from a hearing without knowing the purpose of my visit or of how much consequence it may be to the young lady whom he honours with his protection  certainly sir i have not the least intention to do so replied the colonel i will learn miss bertrams pleasure on the subject and acquaint mr glossin if he can spare time to wait for her answer so saying he left the room  glossin had still remained standing in the midst of the apartment colonel mannering had made not the slightest motion to invite him to sit and indeed had remained standing himself during their short interview when he left the room however glossin seized upon a chair and threw himself into it with an air between embarrassment and effrontery he felt the silence of his companions disconcerting and oppressive and resolved to interrupt it  a fine day mr sampson  the dominie answered with something between an acquiescent grunt and an indignant groan  you never come down to see your old acquaintance on the ellangowan property mr sampson you would find most of the old stagers still stationary there i have too much respect for the late family to disturb old residenters even under pretence of improvement besides its not my way i dont like it i believe mr sampson scripture particularly condemns those who oppress the poor and remove landmarks  or who devour the substance of orphans subjoined the dominie anathema maranatha so saying he rose shouldered the folio which he had been perusing faced to the right about and marched out of the room with the strides of a grenadier  mr glossin no way disconcerted or at least feeling it necessary not to appear so turned to young hazlewood who was apparently busy with the newspaper any news sir hazlewood raised his eyes looked at him and pushed the paper towards him as if to a stranger in a coffeehouse then rose and was about to leave the room i beg pardon mr hazlewood but i cant help wishing you joy of getting so easily over that infernal accident this was answered by a sort of inclination of the head as slight and stiff as could well be imagined yet it encouraged our man of law to proceed i can promise you mr hazlewood few people have taken the interest in that matter which i have done both for the sake of the country and on account of my particular respect for your family which has so high a stake in it indeed so very high a stake that as mr featherhead is turning old now and as theres a talk since his last stroke of his taking the chiltern hundreds it might be worth your while to look about you i speak as a friend mr hazlewood and as one who understands the roll and if in going over it together  i beg pardon sir but i have no views in which your assistance could be useful  o very well perhaps you are right its quite time enough and i love to see a young gentleman cautious but i was talking of your wound i think i have got a clue to that businessi think i have and if i dont bring the fellow to condign punishment  i beg your pardon sir once more but your zeal outruns my wishes i have every reason to think the wound was accidental certainly it was not premeditated against ingratitude and premeditated treachery should you find any one guilty of them my resentment will be as warm as your own this was hazlewoods answer  another rebuff thought glossin i must try him upon the other tack right sir very nobly said i would have no more mercy on an ungrateful man than i would on a woodcock and now we talk of sport this was a sort of diverting of the conversation which glossin had learned from his former patron i see you often carry a gun and i hope you will be soon able to take the field again i observe you confine yourself always to your own side of the hazleshaws burn i hope my dear sir you will make no scruple of following your game to the ellangowan bank i believe it is rather the best exposure of the two for woodcocks although both are capital  as this offer only excited a cold and constrained bow glossin was obliged to remain silent and was presently afterwards somewhat relieved by the entrance of colonel mannering  i have detained you some time i fear sir said he addressing glossin i wished to prevail upon miss bertram to see you as in my opinion her objections ought to give way to the necessity of hearing in her own person what is stated to be of importance that she should know but i find that circumstances of recent occurrence and not easily to be forgotten have rendered her so utterly repugnant to a personal interview with mr glossin that it would be cruelty to insist upon it and she has deputed me to receive his commands or proposal or in short whatever he may wish to say to her  hem hem i am sorry siri am very sorry colonel mannering that miss bertram should supposethat any prejudice in shortor idea that anything on my part  sir said the inflexible colonel where no accusation is made excuses or explanations are unnecessary have you any objection to communicate to me as miss bertrams temporary guardian the circumstances which you conceive to interest her  none colonel mannering she could not choose a more respectable friend or one with whom i in particular would more anxiously wish to communicate frankly  have the goodness to speak to the point sir if you please  why sir it is not so easy all at oncebut mr hazlewood need not leave the roomi mean so well to miss bertram that i could wish the whole world to hear my part of the conference  my friend mr charles hazlewood will not probably be anxious mr glossin to listen to what cannot concern him and now when he has left us alone let me pray you to be short and explicit in what you have to say i am a soldier sir somewhat impatient of forms and introductions so saying he drew himself up in his chair and waited for mr glossins communication  be pleased to look at that letter said glossin putting protocols epistle into mannerings hand as the shortest way of stating his business  the colonel read it and returned it after pencilling the name of the writer in his memorandumbook this sir does not seem to require much discussion i will see that miss bertrams interest is attended to  but sirbut colonel mannering added glossin there is another matter which no one can explain but myself this ladythis mrs margaret bertram to my certain knowledge made a general settlement of her affairs in miss lucy bertrams favour while she lived with my old friend mr bertram at ellangowan the dominiethat was the name by which my deceased friend always called that very respectable man mr sampsonhe and i witnessed the deed and she had full power at that time to make such a settlement for she was in fee of the estate of singleside even then although it was life rented by an elder sister it was a whimsical settlement of old singlesides sir he pitted the two cats his daughters against each other ha ha ha  well sir said mannering without the slightest smile of sympathy but to the purpose you say that this lady had power to settle her estate on miss bertram and that she did so  even so colonel replied glossin i think i should understand the law i have followed it for many years and though i have given it up to retire upon a handsome competence i did not throw away that knowledge which is pronounced better than house and land and which i take to be the knowledge of the law since as our common rhyme has it      tis most excellent      to win the land thats gone and spent no no i love the smack of the whip i have a little a very little law yet at the service of my friends  glossin ran on in this manner thinking he had made a favourable impression on mannering the colonel indeed reflected that this might be a most important crisis for miss bertrams interest and resolved that his strong inclination to throw glossin out at window or at door should not interfere with it he put a strong curb on his temper and resolved to listen with patience at least if without complacency he therefore let mr glossin get to the end of his selfcongratulations and then asked him if he knew where the deed was  i knowthat is i thinki believe i can recover it in such cases custodiers have sometimes made a charge  we wont differ as to that sir said the colonel taking out his pocketbook  but my dear sir you take me so very short i said some persons might make such a claim i mean for payment of the expenses of the deed trouble in the affair etc but i for my own part only wish miss bertram and her friends to be satisfied that i am acting towards her with honour theres the paper sir it would have been a satisfaction to me to have delivered it into miss bertrams own hands and to have wished her joy of the prospects which it opens but since her prejudices on the subject are invincible it only remains for me to transmit her my best wishes through you colonel mannering and to express that i shall willingly give my testimony in support of that deed when i shall be called upon i have the honour to wish you a good morning sir  this parting speech was so well got up and had so much the tone of conscious integrity unjustly suspected that even colonel mannering was staggered in his bad opinion he followed him two or three steps and took leave of him with more politeness though still cold and formal than he had paid during his visit glossin left the house half pleased with the impression he had made half mortified by the stern caution and proud reluctance with which he had been received colonel mannering might have had more politeness he said to himself it is not every man that can bring a good chance of 400 pounds a year to a penniless girl singleside must be up to 400 pounds a year now theres reilageganbeg gillifidget loverless liealone and the spinsters knowegood 400 pounds a year some people might have made their own of it in my place and yet to own the truth after much consideration i dont see how that is possible  glossin was no sooner mounted and gone than the colonel despatched a groom for mr macmorlan and putting the deed into his hand requested to know if it was likely to be available to his friend lucy bertram macmorlan perused it with eyes that sparkled with delight snapped his fingers repeatedly and at length exclaimed available its as tight as a glove naebody could make better wark than glossin when he didna let down a steek on purpose but his countenance falling the auld b that i should say so might alter at pleasure  ah and how shall we know whether she has done so  somebody must attend on miss bertrams part when the repositories of the deceased are opened  can you go said the colonel  i fear i cannot replied macmorlan i must attend a jury trial before our court  then i will go myself said the colonel ill set out tomorrow sampson shall go with me he is witness to this settlement but i shall want a legal adviser  the gentleman that was lately sheriff of this county is high in reputation as a barrister i will give you a card of introduction to him  what i like about you mr macmorlan said the colonel is that you always come straight to the point let me have it instantly shall we tell miss lucy her chance of becoming an heiress  surely because you must have some powers from her which i will instantly draw out besides i will be caution for her prudence and that she will consider it only in the light of a chance  macmorlan judged well it could not be discerned from miss bertrams manner that she founded exulting hopes upon the prospect thus unexpectedly opening before her she did indeed in the course of the evening ask mr macmorlan as if by accident what might be the annual income of the hazlewood property but shall we therefore aver for certain that she was considering whether an heiress of four hundred a year might be a suitable match for the young laird       chapter vii      give me a cup of sack to make mine eyes look red for i must      speak in passion and i will do it in king cambyses vein            henry iv part i   mannering with sampson for his companion lost no time in his journey to edinburgh they travelled in the colonels postchariot who knowing his companions habits of abstraction did not choose to lose him out of his own sight far less to trust him on horseback where in all probability a knavish stableboy might with little address have contrived to mount him with his face to the tail accordingly with the aid of his valet who attended on horseback he contrived to bring mr sampson safe to an inn in edinburghfor hotels in those days there were nonewithout any other accident than arose from his straying twice upon the road on one occasion he was recovered by barnes who understood his humour when after engaging in close colloquy with the schoolmaster of moffat respecting a disputed quantity in horaces 7th ode book ii the dispute led on to another controversy concerning the exact meaning of the word malobathro in that lyric effusion his second escapade was made for the purpose of visiting the field of rullion green which was dear to his presbyterian predilections having got out of the carriage for an instant he saw the sepulchral monument of the slain at the distance of about a mile and was arrested by barnes in his progress up the pentland hills having on both occasions forgot his friend patron and fellowtraveller as completely as if he had been in the east indies on being reminded that colonel mannering was waiting for him he uttered his usual ejaculation of prodigious i was oblivious and then strode back to his post barnes was surprised at his masters patience on both occasions knowing by experience how little he brooked neglect or delay but the dominie was in every respect a privileged person his patron and he were never for a moment in each others way and it seemed obvious that they were formed to be companions through life if mannering wanted a particular book the dominie could bring it if he wished to have accounts summed up or checked his assistance was equally ready if he desired to recall a particular passage in the classics he could have recourse to the dominie as to a dictionary and all the while this walking statue was neither presuming when noticed nor sulky when left to himself to a proud shy reserved man and such in many respects was mannering this sort of living catalogue and animated automaton had all the advantages of a literary dumbwaiter  as soon as they arrived in edinburgh and were established at the george inn near bristo port then kept by old cockburn i love to be particular the colonel desired the waiter to procure him a guide to mr pleydells the advocate for whom he had a letter of introduction from mr macmorlan he then commanded barnes to have an eye to the dominie and walked forth with a chairman who was to usher him to the man of law  the period was near the end of the american war the desire of room of air and of decent accommodation had not as yet made very much progress in the capital of scotland some efforts had been made on the south side of the town towards building houses within themselves as they are emphatically termed and the new town on the north since so much extended was then just commenced but the great bulk of the better classes and particularly those connected with the law still lived in flats or dungeons of the old town the manners also of some of the veterans of the law had not admitted innovation one or two eminent lawyers still saw their clients in taverns as was the general custom fifty years before and although their habits were already considered as oldfashioned by the younger barristers yet the custom of mixing wine and revelry with serious business was still maintained by those senior counsellors who loved the old road either because it was such or because they had got too well used to it to travel any other among those praisers of the past time who with ostentatious obstinacy affected the manners of a former generation was this same paulus pleydell esq otherwise a good scholar an excellent lawyer and a worthy man  under the guidance of his trusty attendant colonel mannering after threading a dark lane or two reached the high street then clanging with the voices of oysterwomen and the bells of pyemen for it had as his guide assured him just chappit eight upon the tron it was long since mannering had been in the street of a crowded metropolis which with its noise and clamour its sounds of trade of revelry and of license its variety of lights and the eternally changing bustle of its hundred groups offers by night especially a spectacle which though composed of the most vulgar materials when they are separately considered has when they are combined a striking and powerful effect on the imagination the extraordinary height of the houses was marked by lights which glimmering irregularly along their front ascended so high among the attics that they seemed at length to twinkle in the middle sky this coup daeil which still subsists in a certain degree was then more imposing owing to the uninterrupted range of buildings on each side which broken only at the space where the north bridge joins the main street formed a superb and uniform place extending from the front of the luckenbooths to the head of the canongate and corresponding in breadth and length to the uncommon height of the buildings on either side  mannering had not much time to look and to admire his conductor hurried him across this striking scene and suddenly dived with him into a very steep paved lane turning to the right they entered a scale staircase as it is called the state of which so far as it could be judged of by one of his senses annoyed mannerings delicacy not a little when they had ascended cautiously to a considerable height they heard a heavy rap at a door still two stories above them the door opened and immediately ensued the sharp and worrying bark of a dog the squalling of a woman the screams of an assaulted cat and the hoarse voice of a man who cried in a most imperative tone will ye mustard will ye down sir down  lord preserve us said the female voice an he had worried our cat mr pleydell would neer hae forgien me  aweel my doo the cats no a prin the waur so hes no in ye say  na mr pleydells neer in the house on saturday at een answered the female voice  and the morns sabbath too said the querist i dinna ken what will be done  by this time mannering appeared and found a tall strong countryman clad in a coat of pepperandsaltcoloured mixture with huge metal buttons a glazed hat and boots and a large horsewhip beneath his arm in colloquy with a slipshod damsel who had in one hand the lock of the door and in the other a pail of whiting or camstane as it is called mixed with watera circumstance which indicates saturday night in edinburgh  so mr pleydell is not at home my good girl said mannering  ay sir hes at hame but hes no in the house hes aye out on saturday at een  but my good girl i am a stranger and my business express will you tell me where i can find him  his honour said the chairman will be at clerihughs about this time hersell could hae telld ye that but she thought ye wanted to see his house  well then show me to this tavern i suppose he will see me as i come on business of some consequence  i dinna ken sir said the girl he disna like to be disturbed on saturdays wi business but hes aye civil to strangers  ill gang to the tavern too said our friend dinmont for i am a stranger also and on business een sic like  na said the handmaiden an he see the gentleman hell see the simple body too but lords sake dinna say it was me sent ye there  atweel i am a simple body thats true hinny but i am no come to steal ony o his skeel for naething said the farmer in his honest pride and strutted away downstairs followed by mannering and the cadie mannering could not help admiring the determined stride with which the stranger who preceded them divided the press shouldering from him by the mere weight and impetus of his motion both drunk and sober passengers hell be a teviotdale tup tat ane said the chairman tats for keeping ta crown o ta causeway tat gate he ll no gang far or he ll get somebody to bell ta cat wi him  his shrewd augury however was not fulfilled those who recoiled from the colossal weight of dinmont on looking up at his size and strength apparently judged him too heavy metal to be rashly encountered and suffered him to pursue his course unchallenged following in the wake of this firstrate mannering proceeded till the farmer made a pause and looking back to the chairman said im thinking this will be the close friend  ay ay replied donald tats ta close  dinmont descended confidently then turned into a dark alley then up a dark stair and then into an open door while he was whistling shrilly for the waiter as if he had been one of his collie dogs mannering looked round him and could hardly conceive how a gentleman of a liberal profession and good society should choose such a scene for social indulgence besides the miserable entrance the house itself seemed paltry and half ruinous the passage in which they stood had a window to the close which admitted a little light during the daytime and a villainous compound of smells at all times but more especially towards evening corresponding to this window was a borrowed light on the other side of the passage looking into the kitchen which had no direct communication with the free air but received in the daytime at second hand such straggling and obscure light as found its way from the lane through the window opposite at present the interior of the kitchen was visible by its own huge firesa sort of pandemonium where men and women half undressed were busied in baking broiling roasting oysters and preparing devils on the gridiron the mistress of the place with her shoes slipshod and her hair straggling like that of megaera from under a roundeared cap toiling scolding receiving orders giving them and obeying them all at once seemed the presiding enchantress of that gloomy and fiery region        loud and repeated bursts of laughter from different quarters of the house proved that her labours were acceptable and not unrewarded by a generous public with some difficulty a waiter was prevailed upon to show colonel mannering and dinmont the room where their friend learned in the law held his hebdomadal carousals the scene which it exhibited and particularly the attitude of the counsellor himself the principal figure therein struck his two clients with amazement  mr pleydell was a lively sharplooking gentleman with a professional shrewdness in his eye and generally speaking a professional formality in his manners but this like his threetailed wig and black coat he could slip off on a saturday evening when surrounded by a party of jolly companions and disposed for what he called his altitudes on the present occasion the revel had lasted since four oclock and at length under the direction of a venerable compotator who had shared the sports and festivity of three generations the frolicsome company had begun to practise the ancient and now forgotten pastime of high jinks this game was played in several different ways most frequently the dice were thrown by the company and those upon whom the lot fell were obliged to assume and maintain for a time a certain fictitious character or to repeat a certain number of fescennine verses in a particular order if they departed from the characters assigned or if their memory proved treacherous in the repetition they incurred forfeits which were either compounded for by swallowing an additional bumper or by paying a small sum towards the reckoning at this sport the jovial company were closely engaged when mannering entered the room  mr counsellor pleydell such as we have described him was enthroned as a monarch in an elbowchair placed on the diningtable his scratch wig on one side his head crowned with a bottleslider his eye leering with an expression betwixt fun and the effects of wine while his court around him resounded with such crambo scraps of verse as these  where is gerunto now and whats become of him geruntos drowned because he could not swim etc etc  such o themis were anciently the sports of thy scottish children dinmont was first in the room he stood aghast a moment and then exclaimed its him sure enough deil o the like o that ever i saw  at the sound of mr dinmont and colonel mannering wanting to speak to you sir pleydell turned his head and blushed a little when he saw the very genteel figure of the english stranger he was however of the opinion of falstaff out ye villains play out the play wisely judging it the better way to appear totally unconcerned where be our guards exclaimed this second justinian see ye not a stranger knight from foreign parts arrived at this our court of holyrood with our bold yeoman andrew dinmont who has succeeded to the keeping of our royal flocks within the forest of jedwood where thanks to our royal care in the administration of justice they feed as safe as if they were within the bounds of fife where be our heralds our pursuivants our lyon our marchmount our carrick and our snowdown let the strangers be placed at our board and regaled as beseemeth their quality and this our high holiday tomorrow we will hear their tidings  so please you my liege tomorrows sunday said one of the company  sunday is it then we will give no offence to the assembly of the kirk on monday shall be their audience  mannering who had stood at first uncertain whether to advance or retreat now resolved to enter for the moment into the whim of the scene though internally fretting at macmorlan for sending him to consult with a crackbrained humourist he therefore advanced with three profound congees and craved permission to lay his credentials at the feet of the scottish monarch in order to be perused at his best leisure the gravity with which he accommodated himself to the humour of the moment and the deep and humble inclination with which he at first declined and then accepted a seat presented by the master of the ceremonies procured him three rounds of applause  deil hae me if they arena a mad thegither said dinmont occupying with less ceremony a seat at the bottom of the table or else they hae taen yule before it comes and are gaun aguisarding  a large glass of claret was offered to mannering who drank it to the health of the reigning prince you are i presume to guess said the monarch that celebrated sir miles mannering so renowned in the french wars and may well pronounce to us if the wines of gascony lose their flavour in our more northern realm  mannering agreeably flattered by this allusion to the fame of his celebrated ancestor replied by professing himself only a distant relation of the preux chevalier and added that in his opinion the wine was superlatively good  its ower cauld for my stamach said dinmont setting down the glassempty however  we will correct that quality answered king paulus the first of the name we have not forgotten that the moist and humid air of our valley of liddel inclines to stronger potations seneschal let our faithful yeoman have a cup of brandy it will be more germain to the matter  and now said mannering since we have unwarily intruded upon your majesty at a moment of mirthful retirement be pleased to say when you will indulge a stranger with an audience on those affairs of weight which have brought him to your northern capital  the monarch opened macmorlans letter and running it hastily over exclaimed with his natural voice and manner lucy bertram of ellangowan poor dear lassie  a forfeit a forfeit exclaimed a dozen voices his majesty has forgot his kingly character  not a whit not a whit replied the king ill be judged by this courteous knight may not a monarch love a maid of low degree is not king cophetua and the beggarmaid an adjudged case in point  professional professional another forfeit exclaimed the tumultuary nobility  had not our royal predecessors continued the monarch exalting his sovereign voice to drown these disaffected clamourshad they not their jean logies their bessie carmichaels their oliphants their sandilands and their weirs and shall it be denied to us even to name a maiden whom we delight to honour nay then sink state and perish sovereignty for like a second charles v we will abdicate and seek in the private shades of life those pleasures which are denied to a throne  so saying he flung away his crown and sprung from his exalted station with more agility than could have been expected from his age ordered lights and a washhand basin and towel with a cup of green tea into another room and made a sign to mannering to accompany him in less than two minutes he washed his face and hands settled his wig in the glass and to mannerings great surprise looked quite a different man from the childish bacchanal he had seen a moment before  there are folks he said mr mannering before whom one should take care how they play the fool because they have either too much malice or too little wit as the poet says the best compliment i can pay colonel mannering is to show i am not ashamed to expose myself before him and truly i think it is a compliment i have not spared tonight on your goodnature but whats that great strong fellow wanting  dinmont who had pushed after mannering into the room began with a scrape with his foot and a scratch of his head in unison i am dandie dinmont sir of the charlies hopethe liddesdale lad yell mind me it was for me ye won yon grand plea  what plea you loggerhead said the lawyer dye think i can remember all the fools that come to plague me  lord sir it was the grand plea about the grazing o the langtae head said the farmer  well curse thee never mind give me the memorial and come to me on monday at ten replied the learned counsel  but sir i haena got ony distinct memorial  no memorial man said pleydell  na sir nae memorial answered dandie for your honour said before mr pleydell yell mind that ye liked best to hear us hillfolk tell our ain tale by word o mouth  beshrew my tongue that said so answered the counsellor it will cost my ears a dinning well say in two words what youve got to say you see the gentleman waits  ou sir if the gentleman likes he may play his ain spring first its a ane to dandie  now you looby said the lawyer cannot you conceive that your business can be nothing to colonel mannering but that he may not choose to have these great ears of thine regaled with his matters  aweel sir just as you and he like so ye see to my business said dandie not a whit disconcerted by the roughness of this reception were at the auld wark o the marches again jock o dawston cleugh and me ye see we march on the tap o touthoprigg after we pass the pomoragrains for the pomoragrains and slackenspool and bloodylaws they come in there and they belang to the peel but after ye pass pomoragrains at a muckle great saucerheaded cutlugged stane that they ca charlies chuckie there dawston cleugh and charlies hope they march now i say the march rins on the tap o the hill where the wind and water shears but jock o dawston cleugh again he contravenes that and says that it bauds down by the auld droveroad that gaes awa by the knot o the gate ower to keeldar ward and that makes an unco difference  and what difference does it make friend said pleydell how many sheep will it feed  ou no mony said dandie scratching his head its lying high and exposed it may feed a hog or aiblins twa in a good year  and for this grazing which may be worth about five shillings a year you are willing to throw away a hundred pound or two  na sir its no for the value of the grass replied dinmont its for justice  my good friend said pleydell justice like charity should begin at home do you justice to your wife and family and think no more about the matter  dinmont still lingered twisting his hat in his hand its no for that sir but i would like ill to be bragged wi him he threeps hell bring a score o witnesses and mair and im sure theres as mony will swear for me as for him folk that lived a their days upon the charlies hope and wadna like to see the land lose its right  zounds man if it be a point of honour said the lawyer why dont your landlords take it up  i dinna ken sir scratching his head again theres been nae electiondusts lately and the lairds are unco neighbourly and jock and me canna get them to yoke thegither about it a that we can say but if ye thought we might keep up the rent  no no that will never do said pleydell confound you why dont you take good cudgels and settle it  odd sir answered the farmer we tried that three times already thats twice on the land and ance at lockerby fair but i dinna ken were baith gey good at singlestick and it couldna weel be judged  then take broadswords and be dd to you as your fathers did before you said the counsel learned in the law  aweel sir if ye think it wadna be again the law its a ane to dandie  hold hold exclaimed pleydell we shall have another lord soulis mistake prythee man comprehend me i wish you to consider how very trifling and foolish a lawsuit you wish to engage in  ay sir said dandie in a disappointed tone so ye winna take on wi me im doubting  me not i go home go home take a pint and agree dandie looked but half contented and still remained stationary anything more my friend  only sir about the succession of this leddy thats dead auld miss margaret bertram o singleside  ay what about her said the counsellor rather surprised  ou we have nae connexion at a wi the bertrams said dandie they were grand folk by the like o us but jean liltup that was auld singlesides housekeeper and the mother of these twa young ladies that are ganethe last o thems dead at a ripe age i trowjean liltup came out o liddel water and she was as near our connexion as second cousin to my mothers halfsister she drew up wi singleside nae doubt when she was his housekeeper and it was a sair vex and grief to a her kith and kin but he acknowledged a marriage and satisfied the kirk and now i wad ken frae you if we hae not some claim by law  not the shadow of a claim  aweel were nae puirer said dandie but she may hae thought on us if she was minded to make a testament weel sir ive said my say ise een wish you goodnight and putting his hand in his pocket  no no my friend i never take fees on saturday nights or without a memorial away with you dandie and dandie made his reverence and departed accordingly       chapter viii      but this poor farce has neither truth nor art      to please the fancy or to touch the heart      dark but not awful dismal but yet mean      with anxious bustle moves the cumbrous scene      presents no objects tender or profound      but spreads its cold unmeaning gloom around            parish register   your majesty said mannering laughing has solemnised your abdication by an act of mercy and charity that fellow will scarce think of going to law  o you are quite wrong said the experienced lawyer the only difference is i have lost my client and my fee hell never rest till he finds somebody to encourage him to commit the folly he has predetermined no no i have only shown you another weakness of my character i always speak truth of a saturday night  and sometimes through the week i should think said mannering continuing the same tone  why yes as far as my vocation will permit i am as hamlet says indifferent honest when my clients and their solicitors do not make me the medium of conveying their doubledistilled lies to the bench but oportet vivere it is a sad thing and now to our business i am glad my old friend macmorlan has sent you to me he is an active honest and intelligent man long sheriffsubstitute of the county ofunder me and still holds the office he knows i have a regard for that unfortunate family of ellangowan and for poor lucy i have not seen her since she was twelve years old and she was then a sweet pretty girl under the management of a very silly father but my interest in her is of an early date i was called upon mr mannering being then sheriff of that county to investigate the particulars of a murder which had been committed near ellangowan the day on which this poor child was born and which by a strange combination that i was unhappily not able to trace involved the death or abstraction of her only brother a boy of about five years old no colonel i shall never forget the misery of the house of ellangowan that morning the father halfdistractedthe mother dead in premature travailthe helpless infant with scarce any one to attend it coming wawling and crying into this miserable world at such a moment of unutterable misery we lawyers are not of iron sir or of brass any more than you soldiers are of steel we are conversant with the crimes and distresses of civil society as you are with those that occur in a state of war and to do our duty in either case a little apathy is perhaps necessary but the devil take a soldier whose heart can be as hard as his sword and his dam catch the lawyer who bronzes his bosom instead of his forehead but come i am losing my saturday at een will you have the kindness to trust me with these papers which relate to miss bertrams business and staytomorrow youll take a bachelors dinner with an old lawyeri insist upon itat three precisely and come an hour sooner the old lady is to be buried on monday it is the orphans cause and well borrow an hour from the sunday to talk over this business although i fear nothing can be done if she has altered her settlement unless perhaps it occurs within the sixty days and then if miss bertram can show that she possesses the character of heiratlaw whybut hark my lieges are impatient of their interregnum i do not invite you to rejoin us colonel it would be a trespass on your complaisance unless you had begun the day with us and gradually glided on from wisdom to mirth and from mirth tototoextravagance goodnight harry go home with mr mannering to his lodging colonel i expect you at a little past two tomorrow  the colonel returned to his inn equally surprised at the childish frolics in which he had found his learned counsellor engaged at the candour and sound sense which he had in a moment summoned up to meet the exigencies of his profession and at the tone of feeling which he displayed when he spoke of the friendless orphan  in the morning while the colonel and his most quiet and silent of all retainers dominie sampson were finishing the breakfast which barnes had made and poured out after the dominie had scalded himself in the attempt mr pleydell was suddenly ushered in a nicely dressed bobwig upon every hair of which a zealous and careful barber had bestowed its proper allowance of powder a wellbrushed black suit with very clean shoes and gold buckles and stockbuckle a manner rather reserved and formal than intrusive but withal showing only the formality of manner by no means that of awkwardness a countenance the expressive and somewhat comic features of which were in complete reposeall showed a being perfectly different from the choice spirit of the evening before a glance of shrewd and piercing fire in his eye was the only marked expression which recalled the man of saturday at een  i am come said he with a very polite address to use my regal authority in your behalf in spirituals as well as temporals can i accompany you to the presbyterian kirk or episcopal meetinghouse tros tyriusve a lawyer you know is of both religions or rather i should say of both formsor can i assist in passing the forenoon otherwise youll excuse my oldfashioned importunity i was born in a time when a scotchman was thought inhospitable if he left a guest alone a moment except when he slept but i trust you will tell me at once if i intrude  not at all my dear sir answered colonel mannering i am delighted to put myself under your pilotage i should wish much to hear some of your scottish preachers whose talents have done such honour to your countryyour blair your robertson or your henry and i embrace your kind offer with all my heart only drawing the lawyer a little aside and turning his eye towards sampson my worthy friend there in the reverie is a little helpless and abstracted and my servant barnes who is his pilot in ordinary cannot well assist him here especially as he has expressed his determination of going to some of your darker and more remote places of worship  the lawyers eye glanced at dominie sampson a curiosity worth preserving and ill find you a fit custodier here you sir to the waiter go to luckie finlaysons in the cowgate for miles macfin the cadie hell be there about this time and tell him i wish to speak to him  the person wanted soon arrived i will commit your friend to this mans charge said pleydell hell attend him or conduct him wherever he chooses to go with a happy indifference as to kirk or market meeting or court of justice or any other place whatever and bring him safe home at whatever hour you appoint so that mr barnes there may be left to the freedom of his own will  this was easily arranged and the colonel committed the dominie to the charge of this man while they should remain in edinburgh  and now sir if you please we shall go to the greyfriars church to hear our historian of scotland of the continent and of america  they were disappointed he did not preach that morning never mind said the counsellor have a moments patience and we shall do very well  the colleague of dr robertson ascended the pulpit footnote this was the celebrated doctor erskine a distinguished clergyman and a most excellent man his external appearance was not prepossessing a remarkably fair complexion strangely contrasted with a black wig without a grain of powder a narrow chest and a stooping posture hands which placed like props on either side of the pulpit seemed necessary rather to support the person than to assist the gesticulation of the preacher no gown not even that of geneva a tumbled band and a gesture which seemed scarce voluntary were the first circumstances which struck a stranger the preacher seems a very ungainly person whispered mannering to his new friend  never fear hes the son of an excellent scottish lawyer footnote the father of doctor erskine was an eminent lawyer and his institutes of the law of scotland are to this day the textbook of students of that science hell show blood ill warrant him  the learned counsellor predicted truly a lecture was delivered fraught with new striking and entertaining views of scripture history a sermon in which the calvinism of the kirk of scotland was ably supported yet made the basis of a sound system of practical morals which should neither shelter the sinner under the cloak of speculative faith or of peculiarity of opinion nor leave him loose to the waves of unbelief and schism something there was of an antiquated turn of argument and metaphor but it only served to give zest and peculiarity to the style of elocution the sermon was not read a scrap of paper containing the heads of the discourse was occasionally referred to and the enunciation which at first seemed imperfect and embarrassed became as the preacher warmed in his progress animated and distinct and although the discourse could not be quoted as a correct specimen of pulpit eloquence yet mannering had seldom heard so much learning metaphysical acuteness and energy of argument brought into the service of christianity  such he said going out of the church must have been the preachers to whose unfearing minds and acute though sometimes rudely exercised talents we owe the reformation  and yet that reverend gentleman said pleydell whom i love for his fathers sake and his own has nothing of the sour or pharisaical pride which has been imputed to some of the early fathers of the calvinistic kirk of scotland his colleague and he differ and head different parties in the kirk about particular points of church discipline but without for a moment losing personal regard or respect for each other or suffering malignity to interfere in an opposition steady constant and apparently conscientious on both sides  and you mr pleydell what do you think of their points of difference  why i hope colonel a plain man may go to heaven without thinking about them at all besides inter nos i am a member of the suffering and episcopal church of scotlandthe shadow of a shade now and fortunately so but i love to pray where my fathers prayed before me without thinking worse of the presbyterian forms because they do not affect me with the same associations and with this remark they parted until dinnertime  from the awkward access to the lawyers mansion mannering was induced to form very moderate expectations of the entertainment which he was to receive the approach looked even more dismal by daylight than on the preceding evening the houses on each side of the lane were so close that the neighbours might have shaken hands with each other from the different sides and occasionally the space between was traversed by wooden galleries and thus entirely closed up the stair the scalestair was not well cleaned and on entering the house mannering was struck with the narrowness and meanness of the wainscotted passage but the library into which he was shown by an elderly respectablelooking manservant was a complete contrast to these unpromising appearances it was a wellproportioned room hung with a portrait or two of scottish characters of eminence by jamieson the caledonian vandyke and surrounded with books the best editions of the best authors and in particular an admirable collection of classics  these said pleydell are my tools of trade a lawyer without history or literature is a mechanic a mere working mason if he possesses some knowledge of these he may venture to call himself an architect  but mannering was chiefly delighted with the view from the windows which commanded that incomparable prospect of the ground between edinburgh and the seathe firth of forth with its islands the embayment which is terminated by the law of north berwick and the varied shores of fife to the northward indenting with a hilly outline the clear blue horizon  when mr pleydell had sufficiently enjoyed the surprise of his guest he called his attention to miss bertrams affairs i was in hopes he said though but faint to have discovered some means of ascertaining her indefeasible right to this property of singleside but my researches have been in vain the old lady was certainly absolute fiar and might dispose of it in full right of property all that we have to hope is that the devil may not have tempted her to alter this very proper settlement you must attend the old girls funeral tomorrow to which you will receive an invitation for i have acquainted her agent with your being here on miss bertrams part and i will meet you afterwards at the house she inhabited and be present to see fair play at the opening of the settlement the old cat had a little girl the orphan of some relation who lived with her as a kind of slavish companion i hope she has had the conscience to make her independent in consideration of the peine forte et dure to which she subjected her during her lifetime  three gentlemen now appeared and were introduced to the stranger they were men of good sense gaiety and general information so that the day passed very pleasantly over and colonel mannering assisted about eight oclock at night in discussing the landlords bottle which was of course a magnum upon his return to the inn he found a card inviting him to the funeral of miss margaret bertram late of singleside which was to proceed from her own house to the place of interment in the greyfriars churchyard at one oclock afternoon  at the appointed hour mannering went to a small house in the suburbs to the southward of the city where he found the place of mourning indicated as usual in scotland by two rueful figures with long black cloaks white crapes and hatbands holding in their hands poles adorned with melancholy streamers of the same description by two other mutes who from their visages seemed suffering under the pressure of some strange calamity he was ushered into the diningparlour of the defunct where the company were assembled for the funeral  in scotland the custom now disused in england of inviting the relations of the deceased to the interment is universally retained on many occasions this has a singular and striking effect but it degenerates into mere empty form and grimace in cases where the defunct has had the misfortune to live unbeloved and die unlamented the english service for the dead one of the most beautiful and impressive parts of the ritual of the church would have in such cases the effect of fixing the attention and uniting the thoughts and feelings of the audience present in an exercise of devotion so peculiarly adapted to such an occasion but according to the scottish custom if there be not real feeling among the assistants there is nothing to supply the deficiency and exalt or rouse the attention so that a sense of tedious form and almost hypocritical restraint is too apt to pervade the company assembled for the mournful solemnity mrs margaret bertram was unluckily one of those whose good qualities had attached no general friendship she had no near relations who might have mourned from natural affection and therefore her funeral exhibited merely the exterior trappings of sorrow  mannering therefore stood among this lugubrious company of cousins in the third fourth fifth and sixth degree composing his countenance to the decent solemnity of all who were around him and looking as much concerned on mrs margaret bertrams account as if the deceased lady of singleside had been his own sister or mother after a deep and awful pause the company began to talk aside under their breaths however and as if in the chamber of a dying person  our poor friend said one grave gentleman scarcely opening his mouth for fear of deranging the necessary solemnity of his features and sliding his whisper from between his lips which were as little unclosed as possibleour poor friend has died well to pass in the world  nae doubt answered the person addressed with halfclosed eyes poor mrs margaret was aye careful of the gear  any news today colonel mannering said one of the gentlemen whom he had dined with the day before but in a tone which might for its impressive gravity have communicated the death of his whole generation  nothing particular i believe sir said mannering in the cadence which was he observed appropriated to the house of mourning  i understand continued the first speaker emphatically and with the air of one who is well informedi understand there is a settlement  and what does little jenny gibson get  a hundred and the auld repeater  thats but sma gear puir thing she had a sair time ot with the auld leddy but its ill waiting for dead folks shoon  i am afraid said the politician who was close by mannering we have not done with your old friend tippoo sahib yet i doubt hell give the company more plague and i am told but youll know for certain that east india stock is not rising  i trust it will sir soon  mrs margaret said another person mingling in the conversation had some india bonds i know that for i drew the interest for her it would be desirable now for the trustees and legatees to have the colonels advice about the time and mode of converting them into money for my part i thinkbut theres mr mortcloke to tell us they are gaun to lift  mr mortcloke the undertaker did accordingly with a visage of professional length and most grievous solemnity distribute among the pallbearers little cards assigning their respective situations in attendance upon the coffin as this precedence is supposed to be regulated by propinquity to the defunct the undertaker however skilful a master of these lugubrious ceremonies did not escape giving some offence to be related to mrs bertram was to be of kin to the lands of singleside and was a propinquity of which each relative present at that moment was particularly jealous some murmurs there were on the occasion and our friend dinmont gave more open offence being unable either to repress his discontent or to utter it in the key properly modulated to the solemnity i think ye might hae at least gien me a leg o her to carry he exclaimed in a voice considerably louder than propriety admitted god an it hadna been for the rigs o land i would hae gotten her a to carry mysell for as mony gentles as are here  a score of frowning and reproving brows were bent upon the unappalled yeoman who having given vent to his displeasure stalked sturdily downstairs with the rest of the company totally disregarding the censures of those whom his remarks had scandalised  and then the funeral pomp set forth saulies with their batons and gumphions of tarnished white crape in honour of the wellpreserved maiden fame of mrs margaret bertram six starved horses themselves the very emblems of mortality well cloaked and plumed lugging along the hearse with its dismal emblazonry crept in slow state towards the place of interment preceded by jamie duff an idiot who with weepers and cravat made of white paper attended on every funeral and followed by six mourning coaches filled with the company many of these now gave more free loose to their tongues and discussed with unrestrained earnestness the amount of the succession and the probability of its destination the principal expectants however kept a prudent silence indeed ashamed to express hopes which might prove fallacious and the agent or man of business who alone knew exactly how matters stood maintained a countenance of mysterious importance as if determined to preserve the full interest of anxiety and suspense  at length they arrived at the churchyard gates and from thence amid the gaping of two or three dozen of idle women with infants in their arms and accompanied by some twenty children who ran gambolling and screaming alongside of the sable procession they finally arrived at the burialplace of the singleside family this was a square enclosure in the greyfriars churchyard guarded on one side by a veteran angel without a nose and having only one wing who had the merit of having maintained his post for a century while his comrade cherub who had stood sentinel on the corresponding pedestal lay a broken trunk among the hemlock burdock and nettles which grew in gigantic luxuriance around the walls of the mausoleum a mossgrown and broken inscription informed the reader that in the year 1650 captain andrew bertram first of singleside descended of the very ancient and honourable house of ellangowan had caused this monument to be erected for himself and his descendants a reasonable number of scythes and hourglasses and deaths heads and crossbones garnished the following sprig of sepulchral poetry to the memory of the founder of the mausoleum  nathaniels heart bezaleels hand if ever any had these boldly do i say had he who lieth in this bed  here then amid the deep black fat loam into which her ancestors were now resolved they deposited the body of mrs margaret bertram and like soldiers returning from a military funeral the nearest relations who might be interested in the settlements of the lady urged the dogcattle of the hackney coaches to all the speed of which they were capable in order to put an end to farther suspense on that interesting topic       chapter ix      die and endow a college or a cat            pope   there is a fable told by lucian that while a troop of monkeys well drilled by an intelligent manager were performing a tragedy with great applause the decorum of the whole scene was at once destroyed and the natural passions of the actors called forth into very indecent and active emulation by a wag who threw a handful of nuts upon the stage in like manner the approaching crisis stirred up among the expectants feelings of a nature very different from those of which under the superintendence of mr mortcloke they had but now been endeavouring to imitate the expression those eyes which were lately devoutly cast up to heaven or with greater humility bent solemnly upon earth were now sharply and alertly darting their glances through shuttles and trunks and drawers and cabinets and all the odd corners of an old maiden ladys repositories nor was their search without interest though they did not find the will of which they were in quest  here was a promissory note for 20 pounds by the minister of the nonjuring chapel interest marked as paid to martinmas last carefully folded up in a new set of words to the old tune of over the water to charlie there was a curious love correspondence between the deceased and a certain lieutenant okean of a marching regiment of foot and tied up with the letters was a document which at once explained to the relatives why a connexion that boded them little good had been suddenly broken off being the lieutenants bond for two hundred pounds upon which no interest whatever appeared to have been paid other bills and bonds to a larger amount and signed by better names i mean commercially than those of the worthy divine and gallant soldier also occurred in the course of their researches besides a hoard of coins of every size and denomination and scraps of broken gold and silver old earrings hinges of cracked snuffboxes mountings of spectacles etc etc etc still no will made its appearance and colonel mannering began full well to hope that the settlement which he had obtained from glossin contained the ultimate arrangement of the old ladys affairs but his friend pleydell who now came into the room cautioned him against entertaining this belief  i am well acquainted with the gentleman he said who is conducting the search and i guess from his manner that he knows something more of the matter than any of us  meantime while the search proceeds let us take a brief glance at one or two of the company who seem most interested  of dinmont who with his large huntingwhip under his arm stood poking his great round face over the shoulder of the homme daffaires it is unnecessary to say anything that thinlooking oldish person in a most correct and gentlemanlike suit of mourning is maccasquil formerly of drumquag who was ruined by having a legacy bequeathed to him of two shares in the ayr bank his hopes on the present occasion are founded on a very distant relationship upon his sitting in the same pew with the deceased every sunday and upon his playing at cribbage with her regularly on the saturday evenings taking great care never to come off a winner that other coarselooking man wearing his own greasy hair tied in a leathern cue more greasy still is a tobacconist a relation of mrs bertrams mother who having a good stock in trade when the colonial war broke out trebled the price of his commodity to all the world mrs bertram alone excepted whose tortoiseshell snuffbox was weekly filled with the best rappee at the old prices because the maid brought it to the shop with mrs bertrams respects to her cousin mr quid that young fellow who has not had the decency to put off his boots and buckskins might have stood as forward as most of them in the graces of the old lady who loved to look upon a comely young man but it is thought he has forfeited the moment of fortune by sometimes neglecting her teatable when solemnly invited sometimes appearing there when he had been dining with blyther company twice treading upon her cats tail and once affronting her parrot  to mannering the most interesting of the group was the poor girl who had been a sort of humble companion of the deceased as a subject upon whom she could at all times expectorate her bad humour she was for forms sake dragged into the room by the deceaseds favourite female attendant where shrinking into acorner as soon as possible she saw with wonder and affright the intrusive researches of the strangers amongst those recesses to which from childhood she had looked with awful veneration this girl was regarded with an unfavourable eye by all the competitors honest dinmont only excepted the rest conceived they should find in her a formidable competitor whose claims might at least encumber and diminish their chance of succession yet she was the only person present who seemed really to feel sorrow for the deceased mrs bertram had been her protectress although from selfish motives and her capricious tyranny was forgotten at the moment while the tears followed each other fast down the cheeks of her frightened and friendless dependent theres ower muckle saut water there drumquag said the tobacconist to the exproprietor to bode ither folk muckle gude folk seldom greet that gate but they ken what its for mr maccasquil only replied with a nod feeling the propriety of asserting his superior gentry in presence of mr pleydell and colonel mannering  very queer if there suld be nae will after a friend said dinmont who began to grow impatient to the man of business  a moments patience if you please she was a good and prudent woman mrs margaret bertrama good and prudent and welljudging woman and knew how to choose friends and depositaries she may have put her last will and testament or rather her mortis causa settlement as it relates to heritage into the hands of some safe friend  ill bet a rump and dozen said pleydell whispering to the colonel he has got it in his own pocket then addressing the man of law come sir well cut this short if you please here is a settlement of the estate of singleside executed several years ago in favour of miss lucy bertram of ellangowan the company stared fearfully wild you i presume mr protocol can inform us if there is a later deed  please to favour me mr pleydell and so saying he took the deed out of the learned counsels hand and glanced his eye over the contents  too cool said pleydell too cool by half he has another deed in his pocket still  why does he not show it then and be dd to him said the military gentleman whose patience began to wax threadbare  why how should i know answered the barrister why does a cat not kill a mouse when she takes him the consciousness of power and the love of teasing i suppose well mr protocol what say you to that deed  why mr pleydell the deed is a welldrawn deed properly authenticated and tested in forms of the statute  but recalled or superseded by another of posterior date in your possession eh said the counsellor  something of the sort i confess mr pleydell rejoined the man of business producing a bundle tied with tape and sealed at each fold and ligation with black wax that deed mr pleydell which you produce and found upon is dated 1st june 17 but this breaking the seals and unfolding the document slowly is dated the 20thno i see it is the 21stof april of this present year being ten years posterior  marry hang her brock said the counsellor borrowing an exclamation from sir toby belch just the month in which ellangowans distresses became generally public but let us hear what she has done  mr protocol accordingly having required silence began to read the settlement aloud in a slow steady businesslike tone the group around in whose eyes hope alternately awakened and faded and who were straining their apprehensions to get at the drift of the testators meaning through the mist of technical language in which the conveyance had involved it might have made a study for hogarth  the deed was of an unexpected nature it set forth with conveying and disponing all and whole the estate and lands of singleside and others with the lands of loverless liealone spinsters knowe and heaven knows what beside to and in favours of here the reader softened his voice to a gentle and modest piano peter protocol clerk to the signet having the fullest confidence in his capacity and integritythese are the very words which my worthy deceased friend insisted upon my insertingbut in trust always here the reader recovered his voice and style and the visages of several of the hearers which had attained a longitude that mr mortcloke might have envied were perceptibly shortenedin trust always and for the uses ends and purposes hereinafter mentioned  in these uses ends and purposes lay the cream of the affair the first was introduced by a preamble setting forth that the testatrix was lineally descended from the ancient house of ellangowan her respected greatgrandfather andrew bertram first of singleside of happy memory having been second son to allan bertram fifteenth baron of ellangowan it proceeded to state that henry bertram son and heir of godfrey bertram now of ellangowan had been stolen from his parents in infancy but that she the testatrix was well assured that he was yet alive in foreign parts and by the providence of heaven would be restored to the possessions of his ancestors in which case the said peter protocol was bound and obliged like as he bound and obliged himself by acceptance of these presents to denude himself of the said lands of singleside and others and of all the other effects thereby conveyed excepting always a proper gratification for his own trouble to and in favour of the said henry bertram upon his return to his native country and during the time of his residing in foreign parts or in case of his never again returning to scotland mr peter protocol the trustee was directed to distribute the rents of the land and interest of the other funds deducting always a proper gratification for his trouble in the premises in equal portions among four charitable establishments pointed out in the will the power of management of letting leases of raising and lending out money in short the full authority of a proprietor was vested in this confidential trustee and in the event of his death went to certain official persons named in the deed there were only two legacies one of a hundred pounds to a favourite waitingmaid another of the like sum to janet gibson whom the deed stated to have been supported by the charity of the testatrix for the purpose of binding her an apprentice to some honest trade  a settlement in mortmain is in scotland termed a mortification and in one great borough aberdeen if i remember rightly there is a municipal officer who takes care of these public endowments and is thence called the master of mortifications one would almost presume that the term had its origin in the effect which such settlements usually produce upon the kinsmen of those by whom they are executed heavy at least was the mortification which befell the audience who in the late mrs margaret bertrams parlour had listened to this unexpected destination of the lands of singleside there was a profound silence after the deed had been read over  mr pleydell was the first to speak he begged to look at the deed and having satisfied himself that it was correctly drawn and executed he returned it without any observation only saying aside to mannering protocol is not worse than other people i believe but this old lady has determined that if he do not turn rogue it shall not be for want of temptation  i really think said mr maccasquil of drumquag who having gulped down one half of his vexation determined to give vent to the resti really think this is an extraordinary case i should like now to know from mr protocol who being sole and unlimited trustee must have been consulted upon this occasioni should like i say to know how mrs bertram could possibly believe in the existence of a boy that a the world kens was murdered many a year since  really sir said mr protocol i do not conceive it is possible for me to explain her motives more than she has done herself our excellent deceased friend was a good woman sira pious womanand might have grounds for confidence in the boys safety which are not accessible to us sir  hout said the tobacconist i ken very weel what were her grounds for confidence theres mrs rebecca the maid sitting there has telld me a hundred times in my ain shop there was nae kenning how her leddy wad settle her affairs for an auld gipsy witch wife at gilsland had possessed her with a notion that the callantharry bertram cas she himwould come alive again some day after a yell no deny that mrs rebecca though i dare to say ye forgot to put your mistress in mind of what ye promised to say when i gied ye mony a halfcrown but yell no deny what i am saying now lass  i ken naething at a about it answered rebecca doggedly and looking straight forward with the firm countenance of one not disposed to be compelled to remember more than was agreeable to her  weel said rebecca yere satisfied wi your ain share ony way rejoined the tobacconist  the buck of the secondhead for a buck of the firsthead he was not had hitherto been slapping his boots with his switchwhip and looking like a spoiled child that has lost its supper his murmurs however were all vented inwardly or at most in a soliloquy such as thisi am sorry by gd i ever plagued myself about her i came here by gd one night to drink tea and i left king and the dukes rider will hack they were toasting a round of running horses by gd i might have got leave to wear the jacket as well as other folk if i had carried it on with them and she has not so much as left me that hundred  well make the payment of the note quite agreeable said mr protocol who had no wish to increase at that moment the odium attached to his office and now gentlemen i fancy we have no more to wait for here and i shall put the settlement of my excellent and worthy friend on record tomorrow that every gentleman may examine the contents and have free access to take an extract andhe proceeded to lock up the repositories of the deceased with more speed than he had opened themmrs rebecca yell be so kind as to keep all right here until we can let the house i had an offer from a tenant this morning if such a thing should be and if i was to have any management  our friend dinmont having had his hopes as well as another had hitherto sate sulky enough in the armchair formerly appropriated to the deceased and in which she would have been not a little scandalised to have seen this colossal specimen of the masculine gender lolling at length his employment had been rolling up into the form of a coiled snake the long lash of his horsewhip and then by a jerk causing it to unroll itself into the middle of the floor the first words he said when he had digested the shock contained a magnanimous declaration which he probably was not conscious of having uttered aloudweel bludes thicker than water shes welcome to the cheeses and the hams just the same but when the trustee had made the abovementioned motion for the mourners to depart and talked of the house being immediately let honest dinmont got upon his feet and stunned the company with this blunt question and whats to come o this poor lassie then jenny gibson sae mony ous as thought oursells sib to the family when the gear was parting we may do something for her amang us surely  this proposal seemed to dispose most of the assembly instantly to evacuate the premises although upon mr protocols motion they had lingered as if around the grave of their disappointed hopes drumquag said or rather muttered something of having a family of his own and took precedence in virtue of his gentle blood to depart as fast as possible the tobacconist sturdily stood forward and scouted the motiona little huzzie like that was weel eneugh provided for already and mr protocol at ony rate was the proper person to take direction of her as he had charge of her legacy and after uttering such his opinion in a steady and decisive tone of voice he also left the place the buck made a stupid and brutal attempt at a jest upon mrs bertrams recommendation that the poor girl should be taught some honest trade but encountered a scowl from colonel mannerings darkening eye to whom in his ignorance of the tone of good society he had looked for applause that made him ache to the very backbone he shuffled downstairs therefore as fast as possible  protocol who was really a good sort of man next expressed his intention to take a temporary charge of the young lady under protest always that his so doing should be considered as merely eleemosynary when dinmont at length got up and having shaken his huge dreadnought greatcoat as a newfoundland dog does his shaggy hide when he comes out of the water ejaculated weel deil hae me then if ye hae ony fash wi her mr protocol if she likes to gang hame wi me that is ye see ailie and me were weel to pass and we would like the lassies to hae a wee bit mair lair than oursells and to be neighbourlike that wad we and ye see jenny canna miss but to ken manners and the like o reading books and sewing seams having lived sae lang wi a grand lady like lady singleside or if she disna ken ony thing about it im jealous that our bairns will like her a the better and ill take care o the bits o claes and what spending siller she maun hae so the hundred pound may rin on in your hands mr protocol and ill be adding something tillt till shell maybe get a liddesdale joe that wants something to help to buy the hirsel what dye say to that hinny ill take out a ticket for ye in the fly to jethart od but ye maun take a powny after that oer the limestane rig deil a wheeled carriage ever gaed into liddesdale footnote see note i and ill be very glad if mrs rebecca comes wi you hinny and stays a month or twa while yere stranger like  while mrs rebecca was curtsying and endeavouring to make the poor orphan girl curtsy instead of crying and while dandie in his rough way was encouraging them both old pleydell had recourse to his snuffbox its meat and drink to me now colonel he said as he recovered himself to see a clown like this i must gratify him in his own way must assist him to ruin himself theres no help for it here you liddesdaledandiecharlies hopewhat do they call you  the farmer turned infinitely gratified even by this sort of notice for in his heart next to his own landlord he honoured a lawyer in high practice  so you will not be advised against trying that question about your marches  no no sir naebody likes to lose their right and to be laughed at down the haill water but since your honours no agreeable and is maybe a friend to the other side like we maun try some other advocate  there i told you so colonel mannering well sir if you must needs be a fool the business is to give you the luxury of a lawsuit at the least possible expense and to bring you off conqueror if possible let mr protocol send me your papers and i will advise him how to conduct your cause i dont see after all why you should not have your lawsuits too and your feuds in the court of session as well as your forefathers had their manslaughters and fireraisings  very natural to be sure sir we wad just take the auld gate as readily if it werena for the law and as the law binds us the law should loose us besides a mans aye the better thought o in our country for having been afore the feifteen  excellently argued my friend away with you and send your papers to me come colonel we have no more to do here  god well ding jock o dawston cleugh now after a said dinmont slapping his thigh in great exultation       chapter x           i am going to the parliament      you understand this bag if you have any business      depending there be short and let me hear it      and pay your fees            little french lawyer   shall you be able to carry this honest fellows cause for him said mannering  why i dont know the battle is not to the strong but he shall come off triumphant over jock of dawston if we can make it out i owe him something it is the pest of our profession that we seldom see the best side of human nature people come to us with every selfish feeling newly pointed and grinded they turn down the very caulkers of their animosities and prejudices as smiths do with horses shoes in a white frost many a man has come to my garret yonder that i have at first longed to pitch out at the window and yet at length have discovered that he was only doing as i might have done in his case being very angry and of course very unreasonable i have now satisfied myself that if our profession sees more of human folly and human roguery than others it is because we witness them acting in that channel in which they can most freely vent themselves in civilised society law is the chimney through which all that smoke discharges itself that used to circulate through the whole house and put every ones eyes out no wonder therefore that the vent itself should sometimes get a little sooty but we will take care our liddesdale mans cause is well conducted and well argued so all unnecessary expense will be saved he shall have his pineapple at wholesale price  will you do me the pleasure said mannering as they parted to dine with me at my lodgings my landlord says he has a bit of reddeer venison and some excellent wine  venison eh answered the counsellor alertly but presently addedbut no its impossible and i cant ask you home neither mondays a sacred day sos tuesday and wednesday we are to be heard in the great teind case in presence but stayits frosty weather and if you dont leave town and that venison would keep till thursday  you will dine with me that day  under certification  well then i will indulge a thought i had of spending a week here and if the venison will not keep why we will see what else our landlord can do for us  o the venison will keep said pleydell and now goodbye look at these two or three notes and deliver them if you like the addresses i wrote them for you this morning farewell my clerk has been waiting this hour to begin a dd information and away walked mr pleydell with great activity diving through closes and ascending covered stairs in order to attain the high street by an access which compared to the common route was what the straits of magellan are to the more open but circuitous passage round cape horn  on looking at the notes of introduction which pleydell had thrust into his hand mannering was gratified with seeing that they were addressed to some of the first literary characters of scotland to david hume esq  to john home esq to dr ferguson to dr black to lord kaimes to mr button to john clerk esq of eldin to adam smith esq to dr robertson  upon my word my legal friend has a good selection of acquaintances these are names pretty widely blown indeed an eastindian must rub up his facultiesa little and put his mind in order before he enters this sort of society  mannering gladly availed himself of these introductions and we regret deeply it is not in our power to give the reader an account of the pleasure and information which he received in admission to a circle never closed against strangers of sense and information and which has perhaps at no period been equalled considering the depth and variety of talent which it embraced and concentrated  upon the thursday appointed mr pleydell made his appearance at the inn where colonel mannering lodged the venison proved in high order the claret excellent and the learned counsel a professed amateur in the affairs of the table did distinguished honour to both i am uncertain however if even the good cheer gave him more satisfaction than the presence of dominie sampson from whom in his own juridical style of wit he contrived to extract great amusement both for himself and one or two friends whom the colonel regaled on the same occasion the grave and laconic simplicity of sampsons answers to the insidious questions of the barrister placed the bonhomie of his character in a more luminous point of view than mannering had yet seen it upon the same occasion he drew forth a strange quantity of miscellaneous and abstruse though generally speaking useless learning the lawyer afterwards compared his mind to the magazine of a pawnbroker stowed with goods of every description but so cumbrously piled together and in such total disorganisation that the owner can never lay his hands upon any one article at the moment he has occasion for it  as for the advocate himself he afforded at least as much exercise to sampson as he extracted amusement from him when the man of law began to get into his altitudes and his wit naturally shrewd and dry became more lively and poignant the dominie looked upon him with that sort of surprise with which we can conceive a tame bear might regard his future associate the monkey on their being first introduced to each other it was mr pleydells delight to state in grave and serious argument some position which he knew the dominie would be inclined to dispute he then beheld with exquisite pleasure the internal labour with which the honest man arranged his ideas for reply and tasked his inert and sluggish powers to bring up all the heavy artillery of his learning for demolishing the schismatic or heretical opinion which had been stated when behold before the ordnance could be discharged the foe had quitted the post and appeared in a new position of annoyance on the dominies flank or rear often did he exclaim prodigious when marching up to the enemy in full confidence of victory he found the field evacuated and it may be supposed that it cost him no little labour to attempt a new formation he was like a native indian army the colonel said formidable by numerical strength and size of ordnance but liable to be thrown into irreparable confusion by a movement to take them in flank on the whole however the dominie though somewhat fatigued with these mental exertions made at unusual speed and upon the pressure of the moment reckoned this one of the white days of his life and always mentioned mr pleydell as a very erudite and facetious person  by degrees the rest of the party dropped off and left these three gentlemen together their conversation turned to mrs bertrams settlements now what could drive it into the noddle of that old harridan said pleydell to disinherit poor lucy bertram under pretence of settling her property on a boy who has been so long dead and gone i ask your pardon mr sampson i forgot what an affecting case this was for you i remember taking your examination upon it and i never had so much trouble to make any one speak three words consecutively you may talk of your pythagoreans or your silent brahmins colonel go to i tell you this learned gentleman beats them all in taciturnity but the words of the wise are precious and not to be thrown away lightly  of a surety said the dominie taking his bluechecqued handkerchief from his eyes that was a bitter day with me indeed ay and a day of grief hard to be borne but he giveth strength who layeth on the load  colonel mannering took this opportunity to request mr pleydell to inform him of the particulars attending the loss of the boy and the counsellor who was fond of talking upon subjects of criminal jurisprudence especially when connected with his own experience went through the circumstances at full length and what is your opinion upon the result of the whole  o that kennedy was murdered its an old case which has occurred on that coast before now the case of smuggler versus exciseman  what then is your conjecture concerning the fate of the child  o murdered too doubtless answered pleydell he was old enough to tell what he had seen and these ruthless scoundrels would not scruple committing a second bethlehem massacre if they thought their interest required it  the dominie groaned deeply and ejaculated enormous  yet there was mention of gipsies in the business too counsellor said mannering and from what that vulgarlooking fellow said after the funeral  mrs margaret bertrams idea that the child was alive was founded upon the report of a gipsy said pleydell catching at the halfspoken hint i envy you the concatenation colonel it is a shame to me not to have drawn the same conclusion well follow this business up instantly here hark ye waiter go down to luckie woods in the cowgate yell find my clerk driver hell be set down to high jinks by this timefor we and our retainers colonel are exceedingly regular in our irregularitiestell him to come here instantly and i will pay his forfeits  he wont appear in character will he said mannering  ah no more of that hal an thou lovest me said pleydell but we must have some news from the land of egypt if possible o if i had but hold of the slightest thread of this complicated skein you should see how i would unravel it i would work the truth out of your bohemian as the french call them better than a monitoire or a plainte de tournelle i know how to manage a refractory witness  while mr pleydell was thus vaunting his knowledge of his profession the waiter reentered with mr driver his mouth still greasy with mutton pies and the froth of the last draught of twopenny yet unsubsided on his upper lip with such speed had he obeyed the commands of his principal driver you must go instantly and find out the woman who was old mrs margaret bertrams maid inquire for her everywhere but if you find it necessary to have recourse to protocol quid the tobacconist or any other of these folks you will take care not to appear yourself but send some woman of your acquaintance i daresay you know enough that may be so condescending as to oblige you when you have found her out engage her to come to my chambers tomorrow at eight oclock precisely  what shall i say to make her forthcoming asked the aiddecamp  anything you choose replied the lawyer is it my business to make lies for you do you think but let her be in praesentia by eight oclock as i have said before the clerk grinned made his reverence and exit  thats a useful fellow said the counsellor i dont believe his match ever carried a process hell write to my dictating three nights in the week without sleep or whats the same thing he writes as well and correctly when hes asleep as when hes awake then hes such a steady fellow some of them are always changing their alehouses so that they have twenty cadies sweating after them like the bareheaded captains traversing the taverns of eastcheap in search of sir john falstaff but this is a complete fixture he has his winter seat by the fire and his summer seat by the window in luckie woods betwixt which seats are his only migrations there hes to be found at all times when he is off duty it is my opinion he never puts off his clothes or goes to sleep sheer ale supports him under everything it is meat drink and cloth bed board and washing  and is he always fit for duty upon a sudden turnout i should distrust it considering his quarters  o drink never disturbs him colonel he can write for hours after he cannot speak i remember being called suddenly to draw an appeal case i had been dining and it was saturday night and i had ill will to begin to it however they got me down to clerihughs and there we sat birling till i had a fair tappit hen footnote see note 2 under my belt and then they persuaded me to draw the paper then we had to seek driver and it was all that two men could do to bear him in for when found he was as it happened both motionless and speechless but no sooner was his pen put between his fingers his paper stretched before him and he heard my voice than he began to write like a scrivener and excepting that we were obliged to have somebody to dip his pen in the ink for he could not see the standish i never saw a thing scrolled more handsomely  but how did your joint production look the next morning said the colonel  wheugh capital not three words required to be altered footnote see note 3  it was sent off by that days post but youll come and breakfast with me tomorrow and hear this womans examination  why your hour is rather early  cant make it later if i were not on the boards of the outer house precisely as the ninehours bell rings there would be a report that i had got an apoplexy and i should feel the effects of it all the rest of the session  well i will make an exertion to wait upon you  here the company broke up for the evening  in the morning colonel mannering appeared at the counsellors chambers although cursing the raw air of a scottish morning in december mr pleydell had got mrs rebecca installed on one side of his fire accommodated her with a cup of chocolate and was already deeply engaged in conversation with her o no i assure you mrs rebecca there is no intention to challenge your mistresss will and i give you my word of honour that your legacy is quite safe you have deserved it by your conduct to your mistress and i wish it had been twice as much  why to be sure sir its no right to mention what is said before ane ye heard how that dirty body quid cast up to me the bits o compliments he gied me and telld ower again ony loose cracks i might hae had wi him now if ane was talking loosely to your honour theres nae saying what might come ot  i assure you my good rebecca my character and your own age and appearance are your security if you should talk as loosely as an amatory poet  aweel if your honour thinks i am safethe story is just this ye see about a year ago or no just sae lang my leddy was advised to go to gilsland for a while for her spirits were distressing her sair ellangowans troubles began to be spoken o publicly and sair vexed she was for she was proud o her family for ellangowan himsell and her they sometimes greed and some times no but at last they didna gree at a for twa or three year for he was aye wanting to borrow siller and that was what she couldna bide at no hand and she was aye wanting it paid back again and that the laird he liked as little so at last they were clean aff thegither and then some of the company at gilsland tells her that the estate was to be selld and ye wad hae thought she had taen an ill will at miss lucy bertram frae that moment for mony a time she cried to me o becky o becky if that useless peenging thing o a lassie there at ellangowan that canna keep her neerdoweel father within boundsif she had been but a ladbairn they couldna hae selld the auld inheritance for that foolbodys debts and she would rin on that way till i was just wearied and sick to hear her ban the puir lassie as if she wadna hae been a ladbairn and keepit the land if it had been in her will to change her sect and ae day at the spawwell below the craig at gilsland she was seeing a very bonny family o bairnsthey belanged to ane maccroskyand she broke outis not it an odd like thing that ilka waf carle in the country has a son and heir and that the house of ellangowan is without male succession there was a gipsy wife stood ahint and heard her a muckle sture fearsomelooking wife she was as ever i set een on wha is it says she that dare say the house of ellangowan will perish without male succession my mistress just turned on her she was a highspirited woman and aye ready wi an answer to a body its me that says it says she that may say it with a sad heart wi that the gipsy wife gripped till her handi ken you weel eneugh says she though ye kenna me but as sure as that suns in heaven and as sure as that waters rinning to the sea and as sure as theres an ee that sees and an ear that hears us baith harry bertram that was thought to perish at warroch point never did die there he was to have a weary weird ot till his aneandtwentieth year that was aye said o him but if ye live and i live yell hear mair o him this winter before the snaw lies twa days on the dun of singleside i want nane o your siller she said to make ye think i am blearing your ee fare ye weel till after martinmas and there she left us standing  was she a very tall woman interrupted mannering  had she black hair black eyes and a cut above the brow added the lawyer  she was the tallest woman i ever saw and her hair was as black as midnight unless where it was grey and she had a scar abune the brow that ye might hae laid the lith of your finger in naebody thats seen her will ever forget her and i am morally sure that it was on the ground o what that gipsywoman said that my mistress made her will having taen a dislike at the young leddy o ellangowan and she liked her far waur after she was obliged to send her l20 for she said miss bertram no content wi letting the ellangowan property pass into strange hands owing to her being a lass and no a lad was coming by her poverty to be a burden and a disgrace to singleside too but i hope my mistresss is a good will for a that for it would be hard on me to lose the wee bit legacy i served for little fee and bountith weel i wot  the counsellor relieved her fears on this head then inquired after jenny gibson and understood she had accepted mr dinmonts offer and i have done sae mysell too since he was sae discreet as to ask me said mrs rebecca they are very decent folk the dinmonts though my lady didna dow to hear muckle about the friends on that side the house but she liked the charlies hope hams and the cheeses and the muirfowl that they were aye sending and the lambswool hose and mittensshe liked them weel eneugh  mr pleydell now dismissed mrs rebecca when she was gone i think i know the gipsywoman said the lawyer  i was just going to say the same replied mannering  and her name said pleydell  is meg merrilies answered the colonel  are you avised of that said the counsellor looking at his military friend with a comic expression of surprise  mannering answered that he had known such a woman when he was at ellangowan upwards of twenty years before and then made his learned friend acquainted with all the remarkable particulars of his first visit there  mr pleydell listened with great attention and then replied i congratulated myself upon having made the acquaintance of a profound theologian in your chaplain but i really did not expect to find a pupil of albumazar or messahala in his patron i have a notion however this gipsy could tell us some more of the matter than she derives from astrology or secondsight i had her through hands once and could then make little of her but i must write to macmorlan to stir heaven and earth to find her out i will gladly come toshire myself to assist at her examination i am still in the commission of the peace there though i have ceased to be sheriff i never had anything more at heart in my life than tracing that murder and the fate of the child i must write to the sheriff of roxburghshire too and to an active justice of peace in cumberland  i hope when you come to the country you will make woodbourne your headquarters  certainly i was afraid you were going to forbid me but we must go to breakfast now or i shall be too late  on the following day the new friends parted and the colonel rejoined his family without any adventure worthy of being detailed in these chapters       chapter xi      can no rest find me no private place secure me      but still my miseries like bloodhounds haunt me      unfortunate young man which way now guides thee      guides thee from death the countrys laid around for thee            women pleased   our narrative now recalls us for a moment to the period when young hazlewood received his wound that accident had no sooner happened than the consequences to miss mannering and to himself rushed upon browns mind from the manner in which the muzzle of the piece was pointed when it went off he had no great fear that the consequences would be fatal but an arrest in a strange country and while he was unprovided with any means of establishing his rank and character was at least to be avoided he therefore resolved to escape for the present to the neighbouring coast of england and to remain concealed there if possible until he should receive letters from his regimental friends and remittances from his agent and then to resume his own character and offer to young hazlewood and his friends any explanation or satisfaction they might desire with this purpose he walked stoutly forward after leaving the spot where the accident had happened and reached without adventure the village which we have called portanferry but which the reader will in vain seek for under that name in the county map a large open boat was just about to leave the quay bound for the little seaport of allonby in cumberland in this vessel brown embarked and resolved to make that place his temporary abode until he should receive letters and money from england  in the course of their short voyage he entered into some conversation with the steersman who was also owner of the boat a jolly old man who had occasionally been engaged in the smuggling trade like most fishers on the coast after talking about objects of less interest brown endeavoured to turn the discourse toward the mannering family the sailor had heard of the attack upon the house at woodbourne but disapproved of the smugglers proceedings  hands off is fair play zounds theyll bring the whole country down upon them na na when i was in that way i played at giffgaff with the officers here a cargo taenvera weel that was their luck there another carried clean through that was mine na na hawks shouldna pike out hawks een  and this colonel mannering said brown  troth hes nae wise man neither to interfere no that i blame him for saving the gangers lives that was very right but it wasna like a gentleman to be righting about the poor folks pocks o tea and brandy kegs however hes a grand man and an officer man and they do what they like wi the like o us  and his daughter said brown with a throbbing heart is going to be married into a great family too as i have heard  what into the hazlewoods said the pilot na na thats but idle clashes every sabbath day as regularly as it came round did the young man ride hame wi the daughter of the late ellangowan and my daughter peggys in the service up at woodbourne and she says shes sure young hazlewood thinks nae mair of miss mannering than you do  bitterly censuring his own precipitate adoption of a contrary belief brown yet heard with delight that the suspicions of julias fidelity upon which he had so rashly acted were probably void of foundation how must he in the meantime be suffering in her opinion or what could she suppose of conduct which must have made him appear to her regardless alike of her peace of mind and of the interests of their affection the old mans connexion with the family at woodbourne seemed to offer a safe mode of communication of which he determined to avail himself  your daughter is a maidservant at woodbourne i knew miss mannering in india and though i am at present in an inferior rank of life i have great reason to hope she would interest herself in my favour i had a quarrel unfortunately with her father who was my commanding officer and i am sure the young lady would endeavour to reconcile him to me perhaps your daughter could deliver a letter to her upon the subject without making mischief between her father and her  the old man a friend to smuggling of every kind readily answered for the letters being faithfully and secretly delivered and accordingly as soon as they arrived at allonby brown wrote to miss mannering stating the utmost contrition for what had happened through his rashness and conjuring her to let him have an opportunity of pleading his own cause and obtaining forgiveness for his indiscretion he did not judge it safe to go into any detail concerning the circumstances by which he had been misled and upon the whole endeavoured to express himself with such ambiguity that if the letter should fall into wrong hands it would be difficult either to understand its real purport or to trace the writer this letter the old man undertook faithfully to deliver to his daughter at woodbourne and as his trade would speedily again bring him or his boat to allonby he promised farther to take charge of any answer with which the young lady might entrust him  and now our persecuted traveller landed at allonby and sought for such accommodations as might at once suit his temporary poverty and his desire of remaining as much unobserved as possible with this view he assumed the name and profession of his friend dudley having command enough of the pencil to verify his pretended character to his host of allonby his baggage he pretended to expect from wigton and keeping himself as much within doors as possible awaited the return of the letters which he had sent to his agent to delaserre and to his lieutenantcolonel from the first he requested a supply of money he conjured delaserre if possible to join him in scotland and from the lieutenantcolonel he required such testimony of his rank and conduct in the regiment as should place his character as a gentleman and officer beyond the power of question the inconvenience of being run short in his finances struck him so strongly that he wrote to dinmont on that subject requesting a small temporary loan having no doubt that being within sixty or seventy miles of his residence he should receive a speedy as well as favourable answer to his request of pecuniary accommodation which was owing as he stated to his having been robbed after their parting and then with impatience enough though without any serious apprehension he waited the answers of these various letters  it must be observed in excuse of his correspondents that the post was then much more tardy than since mr palmers ingenious invention has taken place and with respect to honest dinmont in particular as he rarely received above one letter a quarter unless during the time of his being engaged in a lawsuit when he regularly sent to the posttown his correspondence usually remained for a month or two sticking in the postmasters window among pamphlets gingerbread rolls or ballads according to the trade which the said postmaster exercised besides there was then a custom not yet wholly obsolete of causing a letter from one town to another perhaps within the distance of thirty miles perform a circuit of two hundred miles before delivery which had the combined advantage of airing the epistle thoroughly of adding some pence to the revenue of the postoffice and of exercising the patience of the correspondents owing to these circumstances brown remained several days in allonby without any answers whatever and his stock of money though husbanded with the utmost economy began to wear very low when he received by the hands of a young fisherman the following letter  you have acted with the most cruel indiscretion you have shown how little i can trust to your declarations that my peace and happiness are dear to you and your rashness has nearly occasioned the death of a young man of the highest worth and honour must i say more must i add that i have been myself very ill in consequence of your violence and its effects and alas need i say still farther that i have thought anxiously upon them as they are likely to affect you although you have given me such slight cause to do so the c is gone from home for several days mr h is almost quite recovered and i have reason to think that the blame is laid in a quarter different from that where it is deserved yet do not think of venturing here our fate has been crossed by accidents of a nature too violent and terrible to permit me to think of renewing a correspondence which has so often threatened the most dreadful catastrophe farewell therefore and believe that no one can wish your happiness more sincerely than  j m  this letter contained that species of advice which is frequently given for the precise purpose that it may lead to a directly opposite conduct from that which it recommends at least so thought brown who immediately asked the young fisherman if he came from portanferry  ay said the lad i am auld willie johnstones son and i got that letter frae my sister peggy thats laundry maid at woodbourne  my good friend when do you sail  with the tide this evening  ill return with you but as i do not desire to go to portanferry i wish you could put me on shore somewhere on the coast  we can easily do that said the lad  although the price of provisions etc was then very moderate the discharging his lodgings and the expense of his living together with that of a change of dress which safety as well as a proper regard to his external appearance rendered necessary brought browns purse to a very low ebb he left directions at the postoffice that his letters should be forwarded to kippletringan whither he resolved to proceed and reclaim the treasure which he had deposited in the hands of mrs maccandlish he also felt it would be his duty to assume his proper character as soon as he should receive the necessary evidence for supporting it and as an officer in the kings service give and receive every explanation which might be necessary with young hazlewood if he is not very wrongheaded indeed he thought he must allow the manner in which i acted to have been the necessary consequence of his own overbearing conduct  and now we must suppose him once more embarked on the solway firth the wind was adverse attended by some rain and they struggled against it without much assistance from the tide the boat was heavily laden with goods part of which were probably contraband and laboured deep in the sea brown who had been bred a sailor and was indeed skilled in most athletic exercises gave his powerful and effectual assistance in rowing or occasionally in steering the boat and his advice in the management which became the more delicate as the wind increased and being opposed to the very rapid tides of that coast made the voyage perilous at length after spending the whole night upon the firth they were at morning within sight of a beautiful bay upon the scottish coast the weather was now more mild the snow which had been for some time waning had given way entirely under the fresh gale of the preceding night the more distant hills indeed retained their snowy mantle but all the open country was cleared unless where a few white patches indicated that it had been drifted to an uncommon depth even under its wintry appearance the shore was highly interesting the line of seacoast with all its varied curves indentures and embayments swept away from the sight on either hand in that varied intricate yet graceful and easy line which the eye loves so well to pursue and it was no less relieved and varied in elevation than in outline by the different forms of the shore the beach in some places being edged by steep rocks and in others rising smoothly from the sands in easy and swelling slopes buildings of different kinds caught and reflected the wintry sunbeams of a december morning and the woods though now leafless gave relief and variety to the landscape brown felt that lively and awakening interest which taste and sensibility always derive from the beauties of nature when opening suddenly to the eye after the dulness and gloom of a night voyage perhapsfor who can presume to analyse that inexplicable feeling which binds the person born in a mountainous country to his native hillsperhaps some early associations retaining their effect long after the cause was forgotten mingled in the feelings of pleasure with which he regarded the scene before him        and what said brown to the boatman is the name of that fine cape that stretches into the sea with its sloping banks and hillocks of wood and forms the right side of the bay  warroch point answered the lad  and that old castle my friend with the modern house situated just beneath it it seems at this distance a very large building  thats the auld place sir and thats the new place below it well land you there if you like  i should like it of all things i must visit that ruin before i continue my journey  ay its a queer auld bit said the fisherman and that highest tower is a gude landmark as far as ramsay in man and the point of ayr there was muckle fighting about the place lang syne  brown would have inquired into farther particulars but a fisherman is seldom an antiquary his boatmans local knowledge was summed up in the information already given that it was a grand landmark and that there had been muckle fighting about the bit lang syne  i shall learn more of it said brown to himself when i get ashore  the boat continued its course close under the point upon which the castle was situated which frowned from the summit of its rocky site upon the still agitated waves of the bay beneath i believe said the steersman yell get ashore here as dry as ony gate theres a place where their berlins and galleys as they cad them used to lie in lang syne but its no used now because its ill carrying gudes up the narrow stairs or ower the rocks whiles of a moonlight night i have landed articles there though  while he thus spoke they pulled round a point of rock and found a very small harbour partly formed by nature partly by the indefatigable labour of the ancient inhabitants of the castle who as the fisherman observed had found it essential for the protection of their boats and small craft though it could not receive vessels of any burden the two points of rock which formed the access approached each other so nearly that only one boat could enter at a time on each side were still remaining two immense iron rings deeply morticed into the solid rock through these according to tradition there was nightly drawn a huge chain secured by an immense padlock for the protection of the haven and the armada which it contained a ledge of rock had by the assistance of the chisel and pickaxe been formed into a sort of quay the rock was of extremely hard consistence and the task so difficult that according to the fisherman a labourer who wrought at the work might in the evening have carried home in his bonnet all the shivers which he had struck from the mass in the course of the day this little quay communicated with a rude staircase already repeatedly mentioned which descended from the old castle there was also a communication between the beach and the quay by scrambling over the rocks  ye had better land here said the lad for the surfs running high at the shellicoat stane and there will no be a dry thread amang us or we get the cargo out na na in answer to an offer of money ye have wrought for your passage and wrought far better than ony o us gude day to ye i wuss ye weel  so saying he pushed oil in order to land his cargo on the opposite side of the bay and brown with a small bundle in his hand containing the trifling stock of necessaries which he had been obliged to purchase at allonby was left on the rocks beneath the ruin  and thus unconscious as the most absolute stranger and in circumstances which if not destitute were for the present highly embarrassing without the countenance of a friend within the circle of several hundred miles accused of a heavy crime and what was as bad as all the rest being nearly penniless did the harassed wanderer for the first time after the interval of so many years approach the remains of the castle where his ancestors had exercised all but regal dominion       chapter xii           yes ye mossgreen walls      ye towers defenceless i revisit ye      shamestricken where are all your trophies now      your thronged courts the revelry the tumult      that spoke the grandeur of my house the homage      of neighbouring barons            mysterious mother   entering the castle of ellangowan by a postern doorway which showed symptoms of having been once secured with the most jealous care brown whom since he has set foot upon the property of his fathers we shall hereafter call by his fathers name of bertram wandered from one ruined apartment to another surprised at the massive strength of some parts of the building the rude and impressive magnificence of others and the great extent of the whole in two of these rooms close beside each other he saw signs of recent habitation in one small apartment were empty bottles halfgnawed bones and dried fragments of bread in the vault which adjoined and which was defended by a strong door then left open he observed a considerable quantity of straw and in both were the relics of recent fires how little was it possible for bertram to conceive that such trivial circumstances were closely connected with incidents affecting his prosperity his honour perhaps his life  after satisfying his curiosity by a hasty glance through the interior of the castle bertram now advanced through the great gateway which opened to the land and paused to look upon the noble landscape which it commanded having in vain endeavoured to guess the position of woodbourne and having nearly ascertained that of kippletringan he turned to take a parting look at the stately ruins which he had just traversed he admired the massive and picturesque effect of the huge round towers which flanking the gateway gave a double portion of depth and majesty to the high yet gloomy arch under which it opened the carved stone escutcheon of the ancient family bearing for their arms three wolves heads was hung diagonally beneath the helmet and crest the latter being a wolf couchant pierced with an arrow on either side stood as supporters in full human size or larger a salvage man proper to use the language of heraldry wreathed and cinctured and holding in his hand an oak tree eradicated that is torn up by the roots  and the powerful barons who owned this blazonry thought bertram pursuing the usual train of ideas which flows upon the mind at such scenesdo their posterity continue to possess the lands which they had laboured to fortify so strongly or are they wanderers ignorant perhaps even of the fame or power of their forefathers while their hereditary possessions are held by a race of strangers why is it he thought continuing to follow out the succession of ideas which the scene promptedwhy is it that some scenes awaken thoughts which belong as it were to dreams of early and shadowy recollection such as my old brahmin moonshie would have ascribed to a state of previous existence is it the visions of our sleep that float confusedly in our memory and are recalled by the appearance of such real objects as in any respect correspond to the phantoms they presented to our imagination how often do we find ourselves in society which we have never before met and yet feel impressed with a mysterious and illdefined consciousness that neither the scene the speakers nor the subject are entirely new nay feel as if we could anticipate that part of the conversation which has not yet taken place it is even so with me while i gaze upon that ruin nor can i divest myself of the idea that these massive towers and that dark gateway retiring through its deepvaulted and ribbed arches and dimly lighted by the courtyard beyond are not entirely strange to me can it be that they have been familiar to me in infancy and that i am to seek in their vicinity those friends of whom my childhood has still a tender though faint remembrance and whom i early exchanged for such severe taskmasters yet brown who i think would not have deceived me always told me i was brought off from the eastern coast after a skirmish in which my father was killed and i do remember enough of a horrid scene of violence to strengthen his account  it happened that the spot upon which young bertram chanced to station himself for the better viewing the castle was nearly the same on which his father had died it was marked by a large old oaktree the only one on the esplanade and which having been used for executions by the barons of ellangowan was called the justice tree it chanced and the coincidence was remarkable that glossin was this morning engaged with a person whom he was in the habit of consulting in such matters concerning some projected repairs and a large addition to the house of ellangowan and that having no great pleasure in remains so intimately connected with the grandeur of the former inhabitants he had resolved to use the stones of the ruinous castle in his new edifice accordingly he came up the bank followed by the landsurveyor mentioned on a former occasion who was also in the habit of acting as a sort of architect in case of necessity in drawing the plans etc glossin was in the custom of relying upon his own skill bertrams back was towards them as they came up the ascent and he was quite shrouded by the branches of the large tree so that glossin was not aware of the presence of the stranger till he was close upon him  yes sir as i have often said before to you the old place is a perfect quarry of hewn stone and it would be better for the estate if it were all down since it is only a den for smugglers at this instant bertram turned short round upon glossin at the distance of two yards only and saidwould you destroy this fine old castle sir  his face person and voice were so exactly those of his father in his best days that glossin hearing his exclamation and seeing such a sudden apparition in the shape of his patron and on nearly the very spot where he had expired almost thought the grave had given up its dead he staggered back two or three paces as if he had received a sudden and deadly wound he instantly recovered however his presence of mind stimulated by the thrilling reflection that it was no inhabitant of the other world which stood before him but an injured man whom the slightest want of dexterity on his part might lead to acquaintance with his rights and the means of asserting them to his utter destruction yet his ideas were so much confused by the shock he had received that his first question partook of the alarm  in the name of god how came you here said glossin  how came i here repeated bertram surprised at the solemnity of the address i landed a quarter of an hour since in the little harbour beneath the castle and was employing a moments leisure in viewing these fine ruins i trust there is no intrusion  intrusion sir no sir said glossin in some degree recovering his breath and then whispered a few words into his companions ear who immediately left him and descended towards the house intrusion sir no sir you or any gentleman are welcome to satisfy your curiosity  i thank you sir said bertram they call this the old place i am informed  yes sir in distinction to the new place my house there below  glossin it must be remarked was during the following dialogue on the one hand eager to learn what local recollections young bertram had retained of the scenes of his infancy and on the other compelled to be extremely cautious in his replies lest he should awaken or assist by some name phrase or anecdote the slumbering train of association he suffered indeed during the whole scene the agonies which he so richly deserved yet his pride and interest like the fortitude of a north american indian manned him to sustain the tortures inflicted at once by the contending stings of a guilty conscience of hatred of fear and of suspicion  i wish to ask the name sir said bertram of the family to whom this stately ruin belongs  it is my property sir my name is glossin  glossinglossin repeated bertram as if the answer were somewhat different from what he expected i beg your pardon mr glossin i am apt to be very absent may i ask if the castle has been long in your family  it was built i believe long ago by a family called macdingawaie answered glossin suppressing for obvious reasons the more familiar sound of bertram which might have awakened the recollections which he was anxious to lull to rest and slurring with an evasive answer the question concerning the endurance of his own possession  and how do you read the halfdefaced motto sir said bertram which is upon that scroll above the entablature with the arms  iii really do not exactly know replied glossin  i should be apt to make it out our right makes our might  i believe it is something of that kind said glossin  may i ask sir said the stranger if it is your family motto  nnnononot ours that is i believe the motto of the former people mine ismine isin fact i have had some correspondence with mr cumming of the lyon office in edinburgh about mine he writes me the glossins anciently bore for a motto he who takes it makes it  if there be any uncertainty sir and the case were mine said bertram i would assume the old motto which seems to me the better of the two  glossin whose tongue by this time clove to the roof of his mouth only answered by a nod  it is odd enough said bertram fixing his eye upon the arms and gateway and partly addressing glossin partly as it were thinking aloudit is odd the tricks which our memory plays us the remnants of an old prophecy or song or rhyme of some kind or other return to my recollection on hearing that motto stayit is a strange jingle of sounds  the dark shall be light and the wrong made right when bertrams right and bertrams might shall meet on  i cannot remember the last lineon some particular height height is the rhyme i am sure but i cannot hit upon the preceding word  confound your memory muttered glossin you remember by far too much of it  there are other rhymes connected with these early recollections continued the young man pray sir is there any song current in this part of the world respecting a daughter of the king of the isle of man eloping with a scottish knight  i am the worst person in the world to consult upon legendary antiquities answered glossin  i could sing such a ballad said bertram from one end to another when i was a boy you must know i left scotland which is my native country very young and those who brought me up discouraged all my attempts to preserve recollection of my native land on account i believe of a boyish wish which i had to escape from their charge  very natural said glossin but speaking as if his utmost efforts were unable to unseal his lips beyond the width of a quarter of an inch so that his whole utterance was a kind of compressed muttering very different from the round bold bullying voice with which he usually spoke indeed his appearance and demeanour during all this conversation seemed to diminish even his strength and stature so that he appeared to wither into the shadow of himself now advancing one foot now the other now stooping and wriggling his shoulders now fumbling with the buttons of his waistcoat now clasping his hands together in short he was the picture of a meanspirited shuffling rascal in the very agonies of detection to these appearances bertram was totally inattentive being dragged on as it were by the current of his own associations indeed although he addressed glossin he was not so much thinking of him as arguing upon the embarrassing state of his own feelings and recollection yes he said i preserved my language among the sailors most of whom spoke english and when i could get into a corner by myself i used to sing all that song over from beginning to end i have forgot it all now but i remember the tune well though i cannot guess what should at present so strongly recall it to my memory  he took his flageolet from his pocket and played a simple melody apparently the tune awoke the corresponding associations of a damsel who close beside a fine spring about halfway down the descent and which had once supplied the castle with water was engaged in bleaching linen she immediately took up the song       are these the links of forth she said        or are they the crooks of dee      or the bonnie woods of warroch head        that i so fain would see  by heaven said bertram it is the very ballad i must learn these words from the girl  confusion thought glossin if i cannot put a stop to this all will be out o the devil take all ballads and balladmakers and balladsingers and that dd jade too to set up her pipeyou will have time enough for this on some other occasion he said aloud at present for now he saw his emissary with two or three men coming up the bankat present we must have some more serious conversation together  how do you mean sir said bertram turning short upon him and not liking the tone which he made use of  why sir as to thati believe your name is brown said glossin and what of that sir  glossin looked over his shoulder to see how near his party had approached they were coming fast on vanbeest brown if i mistake not  and what of that sir said bertram with increasing astonishment and displeasure  why in that case said glossin observing his friends had now got upon the level space close beside themin that case you are my prisoner in the kings name at the same time he stretched his hand towards bertrams collar while two of the men who had come up seized upon his arms he shook himself however free of their grasp by a violent effort in which he pitched the most pertinacious down the bank and drawing his cutlass stood on the defensive while those who had felt his strength recoiled from his presence and gazed at a safe distance observe he called out at the same time that i have no purpose to resist legal authority satisfy me that you have a magistrates warrant and are authorised to make this arrest and i will obey it quietly but let no man who loves his life venture to approach me till i am satisfied for what crime and by whose authority i am apprehended  glossin then caused one of the officers show a warrant for the apprehension of vanbeest brown accused of the crime of wilfully and maliciously shooting at charles hazlewood younger of hazlewood with an intent to kill and also of other crimes and misdemeanours and which appointed him having been so apprehended to be brought before the next magistrate for examination the warrant being formal and the fact such as he could not deny bertram threw down his weapon and submitted himself to the officers who flying on him with eagerness corresponding to their former pusillanimity were about to load him with irons alleging the strength and activity which he had displayed as a justification of this severity but glossin was ashamed or afraid to permit this unnecessary insult and directed the prisoner to be treated with all the decency and even respect that was consistent with safety afraid however to introduce him into his own house where still further subjects of recollection might have been suggested and anxious at the same time to cover his own proceedings by the sanction of anothers authority he ordered his carriage for he had lately set up a carriage to be got ready and in the meantime directed refreshments to be given to the prisoner and the officers who were consigned to one of the rooms in the old castle until the means of conveyance for examination before a magistrate should be provided       chapter xiii      bring in the evidence      thou robed man of justice take thy place      and thou his yokefellow of equity      bench by his side you are of the commission      sit you too            king lear   while the carriage was getting ready glossin had a letter to compose about which he wasted no small time it was to his neighbour as he was fond of calling him sir robert hazlewood of hazlewood the head of an ancient and powerful interest in the county which had in the decadence of the ellangowan family gradually succeeded to much of their authority and influence the present representative of the family was an elderly man dotingly fond of his own family which was limited to an only son and daughter and stoically indifferent to the fate of all mankind besides for the rest he was honourable in his general dealings because he was afraid to suffer the censure of the world and just from a better motive he was presumptuously overconceited on the score of family pride and importance a feeling considerably enhanced by his late succession to the title of a nova scotia baronet and he hated the memory of the ellangowan family though now a memory only because a certain baron of that house was traditionally reported to have caused the founder of the hazlewood family hold his stirrup until he mounted into his saddle in his general deportment he was pompous and important affecting a species of florid elocution which often became ridiculous from his misarranging the triads and quaternions with which he loaded his sentences  to this personage glossin was now to write in such a conciliatory style as might be most acceptable to his vanity and family pride and the following was the form of his note  mr gilbert glossin he longed to add of ellangowan but prudence prevailed and he suppressed that territorial designationmr gilbert glossin has the honour to offer his most respectful compliments to sir robert hazlewood and to inform him that he has this morning been fortunate enough to secure the person who wounded mr c hazlewood as sir robert hazlewood may probably choose to conduct the examination of this criminal himself mr g glossin will cause the man to be carried to the inn at kippletringan or to hazlewood house as sir robert hazlewood may be pleased to direct and with sir robert hazlewoods permission mr g glossin will attend him at either of these places with the proofs and declarations which he has been so fortunate as to collect respecting this atrocious business  addressed  sir robert hazlewood of hazlewood bart hazlewood house etc etc  elln gn  tuesday  this note he despatched by a servant on horseback and having given the man some time to get ahead and desired him to ride fast he ordered two officers of justice to get into the carriage with bertram and he himself mounting his horse accompanied them at a slow pace to the point where the roads to kippletringan and hazlewood house separated and there awaited the return of his messenger in order that his farther route might be determined by the answer he should receive from the baronet in about half an hour his servant returned with the following answer handsomely folded and sealed with the hazlewood arms having the nova scotia badge depending from the shield  sir robert hazlewood of hazlewood returns mr g glossins compliments and thanks him for the trouble he has taken in a matter affecting the safety of sir roberts family sir rh requests mr gg will have the goodness to bring the prisoner to hazlewood house for examination with the other proofs or declarations which he mentions and after the business is over in case mr gg is not otherwise engaged sir r and lady hazlewood request his company to dinner  addressed  mr gilbert glossin etc hazlewood house tuesday  soh thought mr glossin here is one finger in at least and that i will make the means of introducing my whole hand but i must first get clear of this wretched young fellow i think i can manage sir robert he is dull and pompous and will be alike disposed to listen to my suggestions upon the law of the case and to assume the credit of acting upon them as his own proper motion so i shall have the advantage of being the real magistrate without the odium of responsibility  as he cherished these hopes and expectations the carriage approached hazlewood house through a noble avenue of old oaks which shrouded the ancient abbeyresembling building so called it was a large edifice built at different periods part having actually been a priory upon the suppression of which in the time of queen mary the first of the family had obtained a gift of the house and surrounding lands from the crown it was pleasantly situated in a large deerpark on the banks of the river we have before mentioned the scenery around was of a dark solemn and somewhat melancholy cast according well with the architecture of the house everything appeared to be kept in the highest possible order and announced the opulence and rank of the proprietor  as mr glossins carriage stopped at the door of the hall sir robert reconnoitred the new vehicle from the windows according to his aristocratic feelings there was a degree of presumption in this novus homo this mr gilbert glossin late writer in presuming to set up such an accommodation at all but his wrath was mitigated when he observed that the mantle upon the panels only bore a plain cipher of gg this apparent modesty was indeed solely owing to the delay of mr gumming of the lyon office who being at that time engaged in discovering and matriculating the arms of two commissaries from north america three englishirish peers and two great jamaica traders had been more slow than usual in finding an escutcheon for the new laird of ellangowan but his delay told to the advantage of glossin in the opinion of the proud baronet  while the officers of justice detained their prisoner in a sort of stewards room mr glossin was ushered into what was called the great oakparlour a long room panelled with wellvarnished wainscot and adorned with the grim portraits of sir robert hazlewoods ancestry the visitor who had no internal consciousness of worth to balance that of meanness of birth felt his inferiority and by the depth of his bow and the obsequiousness of his demeanour showed that the laird of ellangowan was sunk for the time in the old and submissive habits of the quondam retainer of the law he would have persuaded himself indeed that he was only humouring the pride of the old baronet for the purpose of turning it to his own advantage but his feelings were of a mingled nature and he felt the influence of those very prejudices which he pretended to flatter  the baronet received his visitor with that condescending parade which was meant at once to assert his own vast superiority and to show the generosity and courtesy with which he could waive it and descend to the level of ordinary conversation with ordinary men he thanked glossin for his attention to a matter in which young hazlewood was so intimately concerned and pointing to his family pictures observed with a gracious smile indeed these venerable gentlemen mr glossin are as much obliged as i am in this case for the labour pains care and trouble which you have taken in their behalf and i have no doubt were they capable of expressing themselves would join me sir in thanking you for the favour you have conferred upon the house of hazlewood by taking care and trouble sir and interest in behalf of the young gentleman who is to continue their name and family  thrice bowed glossin and each time more profoundly than before once in honour of the knight who stood upright before him once in respect to the quiet personages who patiently hung upon the wainscot and a third time in deference to the young gentleman who was to carry on the name and family roturier as he was sir robert was gratified by the homage which he rendered and proceeded in a tone of gracious familiarity and now mr glossin my exceeding good friend you must allow me to avail myself of your knowledge of law in our proceedings in this matter i am not much in the habit of acting as a justice of the peace it suits better with other gentlemen whose domestic and family affairs require less constant superintendence attention and management than mine  of course whatever small assistance mr glossin could render was entirely at sir robert hazlewoods service but as sir robert hazlewoods name stood high in the list of the faculty the said mr glossin could not presume to hope it could be either necessary or useful  why my good sir you will understand me only to mean that i am something deficient in the practical knowledge of the ordinary details of justice business i was indeed educated to the bar and might boast perhaps at one time that i had made some progress in the speculative and abstract and abstruse doctrines of our municipal code but there is in the present day so little opportunity of a man of family and fortune rising to that eminence at the bar which is attained by adventurers who are as willing to plead for john a nokes as for the first noble of the land that i was really early disgusted with practice the first case indeed which was laid on my table quite sickened me it respected a bargain sir of tallow between a butcher and a candlemaker and i found it was expected that i should grease my mouth not only with their vulgar names but with all the technical terms and phrases and peculiar language of their dirty arts upon my honour my good sir i have never been able to bear the smell of a tallowcandle since  pitying as seemed to be expected the mean use to which the baronets faculties had been degraded on this melancholy occasion mr glossin offered to officiate as clerk or assessor or in any way in which he could be most useful and with a view to possessing you of the whole business and in the first place there will i believe be no difficulty in proving the main fact that this was the person who fired the unhappy piece should he deny it it can be proved by mr hazlewood i presume  young hazlewood is not at home today mr glossin  but we can have the oath of the servant who attended him said the ready mr glossin indeed i hardly think the fact will be disputed i am more apprehensive that from the too favourable and indulgent manner in which i have understood that mr hazlewood has been pleased to represent the business the assault may be considered as accidental and the injury as unintentional so that the fellow may be immediately set at liberty to do more mischief  i have not the honour to know the gentleman who now holds the office of kings advocate replied sir robert gravely but i presume sirnay i am confident that he will consider the mere fact of having wounded young hazlewood of hazlewood even by inadvertency to take the matter in its mildest and gentlest and in its most favourable and improbable light as a crime which will be too easily atoned by imprisonment and as more deserving of deportation  indeed sir robert said his assenting brother in justice i am entirely of your opinion but i dont know how it is i have observed the edinburgh gentlemen of the bar and even the officers of the crown pique themselves upon an indifferent administration of justice without respect to rank and family and i should fear  how sir without respect to rank and family will you tell me that doctrine can be held by men of birth and legal education no sir if a trifle stolen in the street is termed mere pickery but is elevated into sacrilege if the crime be committed in a church so according to the just gradations of society the guilt of an injury is enhanced by the rank of the person to whom it is offered done or perpetrated sir  glossin bowed low to this declaration ex cathedra but observed that in the case of the very worst and of such unnatural doctrines being actually held as he had already hinted the law had another hold on mr vanbeest brown  vanbeest brown is that the fellows name good god that young hazlewood of hazlewood should have had his life endangered the clavicle of his right shoulder considerably lacerated and dislodged several large drops or slugs deposited in the acromion process as the account of the family surgeon expressly bears and all by an obscure wretch named vanbeest brown  why really sir robert it is a thing which one can hardly bear to think of but begging ten thousand pardons for resuming what i was about to say a person of the same name is as appears from these papers producing dirk hatteraicks pocketbook mate to the smuggling vessel who offered such violence at woodbourne and i have no doubt that this is the same individual which however your acute discrimination will easily be able to ascertain  the same my good sir he must assuredly be it would be injustice even to the meanest of the people to suppose there could be found among them two persons doomed to bear a name so shocking to ones ears as this of vanbeest brown true sir robert most unquestionably there cannot be a shadow of doubt of it but you see farther that this circumstance accounts for the mans desperate conduct you sir robert will discover the motive for his crimeyou i say will discover it without difficulty on your giving your mind to the examination for my part i cannot help suspecting the moving spring to have been revenge for the gallantry with which mr hazlewood with all the spirit of his renowned forefathers defended the house at woodbourne against this villain and his lawless companions  i will inquire into it my good sir said the learned baronet yet even now i venture to conjecture that i shall adopt the solution or explanation of this riddle enigma or mystery which you have in some degree thus started yes revenge it must be and good heaven entertained by and against whom entertained fostered cherished against young hazlewood of hazlewood and in part carried into effect executed and implemented by the hand of vanbeest brown these are dreadful days indeed my worthy neighbour this epithet indicated a rapid advance in the baronets good gracesdays when the bulwarks of society are shaken to their mighty base and that rank which forms as it were its highest grace and ornament is mingled and confused with the viler parts of the architecture o my good mr gilbert glossin in my time sir the use of swords and pistols and such honourable arms was reserved by the nobility and gentry to themselves and the disputes of the vulgar were decided by the weapons which nature had given them or by cudgels cut broken or hewed out of the next wood but now sir the clouted shoe of the peasant galls the kibe of the courtier the lower ranks have their quarrels sir and their points of honour and their revenges which they must bring forsooth to fatal arbitrament but well well it will last my time let us have in this fellow this vanbeest brown and make an end of him at least for the present       chapter xiv      twas he      gave heat unto the injury which returned      like a petard ill lighted into the bosom      of him gave fire tot yet i hope his hurt      is not so dangerous but he may recover            fair maid of the inn   the prisoner was now presented before the two worshipful magistrates glossin partly from some compunctious visitings and partly out of his cautious resolution to suffer sir robert hazlewood to be the ostensible manager of the whole examination looked down upon the table and busied himself with reading and arranging the papers respecting the business only now and then throwing in a skilful catchword as prompter when he saw the principal and apparently most active magistrate stand in need of a hint as for sir robert hazlewood he assumed on his part a happy mixture of the austerity of the justice combined with the display of personal dignity appertaining to the baronet of ancient family  there constables let him stand there at the bottom of the table be so good as look me in the face sir and raise your voice as you answer the questions which i am going to put to you  may i beg in the first place to know sir who it is that takes the trouble to interrogate me said the prisoner for the honest gentlemen who have brought me here have not been pleased to furnish any information upon that point  and pray sir answered sir robert what has my name and quality to do with the questions i am about to ask you  nothing perhaps sir replied bertram but it may considerably influence my disposition to answer them  why then sir you will please to be informed that you are in presence of sir robert hazlewood of hazlewood and another justice of peace for this countythats all  as this intimation produced a less stunning effect upon the prisoner than he had anticipated sir robert proceeded in his investigation with an increasing dislike to the object of it  is your name vanbeest brown sir  it is answered the prisoner  so far well and how are we to design you farther sir demanded the justice  captain in his majestysregiment of horse answered bertram  the baronets ears received this intimation with astonishment but he was refreshed in courage by an incredulous look from glossin and by hearing him gently utter a sort of interjectional whistle in a note of surprise and contempt i believe my friend said sir robert we shall find for you before we part a more humble title  if you do sir replied his prisoner i shall willingly submit to any punishment which such an imposture shall be thought to deserve  well sir we shall see continued sir robert do you know young hazlewood of hazlewood  i never saw the gentleman who i am informed bears that name excepting once and i regret that it was under very unpleasant circumstances  you mean to acknowledge then said the baronet that you inflicted upon young hazlewood of hazlewood that wound which endangered his life considerably lacerated the clavicle of his right shoulder and deposited as the family surgeon declares several large drops or slugs in the acromion process  why sir replied bertram i can only say i am equally ignorant of and sorry for the extent of the damage which the young gentleman has sustained i met him in a narrow path walking with two ladies and a servant and before i could either pass them or address them this young hazlewood took his gun from his servant presented it against my body and commanded me in the most haughty tone to stand back i was neither inclined to submit to his authority nor to leave him in possession of the means to injure me which he seemed disposed to use with such rashness i therefore closed with him for the purpose of disarming him and just as i had nearly effected my purpose the piece went off accidentally and to my regret then and since inflicted upon the young gentleman a severer chastisement than i desired though i am glad to understand it is like to prove no more than his unprovoked folly deserved  and so sir said the baronet every feature swoln with offended dignity you sir admit sir that it was your purpose sir and your intention sir and the real jet and object of your assault sir to disarm young hazlewood of hazlewood of his gun sir or his fowlingpiece or his fuzee or whatever you please to call it sir upon the kings highway sir i think this will do my worthy neighbour i think he should stand committed  you are by far the best judge sir robert said glossin in his most insinuating tone but if i might presume to hint there was something about these smugglers  very true good sir and besides sir you vanbeest brown who call yourself a captain in his majestys service are no better or worse than a rascally mate of a smuggler  really sir said bertram you are an old gentleman and acting under some strange delusion otherwise i should be very angry with you  old gentleman sir strange delusion sir said sir robert colouring with indignation i protest and declarewhy sir have you any papers or letters that can establish your pretended rank and estate and commission  none at present sir answered bertram but in the return of a post or two  and how do you sir continued the baronet if you are a captain in his majestys servicehow do you chance to be travelling in scotland without letters of introduction credentials baggage or anything belonging to your pretended rank estate and condition as i said before  sir replied the prisoner i had the misfortune to be robbed of my clothes and baggage  oho then you are the gentleman who took a postchaise fromto kippletringan gave the boy the slip on the road and sent two of your accomplices to beat the boy and bring away the baggage  i was sir in a carriage as you describe was obliged to alight in the snow and lost my way endeavouring to find the road to kippletringan the landlady of the inn will inform you that on my arrival there the next day my first inquiries were after the boy  then give me leave to ask where you spent the night not in the snow i presume you do not suppose that will pass or be taken credited and received  i beg leave said bertram his recollection turning to the gipsy female and to the promise he had given heri beg leave to decline answering that question  i thought as much said sir robert were you not during that night in the ruins of derncleughin the ruins of derncleugh sir  i have told you that i do not intend answering that question replied bertram  well sir then you will stand committed sir said sir robert and be sent to prison sir thats all sir have the goodness to look at these papers are you the vanbeest brown who is there mentioned  it must be remarked that glossin had shuffled among the papers some writings which really did belong to bertram and which had been found by the officers in the old vault where his portmanteau was ransacked  some of these papers said bertram looking over them are mine and were in my portfolio when it was stolen from the postchaise they are memoranda of little value and i see have been carefully selected as affording no evidence of my rank or character which many of the other papers would have established fully they are mingled with shipaccounts and other papers belonging apparently to a person of the same name  and wilt thou attempt to persuade me friend demanded sir robert that there are two persons in this country at the same time of thy very uncommon and awkwardly sounding name  i really do not see sir as there is an old hazlewood and a young hazlewood why there should not be an old and a young vanbeest brown and to speak seriously i was educated in holland and i know that this name however uncouth it may sound in british ears  glossin conscious that the prisoner was now about to enter upon dangerous ground interfered though the interruption was unnecessary for the purpose of diverting the attention of sir robert hazlewood who was speechless and motionless with indignation at the presumptuous comparison implied in bertrams last speech in fact the veins of his throat and of his temples swelled almost to bursting and he sat with the indignant and disconcerted air of one who has received a mortal insult from a quarter to which he holds it unmeet and indecorous to make any reply while with a bent brow and an angry eye he was drawing in his breath slowly and majestically and puffing it forth again with deep and solemn exertion glossin stepped in to his assistance i should think now sir robert with great submission that this matter may be closed one of the constables besides the pregnant proof already produced offers to make oath that the sword of which the prisoner was this morning deprived while using it by the way in resistance to a legal warrant was a cutlass taken from him in a fray between the officers and smugglers just previous to their attack upon woodbourne and yet he added i would not have you form any rash construction upon that subject perhaps the young man can explain how he came by that weapon  that question sir said bertram i shall also leave unanswered  there is yet another circumstance to be inquired into always under sir roberts leave insinuated glossin this prisoner put into the hands of mrs maccandlish of kippletringan a parcel containing a variety of gold coins and valuable articles of different kinds perhaps sir robert you might think it right to ask how he came by property of a description which seldom occurs  you sir mr vanbeest brown sir you hear the question sir which the gentleman asks you  i have particular reasons for declining to answer that question answered bertram  then i am afraid sir said glossin who had brought matters to the point he desired to reach our duty must lay us under the necessity to sign a warrant of committal  as you please sir answered bertram take care however what you do observe that i inform you that i am a captain in his majestysregiment and that i am just returned from india and therefore cannot possibly be connected with any of those contraband traders you talk of that my lieutenantcolonel is now at nottingham the major with the officers of my corps at kingstonuponthames i offer before you both to submit to any degree of ignominy if within the return of the kingston and nottingham posts i am not able to establish these points or you may write to the agent for the regiment if you please and  this is all very well sir said glossin beginning to fear lest the firm expostulation of bertram should make some impression on sir robert who would almost have died of shame at committing such a solecism as sending a captain of horse to jailthis is all very well sir but is there no person nearer whom you could refer to  there are only two persons in this country who know anything of me replied the prisoner one is a plain liddesdale sheepfarmer called dinmont of charlies hope but he knows nothing more of me than what i told him and what i now tell you  why this is well enough sir robert said glossin i suppose he would bring forward this thickskulled fellow to give his oath of credulity sir robert ha ha ha  and what is your other witness friend said the baronet  a gentleman whom i have some reluctance to mention because of certain private reasons but under whose command i served some time in india and who is too much a man of honour to refuse his testimony to my character as a soldier and gentleman  and who is this doughty witness pray sir said sir robert some halfpay quartermaster or sergeant i suppose  colonel guy mannering late of theregiment in which as i told you i have a troop  colonel guy mannering thought glossin who the devil could have guessed this  colonel guy mannering echoed the baronet considerably shaken in his opinion my good sir apart to glossin the young man with a dreadfully plebeian name and a good deal of modest assurance has nevertheless something of the tone and manners and feeling of a gentleman of one at least who has lived in good society they do give commissions very loosely and carelessly and inaccurately in india i think we had better pause till colonel mannering shall return he is now i believe at edinburgh  you are in every respect the best judge sir robert answered glossinin every possible respect i would only submit to you that we are certainly hardly entitled to dismiss this man upon an assertion which cannot be satisfied by proof and that we shall incur a heavy responsibility by detaining him in private custody without committing him to a public jail undoubtedly however you are the best judge sir robert and i would only say for my own part that i very lately incurred severe censure by detaining a person in a place which i thought perfectly secure and under the custody of the proper officers the man made his escape and i have no doubt my own character for attention and circumspection as a magistrate has in some degree suffered i only hint this i will join in any step you sir robert think most advisable but mr glossin was well aware that such a hint was of power sufficient to decide the motions of his selfimportant but not selfrelying colleague so that sir robert hazlewood summed up the business in the following speech which proceeded partly upon the supposition of the prisoner being really a gentleman and partly upon the opposite belief that he was a villain and an assassin  sir mr vanbeest browni would call you captain brown if there was the least reason or cause or grounds to suppose that you are a captain or had a troop in the very respectable corps you mention or indeed in any other corps in his majestys service as to which circumstance i beg to be understood to give no positive settled or unalterable judgment declaration or opinioni say therefore sir mr brown we have determined considering the unpleasant predicament in which you now stand having been robbed as you say an assertion as to which i suspend my opinion and being possessed of much and valuable treasure and of a brasshandled cutlass besides as to your obtaining which you will favour us with no explanationi say sir we have determined and resolved and made up our minds to commit you to jail or rather to assign you an apartment therein in order that you may be forthcoming upon colonel mannerings return from edinburgh  with humble submission sir robert said glossin may i inquire if it is your purpose to send this young gentleman to the county jail for if that were not your settled intention i would take the liberty to hint that there would be less hardship in sending him to the bridewell at portanferry where he can be secured without public exposure a circumstance which on the mere chance of his story being really true is much to be avoided  why there is a guard of soldiers at portanferry to be sure for protection of the goods in the customhouse and upon the whole considering everything and that the place is comfortable for such a place i say all things considered we will commit this person i would rather say authorise him to be detained in the workhouse at portanferry  the warrant was made out accordingly and bertram was informed he was next morning to be removed to his place of confinement as sir robert had determined he should not be taken there under cloud of night for fear of rescue he was during the interval to be detained at hazlewood house  it cannot be so hard as my imprisonment by the looties in india he thought nor can it last so long but the deuce take the old formal dunderhead and his more sly associate who speaks always under his breath they cannot understand a plain mans story when it is told them  in the meanwhile glossin took leave of the baronet with a thousand respectful bows and cringing apologies for not accepting his invitation to dinner and venturing to hope he might be pardoned in paying his respects to him lady hazlewood and young mr hazlewood on some future occasion  certainly sir said the baronet very graciously i hope our family was never at any time deficient in civility to our neighbours and when i ride that way good mr glossin i will convince you of this by calling at your house as familiarly as is consistentthat is as can be hoped or expected  and now said glossin to himself to find dirk hatteraick and his people to get the guard sent off from the customhouse and then for the grand cast of the dice everything must depend upon speed how lucky that mannering has betaken himself to edinburgh his knowledge of this young fellow is a most perilous addition to my dangers here he suffered his horse to slacken his pace what if i should try to compound with the heir its likely he might be brought to pay a round sum for restitution and i could give up hatteraick but no no no there were too many eyes on mehatteraick himself and the gipsy sailor and that old hag no no i must stick to my original plan and with that he struck his spurs against his horses flanks and rode forward at a hard trot to put his machines in motion       chapter xv      a prison is a house of care      a place where none can thrive      a touchstone true to try a friend      a grave for one alive      sometimes a place of right      sometimes a place of wrong      sometimes a place of rogues and thieves      and honest men among            inscription on edinburgh tolbooth   early on the following morning the carriage which had brought bertram to hazlewood house was with his two silent and surly attendants appointed to convey him to his place of confinement at portanferry this building adjoined to the customhouse established at that little seaport and both were situated so close to the seabeach that it was necessary to defend the back part with a large and strong rampart or bulwark of huge stones disposed in a slope towards the surf which often reached and broke upon them the front was surrounded by a high wall enclosing a small courtyard within which the miserable inmates of the mansion were occasionally permitted to take exercise and air the prison was used as a house of correction and sometimes as a chapel of ease to the county jail which was old and far from being conveniently situated with reference to the kippletringan district of the county macguffog the officer by whom bertram had at first been apprehended and who was now in attendance upon him was keeper of this palace of littleease he caused the carriage to be drawn close up to the outer gate and got out himself to summon the warders the noise of his rap alarmed some twenty or thirty ragged boys who left off sailing their mimic sloops and frigates in the little pools of salt water left by the receding tide and hastily crowded round the vehicle to see what luckless being was to be delivered to the prisonhouse out of glossins braw new carriage the door of the courtyard after the heavy clanking of many chains and bars was opened by mrs macguffogan awful spectacle being a woman for strength and resolution capable of maintaining order among her riotous inmates and of administering the discipline of the house as it was called during the absence of her husband or when he chanced to have taken an overdose of the creature the growling voice of this amazon which rivalled in harshness the crashing music of her own bolts and bars soon dispersed in every direction the little varlets who had thronged around her threshold and she next addressed her amiable helpmate  be sharp man and get out the swell canst thou not  hold your tongue and be dd you answered her loving husband with two additional epithets of great energy but which we beg to be excused from repeating then addressing bertramcome will you get out my handy lad or must we lend you a lift  bertram came out of the carriage and collared by the constable as he put his foot on the ground was dragged though he offered no resistance across the threshold amid the continued shouts of the little sansculottes who looked on at such distance as their fear of mrs macguffog permitted the instant his foot had crossed the fatal porch the portress again dropped her chains drew her bolts and turning with both hands an immense key took it from the lock and thrust it into a huge sidepocket of red cloth  bertram was now in the small court already mentioned two or three prisoners were sauntering along the pavement and deriving as it were a feeling of refreshment from the momentary glimpse with which the opening door had extended their prospect to the other side of a dirty street nor can this be thought surprising when it is considered that unless on such occasions their view was confined to the grated front of their prison the high and sable walls of the courtyard the heaven above them and the pavement beneath their feeta sameness of landscape which to use the poets expression lay like a load on the wearied eye and had fostered in some a callous and dull misanthropy in others that sickness of the heart which induces him who is immured already in a living grave to wish for a sepulchre yet more calm and sequestered  macguffog when they entered the courtyard suffered bertram to pause for a minute and look upon his companions in affliction when he had cast his eye around on faces on which guilt and despondence and low excess had fixed their stigmaupon the spendthrift and the swindler and the thief the bankrupt debtor the moping idiot and the madman gay whom a paltry spirit of economy congregated to share this dismal habitation he felt his heart recoil with inexpressible loathing from enduring the contamination of their society even for a moment  i hope sir he said to the keeper you intend to assign me a place of confinement apart  and what should i be the better of that  why sir i can but be detained here a day or two and it would be very disagreeable to me to mix in the sort of company this place affords  and what do i care for that  why then sir to speak to your feelings said bertram i shall be willing to make you a handsome compliment for this indulgence  ay but when captain when and how thats the question or rather the twa questions said the jailor  when i am delivered and get my remittances from england answered the prisoner  macguffog shook his head incredulously  why friend you do not pretend to believe that i am really a malefactor said bertram  why i no ken said the fellow but if you are on the account yere nae sharp ane thats the daylight ot  and why do you say i am no sharp one  why wha but a crackbrained greenhorn wad hae let them keep up the siller that ye left at the gordon arms said the constable deil fetch me but i wad have had it out o their wames ye had nae right to be strippit o your money and sent to jail without a mark to pay your fees they might have keepit the rest o the articles for evidence but why for a blind bottlehead did not ye ask the guineas and i kept winking and nodding a the time and the donnert deevil wad never ance look my way  well sir replied bertram if i have a title to have that property delivered up to me i shall apply for it and there is a good deal more than enough to pay any demand you can set up  i dinna ken a bit about that said macguffog ye may be here lang eneugh and then the gieing credit maun be considered in the fees but however as ye do seem to be a chap by common though my wife says i lose by my goodnature if ye gie me an order for my fees upon that money i daresay glossin will make it forthcoming i ken something about an escape from ellangowan ay ay hell be glad to carry me through and be neighbourlike  well sir replied bertram if i am not furnished in a day or two otherwise you shall have such an order  weel weel then ye shall be put up like a prince said macguffog but mark ye me friend that we may have nae collyshangie afterhend these are the fees that i always charge a swell that must have his libken to himsellthirty shillings a week for lodgings and a guinea for garnish half a guinea a week for a single bed and i dinna get the whole of it for i must gie half a crown out of it to donald laider thats in for sheepstealing that should sleep with you by rule and hell expect clean strae and maybe some whisky beside so i make little upon that  well sir go on  then for meat and liquor ye may have the best and i never charge abune twenty per cent ower tavern price for pleasing a gentleman that way and thats little eneugh for sending in and sending out and wearing the lassies shoon out and then if yere dowie i will sit wi you a gliff in the evening mysell man and help ye out wi your bottle i have drank mony a glass wi glossin man that did you up though hes a justice now and then ise warrant yell be for fire thir cauld nights or if ye want candle thats an expensive article for its against the rules and now ive telld ye the head articles of the charge and i dinna think theres muckle mair though there will aye be some odd expenses ower and abune  well sir i must trust to your conscience if ever you happened to hear of such a thing i cannot help myself  na na sir answered the cautious jailor ill no permit you to be saying that im forcing naething upon ye an ye dinna like the price ye needna take the article i force no man i was only explaining what civility was but if ye like to take the common run of the house its a ane to me ill be saved trouble thats a  nay my friend i have as i suppose you may easily guess no inclination to dispute your terms upon such a penalty answered bertram come show me where i am to be for i would fain be alone for a little while  ay ay come along then captain said the fellow with a contortion of visage which he intended to be a smile and ill tell you nowto show you that i have a conscience as ye catdn me if i charge ye abune sixpence a day for the freedom o the court and ye may walk int very near three hours a day and play at pitchandtoss and hand ba and what not  with this gracious promise he ushered bertram into the house and showed him up a steep and narrow stone staircase at the top of which was a strong door clenched with iron and studded with nails beyond this door was a narrow passage or gallery having three cells on each side wretched vaults with iron bedframes and straw mattresses but at the farther end was a small apartment of rather a more decent appearance that is having less the air of a place of confinement since unless for the large lock and chain upon the door and the crossed and ponderous stanchions upon the window it rather resembled the worst inns worst room it was designed as a sort of infirmary for prisoners whose state of health required some indulgence and in fact donald laider bertrams destined chum had been just dragged out of one of the two beds which it contained to try whether clean straw and whisky might not have a better chance to cure his intermitting fever this process of ejection had been carried into force by mrs macguffog while her husband parleyed with bertram in the courtyard that good lady having a distinct presentiment of the manner in which the treaty must necessarily terminate apparently the expulsion had not taken place without some application of the strong hand for one of the bedposts of a sort of tentbed was broken down so that the tester and curtains hung forward into the middle of the narrow chamber like the banner of a chieftain halfsinking amid the confusion of a combat  never mind that being out o sorts captain said mrs macguffog who now followed them into the room then turning her back to the prisoner with as much delicacy as the action admitted she whipped from her knee her ferret garter and applied it to splicing and fastening the broken bedpost then used more pins than her apparel could well spare to fasten up the bedcurtains in festoons then shook the bedclothes into something like form then flung over all a tattered patchwork quilt and pronounced that things were now something purposelike and theres your bed captain pointing to a massy fourposted hulk which owing to the inequality of the floor that had sunk considerably the house though new having been built by contract stood on three legs and held the fourth aloft as if pawing the air and in the attitude of advancing like an elephant passant upon the panel of a coachtheres your bed and the blankets but if ye want sheets or bowster or pillow or ony sort o nappery for the table or for your hands ye ll hae to speak to me about it for thats out o the gudemans line macguffog had by this time left the room to avoid probably any appeal which might be made to him upon this new exaction and he never engages for ony thing like that  in gods name said bertram let me have what is decent and make any charge you please  aweel aweel thats sune settled well no excise you neither though we live sae near the customhouse and i maun see to get you some fire and some dinner too ise warrant but your dinner will be but a puir ane the day no expecting company that would be nice and fashious so saying and in all haste mrs macguffog fetched a scuttle of live coals and having replenished the rusty grate unconscious of a fire for months before she proceeded with unwashed hands to arrange the stipulated bedlinen alas how different from ailie dinmonts and muttering to herself as she discharged her task seemed in inveterate spleen of temper to grudge even those accommodations for which she was to receive payment at length however she departed grumbling between her teeth that she wad rather lock up a haill ward than be fiking about thae niffnaffy gentles that gae sae muckle fash wi their fancies  when she was gone bertram found himself reduced to the alternative of pacing his little apartment for exercise or gazing out upon the sea in such proportions as could be seen from the narrow panes of his window obscured by dirt and by close iron bars or reading over the records of brutal wit and blackguardism which despair had scrawled upon the halfwhitened walls the sounds were as uncomfortable as the objects of sight the sullen dash of the tide which was now retreating and the occasional opening and shutting of a door with all its accompaniments of jarring bolts and creaking hinges mingling occasionally with the dull monotony of the retiring ocean sometimes too he could hear the hoarse growl of the keeper or the shriller strain of his helpmate almost always in the tone of discontent anger or insolence at other times the large mastiff chained in the courtyard answered with furious bark the insults of the idle loiterers who made a sport of incensing him  at length the tedium of this weary space was broken by the entrance of a dirtylooking servingwench who made some preparations for dinner by laying a halfdirty cloth upon a wholedirty deal table a knife and fork which had not been worn out by overcleaning flanked a cracked delf plate a nearly empty mustardpot placed on one side of the table balanced a saltcellar containing an article of a greyish or rather a blackish mixture upon the other both of stoneware and bearing too obvious marks of recent service shortly after the same hebe brought up a plate of beefcollops done in the fryingpan with a huge allowance of grease floating in an ocean of lukewarm water and having added a coarse loaf to these savoury viands she requested to know what liquors the gentleman chose to order the appearance of this fare was not very inviting but bertram endeavoured to mend his commons by ordering wine which he found tolerably good and with the assistance of some indifferent cheese made his dinner chiefly off the brown loaf when his meal was over the girl presented her masters compliments and if agreeable to the gentleman he would help him to spend the evening bertram desired to be excused and begged instead of this gracious society that he might be furnished with paper pen ink and candles the light appeared in the shape of one long broken tallowcandle inclining over a tin candlestick coated with grease as for the writing materials the prisoner was informed that he might have them the next day if he chose to send out to buy them bertram next desired the maid to procure him a book and enforced his request with a shilling in consequence of which after long absence she reappeared with two odd volumes of the newgate calendar which she had borrowed from sam silverquill an idle apprentice who was imprisoned under a charge of forgery having laid the books on the table she retired and left bertram to studies which were not ill adapted to his present melancholy situation       chapter xvi      but if thou shouldst be draggd in scorn        to yonder ignominious tree      thou shall not want one faithful friend        to share the cruel fates decree            shenstone   plunged in the gloomy reflections which were naturally excited by his dismal reading and disconsolate situation bertram for the first time in his life felt himself affected with a disposition to low spirits i have been in worse situations than this too he said more dangerous for here is no danger more dismal in prospect for my present confinement must necessarily be short more intolerable for the time for here at least i have fire food and shelter yet with reading these bloody tales of crime and misery in a place so corresponding to the ideas which they excite and in listening to these sad sounds i feel a stronger disposition to melancholy than in my life i ever experienced but i will not give way to it begone thou record of guilt and infamy he said flinging the book upon the spare bed a scottish jail shall not break on the very first day the spirits which have resisted climate and want and penury and disease and imprisonment in a foreign land i have fought many a hard battle with dame fortune and she shall not beat me now if i can help it  then bending his mind to a strong effort he endeavoured to view his situation in the most favourable light delaserre must soon be in scotland the certificates from his commanding officer must soon arrive nay if mannering were first applied to who could say but the effect might be a reconciliation between them he had often observed and now remembered that when his former colonel took the part of any one it was never by halves and that he seemed to love those persons most who had lain under obligation to him in the present case a favour which could be asked with honour and granted with readiness might be the means of reconciling them to each other from this his feelings naturally turned towards julia and without very nicely measuring the distance between a soldier of fortune who expected that her fathers attestation would deliver him from confinement and the heiress of that fathers wealth and expectations he was building the gayest castle in the clouds and varnishing it with all the tints of a summerevening sky when his labour was interrupted by a loud knocking at the outer gate answered by the barking of the gaunt halfstarved mastiff which was quartered in the courtyard as an addition to the garrison after much scrupulous precaution the gate was opened and some person admitted the housedoor was next unbarred unlocked and unchained a dogs feet pattered upstairs in great haste and the animal was heard scratching and whining at the door of the room next a heavy step was heard lumbering up and macguffogs voice in the character of pilotthis way this way take care of the step thats the room bertrams door was then unbolted and to his great surprise and joy his terrier wasp rushed into the apartment and almost devoured him with caresses followed by the massy form of his friend from charlies hope  eh whow eh whow ejaculated the honest farmer as he looked round upon his friends miserable apartment and wretched accommodationwhats this ot whats this ot  just a trick of fortune my good friend said bertram rising and shaking him heartily by the hand thats all  but what will be done about it or what can be done about it said honest dandie ist for debt or what ist for  why it is not for debt answered bertram and if you have time to sit down ill tell you all i know of the matter myself  if i hae time said dandie with an accent on the word that sounded like a howl of derision ou what the deevil am i come here for man but just ance errand to see about it but yell no be the waur o something to eat i trow its getting late at een i telld the folk at the change where i put up dumple to send ower my supper here and the chield macguffog is agreeable to let it in i hae settled a that and now lets hear your story whisht wasp man wow but hes glad to see you poor thing  bertrams story being confined to the accident of hazlewood and the confusion made between his own identity and that of one of the smugglers who had been active in the assault of woodbourne and chanced to bear the same name was soon told dinmont listened very attentively aweel he said this suld be nae sic dooms desperate business surely the lads doing weel again that was hurt and what signifies twa or three lead draps in his shouther if ye had putten out his ee it would hae been another case but eh as i wuss auld sherra pleydell was to the fore here od he was the man for sorting them and the queerest roughspoken deevil too that ever ye heard  but now tell me my excellent friend how did you find out i was here  od lad queerly eneugh said dandie but ill tell ye that after we are done wi our supper for it will maybe no be sae weel to speak about it while that langlugged limmer o a lass is gaun flisking in and out o the room  bertrams curiosity was in some degree put to rest by the appearance of the supper which his friend had ordered which although homely enough had the appetising cleanliness in which mrs macguffogs cookery was so eminently deficient dinmont also premising he had ridden the whole day since breakfasttime without tasting anything to speak of which qualifying phrase related to about three pounds of cold roast mutton which he had discussed at his midday stagedinmont i say fell stoutly upon the good cheer and like one of homers heroes said little either good or bad till the rage of thirst and hunger was appeased at length after a draught of homebrewed ale he began by observing aweel aweel that hen looking upon the lamentable relics of what had been once a large fowl wasna a bad ane to be bred at a town end though its no like our barndoor chuckies at charlies hope and i am glad to see that this vexing job hasna taen awa your appetite captain  why really my dinner was not so excellent mr dinmont as to spoil my supper  i daresay no i daresay no said dandie but now hinny that ye hae brought us the brandy and the mug wi the het water and the sugar and a right ye may steek the door ye see for we wad hae some o our ain cracks the damsel accordingly retired and shut the door of the apartment to which she added the precaution of drawing a large bolt on the outside  as soon as she was gone dandie reconnoitred the premises listened at the keyhole as if he had been listening for the blowing of an otter and having satisfied himself that there were no eavesdroppers returned to the table and making himself what he called a gey stiff cheerer poked the fire and began his story in an undertone of gravity and importance not very usual with him  ye see captain i had been in edinbro for twa or three days looking after the burial of a friend that we hae lost and maybe i suld hae had something for my ride but theres disappointments in a things and wha can help the like o that and i had a wee bit law business besides but thats neither here nor there in short i had got my matters settled and hame i cam and the morn awa to the muirs to see what the herds had been about and i thought i might as weel gie a look to the touthope head where jock o dawston and me has the outcast about a march weel just as i was coming upon the bit i saw a man afore me that i kennd was nane o our herds and its a wild bit to meet ony other body so when i cam up to him it was tod gabriel the foxhunter so i says to him rather surprised like what are ye doing up amang the craws here without your hounds man are ye seeking the fox without the dogs so he said na gudeman but i wanted to see yoursell  ay said i and yell be wanting eilding now or something to pit ower the winter  na na quo he its no that im seeking but ye tak an unco concern in that captain brown that was staying wi you dye no  troth do i gabriel says i and what about him lad  says he theres mair tak an interest in him than you and some that i am bound to obey and its no just on my ain will that im here to tell you something about him that will no please you  faith naething will please me quo i thats no pleasing to him  and then quo he yell be illsorted to hear that hes like to be in the prison at portanferry if he disna tak a the better care o himsell for theres been warrants out to tak him as soon as he comes ower the water frae allonby and now gudeman an ever ye wish him weel ye maun ride down to portanferry and let nae grass grow at the nags heels and if ye find him in confinement ye maun stay beside him night and day for a day or twa for hell want friends that hae baith heart and hand and if ye neglect this yell never rue but ance for it will be for a your life  but safe us man quo i how did ye learn a this its an unco way between this and portanferry  never ye mind that quo he them that brought us the news rade night and day and ye maun be aff instantly if ye wad do ony gude and sae i have naething mair to tell ye sae he sat himsell doun and hirselled doun into the glen where it wad hae been ill following him wi the beast and i cam back to charlies hope to tell the gudewife for i was uncertain what to do it wad look uncolike i thought just to be sent out on a huntthegowk errand wi a landlouper like that but lord as the gudewife set up her throat about it and said what a shame it wad be if ye was to come to ony wrang an i could help ye and then in cam your letter that confirmed it so i took to the kist and out wi the pickle notes in case they should be needed and a the bairns ran to saddle dumple by great luck i had taen the other beast to edinbro sae dumple was as fresh as a rose sae aff i set and wasp wi me for ye wad really hae thought he kennd where i was gaun puir beast and here i am after a trot o sixty mile or near by but wasp rade thirty o them afore me on the saddle and the puir doggie balanced itsell as ane of the weans wad hae dune whether i trotted or cantered  in this strange story bertram obviously saw supposing the warning to be true some intimation of danger more violent and imminent than could be likely to arise from a few days imprisonment at the same time it was equally evident that some unknown friend was working in his behalf did you not say he asked dinmont that this man gabriel was of gipsy blood  it was een judged sae said dinmont and i think this maks it likely for they aye ken where the gangs o ilk ither are to be found and they can gar news flee like a footba through the country an they like an i forgat to tell ye theres been an unco inquiry after the auld wife that we saw in bewcastle the sheriffs had folk ower the limestane edge after her and down the hermitage and liddel and a gates and a reward offered for her to appear o fifty pound sterling nae less and justice forster hes had out warrants as i am telld in cumberland and an unco ranging and ripeing they have had a gates seeking for her but shell no be taen wi them unless she likes for a that  and how comes that said bertram  ou i dinna ken i daur say its nonsense but they say she has gathered the fernseed and can gang ony gate she likes like jock the giantkiller in the ballant wi his coat o darkness and his shoon o swiftness ony way shes a kind o queen amang the gipsies she is mair than a hundred year auld folk say and minds the coming in o the mosstroopers in the troublesome times when the stuarts were put awa sae if she canna hide hersell she kens them that can hide her weel eneugh ye needna doubt that od an i had kennd it had been meg merrilies yon night at tibb mumpss i wad taen care how i crossed her  bertram listened with great attention to this account which tallied so well in many points with what he had himself seen of this gipsy sibyl after a moments consideration he concluded it would be no breach of faith to mention what he had seen at derncleugh to a person who held meg in such reverence as dinmont obviously did he told his story accordingly often interrupted by ejaculations such as weel the like o that now or na deil an thats no something now  when our liddesdale friend had heard the whole to an end he shook his great black headweel ill uphaud theres baith gude and ill amang the gipsies and if they deal wi the enemy its a their ain business and no ours i ken what the streeking the corpse wad be weel eneugh thae smuggler deevils when ony o thems killed in a fray they ll send for a wife like meg far eneugh to dress the corpse od its a the burial they ever think o and then to be put into the ground without ony decency just like dogs but they stick to it that they ll be streekit and hae an auld wife when theyre dying to rhyme ower prayers and ballants and charms as they ca them rather than theyll hae a minister to come and pray wi themthats an auld threep o theirs and i am thinking the man that died will hae been ane o the folk that was shot when they burnt woodbourne  but my good friend woodbourne is not burnt said bertram  weel the better for them that bides int answered the storefarmer od we had it up the water wi us that there wasna a stane on the tap o anither but there was fighting ony way i daur to say it would be fine fun and as i said ye may take it on trust that thats been ane o the men killed there and that its been the gipsies that took your pockmanky when they fand the chaise stickin in the snaw they wadna pass the like o that it wad just come to their hand like the bowl o a pint stoup  but if this woman is a sovereign among them why was she not able to afford me open protection and to get me back my property  ou wha kens she has muckle to say wi them but whiles theyll tak their ain way for a that when theyre under temptation and then theres the smugglers that theyre aye leagued wi she maybe couldna manage them sae weel theyre aye banded thegither ive heard that the gipsies ken when the smugglers will come aff and where theyre to land better than the very merchants that deal wi them and then to the boot o that shes whiles crackedbrained and has a bee in her head they say that whether her spaeings and fortunetellings be true or no for certain she believes in them a hersell and is aye guiding hersell by some queer prophecy or anither so she disna aye gang the straight road to the well but deil o sic a story as yours wi glamour and dead folk and losing anes gate i ever heard out o the talebooks but whisht i hear the keeper coming  macguffog accordingly interrupted their discourse by the harsh harmony of the bolts and bars and showed his bloated visage at the opening door come mr dinmont we have put off locking up for an hour to oblige ye ye must go to your quarters  quarters man i intend to sleep here the night theres a spare bed in the captains room  its impossible answered the keeper  but i say it is possible and that i winna stir and theres a dram t ye  macguffog drank off the spirits and resumed his objection but its against rule sir ye have committed nae malefaction  ill break your head said the sturdy liddesdale man if ye say ony mair about it and that will be malefaction eneugh to entitle me to ae nights lodging wi you ony way  but i tell ye mr dinmont reiterated the keeper its against rule and i behoved to lose my post  weel macguffog said dandie i hae just twa things to say ye ken wha i am weel eneugh and that i wadna loose a prisoner  and how do i ken that answered the jailor  weel if ye dinna ken that said the resolute farmer ye ken this ye ken yere whiles obliged to be up our water in the way o your business now if ye let me stay quietly here the night wi the captain ise pay ye double fees for the room and if ye say no ye shall hae the best sarkfu o sair banes that ever ye had in your life the first time ye set a foot by liddel moat  aweel aweel gudeman said macguffog a wilfu man maun hae his way but if i am challenged for it by the justices i ken wha sall bear the wyte and having sealed this observation with a deep oath or two he retired to bed after carefully securing all the doors of the bridewell the bell from the town steeple tolled nine just as the ceremony was concluded  although its but early hours said the farmer who had observed that his friend looked somewhat pale and fatigued i think we had better lie down captain if yere no agreeable to another cheerer but troth yere nae glassbreaker and neither am i unless it be a screed wi the neighbours or when im on a ramble  bertram readily assented to the motion of his faithful friend but on looking at the bed felt repugnance to trust himself undressed to mrs macguffogs clean sheets  im muckle o your opinion captain said dandie od this bed looks as if a the colliers in sanquhar had been int thegither but itll no win through my muckle coat so saying he flung himself upon the frail bed with a force that made all its timbers crack and in a few moments gave audible signal that he was fast asleep bertram slipped off his coat and boots and occupied the other dormitory the strangeness of his destiny and the mysteries which appeared to thicken around him while he seemed alike to be persecuted and protected by secret enemies and friends arising out of a class of people with whom he had no previous connexion for some time occupied his thoughts fatigue however gradually composed his mind and in a short time he was as fast asleep as his companion and in this comfortable state of oblivion we must leave them until we acquaint the reader with some other circumstances which occurred about the same period       chapter xvii      say from whence      you owe this strange intelligence or why      upon this blasted heath you stop our way      with such prophetic greeting      speak i charge you            macbeth   upon the evening of the day when bertrams examination had taken place colonel mannering arrived at woodbourne from edinburgh he found his family in their usual state which probably so far as julia was concerned would not have been the case had she learned the news of bertrams arrest but as during the colonels absence the two young ladies lived much retired this circumstance fortunately had not reached woodbourne a letter had already made miss bertram acquainted with the downfall of the expectations which had been formed upon the bequest of her kinswoman whatever hopes that news might have dispelled the disappointment did not prevent her from joining her friend in affording a cheerful reception to the colonel to whom she thus endeavoured to express the deep sense she entertained of his paternal kindness she touched on her regret that at such a season of the year he should have made upon her account a journey so fruitless  that it was fruitless to you my dear said the colonel i do most deeply lament but for my own share i have made some valuable acquaintances and have spent the time i have been absent in edinburgh with peculiar satisfaction so that on that score there is nothing to be regretted even our friend the dominie is returned thrice the man he was from having sharpened his wits in controversy with the geniuses of the northern metropolis  of a surety said the dominie with great complacency i did wrestle and was not overcome though my adversary was cunning in his art  i presume said miss mannering the contest was somewhat fatiguing mr sampson  very much young lady howbeit i girded up my loins and strove against him  i can bear witness said the colonel i never saw an affair better contested the enemy was like the mahratta cavalry he assailed on all sides and presented no fair mark for artillery but mr sampson stood to his guns notwithstanding and fired away now upon the enemy and now upon the dust which he had raised but we must not fight our battles over again tonight tomorrow we shall have the whole at breakfast  the next morning at breakfast however the dominie did not make his appearance he had walked out a servant said early in the morning it was so common for him to forget his meals that his absence never deranged the family the housekeeper a decent oldfashioned presbyterian matron having as such the highest respect for sampsons theological acquisitions had it in charge on these occasions to take care that he was no sufferer by his absence of mind and therefore usually waylaid him on his return to remind him of his sublunary wants and to minister to their relief it seldom however happened that he was absent from two meals together as was the case in the present instance we must explain the cause of this unusual occurrence  the conversation which mr pleydell had held with mr mannering on the subject of the loss of harry bertram had awakened all the painful sensations which that event had inflicted upon sampson the affectionate heart of the poor dominie had always reproached him that his negligence in leaving the child in the care of frank kennedy had been the proximate cause of the murder of the one the loss of the other the death of mrs bertram and the ruin of the family of his patron it was a subject which he never conversed upon if indeed his mode of speech could be called conversation at any time but it was often present to his imagination the sort of hope so strongly affirmed and asserted in mrs bertrams last settlement had excited a corresponding feeling in the dominies bosom which was exasperated into a sort of sickening anxiety by the discredit with which pleydell had treated it assuredly thought sampson to himself he is a man of erudition and well skilled in the weighty matters of the law but he is also a man of humorous levity and inconsistency of speech and wherefore should he pronounce ex cathedra as it were on the hope expressed by worthy madam margaret bertram of singleside  all this i say the dominie thought to himself for had he uttered half the sentence his jaws would have ached for a month under the unusual fatigue of such a continued exertion the result of these cogitations was a resolution to go and visit the scene of the tragedy at warroch point where he had not been for many years not indeed since the fatal accident had happened the walk was a long one for the point of warroch lay on the farther side of the ellangowan property which was interposed between it and woodbourne besides the dominie went astray more than once and met with brooks swoln into torrents by the melting of the snow where he honest man had only the summer recollection of little trickling rills  at length however he reached the woods which he had made the object of his excursion and traversed them with care muddling his disturbed brains with vague efforts to recall every circumstance of the catastrophe it will readily be supposed that the influence of local situation and association was inadequate to produce conclusions different from those which he had formed under the immediate pressure of the occurrences themselves with many a weary sigh therefore and many a groan the poor dominie returned from his hopeless pilgrimage and weariedly plodded his way towards woodbourne debating at times in his altered mind a question which was forced upon him by the cravings of an appetite rather of the keenest namely whether he had breakfasted that morning or no it was in this twilight humour now thinking of the loss of the child then involuntarily compelled to meditate upon the somewhat incongruous subject of hung beef rolls and butter that his route which was different from that which he had taken in the morning conducted him past the small ruined tower or rather vestige of a tower called by the country people the kaim of derncleugh  the reader may recollect the description of this ruin in the twentyseventh chapter as the vault in which young bertram under the auspices of meg merrilies witnessed the death of hatteraicks lieutenant the tradition of the country added ghostly terrors to the natural awe inspired by the situation of this place which terrors the gipsies who so long inhabited the vicinity had probably invented or at least propagated for their own advantage it was said that during the times of the galwegian independence one hanlon macdingawaie brother to the reigning chief knarth macdingawaie murdered his brother and sovereign in order to usurp the principality from his infant nephew and that being pursued for vengeance by the faithful allies and retainers of the house who espoused the cause of the lawful heir he was compelled to retreat with a few followers whom he had involved in his crime to this impregnable tower called the kaim of derucleugh where he defended himself until nearly reduced by famine when setting fire to the place he and the small remaining garrison desperately perished by their own swords rather than fall into the hands of their exasperated enemies this tragedy which considering the wild times wherein it was placed might have some foundation in truth was larded with many legends of superstition and diablerie so that most of the peasants of the neighbourhood if benighted would rather have chosen to make a considerable circuit than pass these haunted walls the lights often seen around the tower when used as the rendezvous of the lawless characters by whom it was occasionally frequented were accounted for under authority of these tales of witchery in a manner at once convenient for the private parties concerned and satisfactory to the public  now it must be confessed that our friend sampson although a profound scholar and mathematician had not travelled so far in philosophy as to doubt the reality of witchcraft or apparitions born indeed at a time when a doubt in the existence of witches was interpreted as equivalent to a justification of their infernal practices a belief of such legends had been impressed upon the dominie as an article indivisible from his religious faith and perhaps it would have been equally difficult to have induced him to doubt the one as the other with these feelings and in a thick misty day which was already drawing to its close dominie sampson did not pass the kaim of derncleugh without some feelings of tacit horror  what then was his astonishment when on passing the doorthat door which was supposed to have been placed there by one of the latter lairds of ellangowan to prevent presumptuous strangers from incurring the dangers of the haunted vaultthat door supposed to be always locked and the key of which was popularly said to be deposited with the presbyterythat door that very door opened suddenly and the figure of meg merrilies well known though not seen for many a revolving year was placed at once before the eyes of the startled dominie she stood immediately before him in the footpath confronting him so absolutely that he could not avoid her except by fairly turning back which his manhood prevented him from thinking of  i kennd ye wad be here she said with her harsh and hollow voice i ken wha ye seek but ye maun do my bidding  get thee behind me said the alarmed dominie avoid ye conjuro te scelestissima nequissima spurcissima iniquissima atque miserrima conjuro te  meg stood her ground against this tremendous volley of superlatives which sampson hawked up from the pit of his stomach and hurled at her in thunder is the carl daft she said wi his glamour  conjuro continued the dominie abjuro contestor atque viriliter impero tibi  what in the name of sathan are ye feared for wi your french gibberish that would make a dog sick listen ye stickit stibbler to what i tell ye or ye sail rue it while theres a limb o ye hings to anither tell colonel mannering that i ken hes seeking me he kens and i ken that the blood will be wiped out and the lost will be found

and read and ride and rin for me tell him the times coming now and the weirds dreed and the wheels turning bid him look at the stars as he has looked at them before will ye mind a this  assuredly said the dominie i am dubious for woman i am perturbed at thy words and my flesh quakes to hear thee  theyll do you nae ill though and maybe muckle gude  avoid ye i desire no good that comes by unlawful means  fule body that thou art said meg stepping up to him with a frown of indignation that made her dark eyes flash like lamps from under her bent browsfule body if i meant ye wrang couldna i clod ye ower that craig and wad man ken how ye cam by your end mair than frank kennedy hear ye that ye worricow  in the name of all that is good said the dominie recoiling and pointing his long pewterheaded walking cane like a javelin at the supposed sorceressin the name of all that is good bide off hands i will not be handled woman stand off upon thine own proper peril desist i say i am strong lo i will resist here his speech was cut short for meg armed with supernatural strength as the dominie asserted broke in upon his guard put by a thrust which he made at her with his cane and lifted him into the vault as easily said he as i could sway a kitchens atlas  sit down there she said pushing the halfthrottled preacher with some violence against a broken chairsit down there and gather your wind and your senses ye black barrowtram o the kirk that ye are are ye fou or fasting  fasting from all but sin answered the dominie who recovering his voice and finding his exorcisms only served to exasperate the intractable sorceress thought it best to affect complaisance and submission inwardly conning over however the wholesome conjurations which he durst no longer utter aloud but as the dominies brain was by no means equal to carry on two trains of ideas at the same time a word or two of his mental exercise sometimes escaped and mingled with his uttered speech in a manner ludicrous enough especially as the poor man shrunk himself together after every escape of the kind from terror of the effect it might produce upon the irritable feelings of the witch  meg in the meanwhile went to a great black cauldron that was boiling on a fire on the floor and lifting the lid an odour was diffused through the vault which if the vapours of a witchs cauldron could in aught be trusted promised better things than the hellbroth which such vessels are usually supposed to contain it was in fact the savour of a goodly stew composed of fowls hares partridges and moorgame boiled in a large mess with potatoes onions and leeks and from the size of the cauldron appeared to be prepared for half a dozen of people at least so ye hae eat naething a day said meg heaving a large portion of this mess into a brown dish and strewing it savourily with salt and pepper footnote see note 4  nothing answered the dominie scelestissimathat is gudewife  hae then said she placing the dish before him theres what will warm your heart  i do not hunger maleficathat is to say mrs merrilies for he said unto himself the savour is sweet but it hath been cooked by a canidia or an ericthoe  if ye dinna eat instantly and put some saul in ye by the bread and the salt ill put it down your throat wi the cutty spoon scaulding as it is and whether ye will or no gape sinner and swallow        sampson afraid of eye of newt and toe of frog tigers chaudrons and so forth had determined not to venture but the smell of the stew was fast melting his obstinacy which flowed from his chops as it were in streams of water and the witchs threats decided him to feed hunger and fear are excellent casuists  saul said hunger feasted with the witch of endor and quoth fear the salt which she sprinkled upon the food showeth plainly it is not a necromantic banquet in which that seasoning never occurs and besides says hunger after the first spoonful it is savoury and refreshing viands  so ye like the meat said the hostess  yea answered the dominie and i give thee thanks sceleratissimawhich means mrs margaret  aweel eat your fill but an ye kennd how it was gotten ye maybe wadna like it sae weel sampsons spoon dropped in the act of conveying its load to his mouth theres been mony a moonlight watch to bring a that trade thegither continued meg the folk that are to eat that dinner thought little o your game laws  is that all thought sampson resuming his spoon and shovelling away manfully i will not lack my food upon that argument  now ye maun tak a dram  i will quoth sampson conjuro tethat is i thank you heartily for he thought to himself in for a penny in for a pound and he fairly drank the witchs health in a cupful of brandy when he had put this copestone upon megs good cheer he felt as he said mightily elevated and afraid of no evil which could befall unto him  will ye remember my errand now said meg merrilies i ken by the cast o your ee that yere anither man than when you cam in  i will mrs margaret repeated sampson stoutly i will deliver unto him the sealed epistle and will add what you please to send by word of mouth  then ill make it short says meg tell him to look at the stars without fail this night and to do what i desire him in that letter as he would wish      that bertrams right and bertrams might      should meet on ellangowan height i have seen him twice when he saw na me i ken when he was in this country first and i ken whats brought him back again up an to the gate yere ower lang here follow me  sampson followed the sibyl accordingly who guided him about a quarter of a mile through the woods by a shorter cut than he could have found for himself then they entered upon the common meg still marching before him at a great pace until she gained the top of a small hillock which overhung the road  here she said stand still here look how the setting sun breaks through yon cloud thats been darkening the lift a day see where the first stream o light fas its upon donagilds round tower the auldest tower in the castle o ellangowan thats no for naething see as its glooming to seaward abune yon sloop in the bay thats no for naething neither here i stood on this very spot said she drawing herself up so as not to lose one hairbreadth of her uncommon height and stretching out her long sinewy arm and clenched handhere i stood when i tauld the last laird o ellangowan what was coming on his house and did that fa to the ground na it hit even ower sair and here where i brake the wand of peace ower him here i stand again to bid god bless and prosper the just heir of ellangowan that will sune be brought to his ain and the best laird he shall be that ellangowan has seen for three hundred years ill no live to see it maybe but there will be mony a blythe ee see it though mine be closed and now abel sampson as ever ye loed the house of ellangowan away wi my message to the english colonel as if life and death were upon your haste  so saying she turned suddenly from the amazed dominie and regained with swift and long strides the shelter of the wood from which she had issued at the point where it most encroached upon the common sampson gazed after her for a moment in utter astonishment and then obeyed her directions hurrying to woodbourne at a pace very unusual for him exclaiming three times prodigious prodigious prodigious       chapter xviii      it is not madness      that i have utterd bring me to the test      and i the matter will reword which madness      would gambol from            hamlet   as mr sampson crossed the hall with a bewildered look mrs allan the good housekeeper who with the reverent attention which is usually rendered to the clergy in scotland was on the watch for his return sallied forth to meet himwhats this ot now mr sampson this is waur than ever yell really do yoursell some injury wi these lang fasts naethings sae hurtful to the stamach mr sampson if ye would but put some peppermint draps in your pocket or let barnes cut ye a sandwich  avoid thee quoth the dominie his mind running still upon his interview with meg merrilies and making for the diningparlour  na ye needna gang in there the cloths been removed an hour syne and the colonels at his wine but just step into my room i have a nice steak that the cook will do in a moment  exorciso te said sampson that is i have dined  dined its impossible wha can ye hae dined wi you that gangs out nae gate  with beelzebub i believe said the minister  na then hes bewitched for certain said the housekeeper letting go her hold hes bewitched or hes daft and ony way the colonel maun just guide him his ain gate waes me hech sirs its a sair thing to see learning bring folk to this and with this compassionate ejaculation she retreated into her own premises  the object of her commiseration had by this time entered the diningparlour where his appearance gave great surprise he was mud up to the shoulders and the natural paleness of his hue was twice as cadaverous as usual through terror fatigue and perturbation of mind  what on earth is the meaning of this mr sampson said mannering who observed miss bertram looking much alarmed for her simple but attached friend  exorciso said the dominie  how sir replied the astonished colonel  i crave pardon honourable sir but my wits  are gone a woolgathering i think pray mr sampson collect yourself and let me know the meaning of all this  sampson was about to reply but finding his latin formula of exorcism still came most readily to his tongue he prudently desisted from the attempt and put the scrap of paper which he had received from the gipsy into mannerings hand who broke the seal and read it with surprise this seems to be some jest he said and a very dull one  it came from no jesting person said mr sampson  from whom then did it come demanded mannering  the dominie who often displayed some delicacy of recollection in cases where miss bertram had an interest remembered the painful circumstances connected with meg merrilies looked at the young ladies and remained silent we will join you at the teatable in an instant julia said the colonel i see that mr sampson wishes to speak to me alone and now they are gone what in heavens name mr sampson is the meaning of all this  it may be a message from heaven said the dominie but it came by beelzebubs postmistress it was that witch meg merrilies who should have been burned with a tarbarrel twenty years since for a harlot thief witch and gipsy  are you sure it was she said the colonel with great interest  sure honoured sir of a truth she is one not to be forgotten the like o meg merrilies is not to be seen in any land  the colonel paced the room rapidly cogitating with himself to send out to apprehend her but it is too distant to send to macmorlan and sir robert hazlewood is a pompous coxcomb besides the chance of not finding her upon the spot or that the humour of silence that seized her before may again return no i will not to save being thought a fool neglect the course she points out many of her class set out by being impostors and end by becoming enthusiasts or hold a kind of darkling conduct between both lines unconscious almost when they are cheating themselves or when imposing on others well my course is a plain one at any rate and if my efforts are fruitless it shall not be owing to overjealousy of my own character for wisdom  with this he rang the bell and ordering barnes into his private sittingroom gave him some orders with the result of which the reader may be made hereafter acquainted  we must now take up another adventure which is also to be woven into the story of this remarkable day  charles hazlewood had not ventured to make a visit at woodbourne during the absence of the colonel indeed mannerings whole behaviour had impressed upon him an opinion that this would be disagreeable and such was the ascendency which the successful soldier and accomplished gentleman had attained over the young mans conduct that in no respect would he have ventured to offend him he saw or thought he saw in colonel mannerings general conduct an approbation of his attachment to miss bertram but then he saw still more plainly the impropriety of any attempt at a private correspondence of which his parents could not be supposed to approve and he respected this barrier interposed betwixt them both on mannerings account and as he was the liberal and zealous protector of miss bertram no said he to himself i will not endanger the comfort of my lucys present retreat until i can offer her a home of her own  with this valorous resolution which he maintained although his horse from constant habit turned his head down the avenue of woodbourne and although he himself passed the lodge twice every day charles hazlewood withstood a strong inclination to ride down just to ask how the young ladies were and whether he could be of any service to them during colonel mannerings absence but on the second occasion he felt the temptation so severe that he resolved not to expose himself to it a third time and contenting himself with sending hopes and inquiries and so forth to woodbourne he resolved to make a visit long promised to a family at some distance and to return in such time as to be one of the earliest among mannerings visitors who should congratulate his safe arrival from his distant and hazardous expedition to edinburgh accordingly he made out his visit and having arranged matters so as to be informed within a few hours after colonel mannering reached home he finally resolved to take leave of the friends with whom he had spent the intervening time with the intention of dining at woodbourne where he was in a great measure domesticated and this for he thought much more deeply on the subject than was necessary would he flattered himself appear a simple natural and easy mode of conducting himself  fate however of which lovers make so many complaints was in this case unfavourable to charles hazlewood his horses shoes required an alteration in consequence of the fresh weather having decidedly commenced the lady of the house where he was a visitor chose to indulge in her own room till a very late breakfast hour his friend also insisted on showing him a litter of puppies which his favourite pointer bitch had produced that morning the colours had occasioned some doubts about the paternitya weighty question of legitimacy to the decision of which hazlewoods opinion was called in as arbiter between his friend and his groom and which inferred in its consequences which of the litter should be drowned which saved besides the laird himself delayed our young lovers departure for a considerable time endeavouring with long and superfluous rhetoric to insinuate to sir robert hazlewood through the medium of his son his own particular ideas respecting the line of a meditated turnpike road it is greatly to the shame of our young lovers apprehension that after the tenth reiterated account of the matter he could not see the advantage to be obtained by the proposed road passing over the lang hirst windy knowe the goodhouse park hailziecroft and then crossing the river at simons pool and so by the road to kippletringan and the less eligible line pointed out by the english surveyor which would go clear through the main enclosures at hazlewood and cut within a mile or nearly so of the house itself destroying the privacy and pleasure as his informer contended of the grounds in short the adviser whose actual interest was to have the bridge built as near as possible to a farm of his own failed in every effort to attract young hazlewoods attention until he mentioned by chance that the proposed line was favoured by that fellow glossin who pretended to take a lead in the county on a sudden young hazlewood became attentive and interested and having satisfied himself which was the line that glossin patronised assured his friend it should not be his fault if his father did not countenance any other instead of that but these various interruptions consumed the morning hazlewood got on horseback at least three hours later than he intended and cursing fine ladies pointers puppies and turnpike acts of parliament saw himself detained beyond the time when he could with propriety intrude upon the family at woodbourne  he had passed therefore the turn of the road which led to that mansion only edified by the distant appearance of the blue smoke curling against the pale sky of the winter evening when he thought he beheld the dominie taking a footpath for the house through the woods he called after him but in vain for that honest gentleman never the most susceptible of extraneous impressions had just that moment parted from meg merrilies and was too deeply wrapt up in pondering upon her vaticinations to make any answer to hazlewoods call he was therefore obliged to let him proceed without inquiry after the health of the young ladies or any other fishing question to which he might by good chance have had an answer returned wherein miss bertrams name might have been mentioned all cause for haste was now over and slackening the reins upon his horses neck he permitted the animal to ascend at his own leisure the steep sandy track between two high banks which rising to a considerable height commanded at length an extensive view of the neighbouring country  hazlewood was however so far from eagerly looking forward to this prospect though it had the recommendation that great part of the land was his fathers and must necessarily be his own that his head still turned backward towards the chimneys of woodbourne although at every step his horse made the difficulty of employing his eyes in that direction become greater from the reverie in which he was sunk he was suddenly roused by a voice too harsh to be called female yet too shrill for a man whats kept you on the road sae lang maun ither folk do your wark  he looked up the spokeswoman was very tall had a voluminous handkerchief rolled round her head grizzled hair flowing in elflocks from beneath it a long red cloak and a staff in her hand headed with a sort of spearpoint it was in short meg merrilies hazlewood had never seen this remarkable figure before he drew up his reins in astonishment at her appearance and made a full stop i think continued she they that hae taen interest in the house of ellangowan suld sleep nane this night three men hae been seeking ye and you are gaun hame to sleep in your bed d ye think if the ladbairn fas the sister will do weel na na  i dont understand you good woman said hazlewood if you speak of miss i mean of any of the late ellangowan family tell me what i can do for them  of the late ellangowan family she answered with great vehemenceof the late ellangowan family and when was there ever or when will there ever be a family of ellangowan but bearing the gallant name of the bauld bertrams  but what do you mean good woman  i am nae good woman a the country kens i am bad eneugh and baith they and i may be sorry eneugh that i am nae better but i can do what good women canna and daurna do i can do what would freeze the blood o them that is bred in biggit was for naething but to bind bairns heads and to hap them in the cradle hear me the guards drawn off at the customhouse at portanferry and its brought up to hazlewood house by your fathers orders because he thinks his house is to be attacked this night by the smugglers theres naebody means to touch his house he has gude blood and gentle bloodi say little o him for himsellbut theres naebody thinks him worth meddling wi send the horsemen back to their post cannily and quietly see an they winna hae wark the night ay will they the guns will flash and the swords will glitter in the braw moon  good god what do you mean said young hazlewood your words and manner would persuade me you are mad and yet there is a strange combination in what you say  i am not mad exclaimed the gipsy i have been imprisoned for madscourged for madbanished for madbut mad i am not hear ye charles hazlewood of hazlewood dye bear malice against him that wounded you  no dame god forbid my arm is quite well and i have always said the shot was discharged by accident i should be glad to tell the young man so himself  then do what i bid ye answered meg merrilies and ye ll do him mair gude than ever he did you ill for if he was left to his illwishers he would be a bloody corpse ere morn or a banished man but theres ane abune a do as i bid you send back the soldiers to portanferry theres nae mair fear o hazlewood house than theres o cruffel fell and she vanished with her usual celerity of pace  it would seem that the appearance of this female and the mixture of frenzy and enthusiasm in her manner seldom failed to produce the strongest impression upon those whom she addressed her words though wild were too plain and intelligible for actual madness and yet too vehement and extravagant for soberminded communication she seemed acting under the influence of an imagination rather strongly excited than deranged and it is wonderful how palpably the difference in such cases is impressed upon the mind of the auditor this may account for the attention with which her strange and mysterious hints were heard and acted upon it is certain at least that young hazlewood was strongly impressed by her sudden appearance and imperative tone he rode to hazlewood at a brisk pace it had been dark for some time before he reached the house and on his arrival there he saw a confirmation of what the sibyl had hinted  thirty dragoon horses stood under a shed near the offices with their bridles linked together three or four soldiers attended as a guard while others stamped up and down with their long broadswords and heavy boots in front of the house hazlewood asked a noncommissioned officer from whence they came  from portanferry  had they left any guard there  no they had been drawn off by order of sir robert hazlewood for defence of his house against an attack which was threatened by the smugglers  charles hazlewood instantly went in quest of his father and having paid his respects to him upon his return requested to know upon what account he had thought it necessary to send for a military escort sir robert assured his son in reply that from the information intelligence and tidings which had been communicated to and laid before him he had the deepest reason to believe credit and be convinced that a riotous assault would that night be attempted and perpetrated against hazlewood house by a set of smugglers gipsies and other desperadoes  and what my dear sir said his son should direct the fury of such persons against ours rather than any other house in the country  i should rather think suppose and be of opinion sir answered sir robert with deference to your wisdom and experience that on these occasions and times the vengeance of such persons is directed or levelled against the most important and distinguished in point of rank talent birth and situation who have checked interfered with and discountenanced their unlawful and illegal and criminal actions or deeds  young hazlewood who knew his fathers foible answered that the cause of his surprise did not lie where sir robert apprehended but that he only wondered they should think of attacking a house where there were so many servants and where a signal to the neighbouring tenants could call in such strong assistance and added that he doubted much whether the reputation of the family would not in some degree suffer from calling soldiers from their duty at the customhouse to protect them as if they were not sufficiently strong to defend themselves upon any ordinary occasion he even hinted that in case their houses enemies should observe that this precaution had been taken unnecessarily there would be no end of their sarcasms  sir robert hazlewood was rather puzzled at this intimation for like most dull men he heartily hated and feared ridicule he gathered himself up and looked with a sort of pompous embarrassment as if he wished to be thought to despise the opinion of the public which in reality he dreaded  i really should have thought he said that the injury which had already been aimed at my house in your person being the next heir and representative of the hazlewood family failing mei should have thought and believed i say that this would have justified me sufficiently in the eyes of the most respectable and the greater part of the people for taking such precautions as are calculated to prevent and impede a repetition of outrage  really sir said charles i must remind you of what i have often said before that i am positive the discharge of the piece was accidental  sir it was not accidental said his father angrily but you will be wiser than your elders  really sir replied hazlewood in what so intimately concerns myself  sir it does not concern you but in a very secondary degree that is it does not concern you as a giddy young fellow who takes pleasure in contradicting his father but it concerns the country sir and the county sir and the public sir and the kingdom of scotland in so far as the interest of the hazlewood family sir is committed and interested and put in peril in by and through you sir and the fellow is in safe custody and mr glossin thinks  mr glossin sir  yes sir the gentleman who has purchased ellangowan you know who i mean i suppose  yes sir answered the young man but i should hardly have expected to hear you quote such authority why this fellowall the world knows him to be sordid mean tricking and i suspect him to be worse and you yourself my dear sir when did you call such a person a gentleman in your life before  why charles i did not mean gentleman in the precise sense and meaning and restricted and proper use to which no doubt the phrase ought legitimately to be confined but i meant to use it relatively as marking something of that state to which he has elevated and raised himself as designing in short a decent and wealthy and estimable sort of a person  allow me to ask sir said charles if it was by this mans orders that the guard was drawn from portanferry  sir replied the baronet i do apprehend that mr glossin would not presume to give orders or even an opinion unless asked in a matter in which hazlewood house and the house of hazlewoodmeaning by the one this mansionhouse of my family and by the other typically metaphorically and parabolically the family itselfi say then where the house of hazlewood or hazlewood house was so immediately concerned  i presume however sir said the son this glossin approved of the proposal  sir replied his father i thought it decent and right and proper to consult him as the nearest magistrate as soon as report of the intended outrage reached my ears and although he declined out of deference and respect as became our relative situations to concur in the order yet he did entirely approve of my arrangement  at this moment a horses feet were heard coming very fast up the avenue in a few minutes the door opened and mr macmorlan presented himself i am under great concern to intrude sir robert but  give me leave mr macmorlan said sir robert with a gracious flourish of welcome this is no intrusion sir for your situation as sheriffsubstitute calling upon you to attend to the peace of the county and you doubtless feeling yourself particularly called upon to protect hazlewood house you have an acknowledged and admitted and undeniable right sir to enter the house of the first gentleman in scotland uninvitedalways presuming you to be called there by the duty of your office  it is indeed the duty of my office said macmorlan who waited with impatience an opportunity to speak that makes me an intruder  no intrusion reiterated the baronet gracefully waving his hand  but permit me to say sir robert said the sheriffsubstitute i do not come with the purpose of remaining here but to recall these soldiers to portanferry and to assure you that i will answer for the safety of your house  to withdraw the guard from hazlewood house exclaimed the proprietor in mingled displeasure and surprise and you will be answerable for it and pray who are you sir that i should take your security and caution and pledge official or personal for the safety of hazlewood house i think sir and believe sir and am of opinion sir that if any one of these family pictures were deranged or destroyed or injured it would be difficult for me to make up the loss upon the guarantee which you so obligingly offer me  in that case i shall be sorry for it sir robert answered the downright macmorlan but i presume i may escape the pain of feeling my conduct the cause of such irreparable loss as i can assure you there will be no attempt upon hazlewood house whatever and i have received information which induces me to suspect that the rumour was put afloat merely in order to occasion the removal of the soldiers from portanferry and under this strong belief and conviction i must exert my authority as sheriff and chief magistrate of police to order the whole or greater part of them back again i regret much that by my accidental absence a good deal of delay has already taken place and we shall not now reach portanferry until it is late  as mr macmorlan was the superior magistrate and expressed himself peremptory in the purpose of acting as such the baronet though highly offended could only say very well sir it is very well nay sir take them all with you i am far from desiring any to be left here sir we sir can protect ourselves sir but you will have the goodness to observe sir that you are acting on your own proper risk sir and peril sir and responsibility sir if anything shall happen or befall to hazlewood house sir or the inhabitants sir or to the furniture and paintings sir  i am acting to the best of my judgment and information sir robert said macmorlan and i must pray of you to believe so and to pardon me accordingly i beg you to observe it is no time for ceremony it is already very late  but sir robert without deigning to listen to his apologies immediately employed himself with much parade in arming and arraying his domestics charles hazlewood longed to accompany the military which were about to depart for portanferry and which were now drawn up and mounted by direction and under the guidance of mr macmorlan as the civil magistrate but it would have given just pain and offence to his father to have left him at a moment when he conceived himself and his mansionhouse in danger young hazlewood therefore gazed from a window with suppressed regret and displeasure until he heard the officer give the word of commandfrom the right to the front by files march leading file to the right wheel trot the whole party of soldiers then getting into a sharp and uniform pace were soon lost among the trees and the noise of the hoofs died speedily away in the distance       chapter xix      wi coulters and wi forehammers      we garrd the bars bang merrily      until we came to the inner prison      where willie o kinmont he did lie            old border ballad   we return to portanferry and to bertram and his honesthearted friend whom we left most innocent inhabitants of a place built for the guilty the slumbers of the farmer were as sound as it was possible  but bertrams first heavy sleep passed away long before midnight nor could he again recover that state of oblivion added to the uncertain and uncomfortable state of his mind his body felt feverish and oppressed this was chiefly owing to the close and confined air of the small apartment in which they slept after enduring for some time the broiling and suffocating feeling attendant upon such an atmosphere he rose to endeavour to open the window of the apartment and thus to procure a change of air alas the first trial reminded him that he was in jail and that the building being contrived for security not comfort the means of procuring fresh air were not left at the disposal of the wretched inhabitants  disappointed in this attempt he stood by the unmanageable window for some time little wasp though oppressed with the fatigue of his journey on the preceding day crept out of bed after his master and stood by him rubbing his shaggy coat against his legs and expressing by a murmuring sound the delight which he felt at being restored to him thus accompanied and waiting until the feverish feeling which at present agitated his blood should subside into a desire for warmth and slumber bertram remained for some time looking out upon the sea  the tide was now nearly full and dashed hoarse and near below the base of the building now and then a large wave reached even the barrier or bulwark which defended the foundation of the house and was flung up on it with greater force and noise than those which only broke upon the sand far in the distance under the indistinct light of a hazy and often overclouded moon the ocean rolled its multitudinous complication of waves crossing bursting and mingling with each other  a wild and dim spectacle said bertram to himself like those crossing tides of fate which have tossed me about the world from my infancy upwards when will this uncertainty cease and how soon shall i be permitted to look out for a tranquil home where i may cultivate in quiet and without dread and perplexity those arts of peace from which my cares have been hitherto so forcibly diverted the ear of fancy it is said can discover the voice of seanymphs and tritons amid the bursting murmurs of the ocean would that i could do so and that some siren or proteus would arise from these billows to unriddle for me the strange maze of fate in which i am so deeply entangled happy friend he said looking at the bed where dinmont had deposited his bulky person thy cares are confined to the narrow round of a healthy and thriving occupation thou canst lay them aside at pleasure and enjoy the deep repose of body and mind which wholesome labour has prepared for thee  at this moment his reflections were broken by little wasp who attempting to spring up against the window began to yelp and bark most furiously the sounds reached dinmonts ears but without dissipating the illusion which had transported him from this wretched apartment to the free air of his own green hills hoy yarrow man far yaud far yaud he muttered between his teeth imagining doubtless that he was calling to his sheepdog and hounding him in shepherds phrase against some intruders on the grazing the continued barking of the terrier within was answered by the angry challenge of the mastiff in the courtyard which had for a long time been silent excepting only an occasional short and deep note uttered when the moon shone suddenly from among the clouds now his clamour was continued and furious and seemed to be excited by some disturbance distinct from the barking of wasp which had first given him the alarm and which with much trouble his master had contrived to still into an angry note of low growling  at last bertram whose attention was now fully awakened conceived that he saw a boat upon the sea and heard in good earnest the sound of oars and of human voices mingling with the dash of the billows some benighted fishermen he thought or perhaps some of the desperate traders from the isle of man they are very hardy however to approach so near to the customhouse where there must be sentinels it is a large boat like a longboat and full of people perhaps it belongs to the revenue service bertram was confirmed in this last opinion by observing that the boat made for a little quay which ran into the sea behind the customhouse and jumping ashore one after another the crew to the number of twenty hands glided secretly up a small lane which divided the customhouse from the bridewell and disappeared from his sight leaving only two persons to take care of the boat  the dash of these mens oars at first and latterly the suppressed sounds of their voices had excited the wrath of the wakeful sentinel in the courtyard who now exalted his deep voice into such a horrid and continuous din that it awakened his brute master as savage a bandog as himself his cry from a window of how now tearum whats the matter sir down dn ye down produced no abatement of tearums vociferation which in part prevented his master from hearing the sounds of alarm which his ferocious vigilance was in the act of challenging but the mate of the twolegged cerberus was gifted with sharper ears than her husband she also was now at the window bt ye gae down and let loose the dog she said theyre sporting the door of the customhouse and the auld sap at hazlewood house has ordered off the guard but ye hae nae mair heart than a cat and down the amazon sallied to perform the task herself while her helpmate more jealous of insurrection within doors than of storm from without went from cell to cell to see that the inhabitants of each were carefully secured  these latter sounds with which we have made the reader acquainted had their origin in front of the house and were consequently imperfectly heard by bertram whose apartment as we have already noticed looked from the back part of the building upon the sea he heard however a stir and tumult in the house which did not seem to accord with the stern seclusion of a prison at the hour of midnight and connecting them with the arrival of an armed boat at that dead hour could not but suppose that something extraordinary was about to take place in this belief he shook dinmont by the shoulder eh ay oh ailie woman its no time to get up yet groaned the sleeping man of the mountains more roughly shaken however he gathered himself up shook his ears and asked in the name of providence whats the matter  that i cant tell you replied bertram but either the place is on fire or some extraordinary thing is about to happen are you not sensible of a smell of fire do you not hear what a noise there is of clashing doors within the house and of hoarse voices murmurs and distant shouts on the outside upon my word i believe something very extraordinary has taken place get up for the love of heaven and let us be on our guard  dinmont rose at the idea of danger as intrepid and undismayed as any of his ancestors when the beaconlight was kindled od captain this is a queer place they winna let ye out in the day and they winna let ye sleep in the night deil but it wad break my heart in a fortnight but lordsake what a racket theyre making now od i wish we had some light wasp wasp whisht hinny whisht my bonnie man and lets hear what theyre doing deils in ye will ye whisht  they sought in vain among the embers the means of lighting their candle and the noise without still continued dinmont in his turn had recourse to the windowlordsake captain come here od they hae broken the customhouse  bertram hastened to the window and plainly saw a miscellaneous crowd of smugglers and blackguards of different descriptions some carrying lighted torches others bearing packages and barrels down the lane to the boat that was lying at the quay to which two or three other fisherboats were now brought round they were loading each of these in their turn and one or two had already put off to seaward this speaks for itself said bertram but i fear something worse has happened do you perceive a strong smell of smoke or is it my fancy  fancy answered dinmont theres a reek like a killogie od if they burn the customhouse it will catch here and well lunt like a tarbarrel a thegither eh it wad be fearsome to be burnt alive for naething like as if ane had been a warlock macguffog hear ye roaring at the top of his voice an ye wad ever hae a haill bane in your skin lets out man lets out  the fire began now to rise high and thick clouds of smoke rolled past the window at which bertram and dinmont were stationed sometimes as the wind pleased the dim shroud of vapour hid everything from their sight sometimes a red glare illuminated both land and sea and shone full on the stern and fierce figures who wild with ferocious activity were engaged in loading the boats the fire was at length triumphant and spouted in jets of flame out at each window of the burning building while huge flakes of flaming materials came driving on the wind against the adjoining prison and rolling a dark canopy of smoke over all the neighbourhood the shouts of a furious mob resounded far and wide for the smugglers in their triumph were joined by all the rabble of the little town and neighbourhood now aroused and in complete agitation notwithstanding the lateness of the hour some from interest in the free trade and most from the general love of mischief and tumult natural to a vulgar populace  bertram began to be seriously anxious for their fate there was no stir in the house it seemed as if the jailor had deserted his charge and left the prison with its wretched inhabitants to the mercy of the conflagration which was spreading towards them in the meantime a new and fierce attack was heard upon the outer gate of the correction house which battered with sledgehammers and crows was soon forced the keeper as great a coward as a bully with his more ferocious wife had fled their servants readily surrendered the keys the liberated prisoners celebrating their deliverance with the wildest yells of joy mingled among the mob which had given them freedom  in the midst of the confusion that ensued three or four of the principal smugglers hurried to the apartment of bertram with lighted torches and armed with cutlasses and pistols der deyvil said the leader heres our mark and two of them seized on bertram but one whispered in his ear make no resistance till you are in the street the same individual found an instant to say to dinmontfollow your friend and help when you see the time come  in the hurry of the moment dinmont obeyed and followed close the two smugglers dragged bertram along the passage downstairs through the courtyard now illuminated by the glare of fire and into the narrow street to which the gate opened where in the confusion the gang were necessarily in some degree separated from each other a rapid noise as of a body of horse advancing seemed to add to the disturbance hagel and wetter what is that said the leader keep together kinder look to the prisoner but in spite of his charge the two who held bertram were the last of the party  the sounds and signs of violence were heard in front the press became furiously agitated while some endeavoured to defend themselves others to escape shots were fired and the glittering broadswords of the dragoons began to appear flashing above the heads of the rioters now said the warning whisper of the man who held bertrams left arm the same who had spoken before shake off that fellow and follow me  bertram exerting his strength suddenly and effectually easily burst from the grasp of the man who held his collar on the right side the fellow attempted to draw a pistol but was prostrated by a blow of dinmonts fist which an ox could hardly have received without the same humiliation follow me quick said the friendly partizan and dived through a very narrow and dirty lane which led from the main street  no pursuit took place the attention of the smugglers had been otherwise and very disagreeably engaged by the sudden appearance of macmorlan and the party of horse the loud manly voice of the provincial magistrate was heard proclaiming the riot act and charging all those unlawfully assembled to disperse at their own proper peril this interruption would indeed have happened in time sufficient to have prevented the attempt had not the magistrate received upon the road some false information which led him to think that the smugglers were to land at the bay of ellangowan nearly two hours were lost in consequence of this false intelligence which it may be no lack of charity to suppose that glossin so deeply interested in the issue of that nights daring attempt had contrived to throw in macmorlans way availing himself of the knowledge that the soldiers had left hazlewood house which would soon reach an ear so anxious as his  in the meantime bertram followed his guide and was in his turn followed by dinmont the shouts of the mob the trampling of the horses the dropping pistolshots sunk more and more faintly upon their ears when at the end of the dark lane they found a postchaise with four horses are you here in gods name said the guide to the postilion who drove the leaders  ay troth am i answered jock jabos and i wish i were ony gate else  open the carriage then you gentlemen get into it in a short time youll be in a place of safety and to bertram remember your promise to the gipsy wife  bertram resolving to be passive in the hands of a person who had just rendered him such a distinguished piece of service got into the chaise as directed dinmont followed wasp who had kept close by them sprung in at the same time and the carriage drove off very fast have a care o me said dinmont but this is the queerest thing yet od i trust theyll no coup us and then whats to come o dumple i would rather be on his back than in the deukes coach god bless him  bertram observed that they could not go at that rapid rate to any very great distance without changing horses and that they might insist upon remaining till daylight at the first inn they stopped at or at least upon being made acquainted with the purpose and termination of their journey and mr dinmont might there give directions about his faithful horse which would probably be safe at the stables where he had left him aweel aweel een sae be it for dandie od if we were ance out o this trindling kist o a thing i am thinking they wad find it hard wark to gar us gang ony gate but where we liked oursells  while he thus spoke the carriage making a sudden turn showed them through the left window the village at some distance still widely beaconed by the fire which having reached a storehouse wherein spirits were deposited now rose high into the air a wavering column of brilliant light they had not long time to admire this spectacle for another turn of the road carried them into a close lane between plantations through which the chaise proceeded in nearly total darkness but with unabated speed       chapter xx      the night drave on wi sangs and clatter      and aye the ale was growing better            tam oshanter   we must now return to woodbourne which it may be remembered we left just after the colonel had given some directions to his confidential servant when he returned his absence of mind and an unusual expression of thought and anxiety upon his features struck the ladies whom he joined in the drawingroom mannering was not however a man to be questioned even by those whom he most loved upon the cause of the mental agitation which these signs expressed the hour of tea arrived and the party were partaking of that refreshment in silence when a carriage drove up to the door and the bell announced the arrival of a visitor surely said mannering it is too soon by some hours  there was a short pause when barnes opening the door of the saloon announced mr pleydell in marched the lawyer whose wellbrushed black coat and wellpowdered wig together with his point ruffles brown silk stockings highlyvarnished shoes and gold buckles exhibited the pains which the old gentleman had taken to prepare his person for the ladies society he was welcomed by mannering with a hearty shake by the hand the very man i wished to see at this moment  yes said the counsellor i told you i would take the first opportunity so i have ventured to leave the court for a week in session timeno common sacrifice but i had a notion i could be useful and i was to attend a proof here about the same time but will you not introduce me to the young ladies ah there is one i should have known at once from her family likeness miss lucy bertram my love i am most happy to see you and he folded her in his arms and gave her a hearty kiss on each side of the face to which lucy submitted in blushing resignation  on narrete pas dans un si beau chemin continued the gay old gentleman and as the colonel presented him to julia took the same liberty with that fair ladys cheek julia laughed coloured and disengaged herself i beg a thousand pardons said the lawyer with a bow which was not at all professionally awkward age and old fashions give privileges and i can hardly say whether i am most sorry just now at being too well entitled to claim them at all or happy in having such an opportunity to exercise them so agreeably  upon my word sir said miss mannering laughing if you make such flattering apologies we shall begin to doubt whether we can admit you to shelter yourself under your alleged qualifications  i can assure you julia said the colonel you are perfectly right my friend the counsellor is a dangerous person the last time i had the pleasure of seeing him he was closeted with a fair lady who had granted him a teteatete at eight in the morning  ay but colonel said the counsellor you should add i was more indebted to my chocolate than my charms for so distinguished a favour from a person of such propriety of demeanour as mrs rebecca  and that should remind me mr pleydell said julia to offer you tea that is supposing you have dined  anything miss mannering from your hands answered the gallant jurisconsult yes i have dined that is to say as people dine at a scotch inn  and that is indifferently enough said the colonel with his hand upon the bellhandle give me leave to order something  why to say truth replied mr pleydell i had rather not i have been inquiring into that matter for you must know i stopped an instant below to pull off my boothose a world too wide for my shrunk shanks glancing down with some complacency upon limbs which looked very well for his time of life and i had some conversation with your barnes and a very intelligent person whom i presume to be the housekeeper and it was settled among us tota re perspectai beg miss mannerings pardon for my latinthat the old lady should add to your light family supper the more substantial refreshment of a brace of wild ducks i told her always under deep submission my poor thoughts about the sauce which concurred exactly with her own and if you please i would rather wait till they are ready before eating anything solid  and we will anticipate our usual hour of supper said the colonel  with all my heart said pleydell providing i do not lose the ladies company a moment the sooner i am of counsel with my old friend burnet footnote see note 5 i love the coena the supper of the ancients the pleasant meal and social glass that wash out of ones mind the cobwebs that business or gloom have been spinning in our brains all day  the vivacity of mr pleydells look and manner and the quietness with which he made himself at home on the subject of his little epicurean comforts amused the ladies but particularly miss mannering who immediately gave the counsellor a great deal of flattering attention and more pretty things were said on both sides during the service of the teatable than we have leisure to repeat  as soon as this was over mannering led the counsellor by the arm into a small study which opened from the saloon and where according to the custom of the family there were always lights and a good fire in the evening  i seesaid mr pleydell you have got something to tell me about the ellangowan business is it terrestrial or celestial what says my military albumazar have you calculated the course of futurity have you consulted your ephemerides your almochoden your almuten  no truly counsellor replied mannering you are the only ptolemy i intend to resort to upon the present occasion a second prospero i have broken my staff and drowned my book far beyond plummet depth but i have great news notwithstanding meg merrilies our egyptian sibyl has appeared to the dominie this very day and as i conjecture has frightened the honest man not a little  indeed  ay and she has done me the honour to open a correspondence with me supposing me to be as deep in astrological mysteries as when we first met here is her scroll delivered to me by the dominie  pleydell put on his spectacles a vile greasy scrawl indeed and the letters are uncial or semiuncial as somebody calls your large text hand and in size and perpendicularity resemble the ribs of a roasted pig i can hardly make it out  read aloud said mannering  i will try answered the lawyer you are a good seeker but a bad finder you set yourself to prop a falling house but had a gey guess it would rise again lend your hand to the work thats near as you lent your ee to the weird that was far have a carriage this night by ten oclock at the end of the crooked dykes at portanferry and let it bring the folk to woodbourne that shall ask them if they be there in gods namestay here follows some poetry       dark shall be light      and wrong done to right      when bertrams right and bertrams might      shall meet on ellangowans height  a most mystic epistle truly and closes in a vein of poetry worthy of the cumaean sibyl and what have you done  why said mannering rather reluctantly i was loth to risk any opportunity of throwing light on this business the woman is perhaps crazed and these effusions may arise only from visions of her imagination but you were of opinion that she knew more of that strange story than she ever told  and so said pleydell you sent a carriage to the place named  you will laugh at me if i own i did replied the colonel  who i replied the advocate no truly i think it was the wisest thing you could do  yes answered mannering well pleased to have escaped the ridicule he apprehended you know the worst is paying the chaisehire i sent a postchaise and four from kippletringan with instructions corresponding to the letter the horses will have a long and cold station on the outpost tonight if our intelligence be false  ay but i think it will prove otherwise said the lawyer this woman has played a part till she believes it or if she be a thoroughpaced impostor without a single grain of selfdelusion to qualify her knavery still she may think herself bound to act in character this i know that i could get nothing out of her by the common modes of interrogation and the wisest thing we can do is to give her an opportunity of making the discovery her own way and now have you more to say or shall we go to the ladies  why my mind is uncommonly agitated answered the colonel andbut i really have no more to say only i shall count the minutes till the carriage returns but you cannot be expected to be so anxious  why no use is all in all said the more experienced lawyer i am much interested certainly but i think i shall be able to survive the interval if the ladies will afford us some music  and with the assistance of the wild ducks by and by suggested mannering  true colonel a lawyers anxiety about the fate of the most interesting cause has seldom spoiled either his sleep or digestion footnote see note 6 and yet i shall be very eager to hear the rattle of these wheels on their return notwithstanding  so saying he rose and led the way into the next room where miss mannering at his request took her seat at the harpsichord lucy bertram who sung her native melodies very sweetly was accompanied by her friend upon the instrument and julia afterwards performed some of scarlattis sonatas with great brilliancy the old lawyer scraping a little upon the violoncello and being a member of the gentlemens concert in edinburgh was so greatly delighted with this mode of spending the evening that i doubt if he once thought of the wild ducks until barnes informed the company that supper was ready  tell mrs allan to have something in readiness said the colonel i expectthat is i hopeperhaps some company may be here tonight and let the men sit up and do not lock the upper gate on the lawn until i desire you  lord sir said julia whom can you possibly expect tonight  why some persons strangers to me talked of calling in the evening on business answered her father not without embarrassment for he would have little brooked a disappointment which might have thrown ridicule on his judgment it is quite uncertain  well we shall not pardon them for disturbing our party said julia unless they bring as much goodhumour and as susceptible hearts as my friend and admirer for so he has dubbed himself mr pleydell  ah miss julia said pleydell offering his arm with an air of gallantry to conduct her into the eatingroom the time has been when i returned from utrecht in the year 1738  pray dont talk of it answered the young lady we like you much better as you are utrecht in heavens name i daresay you have spent all the intervening years in getting rid so completely of the effects of your dutch education  o forgive me miss mannering said the lawyer the dutch are a much more accomplished people in point of gallantry than their volatile neighbours are willing to admit they are constant as clockwork in their attentions  i should tire of that said julia  imperturbable in their good temper continued pleydell  worse and worse said the young lady  and then said the old beau garcon although for six times three hundred and sixtyfive days your swain has placed the capuchin round your neck and the stove under your feet and driven your little sledge upon the ice in winter and your cabriole through the dust in summer you may dismiss him at once without reason or apology upon the two thousand one hundred and ninetieth day which according to my hasty calculation and without reckoning leapyears will complete the cycle of the supposed adoration and that without your amiable feelings having the slightest occasion to be alarmed for the consequences to those of mynheer  well replied julia that last is truly a dutch recommendation mr pleydell crystal and hearts would lose all their merit in the world if it were not for their fragility  why upon that point of the argument miss mannering it is as difficult to find a heart that will break as a glass that will not and for that reason i would press the value of mine own were it not that i see mr sampsons eyes have been closed and his hands clasped for some time attending the end of our conference to begin the grace and to say the truth the appearance of the wild ducks is very appetising so saying the worthy counsellor sat himself to table and laid aside his gallantry for awhile to do honour to the good things placed before him nothing further is recorded of him for some time excepting an observation that the ducks were roasted to a single turn and that mrs allans sauce of claret lemon and cayenne was beyond praise  i see said miss mannering i have a formidable rival in mr pleydells favour even on the very first night of his avowed admiration  pardon me my fair lady answered the counsellor your avowed rigour alone has induced me to commit the solecism of eating a good supper in your presence how shall i support your frowns without reinforcing my strength upon the same principle and no other i will ask permission to drink wine with you  this is the fashion of utrecht also i suppose mr pleydell  forgive me madam answered the counsellor the french themselves the patterns of all that is gallant term their tavernkeepers restaurateurs alluding doubtless to the relief they afford the disconsolate lover when bowed down to the earth by his mistresss severity my own case requires so much relief that i must trouble you for that other wing mr sampson without prejudice to my afterwards applying to miss bertram for a tart be pleased to tear the wing sir instead of cutting it off mr barnes will assist you mr sampson thank you sir and mr barnes a glass of ale if you please  while the old gentleman pleased with miss mannerings liveliness and attention rattled away for her amusement and his own the impatience of colonel mannering began to exceed all bounds he declined sitting down at table under pretence that he never eat supper and traversed the parlour in which they were with hasty and impatient steps now throwing up the window to gaze upon the dark lawn now listening for the remote sound of the carriage advancing up the avenue at length in a feeling of uncontrollable impatience he left the room took his hat and cloak and pursued his walk up the avenue as if his so doing would hasten the approach of those whom he desired to see i really wish said miss bertram colonel mannering would not venture out after nightfall you must have heard mr pleydell what a cruel fright we had  o with the smugglers replied the advocate they are old friends of mine i was the means of bringing some of them to justice a long time since when sheriff of this county  and then the alarm we had immediately afterwards added miss bertram from the vengeance of one of these wretches  when young hazlewood was hurt i heard of that too  imagine my dear mr pleydell continued lucy how much miss mannering and i were alarmed when a ruffian equally dreadful for his great strength and the sternness of his features rushed out upon us  you must know mr pleydell said julia unable to suppress her resentment at this undesigned aspersion of her admirer that young hazlewood is so handsome in the eyes of the young ladies of this country that they think every person shocking who comes near him  oho thought pleydell who was by profession an observer of tones and gestures theres something wrong here between my young friendswell miss mannering i have not seen young hazlewood since he was a boy so the ladies may be perfectly right but i can assure you in spite of your scorn that if you want to see handsome men you must go to holland the prettiest fellow i ever saw was a dutchman in spite of his being called vanbost or vanbuster or some such barbarous name he will not be quite so handsome now to be sure  it was now julias turn to look a little out of countenance at the chance hit of her learned admirer but that instant the colonel entered the room i can hear nothing of them yet he said still however we will not separate where is dominie sampson  here honoured sir  what is that book you hold in your hand mr sampson  its even the learned de lyra sir i would crave his honour mr pleydells judgment always with his best leisure to expound a disputed passage  i am not in the vein mr sampson answered pleydell heres metal more attractive i do not despair to engage these two young ladies in a glee or a catch wherein i even i myself will adventure myself for the bass part hang de lyra man keep him for a fitter season  the disappointed dominie shut his ponderous tome much marvelling in his mind how a person possessed of the lawyers erudition could give his mind to these frivolous toys but the counsellor indifferent to the high character for learning which he was trifling away filled himself a large glass of burgundy and after preluding a little with a voice somewhat the worse for the wear gave the ladies a courageous invitation to join in we be three poor mariners and accomplished his own part therein with great eclat  are you not withering your roses with sitting up so late my young ladies said the colonel  not a bit sir answered julia your friend mr pleydell threatens to become a pupil of mr sampsons tomorrow so we must make the most of our conquest tonight  this led to another musical trial of skill and that to lively conversation at length when the solitary sound of one oclock had long since resounded on the ebon ear of night and the next signal of the advance of time was close approaching mannering whose impatience had long subsided into disappointment and despair looked at his watch and said we must now give them up when at that instantbut what then befell will require a separate chapter       chapter xxi      justice this does indeed confirm each circumstance      the gipsy told      no orphan nor without a friend art thou      i am thy father heres thy mother there      thy uncle this thy first cousin and these      are all thy near relations            the critic   as mannering replaced his watch he heard a distant and hollow sound it is a carriage for certain no it is but the sound of the wind among the leafless trees do come to the window mr pleydell the counsellor who with his large silk handkerchief in his hand was expatiating away to julia upon some subject which he thought was interesting obeyed the summons first however wrapping the handkerchief round his neck by way of precaution against the cold air the sound of wheels became now very perceptible and pleydell as if he had reserved all his curiosity till that moment ran out to the hall the colonel rung for barnes to desire that the persons who came in the carriage might be shown into a separate room being altogether uncertain whom it might contain it stopped however at the door before his purpose could be fully explained a moment after mr pleydell called out heres our liddesdale friend i protest with a strapping young fellow of the same calibre his voice arrested dinmont who recognised him with equal surprise and pleasure od if its your honour well a be as right and tight as thack and rape can make us  but while the farmer stopped to make his bow bertram dizzied with the sudden glare of light and bewildered with the circumstances of his situation almost unconsciously entered the open door of the parlour and confronted the colonel who was just advancing towards it the strong light of the apartment left no doubt of his identity and he himself was as much confounded with the appearance of those to whom he so unexpectedly presented himself as they were by the sight of so utterly unlookedfor an object it must be remembered that each individual present had their own peculiar reasons for looking with terror upon what seemed at first sight a spectral apparition mannering saw before him the man whom he supposed he had killed in india julia beheld her lover in a most peculiar and hazardous situation and lucy bertram at once knew the person who had fired upon young hazlewood bertram who interpreted the fixed and motionless astonishment of the colonel into displeasure at his intrusion hastened to say that it was involuntary since he had been hurried hither without even knowing whither he was to be transported  mr brown i believe said colonel mannering  yes sir replied the young man modestly but with firmness the same you knew in india and who ventures to hope that what you did then know of him is not such as should prevent his requesting you would favour him with your attestation to his character as a gentleman and man of honour  mr brown i have been seldomneverso much surprised certainly sir in whatever passed between us you have a right to command my favourable testimony  at this critical moment entered the counsellor and dinmont the former beheld to his astonishment the colonel but just recovering from his first surprise lucy bertram ready to faint with terror and miss mannering in an agony of doubt and apprehension which she in vain endeavoured to disguise or suppress what is the meaning of all this said he has this young fellow brought the gorgons head in his hand let me look at him by heaven he muttered to himself the very image of old ellangowan yes the same manly form and handsome features but with a world of more intelligence in the face yes the witch has kept her word then instantly passing to lucy look at that man miss bertram my dear have you never seen any one like him  lucy had only ventured one glance at this object of terror by which however from his remarkable height and appearance she at once recognised the supposed assassin of young hazlewood a conviction which excluded of course the more favourable association of ideas which might have occurred on a closer view dont ask me about him sir said she turning away her eyes send him away for heavens sake we shall all be murdered  murdered wheres the poker said the advocate in some alarm but nonsense we are three men besides the servants and there is honest liddesdale worth halfadozen to boot we have the major vis upon our side however here my friend dandiedaviewhat do they call you keep between that fellow and us for the protection of the ladies  lord mr pleydell said the astonished farmer thats captain brown d ye no ken the captain  nay if hes a friend of yours we may be safe enough answered pleydell but keep near him  all this passed with such rapidity that it was over before the dominie had recovered himself from a fit of absence shut the book which he had been studying in a corner and advancing to obtain a sight of the strangers exclaimed at once upon beholding bertram if the grave can give up the dead that is my dear and honoured master  were right after all by heaven i was sure i was right said the lawyer he is the very image of his father come colonel what do you think of that you do not bid your guest welcome i thinki believei trust were right never saw such a likeness but patience dominie say not a word sit down young gentleman  i beg pardon sir if i am as i understand in colonel mannerings house i should wish first to know if my accidental appearance here gives offence or if i am welcome  mannering instantly made an effort welcome most certainly especially if you can point out how i can serve you i believe i may have some wrongs to repair towards you i have often suspected so but your sudden and unexpected appearance connected with painful recollections prevented my saying at first as i now say that whatever has procured me the honour of this visit it is an acceptable one  bertram bowed with an air of distant yet civil acknowledgment to the grave courtesy of mannering  julia my love you had better retire mr brown you will excuse my daughter there are circumstances which i perceive rush upon her recollection  miss mannering rose and retired accordingly yet as she passed bertram could not suppress the words infatuated a second time but so pronounced as to be heard by him alone miss bertram accompanied her friend much surprised but without venturing a second glance at the object of her terror some mistake she saw there was and was unwilling to increase it by denouncing the stranger as an assassin he was known she saw to the colonel and received as a gentleman certainly he either was not the person she suspected or hazlewood was right in supposing the shot accidental  the remaining part of the company would have formed no bad group for a skilful painter each was too much embarrassed with his own sensations to observe those of the others bertram most unexpectedly found himself in the house of one whom he was alternately disposed to dislike as his personal enemy and to respect as the father of julia mannering was struggling between his high sense of courtesy and hospitality his joy at finding himself relieved from the guilt of having shed life in a private quarrel and the former feelings of dislike and prejudice which revived in his haughty mind at the sight of the object against whom he had entertained them sampson supporting his shaking limbs by leaning on the back of a chair fixed his eyes upon bertram with a staring expression of nervous anxiety which convulsed his whole visage dinmont enveloped in his loose shaggy greatcoat and resembling a huge bear erect upon his hinder legs stared on the whole scene with great round eyes that witnessed his amazement  the counsellor alone was in his element shrewd prompt and active he already calculated the prospect of brilliant success in a strange eventful and mysterious lawsuit and no young monarch flushed with hopes and at the head of a gallant army could experience more glee when taking the field on his first campaign he bustled about with great energy and took the arrangement of the whole explanation upon himself  come come gentlemen sit down this is all in my province you must let me arrange it for you sit down my dear colonel and let me manage sit down mr brown aut quocunque alio nomine vocaris dominie take your seat draw in your chair honest liddesdale  i dinna ken mr pleydell said dinmont looking at his dreadnought coat then at the handsome furniture of the room i had maybe better gang some gate else and leave ye till your cracks im no just that weel put on  the colonel who by this time recognised dandie immediately went up and bid him heartily welcome assuring him that from what he had seen of him in edinburgh he was sure his rough coat and thicksoled boots would honour a royal drawingroom  na na colonel were just plain upthecountry folk but nae doubt i would fain hear o ony pleasure that was gaun to happen the captain and im sure a will gae right if mr pleydell will take his bit job in hand  youre right dandie spoke like a hieland footnote it may not be unnecessary to tell southern readers that the mountainous country in the south western borders of scotland is called hieland though totally different from the much more mountainous and more extensive districts of the north usually called hielands oracle and now be silent well you are all seated at last take a glass of wine till i begin my catechism methodically and now turning to bertram my dear boy do you know who or what you are  in spite of his perplexity the catechumen could not help laughing at this commencement and answered indeed sir i formerly thought i did but i own late circumstances have made me somewhat uncertain  then tell us what you formerly thought yourself  why i was in the habit of thinking and calling myself vanbeest brown who served as a cadet or volunteer under colonel mannering when he commanded theregiment in which capacity i was not unknown to him  there said the colonel i can assure mr brown of his identity and add what his modesty may have forgotten that he was distinguished as a young man of talent and spirit  so much the better my dear sir said mr pleydell but that is to general character mr brown must tell us where he was born  in scotland i believe but the place uncertain  where educated  in holland certainly  do you remember nothing of your early life before you left scotland  very imperfectly yet i have a strong idea perhaps more deeply impressed upon me by subsequent hard usage that i was during my childhood the object of much solicitude and affection i have an indistinct remembrance of a goodlooking man whom i used to call papa and of a lady who was infirm in health and who i think must have been my mother but it is an imperfect and confused recollection i remember too a tall thin kindtempered man in black who used to teach me my letters and walk out with me and i think the very last time  here the dominie could contain no longer while every succeeding word served to prove that the child of his benefactor stood before him he had struggled with the utmost difficulty to suppress his emotions but when the juvenile recollections of bertram turned towards his tutor and his precepts he was compelled to give way to his feelings he rose hastily from his chair and with clasped hands trembling limbs and streaming eyes called out aloud harry bertram look at me was i not the man  yes said bertram starting from his seat as if a sudden light had burst in upon his mind yes that was my name and that is the voice and the figure of my kind old master  the dominie threw himself into his arms pressed him a thousand times to his bosom in convulsions of transport which shook his whole frame sobbed hysterically and at length in the emphatic language of scripture lifted up his voice and wept aloud colonel mannering had recourse to his handkerchief pleydell made wry faces and wiped the glasses of his spectacles and honest dinmont after two loud blubbering explosions exclaimed deils in the man hes garrd me do that i haena done since my auld mither died  come come said the counsellor at last silence in the court we have a clever party to contend with we must lose no time in gathering our information for anything i know there may be something to be done before daybreak  i will order a horse to be saddled if you please said the colonel  no no time enough time enough but come dominie i have allowed you a competent space to express your feelings i must circumduce the term you must let me proceed in my examination  the dominie was habitually obedient to any one who chose to impose commands upon him he sunk back into his chair spread his chequered handkerchief over his face to serve as i suppose for the grecian painters veil and from the action of his folded hands appeared for a time engaged in the act of mental thanksgiving he then raised his eyes over the screen as if to be assured that the pleasing apparition had not melted into air then again sunk them to resume his internal act of devotion until he felt himself compelled to give attention to the counsellor from the interest which his questions excited  and now said mr pleydell after several minute inquiries concerning his recollection of early eventsand now mr bertramfor i think we ought in future to call you by your own proper namewill you have the goodness to let us know every particular which you can recollect concerning the mode of your leaving scotland  indeed sir to say the truth though the terrible outlines of that day are strongly impressed upon my memory yet somehow the very terror which fixed them there has in a great measure confounded and confused the details i recollect however that i was walking somewhere or other in a wood i think  o yes it was in warroch wood my dear said the dominie  hush mr sampson said the lawyer  yes it was in a wood continued bertram as long past and confused ideas arranged themselves in his reviving recollection and some one was with me this worthy and affectionate gentleman i think  o ay ay harry lord bless thee it was even i myself  be silent dominie and dont interrupt the evidence said pleydell and so sir to bertram  and so sir continued bertram like one of the changes of a dream i thought i was on horseback before my guide  no no exclaimed sampson never did i put my own limbs not to say thine into such peril  on my word this is intolerable look ye dominie if you speak another word till i give you leave i will read three sentences out of the black acts whisk my cane round my head three times undo all the magic of this nights work and conjure harry bertram back again into vanbeest brown  honoured and worthy sir groaned out the dominie i humbly crave pardon it was but verbum volans  well nolens volens you must hold your tongue said pleydell  pray be silent mr sampson said the colonel it is of great consequence to your recovered friend that you permit mr pleydell to proceed in his inquiries  i am mute said the rebuked dominie  on a sudden continued bertram two or three men sprung out upon us and we were pulled from horseback i have little recollection of anything else but that i tried to escape in the midst of a desperate scuffle and fell into the arms of a very tall woman who started from the bushes and protected me for some time the rest is all confusion and dread a dim recollection of a seabeach and a cave and of some strong potion which lulled me to sleep for a length of time in short it is all a blank in my memory until i recollect myself first an illused and halfstarved cabinboy aboard a sloop and then a schoolboy in holland under the protection of an old merchant who had taken some fancy for me  and what account said mr pleydell did your guardian give of your parentage  a very brief one answered bertram and a charge to inquire no farther i was given to understand that my father was concerned in the smuggling trade carried on on the eastern coast of scotland and was killed in a skirmish with the revenue officers that his correspondents in holland had a vessel on the coast at the time part of the crew of which were engaged in the affair and that they brought me off after it was over from a motive of compassion as i was left destitute by my fathers death as i grew older there was much of this story seemed inconsistent with my own recollections but what could i do i had no means of ascertaining my doubts nor a single friend with whom i could communicate or canvass them the rest of my story is known to colonel mannering i went out to india to be a clerk in a dutch house their affairs fell into confusion i betook myself to the military profession and i trust as yet i have not disgraced it  thou art a fine young fellow ill be bound for thee said pleydell and since you have wanted a father so long i wish from my heart i could claim the paternity myself but this affair of young hazlewood  was merely accidental said bertram i was travelling in scotland for pleasure and after a weeks residence with my friend mr dinmont with whom i had the good fortune to form an accidental acquaintance  it was my gude fortune that said dinmont odd my brains wad hae been knockit out by twa blackguards if it hadna been for his four quarters  shortly after we parted at the town ofi lost my baggage by thieves and it was while residing at kippletringan i accidentally met the young gentleman as i was approaching to pay my respects to miss mannering whom i had known in india mr hazlewood conceiving my appearance none of the most respectable commanded me rather haughtily to stand back and so gave occasion to the fray in which i had the misfortune to be the accidental means of wounding him and now sir that i have answered all your questions  no no not quite all said pleydell winking sagaciously there are some interrogatories which i shall delay till tomorrow for it is time i believe to close the sederunt for this night or rather morning  well then sir said the young man to vary the phrase since i have answered all the questions which you have chosen to ask tonight will you be so good as to tell me who you are that take such interest in my affairs and whom you take me to be since my arrival has occasioned such commotion  why sir for myself replied the counsellor i am paulus pleydell an advocate at the scottish bar and for you it is not easy to say distinctly who you are at present but i trust in a short time to hail you by the title of henry bertram esq representative of one of the oldest families in scotland and heir of tailzie and provision to the estate of ellangowan ay continued he shutting his eyes and speaking to himself we must pass over his father and serve him heir to his grandfather lewis the entailer the only wise man of his family that i ever heard of  they had now risen to retire to their apartments for the night when colonel mannering walked up to bertram as he stood astonished at the counsellors words i give you joy he said of the prospects which fate has opened before you i was an early friend of your father and chanced to be in the house of ellangowan as unexpectedly as you are now in mine upon the very night in which you were born i little knew this circumstance whenbut i trust unkindness will be forgotten between us believe me your appearance here as mr brown alive and well has relieved me from most painful sensations and your right to the name of an old friend renders your presence as mr bertram doubly welcome  and my parents said bertram  are both no more and the family property has been sold but i trust may be recovered whatever is wanted to make your right effectual i shall be most happy to supply  nay you may leave all that to me said the counsellor t is my vocation hal i shall make money of it  im sure its no for the like ome observed dinmont to speak to you gentlefolks but if siller would help on the captains plea and they say nae plea gangs ain weel without it  except on saturday night said pleydell  ay but when your honour wadna take your fee ye wadna hae the cause neither sae ill neer fash you on a saturday at een again but i was saying theres some siller in the spleuchan thats like the captains ain for weve aye counted it such baith ailie and me  no no liddesdale no occasion no occasion whatever keep thy cash to stock thy farm  to stock my farm mr pleydell your honour kens mony things but ye dinna ken the farm o charlies hope its sae weel stockit already that we sell maybe sax hundred pounds off it ilka year flesh and fell the gither na na  cant you take another then  i dinna ken the deukes no that fond o led farms and he canna bide to put away the auld tenantry and then i wadna like mysell to gang about whistling footnote see note 7 and raising the rent on my neighbours  what not upon thy neighbour at dawstondevilstonehow d ye call the place  what on jock o dawston hout na hes a camsteary chield and fasheous about marches and weve had some bits o splores thegither but deil omeif i wad wrang jock o dawston neither  thourt an honest fellow said the lawyer get thee to bed thou wilt sleep sounder i warrant thee than many a man that throws off an embroidered coat and puts on a laced nightcap colonel i see you are busy with our enfant trouve but barnes must give me a summons of wakening at seven tomorrow morning for my servants a sleepyheaded fellow and i daresay my clerk driver has had clarences fate and is drowned by this time in a butt of your ale for mrs allan promised to make him comfortable and shell soon discover what he expects from that engagement goodnight colonel goodnight dominie sampson goodnight dinmont the downright goodnight last of all to the newfound representative of the bertrams and the macdingawaies the knarths the arths the godfreys the dennises and the rolands and last and dearest title heir of tailzie and provision of the lands and barony of ellangowan under the settlement of lewis bertram esq whose representative you are  and so saying the old gentleman took his candle and left the room and the company dispersed after the dominie had once more hugged and embraced his little harry bertram as he continued to call the young soldier of six feet high       chapter xxii                         my imagination        carries no favour in it but bertrams        i am undone there is no living none        if bertram be away                          alls well that ends well   at the hour which he had appointed the preceding evening the indefatigable lawyer was seated by a good fire and a pair of wax candles with a velvet cap on his head and a quilted silk nightgown on his person busy arranging his memoranda of proofs and indications concerning the murder of frank kennedy an express had also been despatched to mr macmorlan requesting his attendance at woodbourne as soon as possible on business of importance dinmont fatigued with the events of the evening before and finding the accommodations of woodbourne much preferable to those of macguffog was in no hurry to rise the impatience of bertram might have put him earlier in motion but colonel mannering had intimated an intention to visit him in his apartment in the morning and he did not choose to leave it before this interview he had dressed himself barnes having by his masters orders supplied him with every accommodation of linen etc and now anxiously waited the promised visit of his landlord  in a short time a gentle tap announced the colonel with whom bertram held a long and satisfactory conversation each however concealed from the other one circumstance mannering could not bring himself to acknowledge the astrological prediction and bertram was from motives which may be easily conceived silent respecting his love for julia in other respects their intercourse was frank and grateful to both and had latterly upon the colonels part even an approach to cordiality bertram carefully measured his own conduct by that of his host and seemed rather to receive his offered kindness with gratitude and pleasure than to press for it with solicitation  miss bertram was in the breakfastparlour when sampson shuffled in his face all radiant with smilesa circumstance so uncommon that lucys first idea was that somebody had been bantering him with an imposition which had thrown him into this ecstasy having sate for some time rolling his eyes and gaping with his mouth like the great wooden head at merlins exhibition he at length beganand what do you think of him miss lucy  think of whom mr sampson asked the young lady  of harnoof him that you know about again demanded the dominie  that i know about replied lucy totally at a loss to comprehend his meaning  yes the stranger you know that came last evening in the post vehicle he who shot young hazelwood ha ha ha burst forth the dominie with a laugh that sounded like neighing  indeed mr sampson said his pupil you have chosen a strange subject for mirth i think nothing about the man only i hope the outrage was accidental and that we need not fear a repetition of it  accidental ha ha ha again whinnied sampson  really mr sampson said lucy somewhat piqued you are unusually gay this morning  yes of a surety i am ha ha ho facetious ho ho ha  so unusually facetious my dear sir pursued the young lady that i would wish rather to know the meaning of your mirth than to be amused with its effects only  you shall know it miss lucy replied poor abel do you remember your brother  good god how can you ask me no one knows better than you he was lost the very day i was born  very true very true answered the dominie saddening at the recollection i was strangely oblivious ay ay too true but you remember your worthy father  how should you doubt it mr sampson it is not so many weeks since  true true ay too true replied the dominie his houyhnhnm laugh sinking into a hysterical giggle i will be facetious no more under these remembrances but look at that young man  bertram at this instant entered the room yes look at him well he is your fathers living image and as god has deprived you of your dear parentso my children love one another  it is indeed my fathers face and form said lucy turning very pale bertram ran to support her the dominie to fetch water to throw upon her face which in his haste he took from the boiling teaurn when fortunately her colour returning rapidly saved her from the application of this illjudged remedy i conjure you to tell me mr sampson she said in an interrupted yet solemn voice is this my brother  it is it is miss lucy it is little harry bertram as sure as gods sun is in that heaven  and this is my sister said bertram giving way to all that family affection which had so long slumbered in his bosom for want of an object to expand itself upon  it is it isit is miss lucy bertram ejaculated sampson whom by my poor aid you will find perfect in the tongues of france and italy and even of spain in reading and writing her vernacular tongue and in arithmetic and bookkeeping by double and single entry i say nothing of her talents of shaping and hemming and governing a household which to give every one their due she acquired not from me but from the housekeeper nor do i take merit for her performance upon stringed instruments whereunto the instructions of an honourable young lady of virtue and modesty and very facetious withalmiss julia manneringhath not meanly contributed suum cuique tribuito  you then said bertram to his sister are all that remains to me last night but more fully this morning colonel mannering gave me an account of our family misfortunes though without saying i should find my sister here  that said lucy he left to this gentleman to tell youone of the kindest and most faithful of friends who soothed my fathers long sickness witnessed his dying moments and amid the heaviest clouds of fortune would not desert his orphan  god bless him for it said bertram shaking the dominies hand he deserves the love with which i have always regarded even that dim and imperfect shadow of his memory which my childhood retained  and god bless you both my dear children said sampson if it had not been for your sake i would have been contentedhad heavens pleasure so beento lay my head upon the turf beside my patron  but i trust said bertrami am encouraged to hope we shall all see better days all our wrongs shall be redressed since heaven has sent me means and friends to assert my right  friends indeed echoed the dominie and sent as you truly say by him to whom i early taught you to look up as the source of all that is good there is the great colonel mannering from the eastern indies a man of war from his birth upwards but who is not the less a man of great erudition considering his imperfect opportunities and there is moreover the great advocate mr pleydell who is also a man of great erudition but who descendeth to trifles unbeseeming thereof and there is mr andrew dinmont whom i do not understand to have possession of much erudition but who like the patriarchs of old is cunning in that which belongeth to flocks and herds lastly there is even i myself whose opportunities of collecting erudition as they have been greater than those of the aforesaid valuable persons have not if it becomes me to speak been pretermitted by me in so far as my poor faculties have enabled me to profit by them of a surety little harry we must speedily resume our studies i will begin from the foundation yes i will reform your education upward from the true knowledge of english grammar even to that of the hebrew or chaldaic tongue  the reader may observe that upon this occasion sampson was infinitely more profuse of words than he had hitherto exhibited himself the reason was that in recovering his pupil his mind went instantly back to their original connexion and he had in his confusion of ideas the strongest desire in the world to resume spelling lessons and halftext with young bertram this was the more ridiculous as towards lucy he assumed no such powers of tuition but she had grown up under his eye and had been gradually emancipated from his government by increase in years and knowledge and a latent sense of his own inferior tact in manners whereas his first ideas went to take up harry pretty nearly where he had left him from the same feelings of reviving authority he indulged himself in what was to him a profusion of language and as people seldom speak more than usual without exposing themselves he gave those whom he addressed plainly to understand that while he deferred implicitly to the opinions and commands if they chose to impose them of almost every one whom he met with it was under an internal conviction that in the article of erudition as he usually pronounced the word he was infinitely superior to them all put together at present however this intimation fell upon heedless ears for the brother and sister were too deeply engaged in asking and receiving intelligence concerning their former fortunes to attend much to the worthy dominie when colonel mannering left bertram he went to julias dressingroom and dismissed her attendant my dear sir she said as he entered you have forgot our vigils last night and have hardly allowed me time to comb my hair although you must be sensible how it stood on end at the various wonders which took place  it is with the inside of your head that i have some business at present julia i will return the outside to the care of your mrs mincing in a few minutes  lord papa replied miss mannering think how entangled all my ideas are and you to propose to comb them out in a few minutes if mincing were to do so in her department she would tear half the hair out of my head  well then tell me said the colonel where the entanglement lies which i will try to extricate with due gentleness  o everywhere said the young lady the whole is a wild dream  well then i will try to unriddle it he gave a brief sketch of the fate and prospects of bertram to which julia listened with an interest which she in vain endeavoured to disguise well concluded her father are your ideas on the subject more luminous  more confused than ever my dear sir said julia here is this young man come from india after he had been supposed dead like aboulfouaris the great voyager to his sister canzade and his provident brother hour i am wrong in the story i believecanzade was his wife but lucy may represent the one and the dominie the other and then this lively crackbrained scotch lawyer appears like a pantomime at the end of a tragedy and then how delightful it will be if lucy gets back her fortune  now i think said the colonel that the most mysterious part of the business is that miss julia mannering who must have known her fathers anxiety about the fate of this young man brown or bertram as we must now call him should have met him when hazlewoods accident took place and never once mentioned to her father a word of the matter but suffered the search to proceed against this young gentleman as a suspicious character and assassin  julia much of whose courage had been hastily assumed to meet the interview with her father was now unable to rally herself she hung down her head in silence after in vain attempting to utter a denial that she recollected brown when she met him  no answer well julia continued her father gravely but kindly allow me to ask you is this the only time you have seen brown since his return from india still no answer i must then naturally suppose that it is not the first time still no reply julia mannering will you have the kindness to answer me was it this young man who came under your window and conversed with you during your residence at mervyn hall julia i commandi entreat you to be candid  miss mannering raised her head i have been siri believe i am stillvery foolish and it is perhaps more hard upon me that i must meet this gentleman who has been though not the cause entirely yet the accomplice of my folly in your presence here she made a full stop  i am to understand then said mannering that this was the author of the serenade at mervyn hall  there was something in this allusive change of epithet that gave julia a little more courage he was indeed sir and if i am very wrong as i have often thought i have some apology  and what is that answered the colonel speaking quick and with something of harshness  i will not venture to name it sir but she opened a small cabinet and put some letters into his hands i will give you these that you may see how this intimacy began and by whom it was encouraged  mannering took the packet to the windowhis pride forbade a more distant retreat he glanced at some passages of the letters with an unsteady eye and an agitated mind his stoicism however came in time to his aidthat philosophy which rooted in pride yet frequently bears the fruits of virtue he returned towards his daughter with as firm an air as his feelings permitted him to assume  there is great apology for you julia as far as i can judge from a glance at these letters you have obeyed at least one parent let us adopt a scotch proverb the dominie quoted the other daylet bygones be bygones and fair play for the future i will never upbraid you with your past want of confidence do you judge of my future intentions by my actions of which hitherto you have surely had no reason to complain keep these letters they were never intended for my eye and i would not willingly read more of them than i have done at your desire and for your exculpation and now are we friends or rather do you understand me  o my dear generous father said julia throwing herself into his arms why have i ever for an instant misunderstood you  no more of that julia said the colonel we have both been to blame he that is too proud to vindicate the affection and confidence which he conceives should be given without solicitation must meet much and perhaps deserved disappointment it is enough that one dearest and most regretted member of my family has gone to the grave without knowing me let me not lose the confidence of a child who ought to love me if she really loves herself  o no danger no fear answered julia let me but have your approbation and my own and there is no rule you can prescribe so severe that i will not follow  well my love kissing her forehead i trust we shall not call upon you for anything too heroic with respect to this young gentlemans addresses i expect in the first place that all clandestine correspondence which no young woman can entertain for a moment without lessening herself in her own eyes and in those of her loveri request i say that clandestine correspondence of every kind may be given up and that you will refer mr bertram to me for the reason you will naturally wish to know what is to be the issue of such a reference in the first place i desire to observe this young gentlemans character more closely than circumstances and perhaps my own prejudices have permitted formerly i should also be glad to see his birth established not that i am anxious about his getting the estate of ellangowan though such a subject is held in absolute indifference nowhere except in a novel but certainly henry bertram heir of ellangowan whether possessed of the property of his ancestors or not is a very different person from vanbeest brown the son of nobody at all his fathers mr pleydell tells me are distinguished in history as following the banners of their native princes while our own fought at cressy and poirtiers in short i neither give nor withhold my approbation but i expect you will redeem past errors and as you can now unfortunately only have recourse to one parent that you will show the duty of a child by reposing that confidence in me which i will say my inclination to make you happy renders a filial debt upon your part  the first part of this speech affected julia a good deal the comparative merit of the ancestors of the bertrams and mannerings excited a secret smile but the conclusion was such as to soften a heart peculiarly open to the feelings of generosity no my dear sir she said extending her hand receive my faith that from this moment you shall be the first person consulted respecting what shall pass in future between browni mean bertramand me and that no engagement shall be undertaken by me excepting what you shall immediately know and approve of may i ask if mr bertram is to continue a guest at woodbourne  certainly said the colonel while his affairs render it advisable  then sir you must be sensible considering what is already past that he will expect some reason for my withdrawing i believe i must say the encouragement which he may think i have given  i expect julia answered mannering that he will respect my roof and entertain some sense perhaps of the services i am desirous to render him and so will not insist upon any course of conduct of which i might have reason to complain and i expect of you that you will make him sensible of what is due to both  then sir i understand you and you shall be implicitly obeyed  thank you my love my anxiety kissing her is on your account now wipe these witnesses from your eyes and so to breakfast       chapter xxiii           and sheriff i will engage my word to you           that i will by to morrow dinner time           send him to answer thee or any man           for anything he shall be charged withal            henry iv part i   when the several byplays as they may be termed had taken place among the individuals of the woodbourne family as we have intimated in the preceding chapter the breakfast party at length assembled dandie excepted who had consulted his taste in viands and perhaps in society by partaking of a cup of tea with mrs allan just laced with two teaspoonfuls of cogniac and reinforced with various slices from a huge round of beef he had a kind of feeling that he could eat twice as much and speak twice as much with this good dame and barnes as with the grand folk in the parlour indeed the meal of this less distinguished party was much more mirthful than that in the higher circle where there was an obvious air of constraint on the greater part of the assistants julia dared not raise her voice in asking bertram if he chose another cup of tea bertram felt embarrassed while eating his toast and butter under the eye of mannering lucy while she indulged to the uttermost her affection for her recovered brother began to think of the quarrel betwixt him and hazlewood the colonel felt the painful anxiety natural to a proud mind when it deems its slightest action subject for a moment to the watchful construction of others the lawyer while sedulously buttering his roll had an aspect of unwonted gravity arising perhaps from the severity of his morning studies as for the dominie his state of mind was ecstatic he looked at bertramhe looked at lucyhe whimperedhe sniggledhe grinnedhe committed all manner of solecisms in point of form poured the whole cream no unlucky mistake upon the plate of porridge which was his own usual breakfast threw the slops of what he called his crowning dish of tea into the sugardish instead of the slopbasin and concluded with spilling the scalding liquor upon old plato the colonels favourite spaniel who received the libation with a howl that did little honour to his philosophy  the colonels equanimity was rather shaken by this last blunder upon my word my good friend mr sampson you forget the difference between plato and zenocrates  the former was chief of the academics the latter of the stoics said the dominie with some scorn of the supposition  yes my dear sir but it was zenocrates not plato who denied that pain was an evil  i should have thought said pleydell that very respectable quadruped which is just now limping out of the room upon three of his four legs was rather of the cynic school  very well hit off but here comes an answer from macmorlan  it was unfavourable mrs macmorlan sent her respectful compliments and her husband had been and was detained by some alarming disturbances which had taken place the preceding night at portanferry and the necessary investigation which they had occasioned  whats to be done now counsellor said the colonel to pleydell  why i wish we could have seen macmorlan said the counsellor who is a sensible fellow himself and would besides have acted under my advice but there is little harm our friend here must be made sui juris he is at present an escaped prisoner the law has an awkward claim upon him he must be placed rectus in curia that is the first object for which purpose colonel i will accompany you in your carriage down to hazlewood house the distance is not great we will offer our bail and i am confident i can easily show mri beg his pardonsir robert hazlewood the necessity of receiving it  with all my heart said the colonel and ringing the bell gave the necessary orders and what is next to be done  we must get hold of macmorlan and look out for more proof  proof said the colonel the thing is as clear as daylight here are mr sampson and miss bertram and you yourself at once recognise the young gentleman as his fathers image and he himself recollects all the very peculiar circumstances preceding his leaving this country what else is necessary to conviction  to moral conviction nothing more perhaps said the experienced lawyer but for legal proof a great deal mr bertrams recollections are his own recollections merely and therefore are not evidence in his own favour miss bertram the learned mr sampson and i can only say what every one who knew the late ellangowan will readily agree in that this gentleman is his very picture but that will not make him ellangowans son and give him the estate  and what will do so said the colonel  why we must have a distinct probation there are these gipsies but then alas they are almost infamous in the eye of law scarce capable of bearing evidence and meg merrilies utterly so by the various accounts which she formerly gave of the matter and her impudent denial of all knowledge of the fact when i myself examined her respecting it  what must be done then asked mannering  we must try answered the legal sage what proof can be got at in holland among the persons by whom our young friend was educated but then the fear of being called in question for the murder of the gauger may make them silent or if they speak they are either foreigners or outlawed smugglers in short i see doubts  under favour most learned and honoured sir said the dominie i trust he who hath restored little harry bertram to his friends will not leave his own work imperfect  i trust so too mr sampson said pleydell but we must use the means and i am afraid we shall have more difficulty in procuring them than i at first thought but a faint heart never won a fair lady and by the way apart to miss mannering while bertram was engaged with his sister theres a vindication of holland for you what smart fellows do you think leyden and utrecht must send forth when such a very genteel and handsome young man comes from the paltry schools of middleburgh  of a verity said the dominie jealous of the reputation of the dutch seminaryof a verity mr pleydell but i make it known to you that i myself laid the foundation of his education  true my dear dominie answered the advocate that accounts for his proficiency in the graces without question but here comes your carriage colonel adieu young folks miss julia keep your heart till i come back again let there be nothing done to prejudice my right whilst i am non valens agere  their reception at hazlewood house was more cold and formal than usual for in general the baronet expressed great respect for colonel mannering and mr pleydell besides being a man of good family and of high general estimation was sir roberts old friend but now he seemed dry and embarrassed in his manner he would willingly he said receive bail notwithstanding that the offence had been directly perpetrated committed and done against young hazlewood of hazlewood but the young man had given himself a fictitious description and was altogether that sort of person who should not be liberated discharged or let loose upon society and therefore  i hope sir robert hazlewood said the colonel you do not mean to doubt my word when i assure you that he served under me as cadet in india  by no means or account whatsoever but you call him a cadet now he says avers and upholds that he was a captain or held a troop in your regiment  he was promoted since i gave up the command  but you must have heard of it  no i returned on account of family circumstances from india and have not since been solicitous to hear particular news from the regiment the name of brown too is so common that i might have seen his promotion in the gazette without noticing it but a day or two will bring letters from his commanding officer  but i am told and informed mr pleydell answered sir robert still hesitating that he does not mean to abide by this name of brown but is to set up a claim to the estate of ellangowan under the name of bertram  ay who says that said the counsellor  or demanded the soldier whoever says so does that give a right to keep him in prison  hush colonel said the lawyer i am sure you would not any more than i countenance him if he prove an impostor and among friends who informed you of this sir robert  why a person mr pleydell answered the baronet who is peculiarly interested in investigating sifting and clearing out this business to the bottom you will excuse my being more particular  o certainly replied pleydell well and he says  he says that it is whispered about among tinkers gipsies and other idle persons that there is such a plan as i mentioned to you and that this young man who is a bastard or natural son of the late ellangowan is pitched upon as the impostor from his strong family likeness  and was there such a natural son sir robert demanded the counsellor  o certainly to my own positive knowledge ellangowan had him placed as cabinboy or powdermonkey on board an armed sloop or yacht belonging to the revenue through the interest of the late commissioner bertram a kinsman of his own  well sir robert said the lawyer taking the word out of the mouth of the impatient soldier you have told me news i shall investigate them and if i find them true certainly colonel mannering and i will not countenance this young man in the meanwhile as we are all willing to make him forthcoming to answer all complaints against him i do assure you you will act most illegally and incur heavy responsibility if you refuse our bail  why mr pleydell said sir robert who knew the high authority of the counsellors opinion as you must know best and as you promise to give up this young man  if he proves an impostor replied the lawyer with some emphasis  ay certainly under that condition i will take your bail though i must say an obliging welldisposed and civil neighbour of mine who was himself bred to the law gave me a hint or caution this morning against doing so it was from him i learned that this youth was liberated and had come abroad or rather had broken prison but where shall we find one to draw the bailbond  here said the counsellor applying himself to the bell send up my clerk mr driver it will not do my character harm if i dictate the needful myself it was written accordingly and signed and the justice having subscribed a regular warrant for bertram alias browns discharge the visitors took their leave  each threw himself into his own corner of the postchariot and said nothing for some time the colonel first broke silence so you intend to give up this poor young fellow at the first brush  who i replied the counsellor i will not give up one hair of his head though i should follow them to the court of last resort in his behalf but what signified mooting points and showing ones hand to that old ass much better he should report to his prompter glossin that we are indifferent or lukewarm in the matter besides i wished to have a peep at the enemies game  indeed said the soldier then i see there are stratagems in law as well as war well and how do you like their line of battle  ingenious said mr pleydell but i think desperate they are finessing too much a common fault on such occasions  during this discourse the carriage rolled rapidly towards woodbourne without anything occurring worthy of the readers notice excepting their meeting with young hazlewood to whom the colonel told the extraordinary history of bertrams reappearance which he heard with high delight and then rode on before to pay miss bertram his compliments on an event so happy and so unexpected  we return to the party at woodbourne after the departure of mannering the conversation related chiefly to the fortunes of the ellangowan family their domains and their former power it was then under the towers of my fathers said bertram that i landed some days since in circumstances much resembling those of a vagabond its mouldering turrets and darksome arches even then awakened thoughts of the deepest interest and recollections which i was unable to decipher i will now visit them again with other feelings and i trust other and better hopes  do not go there now said his sister the house of our ancestors is at present the habitation of a wretch as insidious as dangerous whose arts and villainy accomplished the ruin and broke the heart of our unhappy father  you increase my anxiety replied her brother to confront this miscreant even in the den he has constructed for himself i think i have seen him  but you must consider said julia that you are now left under lucys guard and mine and are responsible to us for all your motions consider i have not been a lawyers mistress twelve hours for nothing and i assure you it would be madness to attempt to go to ellangowan just now the utmost to which i can consent is that we shall walk in a body to the head of the woodbourne avenue and from that perhaps we may indulge you with our company as far as a rising ground in the common whence your eyes may be blessed with a distant prospect of those gloomy towers which struck so strongly your sympathetic imagination  the party was speedily agreed upon and the ladies having taken their cloaks followed the route proposed under the escort of captain bertram it was a pleasant winter morning and the cool breeze served only to freshen not to chill the fair walkers a secret though unacknowledged bond of kindness combined the two ladies and bertram now hearing the interesting accounts of his own family now communicating his adventures in europe and in india repaid the pleasure which he received lucy felt proud of her brother as well from the bold and manly turn of his sentiments as from the dangers he had encountered and the spirit with which he had surmounted them and julia while she pondered on her fathers words could not help entertaining hopes that the independent spirit which had seemed to her father presumption in the humble and plebeian brown would have the grace of courage noble bearing and high blood in the fardescended heir of ellangowan  they reached at length the little eminence or knoll upon the highest part of the common called gibbies knowea spot repeatedly mentioned in this history as being on the skirts of the ellangowan estate it commanded a fair variety of hill and dale bordered with natural woods whose naked boughs at this season relieved the general colour of the landscape with a dark purple hue while in other places the prospect was more formally intersected by lines of plantation where the scotch firs displayed their variety of dusky green at the distance of two or three miles lay the bay of ellangowan its waves rippling under the influence of the western breeze the towers of the ruined castle seen high over every object in the neighbourhood received a brighter colouring from the wintry sun  there said lucy bertram pointing them out in the distance there is the seat of our ancestors god knows my dear brother i do not covet in your behalf the extensive power which the lords of these ruins are said to have possessed so long and sometimes to have used so ill but o that i might see you in possession of such relics of their fortune as should give you an honourable independence and enable you to stretch your hand for the protection of the old and destitute dependents of our family whom our poor fathers death  true my dearest lucy answered the young heir of ellangowan and i trust with the assistance of heaven which has so far guided us and with that of these good friends whom their own generous hearts have interested in my behalf such a consummation of my hard adventures is now not unlikely but as a soldier i must look with some interest upon that wormeaten hold of ragged stone and if this undermining scoundrel who is now in possession dare to displace a pebble of it  he was here interrupted by dinmont who came hastily after them up the road unseen till he was near the party captain captain yere wanted yere wanted by her ye ken o  and immediately meg merrilies as if emerging out of the earth ascended from the hollow way and stood before them i sought ye at the house she said and found but him pointing to dinmont but ye are right and i was wrang it is here we should meet on this very spot where my eyes last saw your father remember your promise and follow me       chapter xxiv      to hail the king in seemly sort       the ladie was full fain      but king arthur all sore amazed       no answer made again      what wight art thou the ladie said       that will not speak to me      sir i may chance to ease thy pain       though i be foul to see            the marriage of sir gawaine   the fairy bride of sir gawaine while under the influence of the spell of her wicked stepmother was more decrepit probably and what is commonly called more ugly than meg merrilies but i doubt if she possessed that wild sublimity which an excited imagination communicated to features marked and expressive in their own peculiar character and to the gestures of a form which her sex considered might be termed gigantic accordingly the knights of the round table did not recoil with more terror from the apparition of the loathly lady placed between an oak and a green holly than lucy bertram and julia mannering did from the appearance of this galwegian sibyl upon the common of ellangowan  for gods sake said julia pulling out her purse give that dreadful woman something and bid her go away  i cannot said bertram i must not offend her  what keeps you here said meg exalting the harsh and rough tones of her hollow voice why do you not follow must your hour call you twice do you remember your oath were it at kirk or market wedding or burialand she held high her skinny forefinger in a menacing attitude  bertramturned round to his terrified companions excuse me for a moment i am engaged by a promise to follow this woman  good heavens engaged to a madwoman said julia  or to a gipsy who has her band in the wood ready to murder you said lucy  that was not spoken like a bairn of ellangowan said meg frowning upon miss bertram it is the illdoers are illdreaders  in short i must go said bertram it is absolutely necessary wait for me five minutes on this spot  five minutes said the gipsy five hours may not bring you here again  do you hear that said julia for heavens sake do not go  i must i must mr dinmont will protect you back to the house  no said meg he must come with you it is for that he is here he maun take part wi hand and heart and weel his part it is for redding his quarrel might have cost you dear  troth luckie its very true said the steady farmer and ere i turn back frae the captains side ill show that i haena forgotten t  o yes exclaimed both the ladies at once let mr dinmont go with you if go you must on this strange summons  indeed i must answered bertram but you see i am safely guarded adieu for a short time go home as fast as you can        he pressed his sisters hand and took a yet more affectionate farewell of julia with his eyes almost stupefied with surprise and fear the young ladies watched with anxious looks the course of bertram his companion and their extraordinary guide her tall figure moved across the wintry heath with steps so swift so long and so steady that she appeared rather to glide than to walk bertram and dinmont both tall men apparently scarce equalled her in height owing to her longer dress and high headgear she proceeded straight across the common without turning aside to the winding path by which passengers avoided the inequalities and little rills that traversed it in different directions thus the diminishing figures often disappeared from the eye as they dived into such broken ground and again ascended to sight when they were past the hollow there was something frightful and unearthly as it were in the rapid and undeviating course which she pursued undeterred by any of the impediments which usually incline a traveller from the direct path her way was as straight and nearly as swift as that of a bird through the air at length they reached those thickets of natural wood which extended from the skirts of the common towards the glades and brook of derncleugh and were there lost to the view  this is very extraordinary said lucy after a pause and turning round to her companion what can he have to do with that old hag  it is very frightful answered julia and almost reminds me of the tales of sorceresses witches and evil genii which i have heard in india they believe there in a fascination of the eye by which those who possess it control the will and dictate the motions of their victims what can your brother have in common with that fearful woman that he should leave us obviously against his will to attend to her commands  at least said lucy we may hold him safe from harm for she would never have summoned that faithful creature dinmont of whose strength courage and steadiness henry said so much to attend upon an expedition where she projected evil to the person of his friend and now let us go back to the house till the colonel returns perhaps bertram may be back first at any rate the colonel will judge what is to be done  leaning then upon each others arm but yet occasionally stumbling between fear and the disorder of their nerves they at length reached the head of the avenue when they heard the tread of a horse behind they started for their ears were awake to every sound and beheld to their great pleasure young hazlewood the colonel will be here immediately he said i galloped on before to pay my respects to miss bertram with the sincerest congratulations upon the joyful event which has taken place in her family i long to be introduced to captain bertram and to thank him for the welldeserved lesson he gave to my rashness and indiscretion  he has left us just now said lucy and in a manner that has frightened us very much  just at that moment the colonels carriage drove up and on observing the ladies stopped while mannering and his learned counsel alighted and joined them they instantly communicated the new cause of alarm  meg merrilies again said the colonel she certainly is a most mysterious and unaccountable personage but i think she must have something to impart to bertram to which she does not mean we should be privy  the devil take the bedlamite old woman said the counsellor will she not let things take their course prout de lege but must always be putting in her oar in her own way then i fear from the direction they took they are going upon the ellangowan estate that rascal glossin has shown us what ruffians he has at his disposal i wish honest liddesdale maybe guard sufficient  if you please said hazlewood i should be most happy to ride in the direction which they have taken i am so well known in the country that i scarce think any outrage will be offered in my presence and i shall keep at such a cautious distance as not to appear to watch meg or interrupt any communication which she may make  upon my word said pleydell aside to be a sprig whom i remember with a whey face and a satchel not so very many years ago i think young hazlewood grows a fine fellow i am more afraid of a new attempt at legal oppression than at open violence and from that this young mans presence would deter both glossin and his understrappershie away then my boy peer outpeer out you ll find them somewhere about derncleugh or very probably in warroch wood  hazlewood turned his horse come back to us to dinner hazlewood cried the colonel he bowed spurred his horse and galloped off  we now return to bertram and dinmont who continued to follow their mysterious guide through the woods and dingles between the open common and the ruined hamlet of derncleugh as she led the way she never looked back upon her followers unless to chide them for loitering though the sweat in spite of the season poured from their brows at other times she spoke to herself in such broken expressions as these it is to rebuild the auld house it is to lay the cornerstone and did i not warn him i telld him i was born to do it if my fathers head had been the steppingstane let alane his i was doomedstill i kept my purpose in the cage and in the stocks i was banishedi kept it in an unco land i was scourged i was brandedmy resolution lay deeper than scourge or red iron could reachand now the hour is come  captain said dinmont in a half whisper i wish she binna uncanny her words dinna seem to come in gods name or like other folks od they threep in our country that there are sic things  dont be afraid my friend whispered bertram in return  feard fient a haet care i said the dauntless farmer be she witch or deevil its a ane to dandie dinmont  haud your peace gudeman said meg looking sternly over her shoulder is this a time or place for you to speak think ye  but my good friend said bertram as i have no doubt in your good faith or kindness which i have experienced you should in return have some confidence in me i wish to know where you are leading us  theres but ae answer to that henry bertram said the sibyl i swore my tongue should never tell but i never said my finger should never show go on and meet your fortune or turn back and lose it thats a i hae to say  go on then answered bertram i will ask no more questions  they descended into the glen about the same place where meg had formerly parted from bertram she paused an instant beneath the tall rock where he had witnessed the burial of a dead body and stamped upon the ground which notwithstanding all the care that had been taken showed vestiges of having been recently moved here rests ane she said hell maybe hae neibours sune  she then moved up the brook until she came to the ruined hamlet where pausing with a look of peculiar and softened interest before one of the gables which was still standing she said in a tone less abrupt though as solemn as before do you see that blackit and broken end of a sheeling there my kettle boiled for forty years there i bore twelve buirdly sons and daughters where are they now where are the leaves that were on that auld ash tree at martinmas the west wind has made it bare and im stripped too do you see that saugh tree its but a blackened rotten stump now ive sate under it mony a bonnie summer afternoon when it hung its gay garlands ower the poppling water ive sat there and elevating her voice ive held you on my knee henry bertram and sung ye sangs of the auld barons and their bloody wars it will neer be green again and meg merrilies will never sing sangs mair be they blythe or sad but yell no forget her and yell gar big up the auld was for her sake and let somebody live there thats ower gude to fear them of another warld for if ever the dead came back amang the living ill be seen in this glen mony a night after these crazed banes are in the mould  the mixture of insanity and wild pathos with which she spoke these last words with her right arm bare and extended her left bent and shrouded beneath the dark red drapery of her mantle might have been a study worthy of our siddons herself and now she said resuming at once the short stern and hasty tone which was most ordinary to her let us to the wark let us to the wark  she then led the way to the promontory on which the kaim of derncleugh was situated produced a large key from her pocket and unlocked the door the interior of this place was in better order than formerly i have made things decent she said i may be streekit here or night there will be few few at megs lykewake for mony of our folk will blame what i hae done and am to do  she then pointed to a table upon which was some cold meat arranged with more attention to neatness than could have been expected from megs habits eat she saideat yell need it this night yet  bertram in complaisance eat a morsel or two and dinmont whose appetite was unabated either by wonder apprehension or the meal of the morning made his usual figure as a trencherman she then offered each a single glass of spirits which bertram drank diluted and his companion plain  will ye taste naething yoursell luckie said dinmont  i shall not need it replied their mysterious hostess and now she said ye maun hae arms ye maunna gang on dryhanded but use them not rashly take captive but save life let the law hae its ain he maun speak ere he die  who is to be taken who is to speak said bertram in astonishment receiving a pair of pistols which she offered him and which upon examining he found loaded and locked  the flints are gude she said and the powder dry i ken this wark weel  then without answering his questions she armed dinmont also with a large pistol and desired them to choose sticks for themselves out of a parcel of very suspiciouslooking bludgeons which she brought from a corner bertram took a stout sapling and dandie selected a club which might have served hercules himself they then left the hut together and in doing so bertram took an opportunity to whisper to dinmont theres something inexplicable in all this but we need not use these arms unless we see necessity and lawful occasion take care to do as you see me do  dinmont gave a sagacious nod and they continued to follow over wet and over dry through bog and through fallow the footsteps of their conductress she guided them to the wood of warroch by the same track which the late ellangowan had used when riding to derncleugh in quest of his child on the miserable evening of kennedys murder  when meg merrilies had attained these groves through which the wintry seawind was now whistling hoarse and shrill she seemed to pause a moment as if to recollect the way we maun go the precise track she said and continued to go forward but rather in a zigzag and involved course than according to her former steady and direct line of motion at length she guided them through the mazes of the wood to a little open glade of about a quarter of an acre surrounded by trees and bushes which made a wild and irregular boundary even in winter it was a sheltered and snugly sequestered spot but when arrayed in the verdure of spring the earth sending forth all its wild flowers the shrubs spreading their waste of blossom around it and the weeping birches which towered over the underwood drooping their long and leafy fibres to intercept the sun it must have seemed a place for a youthful poet to study his earliest sonnet or a pair of lovers to exchange their first mutual avowal of affection apparently it now awakened very different recollections bertrams brow when he had looked round the spot became gloomy and embarrassed meg after uttering to herself this is the very spot looked at him with a ghastly sideglancedye mind it  yes answered bertram imperfectly i do  ay pursued his guide on this very spot the man fell from his horse i was behind that bourtree bush at the very moment sair sair he strove and sair he cried for mercy but he was in the hands of them that never kennd the word now will i show you the further track the last time ye travelled it was in these arms  she led them accordingly by a long and winding passage almost overgrown with brushwood until without any very perceptible descent they suddenly found themselves by the seaside meg then walked very fast on between the surf and the rocks until she came to a remarkable fragment of rock detached from the rest here she said in a low and scarcely audible whisperhere the corpse was found  and the cave said bertram in the same tone is close beside it are you guiding us there  yes said the gipsy in a decided tone bend up both your hearts follow me as i creep in i have placed the firewood so as to screen you bide behind it for a gliff till i say the hour and the man are baith come then rin in on him take his arms and bind him till the blood burst frae his finger nails  i will by my soul said henry if he is the man i supposejansen  ay jansen hatteraick and twenty mair names are his  dinmont you must stand by me now said bertram for this fellow is a devil  ye needna doubt that said the stout yeoman but i wish i could mind a bit prayer or i creep after the witch into that hole that shes opening it wad be a sair thing to leave the blessed sun and the free air and gang and be killed like a tod thats run to earth in a dungeon like that but my sooth they will be hardbitten terriers will worry dandie so as i said deil hae me if i baulk you this was uttered in the lowest tone of voice possible the entrance was now open meg crept in upon her hands and knees bertram followed and dinmont after giving a rueful glance toward the daylight whose blessings he was abandoning brought up the rear       chapter xxv      die prophet in thy speech      for this among the rest was i ordained            henry vi part iii   the progress of the borderer who as we have said was the last of the party was fearfully arrested by a hand which caught hold of his leg as he dragged his long limbs after him in silence and perturbation through the low and narrow entrance of the subterranean passage the steel heart of the bold yeoman had wellnigh given way and he suppressed with difficulty a shout which in the defenceless posture and situation which they then occupied might have cost all their lives he contented himself however with extricating his foot from the grasp of this unexpected follower be still said a voice behind him releasing him i am a friendcharles hazlewood  these words were uttered in a very low voice but they produced sound enough to startle meg merrilies who led the van and who having already gained the place where the cavern expanded had risen upon her feet she began as if to confound any listening ear to growl to mutter and to sing aloud and at the same time to make a bustle among some brushwood which was now heaped in the cave  here beldam deyvils kind growled the harsh voice of dirk hatteraick from the inside of his den what makest thou there  laying the roughies to keep the cauld wind frae you ye desperate donaegood yere een ower weel off and wotsna it will be otherwise soon  have you brought me the brandy and any news of my people said dirk hatteraick  theres the flask for ye your peopledispersed broken gone or cut to ribbands by the redcoats  der deyvil this coast is fatal to me  ye may hae mair reason to say sae  while this dialogue went forward bertram and dinmont had both gained the interior of the cave and assumed an erect position the only light which illuminated its rugged and sable precincts was a quantity of wood burnt to charcoal in an iron grate such as they use in spearing salmon by night on these red embers hatteraick from time to time threw a handful of twigs or splintered wood but these even when they blazed up afforded a light much disproportioned to the extent of the cavern and as its principal inhabitant lay upon the side of the grate most remote from the entrance it was not easy for him to discover distinctly objects which lay in that direction the intruders therefore whose number was now augmented unexpectedly to three stood behind the looselypiled branches with little risk of discovery dinmont had the sense to keep back hazlewood with one hand till he whispered to bertram a friendyoung hazlewood  it was no time for following up the introduction and they all stood as still as the rocks around them obscured behind the pile of brushwood which had been probably placed there to break the cold wind from the sea without totally intercepting the supply of air the branches were laid so loosely above each other that looking through them towards the light of the firegrate they could easily discover what passed in its vicinity although a much stronger degree of illumination than it afforded would not have enabled the persons placed near the bottom of the cave to have descried them in the position which they occupied  the scene independent of the peculiar moral interest and personal danger which attended it had from the effect of the light and shade on the uncommon objects which it exhibited an appearance emphatically dismal the light in the firegrate was the darkred glare of charcoal in a state of ignition relieved from time to time by a transient flame of a more vivid or duskier light as the fuel with which dirk hatteraick fed his fire was better or worse fitted for his purpose now a dark cloud of stifling smoke rose up to the roof of the cavern and then lighted into a reluctant and sullen blaze which flashed wavering up the pillar of smoke and was suddenly rendered brighter and more lively by some drier fuel or perhaps some splintered firtimber which at once converted the smoke into flame by such fitful irradiation they could see more or less distinctly the form of hatteraick whose savage and rugged cast of features now rendered yet more ferocious by the circumstances of his situation and the deep gloom of his mind assorted well with the rugged and broken vault which rose in a rude arch over and around him the form of meg merrilies which stalked about him sometimes in the light sometimes partially obscured in the smoke or darkness contrasted strongly with the sitting figure of hatteraick as he bent over the flame and from his stationary posture was constantly visible to the spectator while that of the female flitted around appearing or disappearing like a spectre  bertram felt his blood boil at the sight of hatteraick he remembered him well under the name of jansen which the smuggler had adopted after the death of kennedy and he remembered also that this jansen and his mate brown the same who was shot at woodbourne had been the brutal tyrants of his infancy bertram knew farther from piecing his own imperfect recollections with the narratives of mannering and pleydell that this man was the prime agent in the act of violence which tore him from his family and country and had exposed him to so many distresses and dangers a thousand exasperating reflections rose within his bosom and he could hardly refrain from rushing upon hatteraick and blowing his brains out  at the same time this would have been no safe adventure the flame as it rose and fell while it displayed the strong muscular and broadchested frame of the ruffian glanced also upon two brace of pistols in his belt and upon the hilt of his cutlass it was not to be doubted that his desperation was commensurate with his personal strength and means of resistance both indeed were inadequate to encounter the combined power of two such men as bertram himself and his friend dinmont without reckoning their unexpected assistant hazlewood who was unarmed and of a slighter make but bertram felt on a moments reflection that there would be neither sense nor valour in anticipating the hangmans office and he considered the importance of making hatteraick prisoner alive he therefore repressed his indignation and awaited what should pass between the ruffian and his gipsy guide  and how are ye now said the harsh and discordant tones of his female attendant said i not it would come upon youay and in this very cave where ye harboured after the deed  wetter and sturm ye hag replied hatteraick keep your deyvils matins till theyre wanted have you seen glossin  no replied meg merrilies youve missed your blow ye bloodspiller and ye have nothing to expect from the tempter  hagel exclaimed the ruffian if i had him but by the throat and what am i to do then  do answered the gipsy die like a man or be hanged like a dog  hanged ye hag of satan the hemps not sown that shall hang me  its sown and its grown and its heckled and its twisted did i not tell ye when ye wad take away the boy harry bertram in spite of my prayersdid i not say he would come back when he had dreed his weird in foreign land till his twentyfirst year did i not say the auld fire would burn down to a spark but wad kindle again  well mother you did say so said hatteraick in a tone that had something of despair in its accents and donner and blitzen i believe you spoke the truth that younker of ellangowan has been a rock ahead to me all my life and now with glossins cursed contrivance my crew have been cut off my boats destroyed and i daresay the luggers taken there were not men enough left on board to work her far less to fight hera dredgeboat might have taken her and what will the owners say hagel and sturm i shall never dare go back again to flushing  youll never need said the gipsy  what are you doing there said her companion and what makes you say that  during this dialogue meg was heaping some flax loosely together before answer to this question she dropped a firebrand upon the flax which had been previously steeped in some spirituous liquor for it instantly caught fire and rose in a vivid pyramid of the most brilliant light up to the very top of the vault as it ascended meg answered the ruffians question in a firm and steady voice because the hours come and the man        at the appointed signal bertram and dinmont sprung over the brushwood and rushed upon hatteraick hazlewood unacquainted with their plan of assault was a moment later the ruffian who instantly saw he was betrayed turned his first vengeance on meg merrilies at whom he discharged a pistol she fell with a piercing and dreadful cry between the shriek of pain and the sound of laughter when at its highest and most suffocating height i kennd it would be this way she said  bertram in his haste slipped his foot upon the uneven rock which floored the cavea fortunate stumble for hatteraicks second bullet whistled over him with so true and steady an aim that had he been standing upright it must have lodged in his brain ere the smuggler could draw another pistol dinmont closed with him and endeavoured by main force to pinion down his arms such however was the wretchs personal strength joined to the efforts of his despair that in spite of the gigantic force with which the borderer grappled him he dragged dinmont through the blazing flax and had almost succeeded in drawing a third pistol which might have proved fatal to the honest farmer had not bertram as well as hazlewood come to his assistance when by main force and no ordinary exertion of it they threw hatteraick on the ground disarmed him and bound him this scuffle though it takes up some time in the narrative passed in less than a single minute when he was fairly mastered after one or two desperate and almost convulsionary struggles the ruffian lay perfectly still and silent hes gaun to die game ony how said dinmont weel i like him na the waur for that  this observation honest dandie made while he was shaking the blazing flax from his rough coat and shaggy black hair some of which had been singed in the scuffle he is quiet now said bertram stay by him and do not permit him to stir till i see whether the poor woman be alive or dead with hazlewoods assistance he raised meg merrilies  i kennd it would be this way she muttered and its een this way that it should be  the ball had penetrated the breast below the throat it did not bleed much externally but bertram accustomed to see gunshot wounds thought it the more alarming good god what shall we do for this poor woman said he to hazlewood the circumstances superseding the necessity of previous explanation or introduction to each other  my horse stands tied above in the wood said hazlewood i have been watching you these two hours i will ride off for some assistants that may be trusted meanwhile you had better defend the mouth of the cavern against every one until i return he hastened away bertram after binding meg merriliess wound as well as he could took station near the mouth of the cave with a cocked pistol in his hand dinmont continued to watch hatteraick keeping a grasp like that of hercules on his breast there was a dead silence in the cavern only interrupted by the low and suppressed moaning of the wounded female and by the hard breathing of the prisoner       chapter xxvi      for though seduced and led astray        thoust travelld far and wanderd long      thy god hath seen thee all the way        and all the turns that led thee wrong            the hall of justice   after the space of about threequarters of an hour which the uncertainty and danger of their situation made seem almost thrice as long the voice of young hazlewood was heard without here i am he cried with a sufficient party  come in then answered bertram not a little pleased to find his guard relieved hazlewood then entered followed by two or three countrymen one of whom acted as a peaceofficer they lifted hatteraick up and carried him in their arms as far as the entrance of the vault was high enough to permit them then laid him on his back and dragged him along as well as they could for no persuasion would induce him to assist the transportation by any exertion of his own he lay as silent and inactive in their hands as a dead corpse incapable of opposing but in no way aiding their operations when he was dragged into daylight and placed erect upon his feet among three or four assistants who had remained without the cave he seemed stupefied and dazzled by the sudden change from the darkness of his cavern while others were superintending the removal of meg merrilies those who remained with hatteraick attempted to make him sit down upon a fragment of rock which lay close upon the highwater mark a strong shuddering convulsed his iron frame for an instant as he resisted their purpose not there hagel you would not make me sit there  these were the only words he spoke but their import and the deep tone of horror in which they were uttered served to show what was passing in his mind  when meg merrilies had also been removed from the cavern with all the care for her safety that circumstances admitted they consulted where she should be carried hazlewood had sent for a surgeon and proposed that she should be lifted in the meantime to the nearest cottage but the patient exclaimed with great earnestness na na na to the kaim o derncleughthe kaim o derncleugh the spirit will not free itself o the flesh but there  you must indulge her i believe said bertram her troubled imagination will otherwise aggravate the fever of the wound  they bore her accordingly to the vault on the way her mind seemed to run more upon the scene which had just passed than on her own approaching death there were three of them set upon him i brought the twasome but wha was the third it would be himsell returned to work his ain vengeance  it was evident that the unexpected appearance of hazlewood whose person the outrage of hatteraick left her no time to recognise had produced a strong effect on her imagination she often recurred to it hazlewood accounted for his unexpected arrival to bertram by saying that he had kept them in view for some time by the direction of mannering that observing them disappear into the cave he had crept after them meaning to announce himself and his errand when his hand in the darkness encountering the leg of dinmont had nearly produced a catastrophe which indeed nothing but the presence of mind and fortitude of the bold yeoman could have averted  when the gipsy arrived at the hut she produced the key and when they entered and were about to deposit her upon the bed she said in an anxious tone na na not that waythe feet to the east and appeared gratified when they reversed her posture accordingly and placed her in that appropriate to a dead body  is there no clergyman near said bertram to assist this unhappy womans devotions  a gentleman the minister of the parish who had been charles hazlewoods tutor had with many others caught the alarm that the murderer of kennedy was taken on the spot where the deed had been done so many years before and that a woman was mortally wounded from curiosity or rather from the feeling that his duty called him to scenes of distress this gentleman had come to the kaim of derncleugh and now presented himself the surgeon arrived at the same time and was about to probe the wound but meg resisted the assistance of either its no what man can do that will heal my body or save my spirit let me speak what i have to say and then ye may work your will ise be nae hindrance but wheres henry bertram the assistants to whom this name had been long a stranger gazed upon each other yes she said in a stronger and harsher tone i said henry bertram of ellangowan stand from the light and let me see him  all eyes were turned towards bertram who approached the wretched couch the wounded woman took hold of his hand look at him she said all that ever saw his father or his grandfather and bear witness if he is not their living image a murmur went through the crowd the resemblance was too striking to be denied and now hear me and let that man pointing to hatteraick who was seated with his keepers on a seachest at some distancelet him deny what i say if he can that is henry bertram son to godfrey bertram umquhile of ellangowan that young man is the very ladbairn that dirk hatteraick carried off from warroch wood the day that he murdered the gauger i was there like a wandering spirit for i longed to see that wood or we left the country i saved the bairns life and sair sair i prigged and prayed they would leave him wi me but they bore him away and hes been lang ower the sea and now hes come for his ain and what should withstand him i swore to keep the secret till he was aneantwenty i kennd he behoved to dree his weird till that day cam i keepit that oath which i took to them but i made another vow to mysell that if i lived to see the day of his return i would set him in his fathers seat if every step was on a dead man i have keepit that oath too i will be ae step mysell he pointing to hatteraick will soon be another and there will be ane mair yet  the clergyman now interposing remarked it was a pity this deposition was not regularly taken and written down and the surgeon urged the necessity of examining the wound previously to exhausting her by questions when she saw them removing hatteraick in order to clear the room and leave the surgeon to his operations she called out aloud raising herself at the same time upon the couch dirk hatteraick you and i will never meet again until we are before the judgmentseat will ye own to what i have said or will you dare deny it he turned his hardened brow upon her with a look of dumb and inflexible defiance dirk hatteraick dare ye deny with my blood upon your hands one word of what my dying breath is uttering he looked at her with the same expression of hardihood and dogged stubbornness and moved his lips but uttered no sound then fareweel she said and god forgive you your hand has sealed my evidence when i was in life i was the mad randy gipsy that had been scourged and banished and branded that had begged from door to door and been hounded like a stray tyke from parish to parish wha would hae minded her tale but now i am a dying woman and my words will not fall to the ground any more than the earth will cover my blood  she here paused and all left the hut except the surgeon and two or three women after a very short examination he shook his head and resigned his post by the dying womans side to the clergyman  a chaise returning empty to kippletringan had been stopped on the highroad by a constable who foresaw it would be necessary to convey hatteraick to jail the driver understanding what was going on at derncleugh left his horses to the care of a blackguard boy confiding it is to be supposed rather in the years and discretion of the cattle than in those of their keeper and set off full speed to see as he expressed himself whaten a sort o fun was gaun on he arrived just as the group of tenants and peasants whose numbers increased every moment satiated with gazing upon the rugged features of hatteraick had turned their attention towards bertram almost all of them especially the aged men who had seen ellangowan in his better days felt and acknowledged the justice of meg merriliess appeal but the scotch are a cautious people they remembered there was another in possession of the estate and they as yet only expressed their feelings in low whispers to each other our friend jock jabos the postilion forced his way into the middle of the circle but no sooner cast his eyes upon bertram than he started back in amazement with a solemn exclamation as sure as theres breath in man its auld ellangowan arisen from the dead  this public declaration of an unprejudiced witness was just the spark wanted to give fire to the popular feeling which burst forth in three distinct shouts bertram for ever long life to the heir of ellangowan god send him his ain and to live among us as his forebears did of yore  i hae been seventy years on the land said one person  i and mine hae been seventy and seventy to that said another i have a right to ken the glance of a bertram  i and mine hae been three hundred years here said another old man and i sail sell my last cow but ill see the young laird placed in his right  the women ever delighted with the marvellous and not less so when a handsome young man is the subject of the tale added their shrill acclamations to the general allhail blessings on him hes the very picture o his father the bertrams were aye the wale o the country side  eh that his puir mother that died in grief and in doubt about him had but lived to see this day exclaimed some female voices  but well help him to his ain kimmers cried others and before glossin sail keep the place of ellangowan well howk him out ot wi our nails  others crowded around dinmont who was nothing both to tell what he knew of his friend and to boast the honour which he had in contributing to the discovery as he was known to several of the principal farmers present his testimony afforded an additional motive to the general enthusiasm in short it was one of those moments of intense feeling when the frost of the scottish people melts like a snowwreath and the dissolving torrent carries dam and dyke before it  the sudden shouts interrupted the devotions of the clergyman and meg who was in one of those dozing fits of stupefaction that precede the close of existence suddenly starteddinna ye hear dinna ye hear hes owned hes owned i lived but for this i am a sinfu woman but if my curse brought it down my blessing has taen it off and now i wad hae liked to hae said mair but it canna be stayshe continued stretching her head towards the gleam of light that shot through the narrow slit which served for a windowis he not there stand out o the light and let me look upon him ance mair but the darkness is in my ain een she said sinking back after an earnest gaze upon vacuity its a ended now      pass breath      come death and sinking back upon her couch of straw she expired without a groan the clergyman and the surgeon carefully noted down all that she had said now deeply regretting they had not examined her more minutely but both remaining morally convinced of the truth of her disclosure  hazlewood was the first to compliment bertram upon the near prospect of his being restored to his name and rank in society the people around who now learned from jabos that bertram was the person who had wounded him were struck with his generosity and added his name to bertrams in their exulting acclamations  some however demanded of the postilion how he had not recognised bertram when he saw him some time before at kippletringan to which he gave the very natural answerhout what was i thinking about ellangowan then it was the cry that was rising een now that the young laird was found that put me on finding out the likeness there was nae missing it ance ane was set to look fort  the obduracy of hatteraick during the latter part of this scene was in some slight degree shaken he was observed to twinkle with his eyelids to attempt to raise his bound hands for the purpose of pulling his hat over his brow to look angrily and impatiently to the road as if anxious for the vehicle which was to remove him from the spot at length mr hazlewood apprehensive that the popular ferment might take a direction towards the prisoner directed he should be taken to the postchaise and so removed to the town of kippletringan to be at mr macmorlans disposal at the same time he sent an express to warn that gentleman of what had happened and now he said to bertram i should be happy if you would accompany me to hazlewood house but as that might not be so agreeable just now as i trust it will be in a day or two you must allow me to return with you to woodbourne but you are on footo if the young laird would take my horseor mineor mine said halfadozen voicesor mine he can trot ten mile an hour without whip or spur and hes the young lairds frae this moment if he likes to take him for a herezeld footnote see note 8 as they cad it lang syne bertram readily accepted the horse as a loan and poured forth his thanks to the assembled crowd for their good wishes which they repaid with shouts and vows of attachment  while the happy owner was directing one lad to gae doun for the new saddle another just to rin the beast ower wi a dry wisp o strae a third to hie doun and borrow dan dunkiesons plated stirrups and expressing his regret that there was nae time to gie the nag a feed that the young laird might ken his mettle bertram taking the clergyman by the arm walked into the vault and shut the door immediately after them he gazed in silence for some minutes upon the body of meg merrilies as it lay before him with the features sharpened by death yet still retaining the stern and energetic character which had maintained in life her superiority as the wild chieftainess of the lawless people amongst whom she was born the young soldier dried the tears which involuntarily rose on viewing this wreck of one who might be said to have died a victim to her fidelity to his person and family he then took the clergymans hand and asked solemnly if she appeared able to give that attention to his devotions which befitted a departing person  my dear sir said the good minister i trust this poor woman had remaining sense to feel and join in the import of my prayers but let us humbly hope we are judged of by our opportunities of religious and moral instruction in some degree she might be considered as an uninstructed heathen even in the bosom of a christian country and let us remember that the errors and vices of an ignorant life were balanced by instances of disinterested attachment amounting almost to heroism to him who can alone weigh our crimes and errors against our efforts towards virtue we consign her with awe but not without hope  may i request said bertram that you will see every decent solemnity attended to in behalf of this poor woman i have some property belonging to her in my hands at all events i will be answerable for the expense you will hear of me at woodbourne  dinmont who had been furnished with a horse by one of his acquaintance now loudly called out that all was ready for their return and bertram and hazlewood after a strict exhortation to the crowd which was now increased to several hundreds to preserve good order in their rejoicing as the least ungoverned zeal might be turned to the disadvantage of the young laird as they termed him took their leave amid the shouts of the multitude  as they rode past the ruined cottages at derncleugh dinmont said im sure when ye come to your ain captain yell no forget to bigg a bit cothouse there deil be in me but i wad dot mysell an it werena in better hands i wadna like to live int though after what she said od i wad put in auld elspeth the bedrals widow the like o thems used wi graves and ghaists and thae things  a short but brisk ride brought them to woodbourne the news of their exploit had already flown far and wide and the whole inhabitants of the vicinity met them on the lawn with shouts of congratulation that you have seen me alive said bertram to lucy who first ran up to him though julias eyes even anticipated hers you must thank these kind friends  with a blush expressing at once pleasure gratitude and bashfulness lucy curtsied to hazlewood but to dinmont she frankly extended her hand the honest farmer in the extravagance of his joy carried his freedom farther than the hint warranted for he imprinted his thanks on the ladys lips and was instantly shocked at the rudeness of his own conduct lord sake madam i ask your pardon he said i forgot but ye had been a bairn omy ain the captains sae namely he gars ane forget himsell  old pleydell now advanced nay if fees like these are going he said  stop stop mr pleydell said julia you had your fees beforehand remember last night  why i do confess a retainer said the barrister but if i dont deserve double fees from both miss bertram and you when i conclude my examination of dirk hatteraick tomorrowgad i will so supple him you shall see colonel and you my saucy misses though you may not see shall hear  ay thats if we choose to listen counsellor replied julia  and you think said pleydell its two to one you wont choose that but you have curiosity that teaches you the use of your ears now and then  i declare counsellor answered the lively damsel that such saucy bachelors as you would teach us the use of our fingers now and then  reserve them for the harpsichord my love said the counsellor better for all parties  while this idle chat ran on colonel mannering introduced to bertram a plain goodlooking man in a grey coat and waistcoat buckskin breeches and boots this my dear sir is mr macmorlan  to whom said bertram embracing him cordially my sister was indebted for a home when deserted by all her natural friends and relations  the dominie then pressed forward grinned chuckled made a diabolical sound in attempting to whistle and finally unable to stifle his emotions ran away to empty the feelings of his heart at his eyes  we shall not attempt to describe the expansion of heart and glee of this happy evening       chapter xxvii           how like a hateful ape      detected grinning midst his pilferd hoard      a cunning man appears whose secret frauds      are opend to the day            count basil   there was a great movement at woodbourne early on the following morning to attend the examination at kippletringan mr pleydell from the investigation which he had formerly bestowed on the dark affair of kennedys death as well as from the general deference due to his professional abilities was requested by mr macmorlan and sir robert hazlewood and another justice of peace who attended to take the situation of chairman and the lead in the examination colonel mannering was invited to sit down with them the examination being previous to trial was private in other respects  the counsellor resumed and reinterrogated former evidence he then examined the clergyman and surgeon respecting the dying declaration of meg merrilies they stated that she distinctly positively and repeatedly declared herself an eyewitness of kennedys death by the hands of hatteraick and two or three of his crew that her presence was accidental that she believed their resentment at meeting him when they were in the act of losing their vessel through the means of his information led to the commission of the crime that she said there was one witness of the murder but who refused to participate in it still aliveher nephew gabriel faa and she had hinted at another person who was an accessory after not before the fact but her strength there failed her they did not forget to mention her declaration that she had saved the child and that he was torn from her by the smugglers for the purpose of carrying him to holland all these particulars were carefully reduced to writing  dirk hatteraick was then brought in heavily ironed for he had been strictly secured and guarded owing to his former escape he was asked his name he made no answer his profession he was silent several other questions were put to none of which he returned any reply pleydell wiped the glasses of his spectacles and considered the prisoner very attentively a very truculentlooking fellow he whispered to mannering but as dogberry says ill go cunningly to work with him here call in solessoles the shoemaker soles do you remember measuring some footsteps imprinted on the mud at the wood of warroch onnovember 17 by my orders soles remembered the circumstance perfectly look at that paper is that your note of the measurement soles verified the memorandum now there stands a pair of shoes on that table measure them and see if they correspond with any of the marks you have noted there the shoemaker obeyed and declared that they answered exactly to the largest of the footprints  we shall prove said the counsellor aside to mannering that these shoes which were found in the ruins at derncleugh belonged to brown the fellow whom you shot on the lawn at woodbourne now soles measure that prisoners feet very accurately  mannering observed hatteraick strictly and could notice a visible tremor do these measurements correspond with any of the footprints  the man looked at the note then at his footrule and measure then verified his former measurement by a second they correspond he said within a hairbreadth to a footmark broader and shorter than the former  hatteraicks genius here deserted him der deyvil he broke out how could there be a footmark on the ground when it was a frost as hard as the heart of a memel log  in the evening i grant you captain hatteraick said pleydell but not in the forenoon will you favour me with information where you were upon the day you remember so exactly  hatteraick saw his blunder and again screwed up his hard features for obstinate silence put down his observation however said pleydell to the clerk  at this moment the door opened and much to the surprise of most present mr gilbert glossin made his appearance that worthy gentleman had by dint of watching and eavesdropping ascertained that he was not mentioned by name in meg merriliess dying declarationa circumstance certainly not owing to any favourable disposition towards him but to the delay of taking her regular examination and to the rapid approach of death he therefore supposed himself safe from all evidence but such as might arise from hatteraicks confession to prevent which he resolved to push a bold face and join his brethren of the bench during his examination i shall be able he thought to make the rascal sensible his safety lies in keeping his own counsel and mine and my presence besides will be a proof of confidence and innocence if i must lose the estate i must but i trust better things  he entered with a profound salutation to sir robert hazlewood sir robert who had rather begun to suspect that his plebeian neighbour had made a cats paw of him inclined his head stiffly took snuff and looked another way  mr corsand said glossin to the other yokefellow of justice your most humble servant  your humble servant mr glossin answered mr corsand drily composing his countenance regis ad exemplar that is to say after the fashion of the baronet  macmorlan my worthy friend continued glossin how d ye do always on your duty  umph said honest macmorlan with little respect either to the compliment or salutation  colonel mannering a low bow slightly returned and mr pleydell another low bow i dared not have hoped for your assistance to poor country gentlemen at this period of the session  pleydell took snuff and eyed him with a glance equally shrewd and sarcastic ill teach him he said aside to mannering the value of the old admonition ne accesseris in consilium antequam voceris  but perhaps i intrude gentlemen said glossin who could not fail to observe the coldness of his reception is this an open meeting  for my part said mr pleydell so far from considering your attendance as an intrusion mr glossin i was never so pleased in my life to meet with you especially as i think we should at any rate have had occasion to request the favour of your company in the course of the day  well then gentlemen said glossin drawing his chair to the table and beginning to bustle about among the papers where are we how far have we got where are the declarations  clerk give me all these papers said mr pleydell i have an odd way of arranging my documents mr glossin another person touching them puts me out but i shall have occasion for your assistance by and by  glossin thus reduced to inactivity stole one glance at dirk hatteraick but could read nothing in his dark scowl save malignity and hatred to all around but gentlemen said glossin is it quite right to keep this poor man so heavily ironed when he is taken up merely for examination  this was hoisting a kind of friendly signal to the prisoner he has escaped once before said macmorlan drily and glossin was silenced  bertram was now introduced and to glossins confusion was greeted in the most friendly manner by all present even by sir robert hazlewood himself he told his recollections of his infancy with that candour and caution of expression which afforded the best warrant for his good faith this seems to be rather a civil than a criminal question said glossin rising and as you cannot be ignorant gentlemen of the effect which this young persons pretended parentage may have on my patrimonial interest i would rather beg leave to retire  no my good sir said mr pleydell we can by no means spare you but why do you call this young mans claims pretended i dont mean to fish for your defences against them if you have any but  mr pleydell replied glossin i am always disposed to act aboveboard and i think i can explain the matter at once this young fellow whom i take to be a natural son of the late ellangowan has gone about the country for some weeks under different names caballing with a wretched old madwoman who i understand was shot in a late scuffle and with other tinkers gipsies and persons of that description and a great brute farmer from liddesdale stirring up the tenants against their landlords which as sir robert hazlewood of hazlewood knows  not to interrupt you mr glossin said pleydell i ask who you say this young man is  why i say replied glossin and i believe that gentleman looking at hatteraick knows that the young man is a natural son of the late ellangowan by a girl called janet lightoheel who was afterwards married to hewit the shipwright that lived in the neighbourhood of annan his name is godfrey bertram hewit by which name he was entered on board the royal caroline excise yacht  ay said pleydell that is a very likely story but not to pause upon some difference of eyes complexion and so forthbe pleased to step forward sir a young seafaring man came forward here proceeded the counsellor is the real simon pure heres godfrey bertram hewit arrived last night from antigua via liverpool mate of a westindian and in a fair way of doing well in the world although he came somewhat irregularly into it  while some conversation passed between the other justices and this young man pleydell lifted from among the papers on the table hatteraicks old pocketbook a peculiar glance of the smugglers eye induced the shrewd lawyer to think there was something here of interest he therefore continued the examination of the papers laying the book on the table but instantly perceived that the prisoners interest in the research had cooled it must be in the book still whatever it is thought pleydell and again applied himself to the pocketbook until he discovered on a narrow scrutiny a slit between the pasteboard and leather out of which he drew three small slips of paper pleydell now turning to glossin requested the favour that he would tell them if he had assisted at the search for the body of kennedy and the child of his patron on the day when they disappeared  i did notthat is i did answered the consciencestruck glossin  it is remarkable though said the advocate that connected as you were with the ellangowan family i dont recollect your being examined or even appearing before me while that investigation was proceeding  i was called to london answered glossin on most important business the morning after that sad affair  clerk said pleydell minute down that reply i presume the business mr glossin was to negotiate these three bills drawn by you on messrs vanbeest and vanbruggen and accepted by one dirk hatteraick in their name on the very day of the murder i congratulate you on their being regularly retired as i perceive they have been i think the chances were against it glossins countenance fell this piece of real evidence continued mr pleydell makes good the account given of your conduct on this occasion by a man called gabriel faa whom we have now in custody and who witnessed the whole transaction between you and that worthy prisoner have you any explanation to give  mr pleydell said glossin with great composure i presume if you were my counsel you would not advise me to answer upon the spur of the moment to a charge which the basest of mankind seem ready to establish by perjury  my advice said the counsellor would be regulated by my opinion of your innocence or guilt in your case i believe you take the wisest course but you are aware you must stand committed  committed for what sir replied glossin upon a charge of murder  no only as art and part of kidnapping the child  that is a bailable offence  pardon me said pleydell it is plagium and plagium is felony  forgive me mr pleydell there is only one case upon record torrence and waldie they were you remember resurrectionwomen who had promised to procure a childs body for some young surgeons being upon honour to their employers rather than disappoint the evening lecture of the students they stole a live child murdered it and sold the body for three shillings and sixpence they were hanged but for the murder not for the plagium footnote this is in its circumstances and issue actually a case tried and reportedyour civil law has carried you a little too far  well sir but in the meantime mr macmorlan must commit you to the county jail in case this young man repeats the same story officers remove mr glossin and hatteraick and guard them in different apartments  gabriel the gipsy was then introduced and gave a distinct account of his deserting from captain pritchards vessel and joining the smugglers in the action detailed how dirk hatteraick set fire to his ship when he found her disabled and under cover of the smoke escaped with his crew and as much goods as they could save into the cavern where they proposed to lie till nightfall hatteraick himself his mate vanbeest brown and three others of whom the declarant was one went into the adjacent woods to communicate with some of their friends in the neighbourhood they fell in with kennedy unexpectedly and hatteraick and brown aware that he was the occasion of their disasters resolved to murder him he stated that he had seen them lay violent hands on the officer and drag him through the woods but had not partaken in the assault nor witnessed its termination that he returned to the cavern by a different route where he again met hatteraick and his accomplices and the captain was in the act of giving an account how he and brown had pushed a huge crag over as kennedy lay groaning on the beach when glossin suddenly appeared among them to the whole transaction by which hatteraick purchased his secrecy he was witness respecting young bertram he could give a distinct account till he went to india after which he had lost sight of him until he unexpectedly met with him in liddesdale gabriel faa farther stated that he instantly sent notice to his aunt meg merrilies as well as to hatteraick who he knew was then upon the coast but that he had incurred his aunts displeasure upon the latter account he concluded that his aunt had immediately declared that she would do all that lay in her power to help young ellangowan to his right even if it should be by informing against dirk hatteraick and that many of her people assisted her besides himself from a belief that she was gifted with supernatural inspirations with the same purpose he understood his aunt had given to bertram the treasure of the tribe of which she had the custody three or four gipsies by the express command of meg merrilies mingled in the crowd when the customhouse was attacked for the purpose of liberating bertram which he had himself effected he said that in obeying megs dictates they did not pretend to estimate their propriety or rationality the respect in which she was held by her tribe precluding all such subjects of speculation upon farther interrogation the witness added that his aunt had always said that harry bertram carried that round his neck which would ascertain his birth it was a spell she said that an oxford scholar had made for him and she possessed the smugglers with an opinion that to deprive him of it would occasion the loss of the vessel  bertram here produced a small velvet bag which he said he had worn round his neck from his earliest infancy and which he had preserved first from superstitious reverence and latterly from the hope that it might serve one day to aid in the discovery of his birth the bag being opened was found to contain a blue silk case from which was drawn a scheme of nativity upon inspecting this paper colonel mannering instantly admitted it was his own composition and afforded the strongest and most satisfactory evidence that the possessor of it must necessarily be the young heir of ellangowan by avowing his having first appeared in that country in the character of an astrologer  and now said pleydell make out warrants of commitment for hatteraick and glossin until liberated in due course of law yet he said i am sorry for glossin  now i think said mannering hes incomparably the least deserving of pity of the two the others a bold fellow though as hard as flint  very natural colonel said the advocate that you should be interested in the ruffian and i in the knave thats all professional taste but i can tell you glossin would have been a pretty lawyer had he not had such a turn for the roguish part of the profession  scandal would say observed mannering he might not be the worse lawyer for that  scandal would tell a lie then replied pleydell as she usually does laws like laudanum its much more easy to use it as a quack does than to learn to apply it like a physician       chapter xxviii      unfit to live or dieo marble heart      after him fellows drag him to the block            measure for measure   the jail at the county town of the shire ofwas one of those oldfashioned dungeons which disgraced scotland until of late years when the prisoners and their guard arrived there hatteraick whose violence and strength were well known was secured in what was called the condemned ward this was a large apartment near the top of the prison a round bar of ironfootnote see note 9 about the thickness of a mans arm above the elbow crossed the apartment horizontally at the height of about six inches from the floor and its extremities were strongly built into the wall at either end hatteraicks ankles were secured within shackles which were connected by a chain at the distance of about four feet with a large iron ring which travelled upon the bar we have described thus a prisoner might shuffle along the length of the bar from one side of the room to another but could not retreat farther from it in any other direction than the brief length of the chain admitted when his feet had been thus secured the keeper removed his handcuffs and left his person at liberty in other respects a palletbed was placed close to the bar of iron so that the shackled prisoner might lie down at pleasure still fastened to the iron bar in the manner described  hatteraick had not been long in this place of confinement before glossin arrived at the same prisonhouse in respect to his comparative rank and education he was not ironed but placed in a decent apartment under the inspection of macguffog who since the destruction of the bridewell of portanferry by the mob had acted here as an underturnkey when glossin was enclosed within this room and had solitude and leisure to calculate all the chances against him and in his favour he could not prevail upon himself to consider the game as desperate  the estate is lost he said that must go and between pleydell and macmorlan theyll cut down my claim on it to a trifle my characterbut if i get off with life and liberty ill win money yet and varnish that over again i knew not of the gaugers job until the rascal had done the deed and though i had some advantage by the contraband that is no felony but the kidnapping of the boythere they touch me closer let me see this bertram was a child at the time his evidence must be imperfect the other fellow is a deserter a gipsy and an outlaw meg merrilies dn her is dead these infernal bills hatteraick brought them with him i suppose to have the means of threatening me or extorting money from me i must endeavour to see the rascal must get him to stand steady must persuade him to put some other colour upon the business  his mind teeming with schemes of future deceit to cover former villainy he spent the time in arranging and combining them until the hour of supper macguffog attended as turnkey on this occasion he was as we know the old and special acquaintance of the prisoner who was now under his charge after giving the turnkey a glass of brandy and sounding him with one or two cajoling speeches glossin made it his request that he would help him to an interview with dirk hatteraick impossible utterly impossible its contrary to the express orders of mr macmorlan and the captain as the head jailor of a county jail is called in scotland would never forgie me  but why should he know of it said glossin slipping a couple of guineas into macguffogs hand  the turnkey weighed the gold and looked sharp at glossin ay ay mr glossin ye ken the ways o this place lookee at lockup hour ill return and bring ye upstairs to him but ye must stay a night in his cell for i am under needcessity to carry the keys to the captain for the night and i cannot let you out again until morning then ill visit the wards half an hour earlier than usual and ye may get out and be snug in your ain birth when the captain gangs his rounds  when the hour of ten had pealed from the neighbouring steeple macguffog came prepared with a small dark lantern he said softly to glossin slip your shoes off and follow me when glossin was out of the door macguffog as if in the execution of his ordinary duty and speaking to a prisoner within called aloud goodnight to you sir and locked the door clattering the bolts with much ostentatious noise he then guided glossin up a steep and narrow stair at the top of which was the door of the condemned ward he unbarred and unlocked it and giving glossin the lantern made a sign to him to enter and locked the door behind him with the same affected accuracy  in the large dark cell into which he was thus introduced glossins feeble light for some time enabled him to discover nothing at length he could dimly distinguish the palletbed stretched on the floor beside the great iron bar which traversed the room and on that pallet reposed the figure of a man glossin approached him dirk hatteraick  donner and hagel it is his voice said the prisoner sitting up and clashing his fetters as he rose then my dream is true begone and leave me to myself it will be your best  what my good friend said glossin will you allow the prospect of a few weeks confinement to depress your spirit  yes answered the ruffian sullenly when i am only to be released by a halter let me alone go about your business and turn the lamp from my face  psha my dear dirk dont be afraid said glossin i have a glorious plan to make all right  to the bottomless pit with your plans replied his accomplice you have planned me out of ship cargo and life and i dreamt this moment that meg merrilies dragged you here by the hair and gave me the long clasped knife she used to wear you dont know what she said sturmwetter it will be your wisdom not to tempt me  but hatteraick my good friend do but rise and speak to me said glossin  i will not answered the savage doggedly you have caused all the mischief you would not let meg keep the boy she would have returned him after he had forgot all  why hatteraick you are turned driveller  wetter will you deny that all that cursed attempt at portanferry which lost both sloop and crew was your device for your own job  but the goods you know  curse the goods said the smuggler we could have got plenty more but der deyvil to lose the ship and the fine fellows and my own life for a cursed coward villain that always works his own mischief with other peoples hands speak to me no more im dangerous  but dirkbut hatteraick hear me only a few words  hagel nein  only one sentence  tousand curses nein  at least get up for an obstinate dutch brute said glossin losing his temper and pushing hatteraick with his foot  donner and blitzen said hatteraick springing up and grappling with him you will have it then  glossin struggled and resisted but owing to his surprise at the fury of the assault so ineffectually that he fell under hatteraick the back part of his neck coming full upon the iron bar with stunning violence the deathgrapple continued the room immediately below the condemned ward being that of glossin was of course empty but the inmates of the second apartment beneath felt the shock of glossins heavy fall and heard a noise as of struggling and of groans but all sounds of horror were too congenial to this place to excite much curiosity or interest  in the morning faithful to his promise macguffog came mr glossin said he in a whispering voice  call louder answered dirk hatteraick  mr glossin for gods sake come away  hell hardly do that without help said hatteraick  what are you chattering there for macguffog called out the captain from below  come away for gods sake mr glossin repeated the turnkey  at this moment the jailor made his appearance with a light great was his surprise and even horror to observe glossins body lying doubled across the iron bar in a posture that excluded all idea of his being alive hatteraick was quietly stretched upon his pallet within a yard of his victim on lifting glossin it was found he had been dead for some hours his body bore uncommon marks of violence the spine where it joins the skull had received severe injury by his first fall there were distinct marks of strangulation about the throat which corresponded with the blackened state of his face the head was turned backward over the shoulder as if the neck had been wrung round with desperate violence so that it would seem that his inveterate antagonist had fixed a fatal gripe upon the wretchs throat and never quitted it while life lasted the lantern crushed and broken to pieces lay beneath the body  macmorlan was in the town and came instantly to examine the corpse what brought glossin here he said to hatteraick  the devil answered the ruffian  and what did you do to him  sent him to hell before me replied the miscreant  wretch said macmorlan you have crowned a life spent without a single virtue with the murder of your own miserable accomplice  virtue exclaimed the prisoner donner i was always faithful to my shipownersalways accounted for cargo to the last stiver hark ye let me have pen and ink and ill write an account of the whole to our house and leave me alone a couple of hours will ye and let them take away that piece of carrion donnerwetter  macmorlan deemed it the best way to humour the savage he was furnished with writing materials and left alone when they again opened the door it was found that this determined villain had anticipated justice he had adjusted a cord taken from the trucklebed and attached it to a bone the relic of his yesterdays dinner which he had contrived to drive into a crevice between two stones in the wall at a height as great as he could reach standing upon the bar having fastened the noose he had the resolution to drop his body as if to fall on his knees and to retain that posture until resolution was no longer necessary the letter he had written to his owners though chiefly upon the business of their trade contained many allusions to the younker of ellangowan as he called him and afforded absolute confirmation of all meg merrilies and her nephew had told  to dismiss the catastrophe of these two wretched men i shall only add that macguffog was turned out of office notwithstanding his declaration which he offered to attest by oath that he had locked glossin safely in his own room upon the night preceding his being found dead in dirk hatteraicks cell his story however found faith with the worthy mr skriegh and other lovers of the marvellous who still hold that the enemy of mankind brought these two wretches together upon that night by supernatural interference that they might fill up the cup of their guilt and receive its meed by murder and suicide       chapter xxix      to sum the wholethe close of all            dean swift   as glossin died without heirs and without payment of the price the estate of ellangowan was again thrown upon the hands of mr godfrey bertrams creditors the right of most of whom was however defeasible in case henry bertram should establish his character of heir of entail this young gentleman put his affairs into the hands of mr pleydell and mr macmorlan with one single proviso that though he himself should be obliged again to go to india every debt justly and honourably due by his father should be made good to the claimant mannering who heard this declaration grasped him kindly by the hand and from that moment might be dated a thorough understanding between them  the hoards of miss margaret bertram and the liberal assistance of the colonel easily enabled the heir to make provision for payment of the just creditors of his father while the ingenuity and research of his law friends detected especially in the accounts of glossin so many overcharges as greatly diminished the total amount in these circumstances the creditors did not hesitate to recognise bertrams right and to surrender to him the house and property of his ancestors all the party repaired from woodbourne to take possession amid the shouts of the tenantry and the neighbourhood and so eager was colonel mannering to superintend certain improvements which he had recommended to bertram that he removed with his family from woodbourne to ellangowan although at present containing much less and much inferior accommodation  the poor dominies brain was almost turned with joy on returning to his old habitation he posted upstairs taking three steps at once to a little shabby attic his cell and dormitory in former days and which the possession of his much superior apartment at woodbourne had never banished from his memory here one sad thought suddenly struck the honest manthe books no three rooms in ellangowan were capable to contain them while this qualifying reflection was passing through his mind he was suddenly summoned by mannering to assist in calculating some proportions relating to a large and splendid house which was to be built on the site of the new place of ellangowan in a style corresponding to the magnificence of the ruins in its vicinity among the various rooms in the plan the dominie observed that one of the largest was entitled the library and close beside was a snug wellproportioned chamber entitled mr sampsons apartment prodigious prodigious prodigious shouted the enraptured dominie  mr pleydell had left the party for some time but he returned according to promise during the christmas recess of the courts he drove up to ellangowan when all the family were abroad but the colonel who was busy with plans of buildings and pleasuregrounds in which he was well skilled and took great delight  ah ha said the counsellor so here you are where are the ladies where is the fair julia  walking out with young hazlewood bertram and captain delaserre a friend of his who is with us just now they are gone to plan out a cottage at derncleugh well have you carried through your law business  with a wet finger answered the lawyer got our youngsters special service retoured into chancery we had him served heir before the macers  macers who are they  why it is a kind of judicial saturnalia you must know that one of the requisites to be a macer or officer in attendance upon our supreme court is that they shall be men of no knowledge  very well  now our scottish legislature for the jokes sake i suppose have constituted those men of no knowledge into a peculiar court for trying questions of relationship and descent such as this business of bertram which often involve the most nice and complicated questions of evidence  the devil they have i should think that rather inconvenient said mannering  o we have a practical remedy for the theoretical absurdity one or two of the judges act upon such occasions as prompters and assessors to their own doorkeepers but you know what cujacius says multa sunt in moribus dissentanea multa sine ratione footnote the singular inconsistency hinted at is now in a great degree removed however this saturnalian court has done our business and a glorious batch of claret we had afterwards at walkers macmorlan will stare when he sees the bill  never fear said the colonel well face the shock and entertain the county at my friend mrs maccandlishs to boot  and choose jock jabos for your master of horse replied the lawyer  perhaps i may  and where is dandie the redoubted lord of liddesdale demanded the advocate  returned to his mountains but he has promised julia to make a descent in summer with the goodwife as he calls her and i dont know how many children  o the curlyheaded varlets i must come to play at blind harry and hy spy with them but what is all this added pleydell taking up the plans tower in the centre to be an imitation of the eagle tower at caernarvoncorps de logisthe devil wingswings why the house will take the estate of ellangowan on its back and fly away with it  why then we must ballast it with a few bags of sicca rupees replied the colonel  aha sits the wind there then i suppose the young dog carries off my mistress julia  even so counsellor  these rascals the postnati get the better of us of the old school at every turn said mr pleydell but she must convey and make over her interest in me to lucy  to tell you the truth i am afraid your flank will be turned there too replied the colonel  indeed  here has been sir robert hazlewood said mannering upon a visit to bertram thinking and deeming and opining  o lord pray spare me the worthy baronets triads  well sir continued mannering to make short he conceived that as the property of singleside lay like a wedge between two farms of his and was four or five miles separated from ellangowan something like a sale or exchange or arrangement might take place to the mutual convenience of both parties  well and bertram  why bertram replied that he considered the original settlement of mrs margaret bertram as the arrangement most proper in the circumstances of the family and that therefore the estate of singleside was the property of his sister  the rascal said pleydell wiping his spectacles hell steal my heart as well as my mistress et puis  and then sir robert retired after many gracious speeches but last week he again took the field in force with his coach and six horses his laced scarlet waistcoat and best bobwigall very grand as the goodboy books say  ay and what was his overture  why he talked with great form of an attachment on the part of charles hazlewood to miss bertram  ay ay he respected the little god cupid when he saw him perched on the dun of singleside and is poor lucy to keep house with that old fool and his wife who is just the knight himself in petticoats  no we parried that singleside house is to be repaired for the young people and to be called hereafter mount hazlewood  and do you yourself colonel propose to continue at woodbourne  only till we carry these plans into effect see heres the plan of my bungalow with all convenience for being separate and sulky when i please  and being situated as i see next door to the old castle you may repair donagilds tower for the nocturnal contemplation of the celestial bodies bravo colonel  no no my dear counsellor here ends the astrologer  the end       notes to volume i  note 1 p 25  the groaning malt mentioned in the text was the ale brewed for the purpose of being drunk after the lady or goodwifes safe delivery the kenno has a more ancient source and perhaps the custom may be derived from the secret rites of the bona dea a large and rich cheese was made by the women of the family with great affectation of secrecy for the refreshment of the gossips who were to attend at the canny minute this was the kenno so called because its existence was secret that is presumed to be so from all the males of the family but especially from the husband and master he was accordingly expected to conduct himself as if he knew of no such preparation to act as if desirous to press the female guests to refreshments and to seem surprised at their obstinate refusal but the instant his back was turned the kenno was produced and after all had eaten their fill with a proper accompaniment of the groaning malt the remainder was divided among the gossips each carrying a large portion home with the same affectation of great secrecy     note 2 p 198  it is fitting to explain to the reader the locality described in chapter xxii there is or rather i should say there was a little inn called mumpss hall that is being interpreted beggars hotel near to gilsland which had not then attained its present fame as a spa it was a hedge alehouse where the border farmers of either country often stopped to refresh themselves and their nags in their way to and from the fairs and trysts in cumberland and especially those who came from or went to scotland through a barren and lonely district without either road or pathway emphatically called the waste of bewcastle at the period when the adventures described in the novel are supposed to have taken place there were many instances of attacks by freebooters on those who travelled through this wild district and mumpss ha had a bad reputation for harbouring the banditti who committed such depredations  an old and sturdy yeoman belonging to the scottish side by surname an armstrong or elliot but well known by his soubriquet of fighting charlie of liddesdale and still remembered for the courage he displayed in the frequent frays which took place on the border fifty or sixty years since had the following adventure in the waste which suggested the idea of the scene in the text  charlie had been at stagshawbank fair had sold his sheep or cattle or whatever he had brought to market and was on his return to liddesdale there were then no country banks where cash could be deposited and bills received instead which greatly encouraged robbery in that wild country as the objects of plunder were usually fraught with gold the robbers had spies in the fair by means of whom they generally knew whose purse was best stocked and who took a lonely and desolate road homewardthose in short who were best worth robbing and likely to be most easily robbed  all this charlie knew full well but he had a pair of excellent pistols and a dauntless heart he stopped at mumpss ha notwithstanding the evil character of the place his horse was accommodated where it might have the necessary rest and feed of corn and charlie himself a dashing fellow grew gracious with the landlady a buxom quean who used all the influence in her power to induce him to stop all night the landlord was from home she said and it was ill passing the waste as twilight must needs descend on him before he gained the scottish side which was reckoned the safest but fighting charlie though he suffered himself to be detained later than was prudent did not account mumpss ha a safe place to quarter in during the night he tore himself away therefore from megs good fare and kind words and mounted his nag having first examined his pistols and tried by the ramrod whether the charge remained in them  he proceeded a mile or two at a round trot when as the waste stretched black before him apprehensions began to awaken in his mind partly arising out of megs unusual kindness which he could not help thinking had rather a suspicious appearance he therefore resolved to reload his pistols lest the powder had become damp but what was his surprise when he drew the charge to find neither powder nor ball while each barrel had been carefully filled with tow up to the space which the loading had occupied and the priming of the weapons being left untouched nothing but actually drawing and examining the charge could have discovered the inefficiency of his arms till the fatal minute arrived when their services were required charlie bestowed a hearty liddesdale curse on his landlady and reloaded his pistols with care and accuracy having now no doubt that he was to be waylaid and assaulted he was not far engaged in the waste which was then and is now traversed only by such routes as are described in the text when two or three fellows disguised and variously armed started from a mosshag while by a glance behind him for marching as the spaniard says with his beard on his shoulder he reconnoitred in every direction charlie instantly saw retreat was impossible as other two stout men appeared behind him at some distance the borderer lost not a moment in taking his resolution and boldly trotted against his enemies in front who called loudly on him to stand and deliver charlie spurred on and presented his pistol dn your pistol said the foremost robber whom charlie to his dying day protested he believed to have been the landlord of mumpss hadn your pistol i care not a curse for it ay lad said the deep voice of fighting charlie but the tows out now he had no occasion to utter another word the rogues surprised at finding a man of redoubted courage well armed instead of being defenceless took to the moss in every direction and he passed on his way without farther molestation  the author has heard this story told by persons who received it from fighting charlie himself he has also heard that mumpss ha was afterwards the scene of some other atrocious villainy for which the people of the house suffered but these are all tales of at least half a century old and the waste has been for many years as safe as any place in the kingdom     note 3 p 213  the author may here remark that the character of dandie dinmont was drawn from no individual a dozen at least of stout liddesdale yeomen with whom he has been acquainted and whose hospitality he has shared in his rambles through that wild country at a time when it was totally inaccessible save in the manner described in the text might lay claim to be the prototype of the rough but faithful hospitable and generous farmer but one circumstance occasioned the name to be fixed upon a most respectable individual of this class now no more mr james davidson of hindlee a tenant of lord douglas besides the points of blunt honesty personal strength and hardihood designed to be expressed in the character of dandie dinmont had the humour of naming a celebrated race of terriers which he possessed by the generic names of mustard and pepper according as their colour was yellow or greyishblack without any other individual distinction except as according to the nomenclature in the text mr davidson resided at hindlee a wild farm on the very edge of the teviotdale mountains and bordering close on liddesdale where the rivers and brooks divide as they take their course to the eastern and western seas his passion for the chase in all its forms but especially for foxhunting as followed in the fashion described in chapter xxv in conducting which he was skilful beyond most men in the south highlands was the distinguishing point in his character  when the tale on which these comments are written became rather popular the name of dandie dinmont was generally given to him which mr davidson received with great goodhumour only saying while he distinguished the author by the name applied to him in the country where his own is so commonthat the sheriff had not written about him mair than about other folk but only about his dogs an english lady of high rank and fashion being desirous to possess a brace of the celebrated mustard and pepper terriers expressed her wishes in a letter which was literally addressed to dandie dinmont under which very general direction it reached mr davidson who was justly proud of the application and failed not to comply with a request which did him and his favourite attendants so much honour  i trust i shall not be considered as offending the memory of a kind and worthy man if i mention a little trait of character which occurred in mr davidsons last illness i use the words of the excellent clergyman who attended him who gave the account to a reverend gentleman of the same persuasion  i read to mr davidson the very suitable and interesting truths you addressed to him he listened to them with great seriousness and has uniformly displayed a deep concern about his souls salvation he died on the first sabbath of the year 1820 an apoplectic stroke deprived him in an instant of all sensation but happily his brother was at his bedside for he had detained him from the meetinghouse that day to be near him although he felt himself not much worse than usual so you have got the last little mustard that the hand of dandie dinmont bestowed  his ruling passion was strong even on the eve of death mr baillies foxhounds had started a fox opposite to his window a few weeks ago and as soon as he heard the sound of the dogs his eyes glistened he insisted on getting out of bed and with much difficulty got to the window and there enjoyed the fun as he called it when i came down to ask for him he said he had seen reynard but had not seen his death if it had been the will of providence he added i would have liked to have been after him but i am glad that i got to the window and am thankful for what i saw for it has done me a great deal of good notwithstanding these eccentricities adds the sensible and liberal clergyman i sincerely hope and believe he has gone to a better world and better company and enjoyments  if some part of this little narrative may excite a smile it is one which is consistent with the most perfect respect for the simpleminded invalid and his kind and judicious religious instructor who we hope will not be displeased with our giving we trust a correct edition of an anecdote which has been pretty generally circulated the race of pepper and mustard are in the highest estimation at this day not only for verminkilling but for intelligence and fidelity those who like the author possess a brace of them consider them as very desirable companions     note 4 p 232  the cleek here intimated is the iron hook or hooks depending from the chimney of a scottish cottage on which the pot is suspended when boiling the same appendage is often called the crook the salmon is usually dried by hanging it up after being split and rubbed with salt in the smoke of the turf fire above the cleeks where it is said to reist that preparation being so termed the salmon thus preserved is eaten as a delicacy under the name of kipper a luxury to which dr redgill has given his sanction as an ingredient of the scottish breakfastsee the excellent novel entitled marriage     note 5 p 234  the distinction of individuals by nicknames when they possess no property is still common on the border and indeed necessary from the number of persons having the same name in the small village of lustruther in roxburghshire there dwelt in the memory of man four inhabitants called andrew or dandie oliver they were distinguished as dandie eassilgate dandie wassilgate dandie thumbie and dandie dumbie the two first had their names from living eastward and westward in the street of the village the third from something peculiar in the conformation of his thumb the fourth from his taciturn habits  it is told as a wellknown jest that a beggar woman repulsed from door to door as she solicited quarters through a village of annandale asked in her despair if there were no christians in the place to which the hearers concluding that she inquired for some persons so surnamed answered na na there are nae christians here we are a johnstones and jardines     note 6 p 244  the mysterious rites in which meg merrilies is described as engaging belong to her character as a queen of her race all know that gipsies in every country claim acquaintance with the gift of fortunetelling but as is often the case they are liable to the superstitions of which they avail themselves in others the correspondent of blackwood quoted in the introduction to this tale gives us some information on the subject of their credulity  i have ever understood he says speaking of the yetholm gipsies that they are extremely superstitious carefully noticing the formation of the clouds the flight of particular birds and the soughing of the winds before attempting any enterprise they have been known for several successive days to turn back with their loaded carts asses and children upon meeting with persons whom they considered of unlucky aspect nor do they ever proceed on their summer peregrinations without some propitious omen of their fortunate return they also burn the clothes of their dead not so much from any apprehension of infection being communicated by them as the conviction that the very circumstance of wearing them would shorten the days of their living they likewise carefully watch the corpse by night and day till the time of interment and conceive that the deil tinkles at the lykewake of those who felt in their deadthraw the agonies and terrors of remorse  these notions are not peculiar to the gipsies but having been once generally entertained among the scottish common people are now only found among those who are the most rude in their habits and most devoid of instruction the popular idea that the protracted struggle between life and death is painfully prolonged by keeping the door of the apartment shut was received as certain by the superstitious eld of scotland but neither was it to be thrown wide open to leave the door ajar was the plan adopted by the old crones who understood the mysteries of deathbeds and lykewakes in that case there was room for the imprisoned spirit to escape and yet an obstacle we have been assured was offered to the entrance of any frightful form which might otherwise intrude itself the threshold of a habitation was in some sort a sacred limit and the subject of much superstition a bride even to this day is always lifted over it a rule derived apparently from the romans         notes to volume 2  note 1 p 93  the roads of liddesdale in dandie dinmonts days could not be said to exist and the district was only accessible through a succession of tremendous morasses about thirty years ago the author himself was the first person who ever drove a little open carriage into these wilds the excellent roads by which they are now traversed being then in some progress the people stared with no small wonder at a sight which many of them had never witnessed in their lives before     note 2 p 102  the tappit hen contained three quarts of claret      weel she loed a hawick gill        and leugh

the figure of a hen upon the lid in later times the name was given to a glass bottle of the same dimensions these are rare apparitions among the degenerate topers of modern days     note 3 p 102  the account given by mr pleydell of his sitting down in the midst of a revel to draw an appeal case was taken from a story told me by an aged gentleman of the elder president dundas of amiston father of the younger president and of lord melville it had been thought very desirable while that distinguished lawyer was kings counsel that his assistance should be obtained in drawing an appeal case which as occasion for such writings then rarely occurred was held to be matter of great nicety the solicitor employed for the appellant attended by my informant acting as his clerk went to the lord advocates chambers in the fishmarket close as i think it was saturday at noon the court was just dismissed the lord advocate had changed his dress and booted himself and his servant and horses were at the foot of the close to carry him to arniston it was scarcely possible to get him to listen to a word respecting business the wily agent however on pretence of asking one or two questions which would not detain him half an hour drew his lordship who was no less an eminent ban vivant than a lawyer of unequalled talent to take a whet at a celebrated tavern when the learned counsel became gradually involved in a spirited discussion of the law points of the case at length it occurred to him that he might as well ride to arniston in the cool of the evening the horses were directed to be put in the stable but not to be unsaddled dinner was ordered the law was laid aside for a time and the bottle circulated very freely at nine oclock at night after he had been honouring bacchus for so many hours the lord advocate ordered his horses to be unsaddled paper pen and ink were brought he began to dictate the appeal case and continued at his task till four oclock the next morning by next days post the solicitor sent the case to london a chefdoeuvre of its kind and in which my informant assured me it was not necessary on revisal to correct five words i am not therefore conscious of having overstepped accuracy in describing the manner in which scottish lawyers of the old time occasionally united the worship of bacchus with that of themis my informant was alexander keith esq grandfather

never reads even a novel without an eye to the enlargement of the culinary science has added to the almanach des gourmands a certain potage a la meg merrilies de derndeugh consisting of game and

burnet whose taste for the evening meal of the ancients is quoted by mr pleydellwas the celebrated metaphysician and excellent man lord monboddo whose coenae will not be soon forgotten by those who have shared his classic hospitality as a scottish judge he took the designation of his family estate his philosophy as is well known was of a fanciful and somewhat fantastic character but his learning was deep and he was possessed of a singular power of eloquence which reminded the hearer of the os rotundum of the grove or academe enthusiastically partial to classical habits his entertainments were always given in the evening when there was a circulation of excellent bourdeaux in flasks garlanded with roses which were also strewed on the table after the manner of horace the best society whether
