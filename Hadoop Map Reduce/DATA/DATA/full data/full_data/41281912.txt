mind      chapter i  a strong appeal  it was evening of early summer  george lansing sat by a window of the library at brantholme  the house belonged to his cousin and george having lately reached it after traveling in haste from norway awaited the coming of mrs sylvia marston in an eagerly expectant mood  it was characteristic of him that his expression conveyed little hint of his feelings for george was a quiet selfcontained man but he had not been so troubled by confused emotions since sylvia married marston three years earlier  marston had taken her to canada but now he was dead and sylvia returning to england had summoned george who had been appointed executor of her husbands will  outside beyond the broad sweep of lawn the quiet english countryside lay bathed in the evening light a river gleaming in the foreground woods clothed in freshest verdure and rugged hills running back through gradations of softening color into the distance  inside a ray of sunlight stretched across the polished floor and gleams of brightness rested on the rows of books and somber paneling  brantholme was old but modern art had added comfort and toned down its austerity and george fresh from the northern snow peaks was conscious of its restful atmosphere  in the meanwhile he was listening for a footstep  sylvia he had been told would be with him in two or three minutes he had already been expecting her for a quarter of an hour  this however did not surprise him sylvia was rarely punctual and until she married marston he had been accustomed to await her pleasure  she came at length clad in a thin black dress that fitted her perfectly and he rose and stood looking at her while his heart beat fast  sylvia was slight of figure but curiously graceful and her normal expression was one of innocent candor  the somber garments emphasized the colorless purity of her complexion her hair was fair and she had large pathetic blue eyes  her beauty was somehow heightened by a hint of fragility in her widows dress she looked very forlorn and helpless and the man yearned to comfort and protect her it did not strike him that she had stood for some moments enduring his compassionate scrutiny with exemplary patience  its so nice to see you george she said  i knew you would come  he thrilled at the assurance but he was not an effusive person  he brought a chair for her  i started as soon as i got your note he answered simply  im glad youre back again  he did not think it worth while to mention that he had with difficulty crossed a snowbarred pass in order to save time and had left a companion who resented his desertion in the wilds but sylvia guessed that he had spared no effort and she answered him with a smile  your welcomes worth having because its sincere  those who understood sylvia best occasionally said that when she was unusually gracious it was a sign that she wanted something but george would have denied this with indignation  if it wouldnt be too painful you might tell me a little about your stay in canada he said by and by  you never wrote andhe hesitatedi heard only once from dick  dick was her dead husbands name and she sat silent a few moments musing and glancing unobtrusively at george  he had not changed much since she last saw him on her weddingday though he looked a little older and rather more serious  there were faint signs of weariness which she did not remember in his sunburned face  on the whole however it was a reposeful face with something in it that suggested a steadfast disposition  his gray eyes met one calmly and directly his brown hair was short and stiff the set of his lips and the contour of his jaw were firm  george had entered on his thirtieth year  though he was strongly made his appearance was in no way striking and it was seldom that his conversation was characterized by brilliancy  but his friends trusted him  its difficult to speak of sylvia began  when soon after our wedding dick lost most of his money and said that we must go to canada i felt almost crushed but i thought he was right  she paused and glanced at george  he told me what you wished to do and im glad that generous as you are he wouldnt hear of it  george looked embarrassed  i felt his refusal a little he said  i could have spared the money and i was a friend of his  he had proved a staunch friend though he had been hardly tried  for several years he had been sylvias devoted servant and an admirer of the more accomplished marston  when the girl chose the latter it was a cruel blow to george for he had never regarded his comrade as a possible rival but after a few weeks of passionate bitterness he had quietly acquiesced  he had endeavored to blame neither though there were some who did not hold sylvia guiltless  george was as she well knew her faithful servant still and this was largely why she meant to tell him her tragic story  well she said when i first went out to the prairie i was almost appalled  everything was so crude and barbarousbut you know the country  george merely nodded  he had spent a few years in a wheatgrowing settlement inhabited by wellbred young englishmen  the colony however was not conducted on economic lines and when it came to grief george having come into some property on the death of a relative returned to england  still continued sylvia i tried to be content and blamed myself when i found it difficult  there was always so much to docooking washing bakingone could seldom get any help  i often felt worn out and longed to lie down and sleep  i can understand that said george with grave sympathy  its a very hard country for a woman  he was troubled by the thought of what she must have borne for it was difficult to imagine sylvia engaged in laborious domestic toil  it had never occurred to him that her delicate appearance was deceptive  dick she went on was out at work all day there was nobody to talk toour nearest neighbor lived some miles off  i think now that dick was hardly strong enough for his task  he got restless and moody after he lost his first crop by frost  during that long cruel winter we were both unhappy i never think without a shudder of the bitter nights we spent sitting beside the stove silent and anxious about the future but we persevered the next harvest was good and we were brighter when winter set in  i shall always be glad of that in view of what came after  she paused and added in a lower voice  you heard of course  very little i was away  it was a heavy blow  i couldnt write much explained sylvia  even now i can hardly talk of itbut you were a dear friend of dicks  we had to burn wood the nearest bluff where it could be cut was several miles away and dick didnt keep a hired man through the winter  it was often very cold and i got frightened when he drove off if there was any wind  it was trying to wait in the quiet house wondering if he could stand the exposure  then one day something kept him so that he couldnt start for the bluff until noon and near dusk the wind got up and the snow began to fall  it got thicker and i could not sit still  i went out now and then and called and was driven back almost frozen by the storm  i could scarcely see the lights a few yards away the house shook  the memory of that awful night will haunt me all my life  she broke off with a shiver and george looked very compassionate  i think he said gently you had better not go on ah replied sylvia i must grapple with the horror and not yield to it with the future to be faced i cant be a coward  at last i heard the team and opened the door  the snow was blinding but i could dimly see the horses standing in it  i called but dick didnt answer and i ran out and found him lying upon the load of logs  he was very still and made no sign but i reached up and shook himi couldnt believe the dreadful thing  i think i screamed the team started suddenly and dick fell at my feet  then the truth was clear to me  a halfchoked sob broke from her but she went on  i couldnt move him i must have gone nearly mad for i tried to run to petersons three miles away  the snow blinded me and i came back again and by and by another team arrived  peterson had got lost driving home from the settlement  after that i cant remember anything im thankful it is soi couldnt bear it  then there was silence for a few moments until george rose and gently laid his hand on her shoulder  my sympathys not worth much sylvia but its yours he said  can i help in any practical way  growing calmer she glanced up at him with tearful eyes  i cant tell you just yet but its a comfort to have your sympathy dont speak to me for a little while please  he went back to his place and watched her with a yearning heart longing for the power to soothe her  she looked so forlorn and desolate too frail to bear her load of sorrow  i must try to be brave she smiled up at him at length  and you are my trustee  please bring those papers i laid down  i suppose i must talk to you about the farm  it did not strike george that this was a rather sudden change or that there was anything incongruous in sylvias considering her material interests in the midst of her grief  after examining the documents he asked her a few questions to which she gave explicit answers  now you should be able to decide what must be done she said finally and im anxious about it  i suppose thats natural  you have plenty of friends george reminded her consolingly  sylvia rose and there was bitterness in her expression  friends  oh yes but ive come back to them a widow badly provided forthats why i spent some months in montreal before i could nerve myself to face them  then her voice softened as she fixed her eyes on him  its fortunate there are one or two i can rely on  sylvia left him with two clear impressions her helplessness and the fact that she trusted him  while he sat turning over the papers his cousin and cotrustee came in  herbert lansing was a middleaged business man and he was inclined to portliness  his cleanshaven and rather fleshy face usually wore a goodhumored expression his manners were easy and as a rule genial  we must have a talk he began indicating the documents in georges hand  i suppose you have grasped the position even if sylvia hasnt explained it  she shows an excellent knowledge of details  there was a hint of dryness in his tone that escaped georges notice  so far as i can make out he answered dick owned a section of a secondclass wheatland with a mortgage on the last quarter some way back from a railroad  the part under cultivation gives a poor crop  what would you value the property at  george made a rough calculation  i expected something of the kind herbert told him  its all sylvia has to live upon and the interest would hardly cover her dressmakers bills he looked directly at his cousin  of course its possible that she will marry again  she must never be forced to contemplate it by any dread of poverty george said shortly  how is it to be prevented  george merely looked thoughtful and a little stern  getting no answer herbert went on  so far as i can see we have only two courses to choose between  the first is to sell out as soon as we can find a buyer with unfortunate results if your valuations right but the second looks more promising with immigrants pouring into the country lands bound to go up and we ought to get a largely increased price by holding on a while  to do that i understand the land should be worked  yes  it could no doubt be improved which would materially add to its value  i see one difficulty the cost of superintendence might eat up most of the profit  wages are high on the prairie are they not  george assented and herbert continued  then a good deal would depend on the man in charge  apart from the question of his honesty he would have to take a thorough interest in the farm  he would have to think of nothing else and be willing to work from sunrise until dark said george  successful farming means determined effort in western canada  could you put your hands upon a suitable person  im very doubtful  you dont often meet with a man of the kind we need in search of an engagement at a strictly moderate salary  then it looks as if we must sell out now for enough to provide sylvia with a pittance  that george said firmly is not to be thought of  there was a short silence while he pondered for his legacy had not proved an unmixed blessing  at first he had found idleness irksome but by degrees he had grown accustomed to it  though he was still troubled now and then by an idea that he was wasting his time and making a poor use of such abilities as he possessed it was pleasant to feel that within certain limits he could do exactly as he wished life in western canada was strenuous and somewhat primitive he was conscious of a strong reluctance to resume it but he could not bear to have sylvia who had luxurious tastes left almost penniless  there was a way in which he could serve her and he determined to take it george was steadfast in his devotion and did not shrink from a sacrifice  it strikes me theres only one suitable plan he said  i know something about western farming  i wouldnt need a salary and sylvia could trust me to look after her interests  id better go out and take charge until things are straightened up or we come across somebody fit for the post  herbert heard him with satisfaction  he had desired to lead george up to this decision and he suspected that sylvia had made similar efforts  it was not difficult to instil an idea into his cousins mind  well he said thoughtfully the suggestion seems a good one though its rather hard on you if you really mean to go  thats decided was the brief answer  then though we can discuss details later you had better give me legal authority to look after your affairs while you are away  there are those kaffir shares for instance it might be well to part with them if they go up a point or two  ive wondered why you recommended me to buy them george said bluntly  herbert avoided a direct answer  he now and then advised george who knew little about business in the management of his property but his advice was not always disinterested or intended only for his cousins benefit  oh he replied the cleverest operators now and then make mistakes and i dont claim exceptional powers of precision  its remarkably difficult to forecast the tendency of the stockmarket  george nodded as if satisfied  ill arrange things before i sail and id better get off as soon as possible  now suppose we go down and join the others     chapter ii  his friends opinion  on the afternoon following his arrival george stood thoughtfully looking about on his cousins lawn  creepers flecked the mellow brick front of the old house with sprays of tender leaves purple clematis hung from a trellis and lichens tinted the low terrace wall with subdued coloring  the grass was flanked by tall beeches rising in masses of bright verdure against a sky of clearest blue and beyond it across the sparkling river smooth meadows ran back to the foot of the hills  it was in spite of the bright sunshine all so fresh and cool a picture that could be enjoyed only in rural england  george was sensible of the appeal it made to him now when he must shortly change such scenes for the wide levels of western canada which are covered during most of the year with harsh gray grass alternately withered by frost and sun he felt their charm  it was one thing to run across to norway on a fishing or mountaineering trip and come back when he wished but quite another to settle down on the prairie where he must remain until his work should be done  moreover for mrs lansing had many friends the figures scattered about the lawnyoung men and women in light summer attireenhanced the attractiveness of the surroundings  they were nice people with pleasant english ways and george contrasted them with the rather grim aggressive plainsmen among whom he would presently have to live men who toiled in the heat half naked and who would sit down to meals with him in dusty unwashed clothes  he was not a sybarite but he preferred the society of mrs lansings guests  after a while she beckoned him and they leaned upon the terrace wall side by side  she was a goodnatured simple woman with strongly domestic habits and conventional views  im glad herbert has got away from business for a few days she began  he works too hard and its telling on him  how do you think he is looking  george knew she was addicted to displaying a needless anxiety about her husbands health  it had struck him that herbert was getting stouter but he now remembered having noticed a hint of care in his face  the rest will do him good he said  mrs lansings conversation was often disconnected and she now changed the subject  herbert tells me you are going to canada  as youre fond of the open air you will enjoy it  i suppose so george assented rather dubiously  of course its very generous and sylvias fortunate in having you to look after thingsmrs lansing paused before addingbut are you altogether wise in going george  lansing knew that his hostess loved romance and sometimes attempted to assist in one but he would have preferred another topic  i dont see what else i could do he said  thats hardly an answer  you will forgive me for speaking plainly but what i meant was thisyour devotion to sylvia is not a secret  i wish it were george retorted  but i dont intend to deny it  his companion looked at him reproachfully  dont get restive ive your best interests at heart  youre a little too confiding and too backward george  sylvia slipped through your fingers once before  georges brown face colored deeply  he was angry but mrs lansing was not to be deterred  take a hint and stay at home she went on  it might pay you better  and let sylvias property be sacrificed  yes if necessary  she looked at him directly  you have means enough  he struggled with his indignation  sylvia hated poverty and it had been suggested that he should turn the fact to his advantage  the idea that she might be more willing to marry him if she were poor was most unpleasant  sylvias favor is not to be bought he said  mrs lansings smile was half impatient  oh well if youre bent on going theres nothing to be said sylvia of course will stay with us  the arrangement was a natural one as sylvia was a relative of hers but george failed to notice that her expression grew thoughtful as she glanced toward where sylvia was sitting with a man upon whom the soldier stamp was plainly set  george followed her gaze and frowned but he said nothing and his companion presently moved away  soon afterward he crossed the lawn and joined a girl who waited for him ethel west was tall and strongly made  she was characterized by a keen intelligence and bluntness of speech  being an old friend of georges she occasionally assumed the privilege of one  i hear you are going to canada  what is taking you there again she asked  i am going to look after some farming property for one thing  ethel regarded him with amusement  sylvia marstons i suppose  yes george answered rather shortly  then whats the other purpose you have in view  george hesitated  im not sure i have another motive  so i imagined  youre rather an exceptional manin some respects  if thats true i wasnt aware of it george retorted  ethel laughed  its hardly worth while to prove my statement well talk of something else  has herbert told you anything about his business since you came back  i suppose you have noticed signs of increased prosperity  im afraid im not observant and herbert isnt communicative  perhaps hes wise  still the fact that hes putting up a big new orchardhouse has some significance  i understand from stephen that hes been speculating largely in rubber shares  its a risky game  i suppose it is george agreed  but its most unlikely that herbert will come to grief  he has a very long head i believe he could for example buy and sell me  that wouldnt be very difficult  i suspect herbert isnt the only one of your acquaintances who is capable of doing as much  her eyes followed sylvia who was then walking across the grass sylvias movements were always graceful and she had now a subdued pensive air that rendered her appearance slightly pathetic  ethels face however grew quietly scornful  she knew what sylvias forlorn and helpless look was worth  im not afraid that anybody will try george replied  your confidence is admirable laughed ethel but i mustnt appear too cynical and ive a favor to ask  will you take edgar out with you  george felt a little surprised  edgar was her brother a lad of somewhat erratic habits and ideas who had been at oxford when george last heard of him  yes if he wants to go and stephen approves he said for stephen the lawyer was an elder brother and the wests had lost their parents  he will be relieved to get him off his hands for a while but edgar will be over to see you during the afternoon  hes spending a week or two with the charltons  i remember that young charlton and he were close acquaintances  that was the excuse for the visit but you had better understand that there was a certain amount of friction when edgar came home after some trouble with the authorities  in his opinion stephen is too fond of making mountains out of molehills but i must own that edgars molehills have a way of increasing in size and the last one caused us a good deal of uneasiness  anyway we have decided that a years hard work in canada might help to steady him even if he doesnt follow up farming  the main point is that he would be safe with you  ill have a talk with him george promised and after a word of thanks ethel turned away  a little later she joined mrs lansing who was sitting alone in the shadow of a beech  im afraid ive added to georges responsibilitieshe has agreed to take edgar out she said  he has some reason for wishing to be delivered from his friends though i dont suppose he does so  ive felt the same thing  of course im not referring to edgarhis last scrape was only a trifling matter  so he contends laughed ethel  stephen doesnt agree with him  well said mrs lansing ive often thought its a pity george didnt marry somebody nice and sensible  would you apply that description to sylvia  sylvia stands apart mrs lansing declared  she can do what nobody else would venture on and yet you feel you must excuse her  have you any particular exploit of hers in your mind  i was thinking of when she accepted dick marston  i believe even dick was astonished  sylvia knows how to make herself irresistible said ethel strolling away a few moments later somewhat troubled in mind  she had cherished a halftender regard for george which had it been reciprocated might have changed to a deeper feeling  the man was steadfast chivalrous honest and she saw in him latent capabilities which few others suspected  still his devotion to sylvia had never been concealed and ethel had acquiesced in the situation though she retained a strong interest in him  she believed that in going to canada he was doing an injudicious thing but as his confidence was hard to shake he could not be warnedher conversation with him had made that plainer  she would not regret it if sylvia forgot him while he was absent but there were other ways in which he might suffer and she wished he had not chosen to place the management of his affairs in herberts hands  in the meanwhile her brother had arrived and he and george were sitting together on the opposite side of the lawn  edgar was a handsome darkhaired lad with a mischievous expression and he sometimes owned that his capacity for seeing the humorous side of things was a gift that threatened to be his ruin  nevertheless there was a vein of sound common sense in him and he had a strong admiration for george lansing  why do you want to go with me the latter asked pretending to be a bit stern but liking the youngster all the while  that edgar laughed is a rather euphemistic way of putting it  my washes have not been consulted  i must give my relatives the credit for the idea  still one must admit they had some provocation  it strikes me they have had a good deal of patience george said dryly  i suppose its exhausted  no replied edgar with a confidential air its mine that has given out  id better explain that being stuffed with what somebody calls formulae gets monotonous and its a diet theyre rather fond of at oxford  down here in the country theyre almost as bad and pretending to admire things i dont believe in positively hurts  thats why i sometimes protest with as a rule disastrous results  disastrous to the objectionable ideas or customs  no laughed the lad to me  have you ever noticed how vindictive narrowminded people get when you destroy their pet delusions  i cant remember ever having done so  then youll come to it  if youre honest its unavoidable only some people claim that they make the attack from duty while i find a positive pleasure in the thing  theres one consolationyou wont have much time for such proceedings if you come with me  youll have to work in canada  i anticipated something of the sort the lad rejoined  then he grew serious  have you decided whos to look after your affairs while you are away  if you havent you might do worse than leave them to stephen  hes steady and safe as a rock and after all the three per cent youre sure of is better than a handsome dividend you may never get  i cant give herbert the goby  hes the obvious person to do whatever may be needful  i suppose so edgar assented with some reluctance  no doubt hed feel hurt if you asked anybody else but i wish you could have got stephen  he changed the subject and when some of the others came up and joined them he resumed his humorous manner  im not asking for sympathy he said in answer to one remark  im going out to extend the bounds of the empire strengthen the ties with the mother country and that sort of thing  its one of the privileges that seem to be attached to the possession of a temperament like mine  how will you set about the work somebody asked  with the plow and the landpacker george broke in  hell have the satisfaction of driving them twelve hours a day  it happens to be the most effective way of doing the things he mentions  edgars laughter followed him as he left the group  after dinner that evening herbert invited george into the library  parker has come over about my lease and his visit will save you a journey he explained  we may as well get things settled now while hes here  george went with him to the library where the lawyer sat at a writingtable  he waited in silence while herbert gave the lawyer a few instructions  a faint draught flowed in through an open window and gently stirred the litter of papers a shaded lamp stood on the table and its light revealed the faces of the two men near it with sharp distinctness though outside the circle of brightness the big room was almost dark  it struck george that his cousin looked eager as if he were impatient to get the work finished but he reflected that this was most likely because herbert wished to discuss the matter of the lease  then he remembered with a little irritation what ethel said during the afternoon  it was not very lucid but he had an idea that she meant to warn him and edgar had gone some length in urging that he should leave the care of his property to another man  this was curious but hardly to be taken into consideration herbert was capable and exact in his dealings and yet for a moment or two george was troubled by a faint doubt  it appeared irrational and he drove it out of his mind when herbert spoke  the deeds ready you have only to sign he said indicating a paper then he added with a smile you quite realize the importance of what you are doing  the lawyer turned to george  this document gives mr lansing full authority to dispose of your possessions as he thinks fit  in accordance with it his signature will be honored as if it were yours  parkers expression was severely formal and his tone businesslike but he had known george for a long while and had served his father again for a moment george had an uneasy feeling that he was being warned but he had confidence in his friends and his cousin was eminently reliable  i know that he answered  ive left matters in herberts hands on other occasions with fortunate results  will you give me a pen  the lawyer watched him sign with an inscrutable face but when he laid down the pen herbert drew back out of the strong light  he was folding the paper with a sense of satisfaction and relief     chapter iii  a matter of duty  on the evening before georges departure sylvia stood with him at the entrance to the brantholme drive  he leaned upon the gate a broadshouldered motionless figure his eyes fixed moodily upon the prospect because he was afraid to let them dwell upon his companion in front across the dim white road a cornfield ran down to the river and on one side of it a wood towered in a shadowy mass against a soft green streak of light  near its foot the water gleamed palely among overhanging alders and in the distance the hills faded into the grayness of the eastern sky  except for the low murmur of the stream it was very still and the air was heavy with the smell of dewdamped soil  all this had its effect on george  he loved the quiet english country and now when he must leave it it strongly called to him  he had congenial friends and occupations in which he took pleasuresport experiments in farming and stockraising  it would be hard to drop them but that after all was a minor trouble  he would be separated from sylvia until his work should be done  what a beautiful night she said at length  summoning his resolution he turned and looked at her  she stood with one hand resting on the gate slender graceful and wonderfully attractive the black dress emphasizing the pure whiteness of her face and hands sylvia was an artist where dress was concerned and she had made the most of her somber garb  as he looked at her a strong temptation shook the man  he might still discover some excuse for remaining to watch over sylvia and seize each opportunity for gaining her esteem  then he remembered that this would entail the sacrifice of her property and a faint distrust of her which he had hitherto refused to admit seized him  sylvia threatened by poverty might yield without affection to the opportunities of a suitor who would bid high enough for her hand and he would not have such a course forced upon her even if he were the one to profit  youre very quiet you must feel going away she said  yes george admitted i feel it a good deal  ah  i dont know anybody else who would have gonei feel selfish and shabby in letting you  i dont think you could stop me  i havent tried  i suppose im a coward but until you promised to look after matters i was afraid of the future  i have friends but the tinge of contempt which would creep into their pity would be hard to bear  its hateful to feel that you are being put up with sometimes i thought id go back to canada  ive wondered how you stood it as long as you did george said incautiously  arent you forgetting  i had dick with me then  sylvia paused and shuddered  it would be so different now  george felt reproved and very compassionate  yes he said im afraid i forgot but the whole thing seems unreal its almost impossible to imagine your living on a farm in western canada  i dare say its difficult  ill confess im fond of ease and comfort and refinement  i like to be looked after and waited on to have somebody to keep unpleasant things away  thats dreadfully weak isnt it  and because i havent more courage im sending you back to the prairie  im quite ready to go  oh im sure of that  its comforting to remember that youre so resolute and matteroffact  you wouldnt let troubles daunt youperhaps you would scarcely notice them when you had made up your mind  the man smiled rather wistfully  he could feel things keenly and he had his romance but sylvia resumed  i sometimes wonder if you ever felt really badly hurt  once he said quietly  i think i have got over it  ah she murmured  i was afraid you would blame me but now it seems that dick knew you better than i did  when he made you my trustee he said that you were too big to bear him malice  the blood crept into georges face  after the first shock had passed and i could reason calmly i dont think i blamed either of you  you had promised me nothing dick was a brilliant man with a charm everybody felt  by comparison i was merely a plodder  sylvia mused for a few moments  george she said presently i sometimes think youre a little too diffident  you plodders who go straight on stopping for nothing generally gain your object in the end  his heart beat faster  it looked as if she meant this for a hint  i cant thank you properly she continued though i know that all you undertake will be thoroughly carried out  i wish i hadnt been forced to let you go so far away there is nobody else i can rely on  he could not tell her that he longed for the right to shelter her alwaysit was not very long since the canadian tragedybut silence cost him an effort  at length she touched his arm  its getting late and the others will wonder where we are she reminded him  they went back to the house and when sylvia joined mrs lansing george felt seriously annoyed with himself  he had been deeply stirred but he had preserved an unmoved appearance when he might have expressed some sympathy of tenderness which could not have been resented  presently ethel west crossed the room to where he was rather moodily standing  i believe our car is waiting and as edgar wont let me come to the station tomorrow i must say goodby now she told him  both stephen and i are glad he is on your hands  i must try to deserve your confidence george said smiling  its premature yet  never mind that  were alike in some respects pretty speeches dont appeal to us  but theres one thing i must tell youdont delay out yonder come back as soon as you can  she left him thoughtful  he had a high opinion of ethels intelligence but he would entertain no doubts or misgivings  they were treasonable to herbert and what was worse to sylvia  going to bed in good time he had only a few words with sylvia over his early breakfast in the morning  then he was driven to the station where edgar joined him and the greater part of their journey proved uneventful  twelve days after leaving liverpool they were however awakened early one morning by feeling the expresstrain suddenly slacken speed  the big cars shook with a violent jarring and george hurriedly swung himself down from his upper berth  he had some difficulty in getting into his jacket and putting on his boots but he pushed through the startled passengers and sprang down upon the track before the train quite stopped  he knew that accidents were not uncommon in the wilds of northern ontario  ragged firs rose dripping against the rosy glow in the eastern sky with the narrow gap hewed out for the line running through their midst  some had been stripped of their smaller branches by fire and leaned dead and blackened athwart each other  beneath them shallow pools gleamed in the hollows of the rocks which rose in rounded masses here and there and the gravel of the graded track was seamed by water channels  george remembered having heard the roar of heavy rain and a crash of thunder during the night but it was now wonderfully still and fresh and the resinous fragrance of the firs filled the chilly air  walking forward clear of the curious passengers who poured from the cars he saw a lake running back into the woods  a tall watertank stood on the margin with a shanty in which george imagined a telegraph operator was stationed at its foot  ahead the great locomotive was pouring out a cloud of sooty smoke  when george reached it he waited until the engineer had finished talking to a man on the line  what are we stopping for  has anything gone wrong he asked  freight locomotive jumped the track at a washout some miles ahead explained the engineer  took the fireman with her but i dont know much about it yet  guess theyll want me soon  george got the man to promise to take him and then he went back until he met edgar to whom he related what he had heard  im not astonished remarked the lad indicating one of the sleepers look at thatthe rails only held down by a spike or two we fasten them in solid chairs  theyre rough and ready in this country  it was the characteristic hypercritical attitude of the newlyarrived englishman and george knowing that the canadians strongly resent it noticed a look of interest in the eyes of a girl standing near them she was he imagined about twentyfour years of age and was dressed in some thin white material the narrow skirt scarcely reaching to the tops of her remarkably neat shoes  her arms were uncovered to the elbows her neck was bare but this displayed a beautiful skin and the face beneath the turneddown brim of the big hat was attractive george thought she was amused at edgars comment  well he said while we put down a few miles of metals theyd drive the track across leagues of new country and make a start with the traffic  they havent time to be particular with the great western wheatland waiting for development  the girl moved away and when word went around that there would be a delay of several hours george sat down beside the lake and watched the colonist passengers wash their childrens clothes  it was he thought rather a striking scenethe great train standing in the rugged wilderness the wide stretch of gleaming water running back among the firs and the swarm of jaded immigrants splashing barefooted along the beach  their harsh voices and hoarse laughter broke discordantly on the silence of the woods  after a while an elderly man in badlyfitting clothes and an old widebrimmed hat sauntered up with the girl george had noticed and stopped to survey the passengers  a middling sample not so many english as usual he remarked  if they keep on coming in as theyre doing well get harvest hands at a reasonable figure  all he thinks about edgar commented in a lowered voice  thats the uncivil old fellow who smokes the vile leaf tobacco he drove me out of the car once or twice  its hard to believe hes her father but in some ways theyre alike  i cant help feeling sorry for them the girl replied  look at those wornout women almost too limp to move  its hot and shaky enough in our cars the colonist ones must be dreadful  good enough for the folks whore in them theyre not fastidious said the man  they strolled on and george felt mildly curious about them  the girl was pretty and graceful with a stamp of refinement upon her the man was essentially rugged and rather grim  suddenly however a whistle blast rang out and george hurried toward the engine  it was beginning to move when he reached it but grasping a handrail he clambered up the cab was already full of passengers but he had found a place on the frame above the wheels when he saw the girl in the light dress running flushed and eager along the line  leaning down as far as possible he held out his hand to her  get hold if you want to come he called  theres a step yonder  she seized his hand and smiled at him when he drew her up beside him  thanks she said  i was nearly too late  perhaps we had better make for the pilot where therell be more room george suggested as two more passengers scrambled up  they crept forward holding on by the guardrail while the great engine began to rock as it gathered speed  the girl however was fearless and at length they reached the front and stood beneath the big headlamp with the triangular frame of the pilot running down to the rails at their feet  the ledge along the top of it was narrow and when his companion sat down george felt concerned about her safety her hat had blown back setting free tresses of glossy hair her light skirt fluttered against the sooty pilot  youll have to allow me he said tucking the thin fabric beneath her and passing an arm around her waist  he thought she bore it well for her manner was free from prudish alarm or coquettish submission  with sound sense she had calmly acquiesced in the situation but george found the latter pleasant  his companion was pretty the swift motion had brought a fine warmth into her cheeks and a sparkle into her eyes and george was slightly vexed when edgar appearing round the front of the engine unnoticed by the girl surveyed him with a grin  is there room for me he asked  i had to leave the place where i was because my fellow passengers didnt seem to mind if they pushed me off  a stranger doesnt get much consideration in this country  the girl looked up at him consideringly and answered through the roar of the engine  you may sit here if youll stop criticizing us  its quite fair edgar protested as he took his place by her side ive been in canada only three days but ive several times heard myself alluded to as an englishman as if that were some excuse for me  are you sure you havent been provoking people by your superior air  i didnt know i possessed one but i dont see why i should be very humble because im in canada  the girl laughed goodhumoredly and turned to george  im glad i came  this is delightful she said  it was george admitted an exhilarating experience  the big engine was now running at top speed rocking down the somewhat roughly laid line  banks of trees and stretches of gleaming water sped past the rails ahead came flying back to them  the sun was on the firs and the wind that lashed georges face was filled with their fragrance  once or twice a tress of his companions hair blew across his cheek but she did not appear to notice this  he thought she was conscious of little beyond the thrill of speed  at length the engine stopped where the line crossed a lake on a high embankment  a long row of freightcars stood near a break in the track into which the rails ran down and a faint cloud of steam rose from the gap  george helped the girl down anticipating edgar who seemed anxious to offer his assistance and they walked forward until they could see into the pit  it was nearly forty feet in depth for the embankment softened by heavy rain had slipped into the lake  in the bottom a huge locomotive lay shattered and overturned with half a dozen men toiling about it  the girl stopped with a little gasp for there was something strangely impressive in the sight of the wreck  its dreadful isnt it she exclaimed  then the men who had come with them gathered round  wheres the fireman one of them asked  he was too late when he jumped  have they got him out  guess not said another  see theyre trying to jack up the front of her  arent you mistaken about the man george asked looking at the first speaker meaningly  why no replied the other  hes certainly pinned down among the wreck  theyll find him before long  isnt that a jacket sleeve  he broke off with an exclamation as edgar drove an elbow hard into his ribs but it was too late  the girl looked around at george white in face  is there a man beneath the engine  dont try to put me off  im afraid its the case  then why did you bring me she cried with a shudder  take me away at once  george explained that he had forgotten the serious nature of the accident  he hastily helped her up and turned away with her but when they had gone a little distance she sat down on a boulder  i feel badly startled and ashamed she exclaimed  i was enjoying it as a spectacle and all the time there was a man crushed to death then she recovered her composure  go back and help  besides i think your friend is getting into trouble  she was right  the man edgar tried to silence had turned upon him savage and rather breathless  now he said ill fix you mighty quick  think im going to have a blamed percy sticking his elbow into me  edgar glanced at the big and brawny man with a twinge of somewhat natural uneasiness but he was not greatly daunted  oh well he retorted coolly if thats the way you look at it  but if youre not in a desperate hurry ill take off my jacket  what did you prod him for anyway another asked  im sorry i didnt jab him twice as hard though id have wasted my energy edgar explained  the fellow has no sense but thats no reason why he should be allowed to frighten a pretty girl  his antagonist looked as if a light had suddenly dawned on him  is that why you did it  of course  do you think id attack a man of nearly twice my weight without some reason  the fellow laughed  well let it go at that  youre all right percy  we like you  thanks said edgar but my name isnt percy  couldnt you think of something more stylish for a change  they greeted this with hoarse laughter and george arriving on the scene scrambled down into the pit with them to help the men below  it was some time later when he rejoined the girl who was then gathering berries in the wood  she saw that his face and hands were grimy and his clothes were soiled  i heard that you found the unfortunate man  it was very sad she said  but what have you been doing since  shoveling a ton or two of gravel  then i assisted in jacking up one side of the engine  why  did you enjoy it  george laughed he had as it happened experienced a curious pleasure in the work  he was accustomed to the more vigorous sports but after all they led to no tangible results and in this respect his recent task was differentone as he thought of it could see what one had done  he had been endowed with some ability of strictly practical description though it had so far escaped development  yes he responded  i enjoyed it very much  the girl regarded him with a trace of curiosity  was that because work of the kind is new to you  no george answered  it isnt altogether a novelty  i once spent three years in manual labor and now when i look back at them i believe i was happy then  she nodded as if she understood  shall we walk back she suggested  they went on together and though the sun was now fiercely hot and the distance long george enjoyed the walk  once they met a ballast train with a steam plow mounted at one end of it and a crowd of men riding on the open cars but when it had passed there was nothing to break the deep silence of the woods  the dark firs shut in the narrow track except when here and there a winding lake or frothing river filled a sunny opening  soon after george and his companion reached the train the engine came back with a row of freightcars and during the afternoon the western express pulled out again and sped furiously through the shadowy bush     chapter iv  george makes friends  it was nearing midnight when george walked impatiently up and down the waitingroom in winnipeg station for the western express was very late and nobody seemed to know when it would start  george was nevertheless interested in his surroundings and with some reason  the great room was built in palatial style with domed roof tessellated marble floor and stately pillars it was brilliantly lighted and massivelyframed paintings of snowcapped peaks and river gorges adorned the walls  an excursiontrain from winnipeg beach had just come in and streams of young men and women in summer attire were passing through the room  they all looked happy and prosperous he thought the girls light dresses were gayer and smarter than those usually seen among a crowd of english passengers but there was another side to the picture  rows of artistic seats ran here and there and each was occupied by jaded immigrants worn out by their journey in the sweltering colonist cars  piles of dilapidated baggage surrounded them and among it exhausted children lay asleep  drowsy dusty women with careworn faces were huddled beside them men bearing the stamp of illpaid toil sat in dejected apathy and all about each group the floor which was wet with drippings from the roof was strewn with banana skins crumbs and scraps of food  there had been heavy rains and the atmosphere was hot and humid  it was however the silence of these newcomers that struck george most  there was no grumbling among themthey scarcely seemed vigorous enough for thatbut as he passed one row he heard a womans low sobbing and the wail of a fretful child  after a while the girl he had met on the train appeared and intimated by a smile that he might join her  they found an unoccupied seat and a smartlyattired young man who was approaching it stopped when he saw them  well he said coolly i guess i wont intrude  george felt seriously annoyed with him but he was reassured when his companion laughed with candid amusement  though there was no doubt of her prettiness he had already noticed that she did not impress one most forcibly with the fact that she was an attractive young woman  it seemed to sink into the background when one spoke to her  it was rather tedious waiting in the hotel she explained  there was nobody i could talk to my father is busy with a grain broker  then he is a farmer  yes said the girl he has a farm  and you live out in the west with him  of course she said smiling  still i have been in montreal and england  then she turned and glanced at the jaded immigrants  one feels sorry for them they have so much to bear  george felt that she wished to change the subject and he followed her lead  i feel inclined to wonder where they all go to and how you employ them  your people still seem anxious to bring them in  yes she replied thoughtfully its rather a difficult question  of course we pay high wagespeople who say they must dispense with help and cant carry out useful projects would like to see them lowerbut theres the long winter when out west at least very few men can work then what the others have earned in summer rapidly melts  but what do the canadian farmhands and mechanics think  it wouldnt suit them to have wages broken down  west had come up a few moments earlier  it doesnt matter he laughed they wont be consulted  its the other people who pull the strings and theyre adopting a forward policyrush them all in its their lookout when they get here thats my opinion though ill own that i know remarkably little about western canada  you wont admit hes right george said to the girl  she looked grave  sometimes she answered i wonder  then she turned to west  you dont seem impressed with the country she said  as a rule i try to be truthful  the country strikes me as being pretty mixed full of contrasts  theres this place for instance one could imagine they had meant to build a greek temple and now it looks more like a swimmingbath  after planning the rest magnificently why couldnt they put on a roof that wouldnt leak  it has been an exceptionally heavy rain the girl reminded him  just so  but couldnt somebody get a broom and sweep the water out our unimaginative english folk could rise as far as that  she laughed goodhumoredly and her father sauntered up to them  any news of the train yet he asked  no sir said edgar  in my opinion any attempt to extract reliable information from a canadian railroadhand is a waste of time  no doubt its so scarce that it hurts them to part with it  the westerner looked at him with a little hard smile  he was tall and gaunt and dressed in baggy clothes but there was a hint of power in his face which was lined and deeply bronzed by exposure to the weather  well he retorted what do you expect percy if you talk to them like that  but i want to thank you and your partner for taking care of my girl when she went to see the wreck  fellow on the cars told mesaid you were a gritty pup  edgar looked confused but the man drew an old skin bag out of his pocket  its domestic leaf take a smoke  no thanks said edgar quickly  ive no doubt its excellent but i really prefer the common virginia stuff  matter of habit replied the other  i dont carry cigars theyre expensive  going far west  we get off at sage butte  its called butte  im located in that district  then i wonder if you knew an englishman named marston george interposed  i certainly did he died last winter  oughtnt to have come out farming he hadnt the grip  george felt surprised  he had always admired marston who had excelled in whatever he took in hand  it was strange and disconcerting to hear him disparaged  will you tell me what you mean by that he asked  why yes  ive nothing against the man  i liked himguess everybody didbut the contract he was up against was too big for him  had his first crop frozen and lost his nerve and judgment after thatthe man who gets ahead here must have the grit to stand up against a few bad seasons  marston acted foolishly wasted his money buying machines and teams he could have done without and then let up when he saw it wouldnt pay him to use them right off but that was part his wifes fault  she drove him pretty hardthough in some ways i guess he needed it  george frowned  sylvia he admitted was ambitious and she might have put a little pressure upon marston now and then but that she should have urged him on toward ruin in her eagerness to get rich was incredible  i think you must be mistaken about his wife he remarked  well drawled the canadian im not always right  then a bell tolled outside an official shouted the names of towns and there was a sudden stir and murmur of voices in the great waitingroom men seized their bags and bundles women dragged sleepy children to their feet and a crowd began to press about the outlet  guess thats our train  shes going to be pretty full said the canadian  the party joined a stream of hurrying passengers and regretted their haste when they were violently driven through the door and into a railedoff space on the platform where shouting railroadhands were endeavoring to restrain the surging crowd  nobody heeded them the immigrants patience was exhausted and they had suddenly changed from a dully apathetic multitude waiting in various stages of dejection to a savage mob fired by one determined purpose  near by stood a long row of lighted cars and the immigrants meant to get on board them without loss of time  there were two gates guarded by officials who endeavored to discriminate between the holders of first and second class tickets but the crowd was in no mood to submit to the separation  it raged behind the barrier and when one gate was rashly pushed back a little too far a clamorous jostling mass of humanity stormed the opening  its guardians were flung aside helpless and the foremost of the mob poured out upon the platform while the pressure about the gap grew insupportable  women screamed children were reft away from their mothers panting men trampled over bags and bundles torn from their owners hands and george and the elderly canadian struggled determinedly to prevent the girls being badly crushed  edgar had disappeared though they once heard his voice raised in angry protest  they were forced close up to the outlet when there was a check  more officials had been summoned somebody had dropped a heavy box which obstructed the passage and a group of passengers began a savage fight for its recovery  george seized a man who was jostling the girl and thrust him backward but the next moment he was struck by somebody and he saw nothing of his companions when after being violently driven to and fro he reached the gate  a woman with two screaming children clinging to her appeared beside him and he held a man so that she might pass  he was breathless and almost exhausted but he secured her a little room and then the pressure suddenly slackened  the crowd swept out like a flood from a broken dam and in a few more moments george stood gasping on the platform amid a thinner stream of running people  there was no sign of the canadian or his daughter the cars were besieged and george waited until edgar joined him flushed and disheveled  i suppose i was lucky in getting through with only my jacket badly torn said the lad i wondered why the railroad people caged up their passengers behind iron bars but now i know  george laughed  i dont think this kind of thing is altogether usual  owing to the accident theyve no doubt had two trainloads to handle instead of one but the platforms emptying shall we look for a place  they managed to enter a car though the stream of passengers pouring in by the two vestibules met within in dire confusion choking up the passage with their baggage  order was however restored at last and with the tolling of the bell and a jerk that flung those unprepared off their feet the great express got off  nobody left behind edgar announced after a glance through the window  i cant imagine where they put them all though ive never seen a train like this  but what has become of our canadian friends  george said he did not know and edgar resumed  im rather taken with the girlstrikes me as intelligent as well as fetching  the mans a grim old savage but im inclined to think hes prosperous when a fellow says he cant afford cigars i generally suspect him of being rich  its a pity that stinginess is one of the roads to affluence  the car glaringly lighted by huge lamps was crowded and very hot and after a while george went out on to the rear platform for a breath of air  the train had now left the city and glancing back as it swung around a curve he wondered how one locomotive could haul the long row of heavy cars  then he looked out across the wide expanse of grass that stretched away in the moonlight to the dim blur of woods on the horizon  here and there clumps of willows dotted the waste but it lay silent and empty without sign of human life  the air was pleasantly fresh after heavy rain and the stillness of the vast prairie was soothing by contrast with the tumult from which they had recently escaped  lighting his pipe george leaned contentedly on the rail  then remembering what the canadian had said he thought of his old friend marston a man of charm and varied talents whom he had long admired and often rather humbly referred to  it was hard to understand how dick had failed in canada and harder still to see why he had made his plodding comrade his executor for george having seldom had occasion to exert his abilities had no great belief in them  he had suffered keenly when sylvia married dick but the homage he had offered her had always been characterized by diffidence springing from a doubt that she could be content with him and after a sharp struggle he succeeded in convincing himself that his wound did not matter if she were happier with the more brilliant man  he had entertained no hard thoughts of her sylvia could do no wrong  his love for her sprang rather from respect than passion in his eyes she was all that a woman ought to be  in the meanwhile his new friends were discussing him in a car farther back along the train  im glad i had that englishman by me in the crowd the man remarked hes cool and kept his head did what was needed and nothing else  i allow you owe him something for bringing you through  yes said the girl he was quick and resolute  then reserving the rest of her thoughts she added his friends amusing  percy  oh yes agreed her father  nothing to notice about himhes just one of the boys  the others different  what that fellow takes in hand hell go through with  you havent much to form an opinion on  that doesnt count  i can tell if a mans to be trusted when i see him  youre generally right the girl admitted  you were about marston i was rather impressed by him when he first came out  her father smiled  just so  marston had only one troublehe was all on top  you saw all his good points in the first few minutes  it was rough on him that they werent the ones that are needed in this country  its a country that demands a great deal the girl said thoughtfully  sure was the dry reply  the prairie breaks the weak and shiftless pretty quick we only have room for hard men wholl stand up against whatever comes along  and do you think that description fits the englishman we met  well said her father i guess he wouldnt back down if things went against him  he went out for a smoke and the girl considered what he had said  it was not a matter of much consequence but she knew he seldom made mistakes and in this instance she agreed with him  as it happened georges english relatives included one or two clever people but none of them held his talents in much esteem  they thought him honest rather painstaking and goodnatured but that was all  it was left for two strangers to form a juster opinion which was perhaps a not altogether unusual thing  besides the standards are different in western canada  there a man is judged by what he can do     chapter v  the prairie  after a hot and tedious journey george and his companion alighted one afternoon at a little station on a branch line and edgar looked about with interest when the train went on again  a telegraph office with a baggageroom attached occupied the middle of the low platform a tall watertank stood at the end and three grain elevators towered high above a neighboring sidetrack  facing the track stood a row of wooden buildings varying in size and style they included a doublestoried hotel with a veranda in front of it and several untidy shacks  running back from them two short streets thinly lined with small houses led to a sea of grass  sage butte doesnt strike one as a very exhilarating place george remarked  well stroll round it and then see about rooms since we have to stay the night  they left the station but the main street had few attractions to offer  three stores with strangelyassorted dusty goods in their windows fronted the rickety plankwalk beyond these stood a livery stable a chinese laundry and a few dwellinghouses  several dilapidated wagons and buggies were scattered about the uneven road in the side street disorderly rows of agricultural implements surrounded a store and here and there little board dwellings with wire mosquitodoors and netguarded windows stood among low trees  farther back were four very small wooden churches  it was unpleasantly hot though a fresh breeze blew clouds of dust through the place  ive seen enough said edgar  the butte isnt pretty well assume its prosperous though i havent noticed much sign of activity yet lets go to the hotel  when they reached it several untidy loungers sat half asleep in the shade of the veranda and though they obstructed the approach to the entrance none of them moved  passing behind them george opened a door filled in with wiremesh and they entered a hot room with a bare floor furnished with a row of plain wooden chairs  after they had rung a bell for several minutes a man appeared and looked at them with languid interest from behind a short counter  can you put us up george inquired  sure was the answer  the man flung down a labeled key twisted round his register which was fitted in a swivel frame and handed george a pen  we want two rooms edgar objected  cant help that  weve only got one  i suppose wed better take it  where can one get a drink  bar replied the other indicating a gap in a neighboring partition  theyre laconic in this country edgar remarked  ever since i arrived in it ive felt as if i were a mere piece of baggage to be hustled along anyway without my wishes counting  youll get used to it after a while george consoled him  entering the dark bar edgar refreshed himself with several icecooled drinks served in what he thought were unusually small glasses  he felt somewhat astonished when he paid for them  thirsts expensive on the prairie he commented  pump outside drawled the attendant  its rather mean water  they went upstairs to a very scantily furnished doubledbedded room george warned by previous experience glanced around  theres soap and a towel anyway but i dont see any water he remarked  ill take the jar theyll have a raintank somewhere about  edgar did not answer him  he was looking out of the open window and now that there was little to obstruct his view the prospect interested him  it had been a wet spring and round the vast halfcircle he commanded the prairie ran back to the horizon brightly green until its strong coloring gave place in the distance to soft neutral tones it was blotched with crimson flowers in the marshy spots there were streaks of purple broad squares of darker wheat checkered the sweep of grass and dwarf woods straggled across it in broken lines  in one place was the gleam of a little lake  over it all there hung a sky of dazzling blue across which great rounded cloudmasses rolled  edgar looked around as george came in with the water  thats great he exclaimed indicating the prairie and then turning toward the wooden town he added what a frightful mess man can make of pretty things  still ive no doubt the people who built the butte are proud of it  if you talk to them in that style youll soon discover their opinion george laughed but i dont think it would be wise  soon afterward a bell rang for supper and going down to a big room they found seats at a table which had several other occupants  two of them who appeared to be railroadhands were simply dressed in trousers and slatecolored shirts and when they rested their elbows on the tablecloth they left grimy smears  george thought the third man of the party who was neatly attired must be the stationagent the fourth was unmistakably a newlyarrived englishman  as soon as they were seated a very smart young woman came up and rattled off the names of various unfamiliar dishes  i think ill have a steak i know what that is edgar told her  she withdrew and presently surrounded him with an array of little plates at which he glanced dubiously before he attacked the thin hard steak with a nickeled knife which failed to make a mark on it  when he made a more determined effort it slid away from him sweeping some greasy fried potatoes off his plate and he grew hot under the stern gaze of the girl who reappeared with some coffee he had not ordered  perhaps you had better take it away before i do more damage and let me have some fish he said humbly  another time youll say what you want at first  you cant prospect right through the menu she rebuked him  in the meanwhile george had been describing his companions on the train to one of the men opposite  he told me he was located in the district but i didnt learn his name and he didnt get off here he explained  do you know him  sure said the other  its alan grant of poplar bout eighteen miles back  guess he went on to the next stationa little farther but its easier driving now theyre dumping straw on the trail  putting straw on the road edgar broke in  why are they doing that  youll see if you drive out north the man answered shortly  then he turned to his betterdressed companion  what are you going to do with that carload of lumber we got for grant  send the car on to benton  shes billed here  cant help thatthe roads mistake  grant ordered all his stuff to benton  what he says goes  this struck george as significantit was only a man of importance whose instructions would be treated with so much deference  then the agent turned to edgar  what do you think of this country  the countrys very nice  so far as ive seen them i cant say as much for the towns they might be prettier  might be prettier exclaimed the agent  if theyre not good enough for you why did you come here  im not sure it was a very judicious move  but you see i didnt know what the place was like and after all an experience of this kind is supposed to be bracing  the agent ignored edgar after this  he talked to george and elicited the information that the latter meant to farm  then he got up followed by two of the others and the remaining man with the english appearance turned to george diffidently  do you happen to want a teamster he asked  i believe ill want two was the answer  but im afraid ill have to hire canadians  the mans face fell  he looked anxious and george remembered having seen a careworn woman tearfully embracing him before their steamer sailed  her shabby clothes and despairing face had roused georges sympathy  well said the man dejectedly thats for you to decide but ive driven horses most of my life and until i get used to things id be reasonable about the pay  i was told these little places were the best to strike a job in but so far as i can find out theres not much chance here  george felt sorry for him  he suddenly made up his mind  what are farm teamsters getting now he asked a man who was leaving an adjacent table  thirty dollars a month was the answer  thanks said george turning again to the englishman  be ready to start with us tomorrow  ill take you at thirty dollars but if i dont get my value out of you well have to part  no fear of that sir replied the other in a tone of keen satisfaction  when they got outside edgar looked at george with a smile  im glad you engaged the fellow he said but considering that youll have to teach him were you not a little rash  ill find out by and by  george paused and continued gravely its a big adventure these people make  think of itthe raising of the passage money by some desperate economy the woman left behind with hardly enough to keep her a month or two the mans fierce anxiety to find some work  when i saw how he was watching me i felt i had to hire him  just so responded edgar  i suppose i ought to warn you that doing things of the kind may get you into trouble some day but coldblooded prudence never did appeal to me  he took one of the chairs in front of the building and filled his pipe before he continued well sit here a while and then we might as well stroll across the plain  the generalroom doesnt strike me as an attractive place to spend the evening in  an hour later they left the tall elevators and straggling town behind and after brushing through a belt of crimson flowers they followed the tornup black trail that led into the waste  after a mile or two it broke into several divergent rows of ruts and they went on toward a winding line of bluff across the short grass  reaching that they pushed through the thin wood of dwarf birch and poplar skirting little pools from which mallard rose and then crossing a long rise they sat down to smoke on its farther side  sage butte had disappeared the sun had dipped and the air was growing wonderfully fresh and cool  here and there a house or barn rose from the sweep of grass but for the most part it ran back into the distance lonely and empty  it was steeped in strong cold coloring but on its western rim there burned a vivid flush of rose and saffron  edgar was impressed by its vastness and silence  this he said thoughtfully makes up for a good deal  once you get clear of the railroad its a captivating country  have you decided yet what youre going to do in it  its too soon edgar rejoined  the family idea was that i should stay about twelve months and then go back and enter some profession ethel seems quite convinced that a little roughing it will prove beneficial  i might however stop out and try farming which is one reason why you can have my services for nothing for a time considering what local wages are dont you think youre lucky  that laughed george remains to be seen  anyhow theres no doubt that sylvia marston scores in securing you on the same favorable terms  it has struck me that shes a woman who gets things easily  she hasnt always done so  can you imagine for instance what two years on a prairie farm must have been to a delicate fastidious girl brought up in luxury  ive an idea that sylvia would manage to avoid a good many of the hardships  sylvia would never shirk a duty george declared firmly  edgar refilled his pipe  ive been thinking about dick marston he said  after the way he was generally regarded at home it was strange to hear that canadians opinions but ive a notion that this countrys a pretty severe touchstone  i mean that the sort of qualities that make one popular in england may not prove of much use here  dick lost his crop that accounts for a good deal george said shortly  edgar knowing how staunch he was to his friends changed the subject and when the light grew dim they went back to the hotel  breakfasting soon after six the next morning they took their places in a light fourwheeled vehicle for which three persons baggage made a rather heavy load and drove away with the hired man  the grass was wet with dew the air invigoratingly cool and for a time the fresh team carried them across the waste at an excellent pace  when he had got used to the frantic jolting edgar found the drive exhilarating  poplar bluffs little ponds a lake shining amid tall sedges belts of darkgreen wheat went by and while the horses plunged through tall barleygrass or hauled the vehicle over clods and ruts the same vast prospect stretched away ahead  it filled the lad with a curious sense of freedom there was no limit to the prairiesone could go on and on across still wider stretches beyond the horizon  by and by however they ran in among low sandy hills dotted with dwarf pines here and there and the pace slackened  the grass was thin the wheels sank in deep loose sand and the sun was getting unpleasantly hot  for half an hour they drove on and then the team came to a standstill necked with spume at the foot of a short steep rise  edgar alighted and found the heat almost insupportable  there was glaring sand all about him and the breeze which swept the prairie was cut off by the hill in front  youll have to help the team george told him as he went to the horses heads  edgar and the hired man each seized a wheel and endeavored to start the vehicle while the horses plunged in the slipping sand  they made a few yards with clouds of grit flying up about them and afterward came to a stop again  next they tried pushing and after several rests they arrived breathless and gasping at the crest of the rise  there was a big hollow in front and on the opposite side a ridge which looked steeper than the last one  how much do you think there is of this edgar inquired  i cant say george answered  i know of one belt that runs for forty miles  even walking downhill was laborious for they sank ankledeep but it was very much worse when they faced the ascent  short as the hill was it took them some time to climb and with the hired mans assistance edgar carried a heavy trunk up the last part of it  then he sat down  im not sure i can smoke but i intend to try he said  if you mean to rush the next hill right off you will go without me  he turned to the hired man  what do you think of these roads grierson  ive seen better sir the other answered cautiously  perhaps the hills dont go on very far  edgar ruefully glanced ahead at scattered pines clumps of brush and ridges of gleaming sand  its my opinion theres no end to them  hauling a load of wheat through this kind of country must be a bit of an undertaking  after a short rest they toiled for an hour through the sand and then rode slowly over a road thickly strewn with straw which bore the wheels  it led them across lower ground to a strong wire fence where it forked one branch skirting the barrier along the edge of a muskeg the other running through the enclosed land  deciding to take the latter george got down at the entrance which was barred by several strands of wire firmly fastened  half an hours work here edgar commented  drivings rather an arduous pastime in western canada  they crossed a long field of barley a breadth of wheat and passed an empty house then wound through a poplar wood until they reached the grass again  it was long and rank hiding the ruts and hollows in the trail but after stopping a while for dinner in the shadow of a bluff they jolted on and in the afternoon they reached a smoother track crossing a low rise they saw a wide stretch of wheat beneath them with a house and other buildings near its margin  that said george is sylvias farm  half an hour later they drove through the wheat at which george glanced dubiously and then traversing a belt of light sandy clods partly grown with weeds they drew up before the house  it was doublestoried roomy and neatly built of wood but it was in very bad repair and the barn and stables had a neglected and halfruinous look implements and wagons which had suffered from exposure to the weather stood about outside  edgar noticed that georges face was grave  i am afraid we have our work cut out he said  well put up the team and then look round the place and see what needs doing first     chapter vi  george gets to work  it was an oppressive evening after a day of unusual heat  edgar sat smoking outside the homestead  he had been busy since six oclock that morning and he felt tired and downcast  massed thunderclouds brooded over the silent prairie wheat and grass had faded to dingy green and lifeless gray and edgar tried to persuade himself that his moodiness was the effect of the weather  this was partly the case but he was also suffering from homesickness and a shrinking from what was new and strange  the wooden house had a dreary dilapidated look the weathered neglected appearance of barns and stables was depressing  it was through a neighboring gap in the fence that marstons team had brought their lifeless master home and edgar had seen enough to realize that the man must have grown slack and nerveless before he had succumbed the farm had broken down marstons strength and courage and now another man less gifted in many ways had taken it in charge  edgar wondered how he would succeed but in spite of a few misgivings he had confidence in george  after a while the latter who had been examining marstons farming books came out looking grave he had worn a serious air since their arrival  therell have to be a change he said  dicks accounts have given me something to think about  i believe im beginning to understand now how his money went  i suppose you havent got the new program cut and dried yet edgar suggested  george was seldom precipitate  no he answered  ive a few ideas in my mind  wont you have some trouble about finances if the alterations are extensive  ill have to draw on my private account unless herbert will assist  herbert wont do anything of the kind said edgar decidedly  george making no answer called grierson from the stable  youll drive in to the settlement after breakfast tomorrow tom he said  tell the man ill keep the team if hell knock off twenty dollars and he can have his check when he likes  then bring out the flour and groceries  i suppose i wont be going in again for a while well be too busy  its very likely said edgar knowing his comrades temperament  then i wonder if i could draw a pound or two asked grierson diffidently  why george questioned him  the immigration people would see that you had some money before they let you in  ive four pounds now i want to send something home at once  ah said george  i see  how much did you leave your wife  about three pounds sir i had to bring enough to pass me at quebec  then if you give me what you have ill let you have a check for twice as much on an english bank  better get your letter written  griersons look was very expressive as he turned away with a word of thanks and edgar smiled at george  you have bought that fellowfor an advance of four pounds he said  george showed a little embarrassment  i was thinking of the woman he explained  then he pointed to the prairie  theres a rig coming  it looks like visitors  soon afterward grant whom they had met on the train drew up his team and helped his daughter down  we were passing and thought wed look in he said  found out yesterday that you were located here  george called grierson to take the team and leading the new arrivals to the house which was still in disorder he found them seats in the kitchen  it was rather roughly and inadequately furnished and edgar had decided that sylvia had spent little of her time there  after they had talked for a while a man dressed in blue duck trousers a saffroncolored shirt and an old slouch hat which he did not remove walked in carrying a riding quirt  grant returned his greeting curtly and then the man addressed george  i heard you were running this place he said  thats correct  then i put in the wheat on your summer fallow mrs marston told me to  thought id come along and let you have the bill  his manner was assertively offhand and george did not ask him to sit down  its a very secondrate piece of work george said  you might have used the landpacker more than you did  its good enough  anyway ill trouble you for the money  edgar was sensible of indignation mixed with amusement  this overbearing fellow did not know george lansing  i think you had better take off your hat before we go any fartherits customary  then you may tell me what i owe you  the man looked astonished but he complied with the suggestion and afterward stated his charge which was unusually high  edgar noticed that grant was watching george with quiet interest  i suppose you have a note from mrs marston fixing the price  the other explained that the matter had been arranged verbally  was anybody else present when you came to terms george asked  you can quit feeling and pay up exclaimed the stranger  ive told you how much it is  the trouble is that youre asking nearly double the usual charge per acre  grant smiled approvingly but the man advanced with a truculent air to the table at which george was sitting  ive done the work thats good enough for me  you have done it badly but ill give you a check now based on the regular charge which should come togeorge made a quick calculation on a strip of paper and handed it to the man  this is merely because you seem in a hurry  if youre not satisfied you can wait until i get an answer from mrs marston or ill ask some of my neighbors to arbitrate  the man hesitated with anger in his face  i guess ill take the check he said sullenly  crossing the floor george took a pen and some paper from a shelf  sit here he said when he came back and write me a receipt  the other did as he was bidden and george pointed toward the door  thats settled i wont keep you  the man looked hard at him and then went quietly out and grant leaned back in his seat with a soft laugh  you fixed him he remarked  he has the name of being a tough  i suppose an englishman newly out is considered lawful prey  a few of them deserve it grant returned dryly  but let that go what do you think of the place  george felt that he could trust the farmer  he had spent a depressing day during which all he saw had discouraged him  marston had farmed in a singularly wasteful manner fences and outbuildings were in very bad repair half the implements were useless and it would be a long and costly task to put things straight  i feel that ill have my hands full  in fact im a little worried about it there are so many changes that must be made  sure  where are you going to begin  by getting as much summer fallowing as possible done on the second quartersection  the first has been growing wheat for some time ill sew part of that with timothy  theres one bit of stiff land i might put in flax  ive thought of trying corn for the silo  timothy and a silo commented grant  youre going in for stock then  it means laying out money and a slow return  im afraid so  still you cant grow cereals year after year on this light soil  its a wasteful practise that will have to be abandoned as people here seem to be discovering  grain wont pay at sixteen bushels to the acre  a sure thing grant agreed  im sticking right to wheat but thats because im too old to change my system and im on black soil which holds out longer  but youre taking the nature out of it  it will see me through if i fallow said grant  when ive done with it and sell out somebody else can experiment with mixed crops and stockraising  thats going to become the general plan but its costly at the beginning  then he rose  ill walk round the place with you  they went out and the girl fell behind with edgar  he had learned that her name was flora  mr lansing seems to understand farming she remarked  he didnt tell us he had been on the prairie before  he hasnt told you now edgar pointed out  george never does tell things about himself unless theres a reason  he soon got rid of the fellow who sowed the crop  edgar laughed  i knew the man would meet with a surprise  georges abilities are not as a rule obvious at first sight  people find them out by accident and then theyre somewhat startled  youre evidently an admirer of his  do you mean to go in for farming  i am though i wouldnt have him suspect it said edgar  in answer to the other question i havent made up my mind  farming as its carried on in this country seems to be a rather arduous occupation  in the meanwhile im undergoing what english people seem to think of as the canadian cure that is ive been given a chance for readjusting my ideas and developing my character  under mr lansings guidance  edgar realized that the girl was less interested in him than in george but he did not resent this  youre smart  i believe my people entertained some idea of that nature george is considered safe  still to prevent any misapprehension id better point out that my chief failings are a fondness for looking at the amusing side of things and a slackness in availing myself of my opportunities  as an instance of the latter defect im boring you by talking about lansing  flora regarded him with a quiet smile  it struck me that you were saying something about yourself  i suppose thats true edgar admitted  it clears the ground  for what  for an extension of our acquaintance among other things  do you want it extended  they had stopped at the edge of a hollow filled with tall harsh grass and edgar studied her while he considered his answer  there was nothing that suggested coquetry in the faint amusement she displayed this was a girl with some depth of character though he realized that she was pretty  she carried herself well she was finely and strongly made her gray eyes were searching and she had a rather commanding manner  her hair was a warm brown clustering low on a smooth forehead nose and lips and chin were firmly molded  yes he answered candidly im feeling the strangeness of the country and ive an idea that both george and i may need friends in it  it strikes me that you and your father would prove useful ones  well she said hes sometimes called hard and hes a little prejudiced on certain points but he can be very staunch to those he takes a liking to  i believe edgar rejoined that also applies to you i dont mean the first of it  flora changed the subject  i gather that youre not favorably impressed with the place  im not  if i had to farm it id feel scared and i dont think george is happy  its hard to understand how marston let it get into such a state  he was unfitted for the work and he was further handicapped  how edgar asked  you may have noticed that while economy ruled outside the house is remarkably well furnished  the money marston spent in winnipeg stores should have gone into the land  edgar nodded he did not agree with georges opinion of sylvia  you dont seem to approve of the way mrs marston managed things its rather curious  i always thought her pretty capable in some respects  thats very possible said flora with a hint of dryness  after all it may not have been her fault edgar suggested  marston was a generous fellow he may have insisted on thinking first of her comfort  then she ought to have stopped him said flora firmly  do you think a woman should let a man spoil his one chance of success in order to surround her with luxury  the answers obvious  a dazzling flash of lightning leaped from the mass of somber cloud overhead and they turned back toward the house which george and grant reached soon afterward  grant said that he must get home before the storm broke and grierson brought out his spirited team  it had grown nearly dark a curious leaden haze obscured the prairie and when the man was getting into his light springseated wagon a jagged streak of lightning suddenly reft the gloom and there was a deafening roll of thunder  the horses started  grant fell backward from the step dropping the reins and while the others stood dazzled by the flash the terrified animals backed the vehicle with a crash against the stable  then they plunged madly forward toward the fence with the reins trailing along the ground  flora had got in before her father and she was now helpless  it was too late when grant got up grierson and edgar were too far away and the latter stood still wondering with a thrill of horror what the end would be he did not think the horses saw the thin wire fence and the gap in it was narrow  if they struck a post in going through the vehicle would overturn  then george running furiously sprang at the horses heads and went down still holding on  he was dragged along a few yards but the pace slackened and edgar ran forward with grierson behind him  for a few moments there was a savage struggle but they stopped and held the team until grant coolly cleared the reins and flung them to his daughter  stick tight while i get up and then watch out he said to the others  he was seated in another moment the girl quietly making room for him then to edgars astonishment he lashed the frantic horses with the whip and plunging forward they swept madly through the opening in the fence with the wagon jolting from rut to rut  a minute or two afterward they had vanished into the thick obscurity that veiled the waste of grass and there was a dazzling flash and a stunning roll of thunder  george flushed and breathless looked around with a soft laugh  grant has pretty good nerve he said  thats so sir grierson agreed  strikes me hell take some of the wickedness out of his team before he gets them home  i noticed that miss grant didnt look the least bit afraid  then a deluge of rain drove them into the house where edgar sat smoking thoughtfully for what flora grant had said about sylvia had a disturbing effect on him  it looked as if her selfish regard for her comfort had hampered marston in his struggle and though edgar had never had much faith in sylvia this was painful to contemplate moreover george cherished a steadfast regard for her which complicated things but edgar prudently decided that the matter was a delicate one and must be left to the people most concerned  after all miss grant might be mistaken     chapter vii  a cattle drive  george was summer fallowing sitting in the iron saddle of a plow which a heavy clydesdale team hauled through the stubble  the work should have been done earlier for the soil on the marston farm was very light and as it had already grown several crops of cereals george was anxious to expose it to the influence of sun and wind as soon as possible  it was about the middle of the afternoon and very hot rounded cloudmasses overhung the plain but dazzling sunshine fell on grass and stubble and a haze of dust surrounded the team while now and then the fine soil and sand blown from the rest of the fallow by the fresh breeze swept by in streams  george wore motorgoggles to protect his eyes but his face and hands felt scorched and sore farther back edgar plodded behind a lighter team making very poor progress  presently george looked up and saw flora grant riding toward him  she sat astride but her skirt fell in becoming lines and he thought the gray blouse and wide stetson hat with a red band round it most effective  she reined up her horse near the plow and george got down  i was passinggoing on to forsyths placeand my father asked me to call she said  you were talking about buying cattle and a man at dunblane has some good herefords to sell  father thinks they would suit you  his recommendation carries weight said george  ill go and see them  i must thank you for bringing me word  ive another message  its thiswhen youre buying stock be cautious how you bid  as im not well up in local prices i wish mr grant had been a little plainer  he went farther than i expected  you see as a friend of the seller hes awkwardly fixed  just so said george  but if youre not in the same position you might give me a hint  how much is the value of canadian cattle usually below the price likely to be asked of a new arrival  in this case i should say about fifty per cent flora answered with a laugh  thank you responded george  i am sure your opinions to be relied on  edgar stopped his team near by and flora regarded him with amusement as he came toward them his red face streaked with dust  you look a good deal more like a western farmer than you did when i saw you last she laughed  edgar removed his goggles and surveyed his working attire somewhat disgustedly  i wonder whether thats a compliment but now that ive made the first plunge id better go through with itget a flappy hat and a black shirt or one of those brilliant orange ones  the latter are more decorative  but as you are going on a two days journey to drive some cattle ill tell you how to find the way  you had better tell george  i can only remember the things that interest me  flora gave them clear instructions and when she rode away george turned to edgar  youll have to come and well start at once  grierson can go on plowing with the clydesdales which is more than you could do  im afraid i must admit it said edgar glancing at his ragged furrow  but im going to have my supper and put up some provisions before i leave the place  they set out an hour later and safely reached their destination where george purchased a dozen cattle  they were big red and white longhorned animals accustomed to freedom for fences are still scarce on tracts of the prairie and they ranged about the corral in a restless manner  edgar leaning on the rails watched them dubiously  they look unusually active he remarked  im not an expert at cattledriving but i suppose two of us ought to take them home  the rancher laughed  twos quite a good allowance for that small bunch but if you keep north among the scrub poplar you wont be bothered by many fences its pretty dry in summer but youll get good water in baxters well if you head for the big bluff youll see tomorrow afternoon  well let them out when youre ready  as soon as the rails were flung down the cattle rushed out tumultuously as if rejoicing in their restored freedom  then while george and his companion mounted they started off across the prairie at a steady trot  a mettlesome lot seem to be in good training edgar commented have you any idea where theyre going  guess theyre heading for a creek two miles back waters scarce explained the rancher  as its near the trail you had better let them go  youll round them up quite easy when theyve had a drink  george and edgar rode after the cattle  the sun was getting low but the temperature showed no signs of falling and the men were soon soaked in perspiration  the herd went on at a good pace making for a wavy line of timber and on reaching it plunged down the side of a declivity among little scattered trees  a stream trickled through willow bushes and tall grass in the bottom of the hollow and the men had trouble in forcing the cattle to leave the water  before they accomplished it edgar had got very wet and had scratched himself badly in scrambling through the brush  driving stock is by no means so easy as it looks he grumbled when they had climbed the opposite ascent leading their horses  the way these beasts jump about among the bushes confuses you id have sworn there were forty of them in the ravine  i see only nine now george said pointedly  edgar looked back into the hollow  there are three of the brutes slipping away upstream as fast as they can go  youre smarter at the thing than i amhadnt you better go after them  i expect ill be needed to keep this bunch together george rejoined  edgar strode away but it was half an hour later when he came back hot and angry with the cattle crashing through the brush in front of him then the reunited herd set off at a smart pace across the plain  they seem fond of an evening gallop edgar remarked  anyhow theyre going the right way which strikes me as something to be thankful for  they rode on and it was getting dark when they checked the herd near a straggling poplar bluff  the grass was good the beasts began to feed quietly and after picketing their horses the men lay down on their blankets  it was growing cooler a vivid band of green still flickered along the prairies rim and the deep silence was intensified by the soft sound the cattle made cropping the dewdamped herbage  i wonder if they go to sleep mused edgar  im beginning to think this kind of thing must be rather fine when one gets used to it  its a glorious night  by and by he drew his blanket round him and sank into slumber but for a while george who had paid a high price for a hereford bull lay awake thinking and calculating  it would cost a good deal more than he had anticipated to work the farm sylvia had no funds that could be drawn upon and his means were not large  economy and good management would be needed but he was determined to make a success of his undertaking  at last seeing that the herd showed no signs of moving he went to sleep  awakening at sunrise george found that except for the horses there was not a beast in sight  for an hour he and west hunted them through the bluff and then after making a hurried breakfast they went on their way again  it rapidly got hotter the stock traveled quietly and with a halt or two where a clump of poplars offered a little shade they rode scorched by dazzling sunshine across the limitless plain  in the afternoon george began to look eagerly for the bluff that the rancher mentioned  they had found no water and the cattle seemed distressed  the glare and heat were getting intolerable but the vast gradual rise in front of them ran on unbroken to the skyline  its crest however must be crossed before evening and they toiled on  at last the long ascent was made and george felt relieved when he saw a dark line of trees in the wide basin below him  that must be the big bluff where the well is though i dont see a house he said  they had some trouble in urging the herd down the slope but after a while they reached the welcome shadow of the trees and edgar broke into a shout when he saw a rude wooden platform with a windlass upon it and a trough near by  ride ahead with the horses and water them said george dismounting  edgar did as he was bidden but presently the herd attracted by the sight of water came surging round the trough savagely jostling one another  the lad worked hard with the windlass but he could not keep them supplied and they crowded on the low platform covering the well with heads stretched out eagerly toward the dripping bucket  after being flung against the windlass by a thirsty beast edgar called to his companion  theyll break through if youre not quick  its my opinion theyre bent on getting down the well  george came to his assistance with his riding quirt but when they were supplying the last two or three unsatisfied animals a man ran out of the bluff  what in thunder are you doing with our water he cried  he looks angry edgar commented  when that rancher fellow told us about the well he didnt mention the necessity of asking mr baxters permission  then he waved his hand to the stranger  come here and have a talk  the man came on at a quicker run  his face was hot with indignation and on reaching them he broke into breathless and pointed expostulations  when youre quite through well assess the damages george quietly told him  the farmers anger began to dissipate  no he said that would be taking a pretty mean pull on you but waters scarce and you cant have any more  well requested george have you a paddock or corral you could let me put this bunch of cattle into until the morning  im willing to pay for the accommodation  i cant do it replied the other  i want all the fenced grass ive got  take them right along and youll strike a creek about six miles ahead  then you ought to make the river tomorrow night  it was obvious that he desired to be rid of them and as it was getting cooler george resumed his journey  he found the creek early the next morning and as the day promised to be unusually hot he delayed only until he had watered the stock  in an hour or two the sun was hidden by banks of leaden cloud but the temperature did not fall and there was an oppressive heaviness in the air  the prairie had faded to a sweep of lifeless gray obscured above its verge  the men made progress however and late in the afternoon a winding line of timber that marked the rivers course appeared ahead  shortly afterward edgar looked around  thats a curious streak of haze in the distance he remarked  its smoke said george  grass fires are not uncommon in hot weather  it looks like a big one  they urged the cattle on a little faster but it was evening when they reached the first of the trees  george rode forward between them and pulled up his horse in some concern  the ford had been difficult when they crossed it on the outward journey but now the space between bank and bank was filled by an angry flood  it rolled by furiously lapping in frothy ripples upon the steep slope that led down to it  nearly an extra three feet of water thered be a risk in crossing he said when edgar joined him  we couldnt make the place where the trail runs in and the landing downstream from it looks bad  then what ought we to do edgar inquired  wait until tomorrow  theres no doubt been a heavy thunderstorm higher up but the water should soon run down  george glanced back toward the prairie dubiously  im a little anxious about the fire but after all it may not come near us  the cattle did not wander far after drinking and the men ate their supper  it grew dark but the heat did not lessen and the oppressive air was filled with a smell of burning  looking back between the trees they could see a long streak of yellow radiance leaping up and growing dim when the view was obstructed by clouds of smoke  its an awkward situation and as if it were not bad enough theres a big thunderstorm brewing edgar said at length  ill go along and look at the mark you made upon the bank  he strode away among the trees  it was very dark  the tethered horses were moving restlessly but so far as edgar could make out the cattle were bunched together  after lighting a match he came back  the waters falling but only slowly he reported  should we try to drive the stock along the bank  we couldnt herd them in the dark  besides its an extensive fire and im doubtful whether we could get down to the water farther along  they waited for an hour keeping the cattle together with some trouble and watching the blaze which grew brighter rapidly  at last wisps of pungent smoke rolled into the bluff  the beasts are ready to stampede george suddenly called to edgar well have to make a start  get into the saddle and drive them toward the ford  they were very busy for a while  their horses were hard to manage the timber was thick and the herd attempted to break away through it but at last they reached the steep dip to the waterside  one beast plunged in and vanished more followed and george plying his quirt and shouting rode in among the diminishing drove  he felt the water lapping about his boots and then the horse lost its footing  george dropped from the saddle and seized a stirrup  for some minutes he could see a few dark objects about him but they disappeared and he and the horse were swept away downstream  he kept holdthe animal was swimming stronglyand after a time a lurid flash of lightning showed him a black mass of trees close ahead they vanished the succeeding darkness was impenetrable and the crash of thunder was deadened by the roar of water  for a moment or two his head was driven under but when he got it clear another dazzling flash revealed a high bank only a few yards away and when thick darkness followed he felt the horse rise to its feet  then he touched soft bottom and a little later scrambled up an almost precipitous slope with the bridle in his hand and the horse floundering behind him  they reached the summit and stopping among thin timber it was with strong relief that he heard edgars shout  shortly afterward the lad appeared leading his horse  theres some of the drove on this side i dont see the rest he said glancing toward the opposite bank where dark trees stood out against a strong red glare  it strikes me we only got across in time  then torrential rain broke upon them and while they stood unable to move forward a cry reached them faintly through the roar of the deluge  it came again when george answered and was followed by a crackling and snapping of underbrush  then as a blaze of lightning filled the bluff with radiance two men appeared for a moment leading their horses among the slender trunks  they were immediately lost to sight again but presently they came up and george recognized grant by his voice  so you have got through lansing he cried  i met constable flett on the trail and as he told me the river was rising and there was a big fire west i figured you must be up against trouble  he asked a few questions and then resumed  as you got the stock started theyll have swum across but we cant round them up until its light  theres a deserted shack not far off and i guess well head for it  the constable agreed and mounting when they had got out of the timber they rode off through the rain     chapter viii  constable fletts suspicions  it was nearly six oclock in the evening when george and his companions who had spent part of the day looking for the straying stock rode up to the grant homestead through a vast stretch of grain this grew on the rich black soil they call gumbo in the west but here and there a belt of darkcolored summer fallow checkered the strong green of the wheat and oats  though he clung to the onecrop system alan grant was careful of his land  the fine brick house and range of smart wooden buildings the costly implements which included a gasoline tractorplow all indicated prosperity and george recognized that the ruggedfaced man beside him had made a marked success of his farming  when the cattle had been secured flora grant welcomed the new arrivals graciously and after a while they sat down to supper with the hired men in a big room  it was plainly furnished but there was everything that comfort demanded for the happy mean between bareness and superfluity had been cleverly hit and george thought miss grant was responsible for this  he sat beside her at the foot of the long table and noticed the hired hands attitude toward her  it was respectful but not diffident  the girl had no need to assert herself she was on excellent terms with the sturdy toilers who nevertheless cheerfully submitted to her rule  when the meal was over grant led his guests into a smaller room and produced a bag of domestic tobacco  the stock have gone far enough he said  youll stay here tonight  flett looked doubtful though it was obvious that he wished to remain he was a young brownfaced man and his smart khaki uniform proclaimed him a trooper of the northwest mounted police  the trouble is that im a bit late on my round already he protested  thats soon fixed said grant  he opened a rolltop desk and wrote a note which he read out   constable flett has been detained in the neighborhood of this homestead through having rendered at my request valuable assistance in rounding up a bunch of cattle scattered in crossing the flooded river   thanks said flett  that kind of thing counts when theyre choosing a corporal  grant turned to george with a smile  keep in with the police lansingive known a good supper now and then go a long way  they may worry you about fireguards and fencing but theyll stand by you when youre in trouble if you treat them right  if its a matter of straying stock a sick horse or you dont know how to roof a new barn you have only to send for the nearest trooper  arent these things a little outside their duties edgar asked  the constable grinned  most anything that wants doing badly is right in our line  sure said grant  its not long since flett went two hundred miles over the snow with a dogteam to settle a little difference between an indian and his wife  then he once brought a hurt trapper a fortnights journey on his sledge sleeping in the snow in the bitterest weather they were quite alone and the hurt man was crazy most of the time  then youre supposed to look after the settlers as well as to keep order suggested edgar looking admiringly at the sturdy young constable  thats so replied flett  they certainly need it  last winter we struck one crowd in a lonely shack up northman woman and several children huddled on the floor with nothing to eat and the stove outat forty degrees below  there was a bluff a few miles off but they hadnt a tool of any kind to cut cordwood with  took us quite a while to haul them up some stores though we made twelvehour marches between our camps in the snow  we had to hustle that trip  he paused and resumed  better keep an eye on that bunch of young horses mr grant bring them up nearer the house when the nights get darker  those clydesdales are mighty fine beasts and prices are high  grant looked astonished  ive been here a good many years and ive never lost a horse he declared  it doesnt follow youll always be as lucky the trooper said pointedly  i was told that property is as safe in the west as it is in england edgar broke in  just so remarked the trooper  they say that kind of thing  i never was in the old country but young mavericks arent the only stock to go missing in alberta which isnt a long way off  the boys there have their hands full now and then and we have three or four of the worst toughs ive struck right in sage butte  grant leaned forward on the table looking steadily at him  hadnt you better tell me what you have in your mind  i cant give you much information but we got a hint from regina to keep our eyes open and from things ive heard its my idea that now that the boys have nearly stopped the running of alberta cattle across the frontier some of the toughs they couldnt track mean to start the same game farther east  some of you ranchers run stock outside the fences and i guess one could still find a lonely trail to the american border  well said grant im glad you told me  he turned to george  be careful lansing you would be an easier mark  they strolled outside and after a while george joined flora and sauntered away across the grass with her  it was a clear still evening and the air was wonderfully fresh  though he wouldnt let me thank him i feel im seriously indebted to your father miss grant he said  our horses were worn out and the stock had all scattered when he turned up with the trooper  i believe he enjoyed the ride and the night in the rain replied flora  you see he had once to work very hard here and now that things have changed he finds it rather tame  he likes to feel hes still capable of a little exertion  i shouldnt consider him an idle man  flora laughed  that would be very wrong but the need for continual effort and the strain of making ends meet with the chance of being ruined by a frozen crop have passed  i believe he misses the excitement of it  then i gather that he built up this great farm  yes from a free quartersection  he and my mother started in a tworoomed shack  they were both from ontario but she died several years ago  the girl paused  sometimes i think she must have had remarkable courage i can remember her as always ready in an emergency always tranquil  george glanced at her as she stood finely posed looking out across the waste of grass with gravely steady eyes and it occurred to him that she resembled her mother in the respects she had mentioned nevertheless he felt inclined to wonder how she had got her grace and refinement  alan grant was forceful and rather primitive  have you spent much of your time here he asked  no she answered  my mother was once a schoolteacher and she must have had ambitious views for me  when the farm began to prosper i was sent to toronto  after that i went to montreal and finally to england  you must be fond of traveling  oh she said with some reserve i had thought of taking up a profession  and you have abandoned the idea  she looked at him quietly wondering whether she should answer  i had no alternative she said  i began to realize it after my mothers death  then my father was badly hurt in an accident with a team and i came back  he has nobody else to look after him and he is getting on in life  her words conveyed no hint of the stern struggle between duty and inclination but george guessed it  this girl he thought was one not to give up lightly the career she had chosen  then she changed the subject with a smile  i suspect that my father approves of you perhaps because of what you are doing with the land  i think i may say that if you have any little difficulty or are short of any implements that would be useful you need only come across to us  thank you george responded quietly  mr west mentioned that you were on a farm in this country once before  why did you give it up  somebody left me a little money  then what brought you back  she was rather direct but that is not unusual in the west and george was mildly flattered by the interest she displayed  its a little difficult to answer  for one thing i was beginning to feel that i was taking life too easily in england its a habit that grows on one  he had no desire to conceal the fact that he had come out on sylvias behalfit never occurred to him to mention it  he was trying to analyze the feelings which had rendered the sacrifice he made in leaving home a little easier  i dont think the dread of acquiring that habit is common among your people flora said mischievously  it doesnt sound like a very convincing reason  no replied george with a smile  still it had some weight  you see it isnt difficult to get lazy and slack and id done nothing except a little fishing and shooting for several years  i didnt want to sink into a mere lounger about country houses and clubs  its pleasant but too much of it is apt to unfit one for anything else  you believe its safer for example to haul stovewood home through the canadian frost or drive a plow under the scorching sun  yes i think i feel something of the kind  flora somewhat astonished him by her scornful laugh  youre wise she said  we have had sportsmen here from your country and ive a vivid memory of one or two  one could see by their coarse faces that they ate and drank too much and they seemed determined to avoid discomfort at any cost  i suppose they could shoot but they could neither strip a gun nor carry it on a long days march  the last party thought it needful to take a teamload of supplies when they went north after moose  it would have been a catastrophe if they had missed their dinner  going without ones dinner has its inconveniences said george  and thinking too much about it has its perils she retorted  george nodded  he thought he knew what she meant and he agreed with it  he could recall companions who living for pleasure had by degrees lost all zest for the more or less wholesome amusements to which they had confined their efforts  some had become mere club loungers and tattlers one or two had sunk into gross indulgence  this had had its effect on him he did not wish to grow redfaced slothful and fleshy as they had done nor to busy himself with trivialities until such capacities for useful work as he possessed had atrophied  well he said nobody could call this a good country for the pampered loafer  flora smiled and pointed out across the prairie  in the foreground it was flecked with crimson flowers farther back willow and poplar bluffs stretched in bluish smears across the sweep of grass that ran on beyond them toward the vivid glow of color on the skyline  it was almost beautiful in the soft evening light but it conveyed most clearly a sense of vastness and solitude  the effect was somehow daunting  one thought of the arctic winter and the savage storms that swept the wilds  ive heard it called hard she said  it undoubtedly needs hard men there is nothing here that can be easily won  thats a fact that the people youre sending over ought to recognize  they soon discover it when they get out  when theyve had a crop hailed or frozen the thing becomes obvious  did you lose one  i did george rejoined rather gloomily  ive a suspicion that if we get much dry weather and the usual strong winds i may lose another the wheats getting badly cut by driving sand thats a trouble we dont have to put up with in the old country  im sorry said flora and he knew she meant it  but you wont be beaten by one bad season  no george answered with quiet determination  i must make a success of this venture whatever it costs  she was a little puzzled by his manner for she did not think he was addicted to being needlessly emphatic but she asked no questions and soon afterward the others joined them and they went back to the house early on the following morning george started homeward with his cattle and as they rode slowly through the barleygrass that fringed the trail edgar looked at him with a smile  you spent some time in miss grants company he remarked  how did she strike you  i like her  shes interestingi think thats the right word for it seems to understand things talks to you like a man  just so edgar rejoined with a laugh  shes a lady ive a high opinion of in fact im a little afraid of her  though im nearly as old as she is she makes me feel callow  its a sensation thats new to me  and youre a man of experience arent you  i suppose i was rather a favorite at home edgar owned with humorous modesty  for all that i dont feel myself quite up to miss grants standard  i didnt notice any assumption of superiority on her part  oh no said edgar  she doesnt require to assume it the superioritys obvious thats the trouble  one hesitates about offering her the small change of compliments that generally went well at home  if you try to say something smart she looks at you as if she were amused not at what you said but at you  theres an embarrassing difference between the things  the remedys simple  dont try to be smart  you would find that easy edgar retorted  now in my opinion miss grant is intellectual which is more than anybody ever accused you of being but i suspect you would make more progress with her than i could do  extremes have a way of meeting and perhaps it isnt really curious that your direct and simple views should now and then recommend you to a more complex person  i notice a couple of beasts straying yonder george said dryly  edgar rode off to drive the animals up to the herd  george he thought was painfully practical only such a man could break off the discussion of a girl like miss grant to interest himself in the movements of a wandering steer  for all that the beasts must be turned and they gave edgar a hard gallop through willow scrub and tall grass before he could head them off and afterward overtake the drove     chapter ix  george turns reformer  george was working in the summer fallow a few days after his return from grants homestead when a man rode across the plowing and pulled up his horse beside him  he was on the whole a handsome fellow well mounted and smartly dressed but there was a hint of hardness in his expression  george recognized him as the landlord of a hotel at the settlement  your crops not looking too good the stranger greeted him  no returned george  it was badly put in and weve had unusually dry weather  i forgot the other rejoined  youre the fellow jake gillet had the trouble with  beat him down on the price didnt you  hes a bad man to bluff  the point that concerned me was that he asked a good deal more than his work was worth  the man looked at george curiously  thats quite possible but you might have let him down more gently than you did  as a newcomer you dont want to kick too much or run up against things other folks put up with  george wondered where the hint he had been given led  i rode over to bring this paper for you to sign the man went on  glancing through it george saw that it was a petition against any curtailment of the licenses at sage butte and a testimonial to the excellent manner in which the sachem hotel was conducted by its owner oliver beamish  george had only once entered the place but it had struck him as being badly kept and frequented by rather undesirable customers  some fool temperance folks are starting a campaignwant to shut the hotels his visitor explained  youll put your name to this  im afraid youll have to excuse me mr beamish  i cant form an opinion i havent heard the other side yet  do you want to hear them  do you like that kind of talk  george smiled though he was not favorably impressed by the man  his tone was too dictatorial george expected civility when asked a favor  after all he said it would only be fair  then you wont sign  no  beamish sat silent a moment or two regarding george steadily  one name more or less doesnt matter much but ill own that the opinion of you farmers who use my hotel as a stoppingplace counts with the authorities he told him  ive got quite a few signatures  you want to remember that it wont pay you to go against the general wish  there was a threat in his manner and georges face hardened  that consideration hasnt much weight with me he said  well returned beamish i guess youre wrong but as theres nothing doing here ill get on  he rode away and george thought no more of the matter for several days  then as he was riding home with edgar from a visit to a neighbor who had a team to sell they stopped to rest a few minutes in the shade of a poplar bluff  it was fiercely hot on the prairie but the wood was dim and cool and george followed edgar through it in search of saskatoons  the red berries were plentiful and they had gone farther than they intended when george stopped waistdeep in the grass of a dry sloo where shallow water had lain in the spring  he nearly fell over something large and hard  stooping down he saw with some surprise that it was a wooden case  i wonder whats in it he said  bottles reported edgar pulling up a board of the lid  one of the cureeverything tonics according to the labels  it strikes me as a curious place to leave it in  george carefully looked about  he could distinguish a faint track where the grasses had been disturbed running straight across the sloo past the spot he occupied but he thought that the person who had made the track had endeavored to leave as little mark as possible  then he glanced out between the poplar trunks across the sunlit prairie  there was not a house on it scarcely a clump of timber broke its even surface  the bluff was very lonely and george remembered that a trail which ran near by led to an indian reservation some distance to the north  while he considered edgar broke in  as neither of us requires a pickmeup it might be better to leave the thing where it is  that replied george is my own idea  edgar looked thoughtful  the case didnt come here by accident and one wouldnt imagine that tonics are in great demand in this locality  i have however heard the liquor laws denounced and as a rule its wise to leave matters that dont concern you severely alone  just so said george  well get on again if you have had enough berries  on reaching the homestead they found a note from miss grant inviting them to come over in the evening and both were glad to comply with it when they arrived the girl led them into a room where a lady of middleage and a young man in clerical attire were sitting with her father  mrs nelson has come over from sage butte on a mission she said when she presented them  mr hardie who is the methodist minister there is anxious to meet you  the lady was short and slight in figure but was marked by a most resolute expression  the mission is mr hardies she said  im merely his assistant  i suppose youre a temperance reformer mr lansing  no george answered meekly i cant say i am  then youll have to become one  how long is it since you indulged in drink  george felt a little embarrassed but edgar seeing floras smile and the twinkle in her fathers eyes hastily came to his rescue  nearly a month to my knowledge  that is if you dont object to strong green tea consumed in large quantities  one should practise moderation in everything  everything  it has struck me said edgar thoughtfully that moderation is now and then desirable in temperance reform  mrs nelson fixed her eyes on him with a severe expression  are you a scoffer  no said edgar as a matter of fact im open to conviction especially if you intend to reform the butte  in my opinion it needs it  well responded the lady youre a signature anyway and we want as many as we can get  but well proceed to business  will you state our views mr hardie  the man began quietly and george was favorably impressed by him  he had a pleasant sunburned face and a wellknit but rather thin figure which suggested that he was accustomed to physical exertion as he could not afford a horse he made long rounds on foot to visit his scattered congregation under scorching sun and in the stinging frost  there are four churches in sage butte but i sometimes fear that most of the good they do is undone in the pool room and the saloons he said  of the latter one cannot perhaps strongly object to the queens  one should always object to a saloon mrs nelson corrected him  hardie smiled goodhumoredly  after all the others the more pressing evil  theres no doubt about the unfortunate influence of the sachem  thats so grant agreed  when i first came out from ontario there wasnt a loafer in the town  when the boys were through with their days job they had a quiet talk and smoke and went to bed they came here to work  now the sachem bars full of slouchers every night and quite a few of them dont do anything worth speaking of in the daytime except make trouble for decent folks  if the boys try to put the screw on a farmer at harvest or when he has extra wheat to haul youll find they hatched the mischief at beamishs saloon  but ive no use for giving those fellows tracts with warning pictures  that said mrs nelson is by no means what we intend to do  im afraid that admonition hasnt had much effect and i agree with mr grant that the sachem is a gathering place for doubtful characters hardie went on  whats worse ive reasons for supposing that beamish gets some of them to help him in supplying the indians on the reservation with liquor  this was a serious offense and there was a pause during which edgar glanced meaningly at george  then he made a pertinent remark  four churches to two saloons is pretty long odds  why do you think it needful to call in the farmers  hardie looked troubled but he showed that he was honest  the churches are thinly attended im the only resident clergyman and im sorry i must confess that some of our people are indifferent reluctant or perhaps half afraid to interfere  they want a clear lead if we could get a big determined meeting it might decide the waverers  then youre not sure of winning asked grant  no replied hardie  therell be strong and wellmanaged opposition in fact we have nearly everything against us  ive been urged to wait but the evils increasing those against us are growing stronger  if you lose you and your friends will find the butte pretty hot  but you feel you have a chance a fighting chance and you mean to take it  yes  then im with you grant declared with a grim smile  dont mistake me i take my glass of lager when i feel like ittheres some right here in the housebut if its needful i can do without  im not going into this thing to help you in preaching to whiskytanks and toughsits the law im standing for  if what you suspect is going on well soon have our colts rebranded and our calves missing  we have got to clean out beamishs crowd  thanks said hardie with keen satisfaction  he turned to george  id be glad of your support mr lansing  george sat silent a moment or two while flora watched him  then he said quietly  my positions much the same as mr grantsi can do without  after what you have said about the sachem ill join you  and you hardie asked edgar  the lad laughed  i follow my leader  the loungers about the sachem werent civil to me said unpleasant things about my appearance and my english clothes to help to make them abstainers strikes me as a happy thought  flora glanced at him in amused reproof and hardie turned to grant  what about your hired men  count them in they go with me  if you have brought any memorial along ill see they sign it  i wish all our supporters had your determination mrs nelson remarked approvingly  hardie ventured a protest  i dont want any pressure put upon them mr grant  pressure queried the farmer  ill just ask them to sign  i wonder if youre quite satisfied with the purity of all your allies motives mr hardie edgar inquired  a smile crept into the clergymans face  i dont think a leaders often in that position mr west and considering what im up against i cant refuse any support thats offered me  its one reason why ive taken yours  now that ive joined you id better mention a little discovery west and i made this afternoon said george  hardies expression grew eager as he listened  its certainly liquorfor the reservation indians he broke out if we can fix the thing on beamishi havent a doubt that hes responsiblewe can close the sachem  then we had better decide how its to be done grant said curtly  he ruled out several suggestions and finally said  i expect the case will be sent for tonight and we want two witnesses wholl lie by in the sloo  one of them ought to be a farmer but well see about that  guess your part is to find out how the liquor left the butte mr hardie  what do you think of the plan maam  i leave it to you said mrs nelson half reluctantly  but be warnedif the men cant close the sachem the women of sage butte will undertake the thing  then we have only to decide who is to watch the bluff said hardie  as i first mentioned the matter ill go for one george volunteered  youre the right man declared grant  as a newcomer whos never been mixed up with local affairs your word would carry more weight with the court  the opposition couldnt make you out a partizan  but you want to recognize what youre doingafter this youll find yourself up against all the sachem toughs  its quite likely theyll make trouble for you  i wonder whether such reasons count for much with mr lansing flora said suggestively  george made no reply but edgar laughed  they dont miss grant you can set your mind at rest on that  you dont seem curious whether they count with me  youre not going grant told him  we must have two men who can be relied on and i can put my hand on another whos younger and a little more wiry than i am  he turned to george  what you have to do is to lie close in the sloo grass until the fellows come for the liquor when youll follow them to the reservation without their seeing you  then youll ride up and make sure you would know them again  they should get there soon after daylight as they wont strike the bluff until its dark but theres thick brush in the ravine the trail follows for the last few miles  it wont matter if they light out because flett will pick up their trail  ill send for him right off but he could hardly get through before morning  the party broke up shortly afterward and george rode home wondering why he had allowed himself to become involved in what might prove to be a troublesome matter  his ideas on the subject were not very clear but he felt that flora grant had expected him to take a part  then he had been impressed in hardies favor the man was in earnest ready to court popular hostility but he was nevertheless genial and free from dogmatic narrowmindedness  behind all this there was in george a detestation of vicious idleness and indulgence and a respect for right and order  since he had been warned that the badlykept hotel sheltered a gang of loafers plotting mischief and willing to prey upon men who toiled strenuously he was ready for an attempt to turn them out  he agreed with grant the gang must be put down     chapter x  the liquorrunners  dusk was closing in when george and the hired man whom grant had sent with him reached the bluff and tethered their horses where they would be hidden among the trees  this done george stood still for a few moments looking about  a dark cloudbarred sky hung over the prairie which was fast fading into dimness the wood looked desolate and forbidding in the dying light  he did not think any one could have seen him and his companion enter it  then he and the man floundered through the undergrowth until they reached the sloo where they hid themselves among the grass at some distance from the case which had not been removed  there was no moon and a fresh breeze swept through the wood waking eerie sounds and sharp rustlings among the trees  once or twice george started imagining that somebody was creeping through the bushes behind him but he was glad of the confused sounds because they would cover his movements when the time for action came  his companion a teamster born on the prairie lay beside him amid the tall harsh grass that swayed to and fro with a curious dry clashing  he broke into a soft laugh when george suddenly raised his head  only a cottontail hustling through the brush  whoevers coming will strike the bluff on the other side he said  nights kind of wild pity it wont rain  crops on light soil are getting badly cut  george glanced up at the patch of sky above the dark mass of trees black and threatening clouds drove across it but during the past few weeks he had watched them roll up from the west a little after noon almost every day  for a while they shadowed the prairie promising the deluge he eagerly longed for and then toward evening they cleared away and pitiless sunshine once more scorched the plain grain grown upon the stiff black loam withstood the drought but the light soil of the marston farm was lifted by the wind and the sharp sand in it abraded the tender stalks  it might cut them through if the dry weather and strong breeze continued and then the crop which was to cover his first expenses would yield him nothing  yes he returned moodily  it looks as if it couldnt rain  we ought to go in more for stockraising its safer  costs quite a pile to start with and the ranchers farther west certainly have their troubles  we had a good many calves missing and now and then prime steers driven off when i was rangeriding  i havent heard of any cattlestealing about here  no said the teamster  still i guess we may come to it there are more toughs about the settlement than there used to be  indians have been pretty good but ive known them make lots of trouble in other districts by killing beasts for meat and picking up stray horses  but that was where they had mean whites willing to trade with them  george considered this  it had struck him that the morality of the country had not improved since he had last visited it though this was not surprising in view of the swarm of immigrants that were pouring in grant had pithily said that once upon a time the boys had come there to work but it now looked as if a certain proportion had arrived on the prairie because nobody could tolerate them at home  flett and the methodist preacher seemed convinced that there were a number of these undesirables hanging about sage butte ready for mischief  well he said i suppose the first thing to be done is to stop this liquorrunning  they had no further conversation for another hour  the poplars rustled behind them and the grass rippled and clashed but now and then the breeze died away for a few moments and there was a curious and almost disconcerting stillness  at last in one of these intervals the canadian partly rising lifted his hand  listen he said  guess i hear a team  a low rhythmic drumming that suggested the beat of hoofs rose from the waste but it was lost as the branches rattled and the long grass swayed noisily before a rush of breeze  george thought the sound had come from somewhere half a mile away  if theyre indians would they bring a wagon he asked  its quite likely  some of the bucks keep smart teams they do a little rough farming on the reservation  it would look as if they were going for sloo hay if anybody saw them  george waited in silence wishing he could hear the thud of hoofs again  it was slightly daunting to lie still and wonder where the men were  it is never very dark in summer on the western prairie and george could see across the sloo but there was no movement that the wind would not account for among the black trees that shut it in several minutes passed and george looked around again with strained attention  suddenly a dim figure emerged from the gloom  another followed it but they made no sound that could be heard through the rustle of the leaves and george felt his heart beat and his nerves tingle as he watched them flit half seen through the grass  then one of the shadowy objects stooped lifting something and they went back as noiselessly as they had come  in a few more moments they had vanished and the branches about them clashed in a rush of wind  it died away and there was no sound or sign of human presence in all the silent wood  george glad that the strain was over was about to rise but his companion laid a hand on his arm  give em time to get clear  we dont want to come up until theres light enough to swear to them or they make the reservation  they waited several minutes and then traversing the wood found their horses and mounted  the grass stretched away blurred and shadowy and though they could see nothing that moved upon it a beat of hoofs came softly back to them  winds bringing the sound said the teamster  guess they wont hear us  they rode out into the gray obscurity losing the sound now and then they had gone several leagues when they came to the edge of a dark bluff  drawing bridle they sat and listened until the teamster broke the silence  theres a trail runs through well try it  the trail was difficult to find and bad to follow for long grass and willowscrub partly covered it and in spite of their caution the men made a good deal of noise  that however seemed of less importance for they could hear nothing ahead and george looked about carefully as they crossed a more open space  the trees were getting blacker and more distinct he could see their tops clearly against the sky and guessed that dawn was near  how far it was to the reservation he did not know but there would be light enough in another hour to see the men who had carried off the liquor  then he began to wonder where the latter were for there was now no sign of them  suddenly when the wind dropped for a moment a faint rattle of wheels reached them from the depths of the wood and the teamster raised his hand  pretty close he said  come on as cautious as you can  the reservations not far away and we dont want them to get there much before us  they rode a little more slowly but when the rattle of wheels and thud of hoofs grew sharply distinct in another lull the man struck his horse  theyve heard us he cried  weve got to run them down  george urged his beast and there was a crackle of brush about him as the black trees streamed past  the thrill of the pursuit possessed him after weeks of patient labor he felt the exhilaration of the wild night ride  the trail he knew was riddled here and there with gopher holes and partly grown with brush that might bring his horse down but this did not count  he was glad however that the teamster was behind him because he could see the dim gap ahead between the mass of trees and he thought that it was rapidly becoming less shadowy  the sound of hoofs and wheels was growing louder they were coming up with the fugitives  keep them on the run gasped the man behind  if one of us gets thrown the other fellow will hold right on  a few minutes later georges horse plunged with a crash through a break  were off the trail his companion cried  guess it switches round a sloo  they floundered through crackling brushwood until they struck the track and afterward rode furiously to make up the lost time with the sound of wheels leading them on  then in the gap before them they saw what seemed to be the back of a wagon which to georges surprise suddenly disappeared  the next moment a figure carrying something crossed the trail  to the right cried the teamster  george did not think his companion had seen the man  he rode after him into the brush and saw the fellow hurrying through it with a load in his arms  the man looked around  george could dimly make out his dark face and his figure was almost clear  he was an indian and unusually tall  then he plunged into a screen of bushes and george riding savagely drove his horse at the obstacle  he heard the twigs snap beneath him a drooping branch struck him hard and then he gasped with horror  in front there opened up a deep black rift in which appeared the tops of trees  seeing it was too late to pull up he shook his feet clear of the stirrups  he felt the horse plunge down there was a shock and he was flung violently from the saddle  he struck a precipitous slope and rolled down it clutching at twigs which broke and grass until he felt a violent blow on his head  after that he knew nothing  it was broad daylight when consciousness returned and he found himself lying halfway down a steep declivity  at the foot of it tall reeds and sedges indicated the presence of water and he realized that he had fallen into a ravine  there was a small tree near by against which he supposed he had struck his head but somewhat to his astonishment he could not see his horse  it had apparently escaped better than he had for he felt dizzy and shaky and averse to making an effort to get up though he did not think he had broken any bones  after a while he fumbled for his pipe and found some difficulty in lighting it but he persevered and lay quiet while he smoked it out the sunlight was creeping down the gully it was getting pleasantly warm and george felt dull and lethargic  some time had passed when he heard the teamsters shout and saw the man scrambling down the side of the ravine  badly hurt he asked on reaching george  no said george i dont think its serious i feel half asleep and stupid  suppose thats because i hit my head  the other looked at him searchingly  his eyes were heavy and his face had lost its usual color  you want to get back to your homestead and lie quiet a while  i didnt miss you until id got out of the bluff and then the wagon was close ahead  how was it you avoided falling in after me  thats easy understood in the daylight  the trail twists sharply and runs along the edge of the ravine  i stuck to it instead of turning you went straight on  yes said george and mentioned having seen the indian who left the wagon  then he asked but what about the fellow you followed  his companion hesitated  guess ive been badly fooled  i came up with him outside the bluff when it was getting light and he stopped his team  said he was quietly driving home when he heard somebody riding after him and as hed once been roughly handled by mean whites he tried to get away then as i didnt know what to do i allowed id keep him in sight until constable flett turned up and by and by we came to a deserted shack theres a well in the bluff behind it and the buck said his team wanted a drink they certainly looked a bit played out and my mare was thirsty  he found an old bucket and asked me to fill it  you didnt leave him with the horses  no sir but what i did was most as foolish  i let him go and he didnt come back  see how i was fixed  if id gone into the bluff to look for him he might have slipped out and driven off so i stood by the beasts quite a while  it strikes me that team wasnt his  at last flett rode up with another trooper  it seems steve met them on the trail  george nodded  flett had arrived before he was expected because grants messenger had been saved a long ride to his station  well he said  when we couldnt find the buck flett sent his partner off to pick up his trail and then said wed better take the team along and look for you  i left where the trail forks he was to wait a bit  now do you think you can get up  george did so and managed with some assistance to climb the slope where his companion left him and went off for the constable  flett arrived presently and made george tell his story  the things quite plain he said  the fellow you saw jumped off with the liquor though one wouldnt expect him to carry it far  you say he was tall did he walk a little lame  it was too dark to tell  im inclined to think i would know him again  well explained flett this is the kind of thing little ax is likely to have a hand in and hes the tallest buck in the crowd  ill stick to the team until we come across somebody who knows its owner  the first thing we have to do is to find that case of liquor  half an hour later the teamster came back carrying it and set it down before the constable with a grin  guess its your duty to see whats in these bottles he remarked shall i get one out  you neednt ive a pretty good idea answered flett adding meaningly besides its the kind of stuff a white man cant drink then he turned to george  id better take you home  you look kind of shaky  what about my horse george asked  guess hes made for home said the teamster  i struck his trail and it led right out of the woods  george got into the wagon with some trouble and the teamster rode beside it when they set off  you havent much to put before a court he said to flett  no the constable replied thoughtfully  im not sure our people will take this matter up anyway it looks as if we could only fix it on the indians  this is what comes of you folks fooling things instead of leaving them to us  the police certainly like a conviction rejoined the teamster grinning  they feel real bad when the court lets a fellow off seem to think thats their business  guess its why a few of their prisoners escape  flett ignored this and the teamster turned to george  ill tell you what once happened to me  i was working for a blamed hard boss and it doesnt matter why i quit without getting my wages out of him but he wasnt feeling good when i lit out behind a freightcar  by bad luck there was a trooper handy when a trainhand found me at a lonely sidetrack  well that policeman didnt know what to do with me  it was quite a way to the nearest guardroom they dont get medals for corraling a man whos only stolen a ride and he had to watch out for some cattle rustlers so wherever he went i had to go along with him  we got quite friendly and one night he said to me theres a freight that stops here nearly due  ill go to sleep while you get out on her  the teamster paused and added with a laugh  thats what i did and id be mighty glad to set the drinks up if i ever meet that man off duty  wed both have a fullsize jag on before we quit  and youre one of the fellows whore running hardies temperance campaign flett said dryly     chapter xi  diplomacy  flett left the team at georges homestead  bidding him take good care of it and borrowing a fresh team he drove away with the wagon  when he reached sage butte it was getting dusk  he hitched the horses outside of the better of the two hotels and entered in search of food as he had still a long ride before him  supper had long been finished and flett was kept waiting for some time but he now and then glanced at the wagon  it was dark when he drove away after seeing that the case lay where he had left it and he had reached his post before he made a startling discovery  when he carried the case into the lamplight it looked smaller and on hastily opening it he found it was filled with soil  he sat down and thought though on the surface the matter was clearhe had been cleverly outwitted by somebody who had exchanged the case while he got his meal  this as he reflected was not the kind of thing for which a constable got promoted but there were other points that required attention  the substitution had not been effected by anybody connected with the queens it was he suspected the work of some of the frequenters of the sachem and he and his superiors had to contend with a wellorganized gang  news of what had happened in the bluff had obviously been transmitted to the settlement while he had rested at lansings homestead  he had however made a long journey and as he would have to ride on and report the matter to his sergeant in the morning he went to sleep  the next day george was setting out on a visit to grant when a man rode up and asked for the team  flett cant get over but he wants the horses at the post so as to have them handy if he finds anybody who can recognize them he explained  that sounded plausible but george hesitated  the animals would be of service as a clue to their owner and a proof of his complicity in the affair  as they had not been identified it would embarrass the police if they were missing  i can only hand them over to a constable unless you have brought a note from flett he replied  then as i havent one youll beat me out of a days pay and make flett mighty mad  do you think hed get anybody who might know the team to waste a day riding out to your place  guess the folks round here are too busy and theyd be glad of the excuse that it was so far they wont want to mix themselves up in this thing  george could find no fault with this reasoning but he thought the fellow was a little too eager to secure the horses  well he said as im going to call on mr grant ill see what he has to say  if im not back in time mr west will give you supper  then grants standing in with you and the temperance folks  it struck george that he had been incautious but he could not determine whether the man had blundered or not  his question suggested some knowledge of the situation but an accomplice of the offenders would no doubt have heard of the part grants hired man had played  i dont see how that concerns you he replied  youll have to wait until i return if you want the team  he rode on but he had not gone far when he met beamish of the sachem  i was coming over to see you the man told him  you bought that young hereford bull of broughtons didnt you  george was surprised at the question but he answered that he had done so  then would you sell him  i hadnt thought of it  guess that means ill have to tempt you beamish said  i want the beast  he named a price that struck george as being in excess of the animals value and then explained  ive seen him once or twice before he fell into broughtons hands the imported red rover strain is marked in him and a friend of mine whos going in for herefords told me not to stick at a few dollars if i could pick up such a bull  this was plausible but not altogether satisfactory and george reflecting that a buyer does not really praise what he means to purchase imagined that there was something behind it  im not likely to get a better bid he admitted  but i must ask if the transaction would be complete  would you expect anything further from me in return  beamish regarded him keenly with a faint smile  well he said i certainly want the bull but you seem to understand  leave it at that im offering to treat you pretty liberally  so as to prevent my assisting flett in any way or taking a part in hardies campaign  i wouldnt consider it the square thing for you to do beamish returned quietly  george thought of the man who was waiting at the homestead for the team  it was obvious that an attempt was being made to buy him and he strongly resented it  then i can only tell you that i wont make this deal  thats the end of the matter  beamish nodded and started his horse but he looked back as he rode off  well he called in a meaning tone you may be sorry  george rode on to grants homestead and finding him at work in the fallow told him what had passed  i fail to see why theyre so eager to get hold of me he concluded  grant sitting in the saddle of the big plow thoughtfully filled his pipe  of course he said it wasnt a coincidence that beamish came over soon after the fellow turned up for the horses  it would have been worth while buying the bull if you had let them goespecially as i believe its right about a friend of his wanting oneand nobody could have blamed you for selling  the fact is your position counts  the bluff would make a handy place for a depot and while theres nobody else near you command the trails to it and the reservation  nobody could get by from the settlement without being seen unless they made a big round if you watched out  im beginning to understand  what you say implies that theyre doing a good trade  thats so grant assented  i wouldnt have believed it was so big before hardie put me on the track and i began to look around  but you want to remember that what youre doing may cost you something  im your nearest neighbor youre running stock that are often out of sight and youre up against a determined crowd  its true george admitted  still i cant back out  grant cast a keen approving glance at him  george sat quietly in his saddle with a smile on his brown face his pose was easy but virile there was a stamp of refinement and old country breeding upon him  his eyes were suggestively steady his skin was clear he looked forceful in an unemphatic manner  the farmer was to some extent prejudiced against the type but he could make exceptions  he had liked lansing from the beginning and he knew that he could work  no he said i guess youre not that kind of man  but wont you get down and go along to the house  flora will be glad to talk with you and ill be in for supper soon  george thanked him and did as he suggested  he was beginning to find pleasure in the conversation of flora grant  it was two hours later when he took his leave and the farmer went out with him  i dont know what hardies doing but ive an idea that mrs nelson means to make some move at the farmers club fair he said  shes a mighty determined and enterprising woman  if you can spare the time youd better ride in and see whats going on  on reaching home george was not surprised to find that the man who had come for the horses had departed without waiting for his answer  the next day he received an intimation that the annual exhibition of the sage butte farmers club would shortly be held and one morning a fortnight later he and edgar rode off to the settlement  they found the little town rudely decorated with flags and arches of poplar boughs and a goodhumored crowd assembled  the onesided street that faced the track was lined with buggies wagons and a few automobiles horses and two or three yoke of oxen were tethered outside the overfull livery stables  a strong breeze drove blinding dustclouds through the place but even in the wind the sunshine was scorching  as he strolled toward the fairground george became interested in the crowd  it was largely composed of small farmers and almost without exception they and their wives were smartly attired they looked contented and prosperous  mingling with them were teamsters many as neatly dressed as their masters though some wore bluejean and saffroncolored shirts and there were railroadhands mechanics and storekeepers  all of them were cheerful a few good years free from harvest frost and blight had made a marked improvement in everybodys lot  yet there was another side to the picture  odd groups of loungers indulged in scurrilous jests hoarse laughter and an occasional angry uproar issued from the hotels and shabby men with hard faces slouched about the veranda of one  george noticed this but he presently reached the fairground where he inspected the animals and implements and then toward suppertime he strolled back with grant  they were walking up one of the sidestreets when shouts broke out behind them  george looked around but for a moment he could see very little through the cloud of dust that swept the street  when it blew away it revealed a row of women advancing two by two along the plank sidewalk  they were of different ages and stations in life but they all came on as if with a fixed purpose and they had resolute faces  mrs nelson led them carrying a riding quirt and though george was not astonished to see her he started when he noticed flora grant near the end of the procession  she was paler than usual and she walked quietly with a rather strained expression  grant touched georges shoulder  this is certainly more than i figured on he said but i guess theres no use in my objecting  now shes started shell go through with it  theyre making for the sachem we had better go along  shortly afterward a gathering crowd blocked the street  speech somebody cried and there was ironical applause  mrs nelson raised her hand and when the procession stopped she looked sternly at the men before her  no she answered speeches are wasted on such folks were here to act  she waved the quirt commandingly  let us pass  she was obeyed  the women moved on and george and grant managed to enter the hotel behind them before the throng closed in  the big generalroom was hot and its atmosphere almost intolerably foul the bar which opened off it was shadowy and the crowded figures of lounging men showed dimly through thick cigar smoke  the hum of their voices died away and there was a curious silence as the women came in edging forward george saw beamish leaning on his counter looking quietly selfpossessed and very dapper in his white shirt and wellcut clothes  well he said what do you ladies want with me  their leader faced him a small and yet commanding figure with an imperious expression and sparkling eyes  you got a notice that from suppertime this bar must be shut  i did maam  it was signed by you  now so far as i know the magistrates are the only people who can close my hotel  thats so shouted somebody and there were confused murmurs and harsh laughter which suggested that some of the loungers were not quite sober  fire them out cried another man  guess this is why nelson gets cold potatoes for his supper  ought to be at home mending socks or washing their mens clothes  the lady turned sternly on the last speaker  yes she said thats the kind of idea you would hold  its getting played out now  george was conscious of slight amusement  the affair had its humorous side and though he was ready to interfere if the women were roughly handled he did not think they ran any serious risk  beamish looked capable of dealing with the situation  you dont require to butt in boys he said  leave me to talk to these ladies i guess their intentions are good  he bowed to mrs nelson  you can go on maam  ive only this to sayyou must close your bar right now  suppose im not willing  it will mean a big loss to me  that answered mrs nelson firmly doesnt count the bigger the loss the better  you will stop the sale of drink until tomorrow or take the consequences  another woman who looked careworn and haggard and was shabbily dressed stood forward  we and the children have borne enough she broke out  we have to save the cordwood in the bitter cold we have to send the kiddies out in old thin clothes while the money that would make home worth living in goes into your register  where are the boysour husbands and sonswho once held steady jobs and did good work  she raised an accusing hand with despair in her pinched face  oh  i neednt tell youtheyre rebranding farmers calves or hiding from the police dont you know of one who walked to his death through the big trestle dazed with liquor  for these things the men who tempted them will have to answer  true but not quite to the point mrs nelson interposed  we have found remonstrance useless the time for words has passed  this fellow has had his warning were waiting for him to comply with it  there was an uproar outside from the crowd that was struggling to get in and demanding to be told what was going on but beamish made a sign of resignation  it looks as if i couldnt refuse you and anyway it wouldnt be polite  he turned to his customers  boys its not my fault but youll get no more drinks today  for all that i must make a point of asking you to treat these ladies with respect  smart grant remarked to george  he has handled the thing right this means trouble for hardie  then beamish once more addressed the intruders  now that ive given in has it struck you that there isnt much use in closing my place if you leave the queens open  well shut them both mrs nelson declared  then theres just another pointive folks who have driven a long way staying the night with me and theres quite a crowd coming in for supper  how am i to treat them  they can have all they want to eat mrs nelson told him graciously but no liquor  i cant refuse to supply them without a reason  what am i to say  tell them that the womens reform league has compelled you to close your bar  and ive been given the orders by their acknowledged secretary  yes  im proud of being their leader and of the duty ive discharged  beamish turned to his customers  youll remember what she has told me boys  grant drew george away  she walked right into the trap you couldnt have stopped her  im sorry for hardie  but we may as well get out now therell be no trouble  the street was blocked when the women left but a passage was made for them and followed by everybody in the settlement they proceeded to the other hotel whose proprietor capitulated  then mrs nelson made a speech in which she pointed out that for once the festival would not be marked by the orgies which had on previous occasions disgraced the town  her words by no means conciliatory and her aggressive air provoked the crowd which had for the most part watched the proceedings with amusement  there were cries of indignant dissent angry shouts and the throng began to close in upon the speaker  then there was sudden silence and the concourse split apart  into the gap rode a slim young man in khaki with a wide hat of the same color who pulled up and sat looking at the people with his hand on his hip george recognized him as the constable who shared the extensive beat with flett  now he said goodhumoredly whats all this fuss about  several of them informed him and he listened gravely before he called one of the farmers stewards and spoke a few words to him  it strikes me he said that you had all better go back to the fairground while i look into things  theres an item or two on the program mr carson wants to work off before supper  he had taken the right tone and when they began to disperse he rode on to the sachem  i want your account of this disturbance he said to the proprietor  beamish related what had taken place and the constable looked surprised  am i to understand that youre afraid to open your bar because of the women he asked  yes sir replied beamish coolly thats about the size of it youd have been scared too theyre a mighty determined crowd  nobody except the authorities has any right to interfere  thats my opinion but what am i to do about it  suppose these women come back will you stand at the door and keep them out  theyre capable of mobbing you  the constable looked dubious and beamish continued  besides ive given them my word id shut upthey made me  then how do you expect us to help  so far as i can see you can only report the matter to your bosses  the constable felt inclined to agree with this  he asked for the names of the ladies and beamish hesitated  i was too taken up with mrs nelson to notice the rest and the place was rather dark  anyway about half of them were foolish girls with notions i dont want to drag them in  you blame somebody for setting them on  i do said beamish without a trace of rancor  theres mrs nelsoneverybody knows shes a crankand hardie the methodist minister  theyve been trying to make trouble for the hotels for quite a while  the constable made a note of this and presently called on hardie who had just returned to town after visiting a sick farmer  the former listened to what the minister had to say but was not much impressed beamish had cleverly made him his partizan  after supper george and grant called on hardie and found him looking distressed  im much afraid that the result of three or four months earnest work has been destroyed this afternoon he said  our allies have stirred up popular prejudice against us  well meet with opposition whichever way we turn  theres something in that grant agreed  mrs nelsons a lady who would wreck any cause  still she has closed the hotels  for one night  as a result of this afternoons work they will probably be kept open altogether  you can imagine how the authorities will receive any representations we can make after our being implicated in this disturbance  have you thought of disowning the ladies  you could do soyou had no hand in the thing  the young clergyman flushed hotly  id have stopped this rashness if id heard of it but after all im the real instigator since i started the campaign  im willing to face my share of the blame  you mean youll let beamish make you responsible  of course said hardie  i cant deny im leader  the move was a mistake considered prudentially but it was morally justifiable  ill defend it as strongly as im able  grant nodded and flora and mrs nelson came in  are you satisfied with what youve done grant said to the girl you might have given me a hint of it  flora smiled  im afraid beamish was too clever for us  from an outsiders point of view he behaved exceptionally well and in doing so he put us in the wrong  i didnt know what had been planned when i left home but as one of the league i couldnt draw back when i heard of it  you think he was too clever mrs nelson broke in  how absurd to say that  we have won a brilliant victory  grant made a little gesture  if youre convinced of that maam well leave you to talk it over  he led george toward the door  i like that man hardie he resumed when they reached the street beamish has him beaten for the present but im thankful therell be no women about when we come to grips with his crowd  it may take a while but those fellows have got to be downed     chapter xii  george faces disaster  a fortnight had passed since the affair at the settlement when hardie arrived at the marston homestead toward suppertime  after the meal was over he accompanied his host and edgar to the little room used for an office  as ive been busy since four this morning i dont mean to do anything more said george i suppose you dont smoke  no hardie answered  its a concession i can make without much effort to our stricter brethren  im inclined to believe they consider smoking almost as bad as drink  you agree with them about the latter  we try to be consistent edgar told him  you see i couldnt very well indulge in an occasional drink when ive undertaken to make those sage butte fellows abstainers  anyhow though youre by no means liberal in your view youre practical people  as soon as i landed at montreal a pleasant young man wearing a silver monogram came up to me and offered me introductions to people who might find me a job though i didnt want one i was grateful and when i told him i wasnt one of his flock he said it didnt matter  that kind of thing makes a good impression  how are you getting on at the settlement  george interposed  hardie sat silent for a few moments and george saw that his eyes were anxious and his face looked worn  badly he said  i feel i can talk to you freely and thats really why i came though i had another call to make  youre having trouble  plenty of it  ive had another visit from the police though thats not a very important matter and mrs nelsons action has raised a storm of indignation  it would be useless to move any further against the sachem  even this is not the worst  our people are split up by disagreements ive been taken to task my staunchest supporters are falling away  theyll rally said george  leave those who havent the courage to do so alone youre better rid of them  i suppose its apt to make a difference in your finances  the clergyman colored  thats true though its hard to own  it subjects one to a strong temptation  after all were expected to keep our churches fullits necessary  the road to success edgar remarked is comparatively easy  always proclaim the popular view but be a little more emphatic and go a little farther than the rest  then theyll think you a genius and make haste to follow your lead  hardie looked at him quietly  theres another way mr west and the gate of it is narrow  i think it seldom leads to worldly fame  he paused and sighed  it needs courage to enter and one often shrinks  well said edgar ill confess that i find the popular idea whatever it may happen to be irritating i like to annoy the people who hold it by pointing out their foolishness which is partly why im now farming in western canada  george of course is more altruistic though i dont think he ever analyzes his feelings  as soon as he sees anybody in trouble and getting beaten he begins to strip  ive a suspicion that he enjoys a fight  if you would stop talking rot wed get on better george said curtly and then turned to his visitor  i gather that youre afraid of wrecking your church  its an awkward situation but i suppose you have made up your mind  yes i must go on if i go alone  the man as the others recognized had no intention of being dramatic but his quiet announcement had its effect and there was silence for a moment or two  then edgar who was impatient of any display of strong feeling made an abrupt movement  after all he said cheerfully youll have mrs nelson beside you and im inclined to think she would enliven any solitude  hardie smiled and the lad continued  now we had perhaps better be practical and consider how to get over the difficulties  he grew less discursive when they fell in with his suggestion  george possessed sound sense and some power of leading and for a while they were busy elaborating a plan of campaign in which his advice was largely deferred to  then there was an interruption for grierson his hired man came in  i was hauling hay from the big sloo when i saw the hereford bull he said  he was by himself and bleeding from the shoulder  thought id better bring him home though he walked very lame  ah exclaimed george sharply  ill come and look at him  the others followed and on reaching the wirefenced corral they found the animal lying down with its forequarter stained with blood  george sent for some water and he soon found the wound which was very small and round  its a curious mark hardie commented  yes said george its a bullet hole  the surprise of the others was obvious  i think its a hint george explained  well try to get him on his feet  they succeeded and when the beast had been led into a stall george turned to hardie  as you said you wouldnt stay the night would you mind starting for the settlement now  the livery stable fellow is said to be clever at veterinary work you might send him out and mail a note ill give you to the police  hardie professed his willingness to be of service and on getting into his buggy said with some hesitation  im afraid youre right in your suspicions and im particularly sorry  in a way im responsible for this  george smiled rather grimly  one cant go into a fight without getting hurt and we havent come to the end of it yet  this affair wont cost you my support  the clergymans eyes sparkled as he held out his hand  i never imagined ityou have my sympathy mr lansing  it would give me the greatest pleasure to see the cowardly brute who fired that shot brought to justice  he drove away and george went moodily back to the house with edgar  thats a man who has had to choose between his duty and his interest george said but just now we have other things to think about  its a pity i cant get the bullet out until help arrives  the livery man turned up on the following day and succeeded in extracting it and flett made his appearance the morning after  he examined the wounded animal  it may have been done by accident but if so its curious the beast should have been hit close to a place where it would have killed him he remarked  whats your private opinion george asked  the constable smiled  as we havent gone very far yet ill reserve it  he took up the bullet  winchester or marlin usual caliber nothing to be made of that  now lets go and take a look at the place where the shot was fired  they traced back the path of the wounded beast from the spot where grierson had found it by the red splashes that here and there stained the short grass of the unfenced prairie  at last they stopped where the ground was broken by a few low sandy ridges sprinkled with small birches and poplars and flett pointed to the mark of hoofs in a strip of almost bare light soil  this is where he was hit he said  you can see how he started off going as hard as he could  next weve got to find the spot the man fired from  it proved difficult  the dry grass revealed nothing and they vainly searched several of the neighboring hillocks where it grew less thickly  scorching sunshine beat down on them and a strong breeze blew the sand about  at length flett pointed to a few halfobliterated footprints on the bare summit of a small rise  the fellow stopped here with his feet well apart  hed stand like that while he put up his gun  sit down and smoke while i copy these marks  he proceeded to do so carefully having brought some paper from the homestead  have you any reason for thinking it was a standing shot he took george asked  i havent i wish i had  quite a lot depends upon his position  george nodded  so it struck me  well look round for some more conclusive signs when you have finished  before this happened  flora grant rode up  i was going back from forsters when i noticed you moving about the hills she explained  i made this round to find out what you were doing  george told her and her sympathy was obvious  im very sorry but my father warned you she said  im afraid youre finding this an expensive campaign  i can put up with it so long as i have my friends support  i think you can count on that she smiled  but what is fletts theory  if he has one hes clever at hiding it edgar broke in but im doubtful  in my opinion he knows the value of the professional air of mystery  when i see any use in it i can talk retorted flett  whats your notion mr lansing  you dont agree that the fellow shot your beast from here  no answered george  of course there are only two explanations of the thing and the first is that it was an accident  in that case the fellow must have been out after antelope or cranes  theres an objection its close season though i wouldnt count too much on that  you farmers arent particular when theres nobody around  now its possible that a man whod been creeping up on an antelope would work in behind this rise and take a quick shot standing when he reached the top of it  if so i guess hed have his eyes only on what he was firing at  suppose he missed and your beast happened to be in line with him  flora smiled  its not convincing mr flett  seen from here the bull would be in the open conspicuous against white grass and sand  i didnt say the thing was likely  wont you go on mr lansing  the other explanation is that the fellow meant to kill or mark the bull the place where it was hit points to the former  if that was his intention hed lie down or kneel to get a steadier aim  we had better look for the spot  they spent some time before flett thought he had found it  somebody lay down here and the bull would be up against a background of poplar scrub he said  ill measure off the distance and make a plan  he counted his paces and had set to work with his notebook when flora interrupted  wouldnt a sketch be better  give me a sheet of paper and has anybody another pencil  george gave her one and after walking up and down and standing for a few moments on a low mound she chose a position and began the sketch it was soon finished but it depicted the scene with distinctness with the bull standing in the open a little to one side of the clump of scrub  george started as he saw that she had roughly indicated the figure of a man lying upon the little mound with a rifle in his hand it struck him that she was right  its a picture said the constable but why did you put that fellow yonder  come and see  they followed her to the mound and after an inspection of it flett nodded  youd make a mighty smart tracker miss grant  i was against this mound being the firing place because to get to it the fellow would have to come out into the open  would that count  it was a bull he was after  it was flett agreed  this fixes the thing  george looked at him meaningly  have you made up your mind about anything else  oh yes said flett  it was done with malicious mischief  if a poor white or an indian meant to kill a beast for meat he wouldnt pick a bull worth a pile of money at least while there was common beef stock about  then what do you mean to do  flett smiled  sooner or later im going to put handcuffs on the man who did this thing  if youll give me the sketch miss grant ill take it along  flora handed it to him and he and edgar went away shortly afterward leaving george with the girl  she sat still looking down at him when he had helped her to the saddle  im afraid you have a good many difficulties to face she said  yes assented george  a dry summer is bad for wheat on my light soil and that is why i thought of going in for stock  he paused with a rueful smile  it doesnt promise to be a great improvement if im to have my best beasts shot  she pointed to the west  the grass about them was still scorched with fierce sunshine but leaden cloudmasses darkly rolled together with a curious bluish gleam in them covered part of the sky  this time it will rain she said  we will be fortunate if we get no more than that  try to remember mr lansing that bad seasons are not the rule in western canada and one good one wipes out the results of several lean years  then she rode away and george joined edgar  he felt that he had been given a warning  on reaching home he harnessed a team and drove off to a sloo to haul in hay but while he worked he cast anxious glances at the clouds  they rolled on above him in an endless procession opening out to emit a passing blaze of sunshine and closing in again the horses were restless he could hardly get them to stand the grasses stirred and rustled in a curious manner and even the little gophers that scurried away from the wagon wheels displayed an unusual and feverish activity  yet there was not a drop of rain and the man toiled on in savage impatience wondering whether he must once more resign himself to see the promised deluge pass away  it was a question of serious import  a nights heavy rain would consolidate the soil that blew about with every breeze revive the suffering wheat and strengthen its abraded stalks against any further attack by the driving sand  indeed he thought it would place the crop in security  he came home for supper jaded dusty and morose and found that he could scarcely eat when he sat down to the meal  he could not rest when it was over though he was aching from heavy toil nor could he fix his attention on any new task and when dusk was getting near he strolled up and down before the homestead with edgar  there was a change in the looks of the buildingsall that could be done had been effectedbut there was also a change in the man  he was leaner his face was getting thin and he looked worn but he maintained a forced tranquillity  the sky was barred with cloud now the great breadth of grain had faded to a leaden hue the prairie to shadowy gray  the wind had dropped the air was tense and still a strange impressive silence brooded over everything  presently edgar looked up at the clouds  they must break at last he said  one cant help thinking of what they holdendless carloads of grain wads of dollar bills for the storekeepers prosperity for three big provinces  its much the same weather right along to the rockies  i wasnt considering the three provinces said george  no retorted edgar  your attention was confined to the improvement the rain would make in sylvia marstons affairs  youre looking forward to sending her a big check after harvest  so far it has looked more like facing a big deficit  you mean your facing it  george frowned  sylvia has nothing except this land  it strikes me shes pretty fortunate in one way  you find the working capital and bear the loss if there is one  i wonder what arrangements you made about dividing a surplus  that said george is a thing ive no intention of discussing with anybody but my cotrustee  edgar smiled he had hardly expected to elicit much information upon the point having failed to do so once or twice already  well he said i believe well see the rain before an hour has passed  soon after he had spoken a flash leaped from overhead and the prairie was flooded with dazzling radiance  it was followed by a roll of thunder and a roar as the rain came down  for a few moments the dust whirled up and there was a strong smell of earth then the air was filled with falling water  george stood still in the deluge rejoicing while the great drops lashed his upturned face until edgar laughingly pushed him toward the house  as im wet through i think ill go to bed  at last you can rest content  george following his example lay down with a deep sense of thankfulness  his cares had gone the flood that roared against the board walls had banished them  now that relief had come he felt strangely weary and in a few minutes he was sound asleep  he did not hear the thunder which broke out again nor feel the house shake in the rush of icy wind that suddenly followed the ominous rattle on roof and walls different from and sharper than the lashing of the rain began and died away unnoticed by him  he was wrapped in the deep healing slumber that follows the slackening of severe mental and bodily strain he knew nothing of the banks of ragged icelumps that lay melting to lee of the building  it was very cold the next morning though the sun was rising above the edge of the scourged plain when edgar partly dressed and wearing wet boots and leggings came into the room and looked down at george compassionately  the brown face struck him as looking worn george had flung off part of the coverings and there was something that suggested limp relaxation in his attitude but edgar knew that his comrade must bear his load again  george he said touching him you had better get up  the man stirred and looking at him became at once intent as he saw his face  ah he exclaimed  something else gone wrong  edgar nodded  im sorry he answered simply  put on your things and come out you had better get it over with  in three or four minutes george left the house  holding himself steadily in hand he walked through the drenched grass toward the wheat  on reaching it he set his lips tight and stood very still the great field of grain had gone short severed stalks halfburied in a mass of rent and tornup blades covered the wide stretch of soil where the wheat had been  the crop had been utterly wiped out by the merciless hail  edgar did not venture to speak any sympathy he could express would have looked like mockery and for a while there was strained silence  then george showed of what tough fiber he was made  well he said it has to be faced  after this well try another plan more stock for one thing he paused and then resumed tell grierson to hurry breakfast  i must drive in to the butte theres a good deal to be done  edgar moved away feeling relieved  george instead of despairing was considering new measures  he was far from beaten yet     chapter xiii  sylvia seeks amusement  it was a fine september afternoon and sylvia reclined pensively in a canvas hammock on herbert lansings lawn with one or two opened letters in her hand  bright sunshine lay upon the grass but it was pleasantly cool in the shadow of the big copper beech  a neighboring border glowed with autumn flowers ribands of asters spikes of crimson gladiolus ranks of dahlias  across the lawn a virginia creeper draped the house with vivid tints  the scene had nothing of the grim bareness of the western prairie of which sylvia was languidly thinking her surroundings shone with strong color and beyond them a peaceful english landscape stretched away  she could look out upon heavilymassed trees yellow fields with sheaves in them and the winding streak of a flashing river  yet sylvia was far from satisfied  the valley was getting dull she needed distraction and her letters suggested both the means of getting it and a difficulty  she wore black but it had an artistic almost coquettish effect and the big hat became her well in spite of its simple trimming  sylvia bestowed a good deal of thought upon her appearance  after a while mrs lansing came out and joined her  is there any news in your letters she asked  yes answered sylvia theres one from georgeits a little disappointing but you can read it  as usual hes laconic  georges curtness was accounted for by the fact that he had been afraid of saying too much but sylvia carelessly handed the letter to her companion  after all he shows a nice feeling mrs lansing remarked  he seems to regret very much his inability to send you a larger check  so do i said sylvia with a petulant air  he points out that it has been a bad season and he has lost his crop  bad seasons are common in western canada ive met farmers who seemed to thrive on them  no doubt they didnt do so all at once  i dare say thats true sylvia agreed  its very likely that if i give him plenty of time george will get everything righthes one of the plodding persistent people who generally succeed in the endbut what use will there be in that  im not growing youngeri want some enjoyment now  she spread out her hands with a gesture that appealed for sympathy  one gets so tired of petty economy and selfdenial  but george and herbert arranged that you should have a sufficient allowance  sufficient said sylvia is a purely relative term  so much depends upon ones temperament doesnt it  perhaps i am a little extravagant and thats why im disappointed  after all you have very few necessary expenses  sylvia laughed  its having only the necessary ones that makes it so dull  now ive thought of going to stay a while with susan kettering theres a letter from her asking when ill come  mrs lansing was a lady of strict conventional views and she showed some disapproval  but you can hardly make visits yet  i dont see why i cant visit susan  shes a relative and it isnt as if she were entertaining a number of people  she says shes very quiet she has hardly asked anybody only one or two intimate friends  shell have three or four men down for the partridge shooting  after all said sylvia i cant make her send them away  you have once or twice had men from town here  susan leads a very different life from mine mrs lansing persisted shes a little too fond of amusement and i dont approve of all her friends  she paused as an idea struck her  is captain bland going there for the shooting  i really cant tell you  is there any reason why she shouldnt invite him  mrs lansing would have preferred that sylvia should not see so much of bland as she was likely to do if she stayed in the same house with him though she knew of nothing in particular to his discredit  he had served without distinction in two campaigns he lived extravagantly and was supposed to be something of a philanderer  indeed not long ago an announcement of his engagement to a lady of station had been confidently expected but the affair had for some unknown reason suddenly fallen through  mrs lansing was puzzled about him  if the man were looking for a wealthy wife why should he be attracted as she thought he was by sylvia who had practically nothing  id really rather have you remain with us but of course i cant object to your going she said  i knew you would be nice about it sylvia exclaimed  i must have a talk with herbert you said he would be home this evening  lansings business occasionally prevented his nightly return from the nearest large town but he arrived some hours later and after dinner sylvia found him in his smokingroom  he looked up with a smile when she came in for their relations were generally pleasant  they understood each other though this did not lead to mutual confidence or respect  well he said  sylvia sat down in an easy chair adopting as she invariably did a becoming pose and handed him georges letter  he hasnt sent you very much herbert remarked  no said sylvia thats the difficulty  so i anticipated  youre not economical  sylvia laughed  i wont remind you of your failings  you have one virtueyou can be liberal when it suits you and youre my trustee  lansings rather fleshy smoothshaven face grew thoughtful but sylvia continued  im going to susans and i really need a lot of new clothes  for a week or twos visit  i may perhaps go on somewhere else afterward  i wonder whether you thought it necessary to tell muriel so  sylvia sighed  im afraid i didnt  i can hardly expect muriel to quite understand or sympathize  she has you and the flowers shes so fond of and quiet friends of the kind she likes while its so different with me besides i was never meant for retirement  that laughed lansing is very true  of course sylvia went on i shall be very quiet but there are things one really has to take part in  bridge is expensive unless youre unusually lucky or an excellent player lansing suggested  however it would be more to the purpose if you mentioned what is the least you could manage with  sylvia told him and he knit his brows  moneys tight with me just now he objected  you know its only on account  george will do ever so much better next year and i dare say if i pressed him he would send another remittance  his letter indicates that hed find it difficult  george wouldnt mind that  he rather likes doing things that are hard and its comforting to think that selfdenial doesnt cost him much  im thankful i have him to look after the farm  lansing regarded her with ironical amusement he knew what her gratitude was worth  yes he agreed significantly george seldom expects anything for himself  im afraid im different in that respect  sylvia sat silent for a few moments because she understood  if herbert granted the favor he would look for something in return though she had no idea what this would be  she was conscious of a certain hesitation but she did not allow it to influence her  i dont doubt it she rejoined with a smile  cant you let me have a check  that will make you my creditor but im not afraid youll be very exacting  well was the response i will see what i can do  she went out and lansing filled his pipe with a feeling of satisfaction  he was not running much risk in parting with the money and sylvia might prove useful by and by  sylvia left brantholme shortly afterward and somewhat to her annoyance found ethel west a guest at the house she visited  ethel had known dick she was a friend of georges and no doubt in regular communication with her brother in canada  it was possible that she might allude to sylvias doings when she wrote but there was some consolation in remembering that george was neither an imaginative nor a censorious person  sylvia had spent a delightful week in her new surroundings when she descended the broad stairway one night with a shawl upon her arm and an elegantly bound little notebook in her hand  a handsome darkhaired man whose bearing proclaimed him a soldier walked at her side  blands glance was quick and direct but he had a genial smile and his manners were usually characterized by a humorous boldness  still it was difficult to find fault with them and sylvia had acquiesced in his rather marked preference for her society  she was however studying the little book as she went down the shallow steps and her expression indicated dissatisfaction  im afraid it was my fault though you had very bad luck said the man noticing her look  im dreadfully sorry  it was your fault sylvia rejoined with some petulance  when i held my best hand i was deceived by your lead  besides as i told the others i didnt mean to play you shouldnt have come down and persuaded me  bland considered  on the whole sylvia played a good game but she was obviously a little out of practise for his lead had really been the correct one though she had not understood it  this however was of no consequence it was her concluding words that occupied his attention  they had he thought been spoken with a full grasp of their significance his companion was not likely to be guilty of any illconsidered admission  then im flattered that my influence goes so far though its perhaps unlucky in the present instance he said boldly  ill own that im responsible for our misfortunes and im ready to take the consequences please give me that book  no sylvia replied severely  i feel guilty for playing at all but the line must be drawn  where do you feel inclined to draw it  they had reached the hall and sylvia turned and looked at him directly but with a trace of coquetry  at allowing a comparative stranger to meet my losses if i must be blunt  the arrangement isnt altogether unusual  in this case its a duty and the restriction you make doesnt bar me out  im not a stranger  a mere acquaintance then said sylvia  that wont do either  it doesnt apply to me  then ill have to alter the classification  she broke into a soft laugh  its difficult to think of a term to fit would you like to suggest something  several epithets occurred to the man but he feared to make too rash a venture  well he said would you object toconfidential friend  sylvias smile seemed to taunt him  certainly it goes too far  one doesnt become a confidential friend in a very limited time  ive known it happen in a few days  friendships of that kind dont last  in a little while you find you have been deceived  but we wont talk of these things  you cant have the book and im going out  he held up the shawl which she draped about her shoulders and they strolled on to the terrace  the night was calm and pleasantly cool beyond the black line of hedge across the lawn meadows and harvest fields with rows of sheaves that cast dark shadows behind them stretched away in the moonlight  after a while sylvia stopped and leaned upon the broadtopped wall  its really pretty she remarked  yes returned bland its more than pretty  theres something in it that rests one  i sometimes wish i could live in such a place as this altogether  sylvia was astonished because she saw he meant it  after your life you would get horribly tired of it in three months  after my life  do you know what that has been  race meetings polo matches hilarious mess dinners  he laughed rather shortly  i suppose so but theyre not the only army duties  some of the rest are better abroad but theyre frequently accompanied by semistarvation scorching heat or stinging cold and fatigue and it doesnt seem to be the rule that those who bear the heaviest strain are remembered when promotion comes  sylvia studied him attentively  bland was well and powerfully made and she liked big menthere was more satisfaction in bending them to her will  in spite of his careless goodhumor he bore a certain stamp of distinction he was an excellent cardplayer he could dance exceptionally well and she had heard him spoken of as a firstclass shot  it was unfortunate that these abilities were of less account in a military career than she had supposed but when properly applied they carried their possessor some distance in other fields  what was as much to the purpose bland appeared to be wealthy and took a leading part in social amusements and activities  i suppose that is the case she said sympathetically in answer to his last remark  you have never told me anything about your last campaign  you were injured in it were you not  the man had his weaknesses but they did not include any desire to retail his exploits and sufferings to womens ears  he would not speak of his wounds honorably received or of perils faced as carelessly as he had exposed his men  yes he answered  but that was bad enough at the time and the rest of it would make a rather monotonous tale  surely not protested sylvia  the thrill and bustle of a campaign must be wonderfully exciting  the novelty of marching steadily in a blazing sun drinking bad water and shoveling trenches half the night soon wears off he said with a short laugh and changed the subject  one could imagine that youre not fond of quietness  sylvia shivered  the memory of her two years in canada could not be banished  she looked back on them with something like horror  no she declared i hate it  its deadly to me  well ive an idea  theres the dene hall charity gymkana comes off in a few days  its semiprivate and i know the people in fact theyve made me enter for some of the events  its a pretty ride to the place and i can get a good car  will you come  i dont know whether i ought said sylvia with some hesitation  think over it anyway he begged her  one or two people came out and when somebody called her name sylvia left him without promising  bland remained leaning on the wall and thinking hard  sylvia strongly attracted him  she was daintily pretty quick of comprehension and in spite of her black attire which at times gave her a forlorn air that made him compassionate altogether charming  it was however unfortunate that he could not marry a poor wife and he knew nothing about sylvias means  to do him justice he had shrunk from any attempt to obtain information on this point but he felt that it would have to be made before things went too far  his thoughts were interrupted by ethel west who strolled along the terrace and stopped close at hand  i didnt expect to find you wrapped in contemplation she remarked  as a matter of fact ive been talking  to mrs marston  shes generally considered entertaining  bland looked at her with a smile  he liked ethel west  she was blunt without being tactless and her conversation was sometimes piquant moreover he remembered that ethel and sylvia were old acquaintances  i find her so he said  though she has obviously had trouble shes very bright  its a sign of courage  in sylvia marstons case its largely a reaction  she spent what she regards as two harrowing years in canada  after all canada doesnt seem to be a bad place said bland  two of my friends who left the service went out to take up land and they evidently like it  they got lots of shooting and theyve started a pack of hounds  ethel considered  she could have told him that sylvias husband had gone out to make a living and had not been in a position to indulge in costly amusements but this did not appear advisable  i dont think marston got a great deal of sport she said  he had too much to do  a big place to look after  i understand its wise to buy up all the land you can  ethels idea of the mans views in respect to sylvia was confirmed  he was obviously giving her a lead and she followed it though she did not intend to enlighten him  yes she answered thats the opinion of my brother whos farming there  he says values are bound to go up as the new railroads are built and marston had a good deal of land  sylvia is prudently keeping every acre and farming as much as possible  she saw this was satisfactory to bland and she had no hesitation in letting him conclude what he liked from it  it was not her part to caution him and it was possible that if no other suitor appeared sylvia might fall back on george which was a risk that must be avoided at any cost  ethel did not expect to gain anything for herself she knew that george had never had any love for her but she was determined that he should not fall into sylvias hands  he was too fine a man in many ways to be thus sacrificed  but how can mrs marston carry on the farm bland inquired  i should have said her trustees are doing so ethel answered carelessly  one of them went out to look into things not long ago  then she moved away and left bland with one difficulty that had troubled him removed     chapter xiv  bland gets entangled  when mrs kettering heard of sylvias intention to attend the gymkana she gave her consent and said that as she had an invitation she would make up a party to go  this was not what bland required  it was however a fourseated car that he had been promised the use of and counting sylvia and himself and the driver there was only one place left  while he was wondering to whom it would be best to offer it sylvia thought of ethel west who had announced that she would not attend the function  by making a short round they could pass through a market town of some importance  you mentioned that you wished to buy some things why not come with us she said to ethel  we could drop you going out and call for you coming home  susan will have the big car full so she couldnt take you and its a long drive to the station and the trains run awkwardly  sylvias motive was easy to discern but ethel agreed  she was on the whole inclined to pity captain bland but he was a stranger and george was a friend  if sylvia must choose between them it would be much better that she should take the soldier  for all that ethel had an uncomfortable feeling that she was assisting in a piece of treachery when she set off soon after lunch on a fine autumn day and the car had gone several miles before she began to enjoy the ride  for a while the straight white road climbing steadily crossed a waste of moors  the dry grass gleamed gray and silver among the russet fern rounded whiteedged clouds floated scarcely moving in a sky of softest blue  the upland air was gloriously fresh and the speed exhilarating  by and by they ran down into a narrow dale in the depths of which a river brawled among the stones and climbed a long ascent from which they could see a moving dustcloud indicating that mrs ketterings car was only a mile or two behind  after that there was a league of brown heath and then they sped down to a wide wooded valley in the midst of which rose the gray walls of an ancient town  on reaching it ethel alighted in the marketsquare hard by the lofty abbey and turned to bland  i have one or two calls to make after ive finished shopping but if it takes longer than i expected or you cant get here in time ill go back by train she said  in that case you must bring me home from the station  bland promised and ethel watched the car with a curious expression until it vanished under a timeworn archway  she was vexed with herself for playing into sylvias hands though she had only done so in what she regarded as georges interest  if sylvia married bland the blow would no doubt be a heavy one to george but it would be better for him in the end  in the meanwhile the car sped on up the valley until it reached an ancient house built on to a great square tower where bland was welcomed by a lady of high importance in the district  afterward he was familiarly greeted by several of her guests which sylvia who had strong ambitions duly noticed these people occupied a different station from the one in which she had hitherto moved  when bland was called away from her she was shown to a place at some distance from mrs ketterings party and she sat down and looked about with interest  from the smooth lawn and still glowing borders before the old gray house a meadow ran down to the river that wandered gleaming through the valley and beyond it the brown moors cut against the clear blue sky  in the meadow a large oval space was lined with groups of smartlydressed people and in its midst rose trim pavilions outside which grooms stood holding beautiful glossy horses  everything was prettily arranged the scene with its air of gayety appealed to sylvia and she enjoyed it keenly though she was now and then conscious of her somber attire  then the entertainment began and she admitted that bland finelymounted was admirable  he took his part in several competitions and through them all displayed a genial goodhumor and easy physical grace  he had for the most part younger men as antagonists but sylvia thought that none of them could compare with him in manner or bearing  after a while sylvia noticed with a start of surprise and annoyance that herbert lansing was strolling toward her  he took an unoccupied chair at her side  what brought you here she asked  that he said is easily explained  i got a kind of circular of invitation and as ive had dealings with one or two of these people i thought it advisable to make an appearance and pay my halfguinea then theres a man i want a talk with and i find that the atmosphere of an office has often a deterrent effect on those unused to it  but i didnt expect to find you here  susan and some of the others have come ive no doubt youll meet her  the explanation appeared adequate on the face of it but a moment later herbert glanced at bland who was dexterously controlling his restive horse  the man looks well in the saddle doesnt he he said  yes assented sylvia in an indifferent tone though she was slightly disturbed  herbert was keenwitted and she would rather not have had him take an interest in her affairs  im inclined to think its fortunate i didnt bring muriel he resumed with a smile  shes rather conventional and has stricter views than seem to be general nowadays  i cant see why i should remain in complete seclusion its an irrational idea  but ive no intention of concealing anything i think fit to do  of course not  are you going to mention that you attended this entertainment when you write to muriel  sylvia pondered her reply  in spite of its dullness mrs lansings house was a comfortable and secure retreat  she would have to go back to it presently and it was desirable that she should avoid any cause of disagreement with her hostess  no she said candidly i dont see any need for that and i may not write for some time  of course muriel doesnt quite look at things as i do and on one or two points shes unusually sensitive  herbert looked amused  youre considerate and i dare say youre right  there doesnt seem to be any reason why muriel should concern herself about the thing particularly as youre in susans hands  the implied promise that he would not mention his having seen her afforded sylvia some relief but when he went away to speak to mrs kettering she wished she had not met him  herbert was troubled by none of his wifes prejudices but on another occasion he had made her feel that she owed him something for which he might expect some return and now the impression was more marked their secret though of no importance had strengthened his position  herbert seldom granted a favor without an end in view and she did not wish him to get too firm a hold on her  the feeling however wore off and she had spent a pleasant afternoon when bland came for her as the shadows lengthened  he reminded her of ethel  well have to get off if were to pick up miss west  sylvia said that she was ready though she felt it would have been more satisfactory had ethel been allowed to go back by train  they began the journey but after a few miles the car stopped on a steep rise the driver with some trouble started the engine but soon after they had crossed the crest of the hill it stopped again and he looked grave as he supplied bland with some details that sylvia found unintelligible  you must get her along another mile then you can go back on a bicycle for what you want bland told him and turned to sylvia  well be delayed for an hour or so but he can leave word for miss west and theres an inn not far off where theyll give us tea while were waiting  they reached it after turning into another road though the car made alarming noises during the journey  sylvia viewed the old building with appreciation  it stood long and low and cleanly whitewashed on the brink of a deep ghyll filled with lichened boulders and russet ferns with a firwood close behind it and in front a wide vista of moors and fells that stood out darkly blue against the evening light near the stone porch a rustic table stood beside a row of tall red hollyhocks  its a charming spot sylvia exclaimed  cant we have tea outside  bland ordered it and they sat down to a neatlyserved meal  the evening was warm and very still and clear  a rattle of wheels reached them from somewhere far down the road and they could hear the faint splash of water in the depths of the ravine  this is really delightful murmured sylvia when the table had been cleared  i like the quietness of the country when it comes as a contrast after for example such an afternoon as we have spent  then youre not sorry you came  sorry  you wouldnt suggest it if you knew how dull my days often are  but i mustnt be doleful  you may smoke if you like  bland did not particularly wish to smoke but he lighted a cigarette it seemed to banish formality to place them on more familiar terms  what is the matter with the car sylvia asked  im afraid i cant tell you  it cant be got along without something the man has gone back for  they do stop sometimes  is this one in the habit of doing so  i cant say as it isnt mine  why do you ask  oh said sylvia i had my suspicions  the man didnt seem in the least astonished or annoyed for one thing  then it broke down in such a convenient place  bland laughed her boldness appealed to him  well he declared im perfectly innocent though i cant pretend im sorry  you felt you had to say that  no he declared with a direct glance i meant it  sylvia leaned back in her chair and glanced appreciatively at the moor  after all she said its remarkably pretty here and a change is nice  ill confess that i find susans friends a little boring  the implication was that she preferred blands society and he was gratified  that struck me some time ago he rejoined  i wonder if you can guess why i thought it worth while to put up with them  sylvia smiled as she looked at him  she liked the man she thought that he had a good deal she valued to offer her but as yet she desired only his captivation  she must not allow him to go too far  you might have had a number of motives she said carelessly  i dont feel much curiosity about them  bland bore the rebuff goodhumoredly  patience was one of his strong points and since his conversation with ethel west on the terrace he had made up his mind  in arriving at a decision the man was honest and ready to make some sacrifice  he had been strongly impressed by sylvia on their first meeting but he had realized that it would be a mistake to marry her unless she had some means  hitherto he had found it difficult to meet his expenses which were large  he did not believe now that sylvia was rich and he had seen enough of her to suspect that she was extravagant but this did not deter him  she had undoubtedly some possessions and he was prepared to retrench and deny himself a number of costly pleasures  indeed he had once or twice thought of leaving the army  then i wont force an explanation on you he said and lighting another cigarette lazily watched her and tried to analyze her charm  he failed to do so  sylvia was a born coquette and most dangerous in that her power of attraction was natural and as a rule she appealed to the better and more chivalrous feelings of her victims  fragile and delicately pretty she looked as if she needed some one to shelter and defend her from all troubles  bland decided that although she rarely said anything brilliant and he had seen more beautiful women he had not met one who taken all round could compare with sylvia  what are you thinking of she asked at length with a gleam of mischief in her eyes  oh he answered slightly confused my mind was wandering  i believe i was trying to explain a thing thats wrapped in impenetrable mystery  one wouldnt have imagined you were given to that kind of amusement and its obviously a waste of time  wouldnt it be wiser to accept the object that puzzles you for what it seems if its nice  it is he declared wondering whether this was a random shot on her part or one of the flashes of penetration with which she sometimes surprised him  your advice is good  i believe so responded sylvia  if a thing pleases you dont try to find out too much about it  thats the way to disappointment  she was a little astonished at his reply  perhaps its a deserved penalty  one should respect a beautiful mysteryunquestioning faith is a power  it reacts upon its object as well as upon its possessor  even if its mistaken  it couldnt be altogether so bland objected  nothing that was unworthy could inspire real devotion  all this is far too serious said sylvia petulantly for her companions moralizing had awakened a train of unpleasant reflections  she did not think unquestioning faith was common but she knew of one man who was endowed with it and he was toiling for her sake on the desolate western prairie  once or twice his belief in her had roused angry compunction and she had revealed the more unfavorable aspects of her character but he had refused to see them  then what shall we talk about bland inquired  anything that doesnt tax ones brain severely  yourself for example  im not sure thats flattering and its an indifferent topic but i wont back out  as i gave you your choice i must take the consequences  are you always ready to do that  there was a tiny hint of seriousness in her voice  well he said with some dryness i generally try  there was something that reminded her of george in his expression  the man she thought would redeem what pledge he gave he might be guilty of rashness but he would not slink away when the reckoning came  then she became conscious of a halftender regret  it was a pity that george was so fond of the background and left it only when he was needed while brand was a prominent figure wherever he went and this was perhaps the one of his characteristics which most impressed her then he rather modestly began the brief account of his career adding scraps of information about his relatives who were people of station he did not enlarge upon several points that were in his favor but he omitted to state that he had now and then been on the verge of a financial crisis  sylvia listened with keen interest and asked a few questions to help him on but when he finished she let the subject drop  soon afterward she glanced down the road which was growing dim  i wish your man would come  its getting late she said  he cant be much longer  i dont think you need be disturbed  i am disturbed sylvia declared  i really shouldnt have come today you will remember i hesitated  then it was a temptation  sylvia smiled rather wistfully  that must be confessed i need a little stir and brightness and i so seldom get it  you know muriel i owe her a good deal but shes so dull and she makes you feel that everything you like to do is wrong  but you havent been very long with mrs lansing  wasnt it different in canada  bland had a reason for venturing on the question though it was rather a delicate one  i can hardly bear to think of it  for four months in the year i was shut up halffrozen in a desolate homestead  there was deep snow all round the place nobody came  it was a days drive to a forlorn settlement nothing ever broke the dreary monotony  in summer one got worn out with the heat and the endless petty troubles  there was not a moments rest the house was filled with plowmen and harvesters uncouth barbarians who ate at our table and must be waited on  bland was moved to pity but he was also consoled  as she had not mentioned marston she could not greatly have felt his loss  sylvia must have married young no doubt before she knew her mind  i wish he said quietly i could do something to make your life a little brighter  but you cant  ive had one happy dayand im grateful  it must last me a while  he leaned forward looking at her with an intent expression  sylvia give me the right to try  she shrank from him with a start that was partly natural for she was not quite prepared for a bold avowal  no she said in alarm  how can i do that  dont you understand me sylvia  i want the right to take care of you  she checked him with a gesture  it is you who cant understand  do you think im heartless  nothing could make me think hardly of you he declared  then show me some respect and consideration  it was what i looked for i felt i was safe with you  though he had not expected strong opposition he saw that she was determined  he had been too precipitate and while he had no idea of abandoning his purpose he bowed  if ive offended you must forgive mei thought of nothing beyond my longing for you  that wont change or diminish but ive been rash and have startled you  i must wait  he watched her in keen anxiety but sylvia gave no hint of her feelings  as a matter of fact she was wondering why she had checked and repulsed him  she could not tell  a sudden impulse had swayed her but she was not sorry she had yielded to it  her hold on the man was as strong as ever the affair was not ended  there was silence for the next few minutes  it was growing dark the hills had faded to blurs of shadows and the moor ran back a vast dim waste  then a twinkling light moved toward them up the ascending road bland rose and pointed to it  i dare say the man has got the things he needed  well be off again shortly he said in his usual manner and sylvia was grateful  in another halfhour the car was ready and when bland helped sylvia in and wrapped the furs about her there was something new in his care for her comfort  it was a kind of proprietary gentleness which she did not resent  then they sped away across the dusky moor     chapter xv  herbert makes a claim  sylvia finished her round of visits in a state approaching insolvency mrs kettering with whom she stayed some time indulged in expensive amusements and though she would have listened with goodhumor to a plea of poverty sylvia declined to make it  she would not have bland suspect the state of her affairs and while he remained in the house she took her part in all that went on which included cardplaying for high stakes  as it happened she had a steady run of misfortune bland sympathized with her and occasionally ventured a remonstrance but she could see that the cheerful manner in which she faced her losses had its effect on him  on the evening of her return herbert was strolling along the platform at a busy junction in the gathering dusk when he noticed bland speaking to a porter  soon afterward  bland came toward him and herbert asked him if he were staying in the neighborhood  no said bland im passing through only been here half an hour were probably on the same errand  i came to meet mrs marston herbert told him  and i broke my journey to town with the idea of being of some assistance when she changed  they dont give one much time here and its an awkward station herbert said with a careless air  it struck him that sylvias acquaintance with the man must have ripened rapidly for he was well informed of her movements but this was no concern of his  he had thought for some time that a match between her and george would be unsuitable  for a while he and bland talked about indifferent matters and then the latter turned to him with a smile  i was very lucky at a small steeplechase he said  backed a rank outsider that only a few friends of mine believed in  do you know of anything thats bound to go up on the stock exchange  its in your line i think  i dont  such stocks are remarkably scarce  if theres any strong reason for a rise in value buyers anticipate it  then perhaps you know of something that has a better chance than the rest  i expect your tips worth having  you might tryrubber  rubber  hasnt that been a little overdone  herbert considered for this remark confirmed his private opinion rubber shares had been in strong demand but he thought they would not continue in general favor  the suggestion made by an outsider might be supposed to express the view held by small speculators which had its effect on the market  i gave you my idea but i cant guarantee success he said  you must use your judgment and dont blame me if things go wrong  of course not the risks mine returned bland and herbert thought he meant to follow his advice  a few minutes later the train which they were waiting for came in and herbert tactfully stood aside when bland helped sylvia to alight watching her face he concluded by the absence of any sign of surprise that the meeting had been arranged  bland however had little opportunity for conversation amid the bustle and the train was on the point of starting before sylvia saw herbert  he got in as it was moving and she looked at him sharply  i didnt expect you would meet me  so i supposed he told her  oh well she said smiling you might have been useful  herbert thought she might have thanked him for coming considering that he had by his wifes orders made an inconvenient journey but gratitude was not one of sylvias virtues  did you enjoy yourself he asked  yes on the whole but ive been dreadfully unlucky  in fact im threatened by a financial crisis  herbert made a rueful grimace  i know what that means im getting used to it  but well talk the matter over another time  i suppose im neglecting my duties i ought to lecture you  isnt muriel capable of doing all thats necessary in that line  shes hampered by not knowing as much as i do herbert retorted with a meaning smile  nothing of moment passed between them during the rest of the journey but some time after they reached home herbert turned to sylvia who was sitting near him in the absence of his wife  youre short of funds again he asked  sylvia explained her embarrassments and herbert looked thoughtful  so he said you have spent what george sent as well as what i advanced you in anticipation of his next remittance  this cant go on you know  ill be very economical for the next few months sylvia promised penitently  if youre not youll find very stern economy imperative during those that follow but ill let you have a small check before i leave  sylvia thanked him and they talked about other matters for a while then he said carelessly  theres a favor you could do me  it wont cost you any trouble  a young man is coming down here next week and i want you to be as pleasant as you can and make him enjoy his visit  im inclined to think hell appreciate any little attention you can show him  the lasts a cheap compliment sylvia rejoined  arent you asking me to undertake your wifes duty  herbert smiled  not altogether  muriels an excellent hostess she will do her part but i want you to assist her  you have exceptional and rather dangerous gifts  dont go too far sylvia warned him  but id better understand the situation  how long do you expect me to be amiable to the man  only for a couple of days  he might come down again but thats not certain  sylvia considered for she saw what herbert required  she was to exert her powers of fascination upon the visitor in order to make him more pliable in his hosts hands  the task was not a disagreeable one and she had foreseen all along that herbert in indulging her in various ways would look for some return  after all she said theres no reason why i should be ungracious to him so long as hes pleasant  herbert carelessly nodded agreement but sylvia knew that he expected her to carry out his wishes and she did not find it difficult when the guest arrived  paul singleton was young and perhaps unusually susceptible to the influences brought to bear upon him during his visit  born with some talents in very humble station he had by means of scholarships obtained an excellent education and had devoted himself in particular to the study of botany  a prosperous man who took an interest in him sent him out to a tropical plantation where he wrote a work on the vegetable product of equatorial regions which secured him notice indeed he was beginning to make his mark as an authority on the subject  so far however his life had been one of economy and selfdenial and although lansings dwelling was not characterized by any very marked signs of culture or luxury it was different from the surroundings to which singleton was accustomed  his hostess was staidly cordial and at once set him at his ease sylvia was a revelation  her piquant prettiness and her charm of manner dazzled him  she played her part well not merely because she had agreed to do so but because it was one that strongly appealed to her nature  on the second evening of singletons visit he was talking to sylvia rather confidentially in the drawingroom where mrs lansing had left them while herbert was seated at a table in his library with a cigar in his hand and a litter of papers in front of him  he was thinking hard and rubber occupied the foremost place in his mind  he was a director of a company formed to exploit a strip of rubberbearing territory in the tropics which had hitherto been successful but he felt that it was time to retire from the position and realize the profit on his shares  there was another company he and some associates had arranged to launch but he was now very doubtful whether this would be wise  rubber exploitations were overdone there were signs that investors were losing their confidence  withdrawal however was difficult for it must be quietly effected without breaking prices by any unusual sales  it was therefore desirable that other holders should cling to their shares and any fresh buying by outsiders would of course be so much the better  this was one reason why he had suggested a purchase to bland  opening a book he noted the amount of stock standing in georges name this had been purchased by herbert who had been given such authority by his cousin at a time when the directors position needed strengthening though it had been necessary to dispose of sound shares yielding a small return  the prompt sale of this stock would secure george a moderate profit but after some consideration herbert decided that it should remain  he had no wish that george should suffer but his own interests stood first  then he carefully studied several sheets of figures which confirmed his opinion that a drop in the value of the stock he owned might be looked for shortly though he thought very few people realized this yet  it was time for effective but cautious action  he must unload as soon as possible  by and by he rang a bell and passed across the cigar box when singleton came in and sat down opposite him  he was a wiry darkhaired man with an intelligent face which had grown rather white and haggard in the tropics  just now he felt grateful to his host who had made his stay very pleasant and had given him an opportunity for meeting sylvia  i suppose you have read my report on your new tropical property he said  yes answered herbert picking up a lengthy document  ive given it some thought  on the whole it isnt optimistic  singleton pondered this  he had learned a little about company floating and was willing to oblige his host as far as he honestly could  lansing had enabled him to undertake a search for some rare examples of tropical flora by paying him a handsome fee for the report  well he said there is some good rubber in your territory as i have stated  but not readily accessible  im afraid i cant say it is  herbert smiled at him  im not suggesting such a course  in asking a man of your character and attainments to investigate i was prompted by the desire to get a reliable report  singleton did not know what to make of this so far as his experience went gentlemen who paid for an opinion on the property they meant to dispose of did not want an unfavorable one  the rubbers scattered and grows in awkward places he explained  precisely  herbert glanced at the paper  you mentioned something of the kind  but what about planting and systematic cultivation  soil and climate are eminently suitable  i gather that theres a difficulty in the way of obtaining native labor  singleton broke into a grim smile  its a serious one  the natives consider strangers as their lawful prey and they lately managed to give a strong punitive expedition a good deal of trouble  in fact as theyre in a rather restless mood the authorities were very dubious about letting me go inland and in spite of the care i took they got two of my colored carriers  shot them with little poisoned arrows  ah ejaculated herbert  poisoned arrows  that should have a deterrent effect  singularly so  a slight prick is enough to wipe you out within an hour  its merciful the time is so short  that said herbert was not quite what i meant  i was thinking of the effect upon the gentlemen who wish to launch this company  the risk isnt attached to their end of the business singleton dryly pointed out  herbert did not answer  while he sat with knitted brows turning over some of the papers in front of him  singleton looked about  hitherto his life had been spent in comfortless and shabby english lodgings in the sour steam of tropic swamps and in galvanized iron factories that were filled all day with an intolerable heat  as a result of this his hosts library impressed him  it was spacious and furnished in excellent taste a shaded silver lamp stood on the table diffusing a restricted light that made the room look larger a clear wood fire burned in the grate  the effect of all he saw was tranquilizing and the house as a whole inhabited as it was by two charming cultured women struck him as a delightful place of rest  he wondered with longing whether he would have an opportunity for coming back to it  then his host looked up  have you any strong objections to recasting this report he asked dont mistake me  im not asking you to color things in any way i want simple facts  after what you have told me i cant consider the prospects of our working the concessions very favorable  singleton was surprised lansings attitude was puzzling considering that he had suggested the flotation of the projected company  do you want the drawbacks insisted on he asked  herbert smiled  i dont want them mitigated state them clearly  include what you told me about the trouble with the natives and the poisoned arrows  then a light broke in upon singleton  he had not placed his host in the same category with mrs lansing and sylvia  it looked as if he had changed his plans and wished to prevent the company from being formed this caused singleton to consider how far he would be justified in assisting him  he could honestly go some length in doing so and having fallen a victim to sylvias charm he was willing to do his utmost  theres no doubt that some of the facts are discouraging he said  herbert looked at him keenly  that is what struck me  suppose you think the thing over and bring me down a fresh report a week from today  stay a day or two if youre not busy i can get you some shooting and we can talk over any points that seem to require it at leisure  singleton sat silent a moment  he wanted to come back and he did not believe the concession could be profitably worked by any usual methods for all that he thought he could make something of the property it was not altogether worthless though it would require exceptional treatment  perhaps that would be better he replied i should be delighted to make another visit  herbert took up the paper and looked at singleton with a smile as he flung it into the fire  now i think well go down he said  mrs lansing will be waiting for us  singleton spent the remainder of the evening with great content talking to sylvia  when she left him herbert met her in the hall  thanks he smiled meaningly  did you find the man interesting  to some extent returned sylvia hes a type thats new to me still of course hes a little raw and inclined to be serious  i think one could see too much of him  hes coming down again in a week  oh said sylvia with signs of protest  and after that  herbert laughed  i dont think hell make a third visit     chapter xvi  a forced retirement  singleton came down again to brantholme bringing his amended report which met with herberts approval  he spent one wet day walking through turnip fields and stubble in search of partridges and two delightful evenings with mrs lansing and sylvia and then he was allowed to depart  he had served his purpose and herbert was glad to get rid of him  lansing generally found it desirable to drop men for whom he had no more use but he had not done with singleton  a day or two later after his guest had left herbert sat in his office in a busy town with an open ledger in front of him  he looked thoughtful and as a matter of fact he was reviewing the latter part of his business career which had been marked by risks boldly faced but attended by keen anxiety  though his wife had some money lansing had been hampered by lack of capital and georges money had been placed at his disposal at a very opportune time  it had enabled him to carry the rubber company over what might have proved a crisis and thus strengthen his position as director by purchasing sufficient shares on georges account to keep the price from falling and defeat the intrigues of a clique of discontented investors  now however the strain had slackened herberts schemes had succeeded and he had only to take his profit by selling out as quietly as possible  he had already given a broker orders to do so  he rather regretted that he could not dispose of georges shares but these must be kept a little longer to throw a large quantity upon the market would have a depressing effect and might arouse suspicion  presently a man with whom he had dealings was shown in and sat down his appearance indicated some degree of prosperity but he looked disturbed and anxious  i met jackson yesterday and after what he told me of his interview with you i thought id better run up and see you at once he explained  herbert had expected the visit  im at your service he said  what about the new company  i understand you havent come to any decision yet about the suggestions we sent you for its flotation  no replied herbert  in fact ive reasons for believing it wouldnt be wise to go any farther in the matter  the other looked at him in astonishment  well he said i heard that you were not so enthusiastic as you were not long ago which is why i came down but i never expected this anyway after what we have done you are bound to go on with the thing our success with the first company will help the shares off  thats not certain  herbert handed him a paper  you havent seen singletons report  the man read it hastily his face changing  then he looked up with signs of strong indignation  you let him give you a thing like this  paid him for it  what could i do  the mans honest  he declares the countrys dangerous he had two carriers killed  theres no prospect of our obtaining the needful native labor  send somebody else out at once  with the same result  besides its expensive  singletons fee wasnt so big because he shared the cost of his orchid collecting or something of the kind with us  then he might talk and there would always be the risk of somebodys challenging us with suppressing his report  if things went wrong that would lead to trouble  would there be any use in my seeing him  herbert smiled  singleton would not turn against him sylvia had made her influence felt  not the slightest he answered  you can take that for granted  his visitor pondered for a moment or two and then he crumpled the report in his hand growing red in the face  you seem content with this production  it looks as if you had meant to back out  herbert looked at him tranquilly  well he said thats my intention now and i dont think that you can induce me to alter it  i cant see that we would be justified in floating the concern  but it was you who suggested it and led us on  what about the money we have already spent  its gone  im sorry but things dont always turn out right  when i first mentioned the matter the prospects looked good investigation places them in a less favorable light for which you can hardly hold me responsible  you took a business risk  the other man angrily flung the report on the table  this has been a blow to me and im far from appreciating the course youve taken  but what about the older concern  though we dont seem to have turned out much rubber yet i suppose its position is still satisfactory  herbert saw suspicion in the mans face and he rang a bell  i think you had better satisfy yourself i have the necessary particulars here  he indicated some books on a neighboring shelf and then added when a clerk appeared  will you bring me the extract of our working expenses that i asked you to make out  the clerk came back with a sheet of figures which herbert handed to his visitor with one of the books and the man spent some time carefully examining them  everything looks satisfactory ive no fault to find he said at length  but i feel very sore about your giving up the new undertaking  it cant be helped explained herbert  if its any comfort to you i dropped as much money over preliminary expenses as you did  after a little further conversation his visitor left and herbert resumed his work  on the whole the interview had been less embarrassing than he expected and though it was likely that the rest of his colleagues would call and expostulate he was ready to meet them  his excuse for abandoning the project was on the face of it a good one but he had no thought of giving these men who were largely interested in the original company a word of warning  it was undesirable that they should sell their shares until he had disposed of his  they had he argued the same opportunities for forecasting the course of the market and gaging the trend of investors ideas as he enjoyed and if they did not make use of them it was their fault  the stock had reached a satisfactory premium which was all that he had promised he could not be expected to guarantee its remaining at the high level  during the next three or four weeks his broker sold out his shares in small blocks and when the quantity had been largely reduced herbert decided that he would dispose of those he had purchased on georges account  though there were signs of a diminishing interest in such stock values had scarcely begun to fall and having made his position secure he did not wish his cousin to incur a loss  accordingly he sent instructions to sell another lot of shares  he was very busy the next day when a telegram was brought him but he sat still for some minutes considering it  the market it stated had suddenly fallen flat and as prices were giving way sharply further orders were requested  the change herbert had foreseen had come a little sooner than he had expected  he still held some shares which he had thought of keeping because it might after all prove judicious to retain a degree of control in the company and having sold the rest at a good profit a moderate fall in their value would be of less consequence  the drop however was marked and he decided to further reduce the quantity standing in his name instead of realizing those belonging to his cousin  george must take his chance and the market might rally  as a result of these reflections he wired his broker to sell and in a few hours received an answer   sale effected within limit given market since broken badly expect slump   herbert saw that he had acted with prudence though it was evident that his cousin had incurred a serious loss  he was sorry for this but it could not be helped  a few days later he was sitting beside the fire at home after his evening meal when sylvia entered the room in his wifes absence  she stood near the hearth examining some embroidery in her hand but she looked up presently and it became evident that she had been reading the papers  there seems to be a sharp fall in rubber shares she said  will it affect you  no replied herbert not seriously  i suppose that means you must have anticipated the fall and sold outunloaded i think you call itin time  herbert did not wish to discuss the matter  he had already had one or two trying interviews with his business colleagues and the opinions they had expressed about him still rankled in his mind  he was not particularly sensitive but the subject was an unpleasant one  something of the kind he answered  one has to take precautions  sylvia laughed  one could imagine your taking them  youre not the man to be caught at a disadvantage are you  well he said dryly its a thing i try to avoid  sylvia sat down as if she meant to continue the conversation which was far from what he desired but he could not be discourteous  had george any shares in your company she asked  there was no way of avoiding a reply without arousing her suspicions herbert knew that she was keenwitted and persistent  yes he said he had a quantity  have those shares been sold  this was a more troublesome question but herbert was compelled to answer  no not yet  its unfortunate that the market broke before i could get rid of them but it may rally  im rather disturbed about the matter but after all one has to take ones chance in buying shares dealing in the speculative sorts is to a large extent a game of hazard  i suppose so but then somebody must win  no returned herbert now and then everybody loses  sylvia glanced at him with a mocking smile  even those in the inside ring  when that happens it must be something like a catastrophe  but im sorry for george he doesnt deserve this  herbert could not deny it but to his surprise the girl leaned forward speaking in an authoritative tone  i dont know what you can do but you must do something to get george out of the difficulty  its obvious that you led him into ithe isnt the man to go in for rash speculation he would have chosen something safe  it was a relief to herbert that his wife came in just then but as he had reason for believing that she would not remain he decided that he would go out and post some letters  sylvia seemed to be in an inquisitive mood and he did not wish to be left alone with her  the night was fine but dark in places a thin lowlying mist that hung over the meadows obscured the hedgerows and it grew more dense as herbert approached the river which brawled noisily among the stones the man however scarcely noticed this his mind was occupied with other matters  sylvias attitude had disturbed him  she was useful as an ally but she could not be allowed to criticize his conduct or to give him orders  moreover he had reasons for believing that investors in his company might share her views and he looked for serious trouble with two or three gentlemen who blamed him for their losses and had so far incivilly refused to be pacified by his explanations  herbert was of a philosophic disposition and realized that one must not expect too much  having made a handsome profit he felt that he ought to be content and bear a certain amount of suspicion and contumely with unruffled goodhumor  for all that he found it disagreeable to be looked upon as a trickster and it was worse when his disgusted associates used more offensive epithets in his presence  he was considering how he should deal with them when he entered a thicker belt of mist  it shut him in so that he could see nothing ahead but there was a strong fence between him and the river and he went on lost in thought until the mist was suddenly illuminated and a bright light flashed along the road  the hoot of a motorhorn broke out behind him and rudely startled he sprang aside  he was too late somebody cried out in warning and the next moment he was conscious of a blow that flung him bodily forward  he came down with a crash something seemed to grind him into the stones there was a stabbing pain in his side and he lost consciousness  fortunately the big car was promptly stopped and two men sprang down an indistinct object lay just behind the forward pair of wheels and in anxious haste they dragged it clear and into the glare of the lamps herberts hat had fallen off he was scarcely breathing and his face was ghastly white but one of the men recognized him  its lansing he exclaimed  seems badly hurt though id nearly pulled her up when she struck him  he was dragged some way jacket must have caught the starting crank or something but that doesnt matter now  he raised his voice dreadfully sorry mr lansing can you hear me  there was no answer and the man shook his head  im afraid this is serious  his companion looked unnerved but he roused himself with an effort  it is and were behaving like idiots wasting time that may be valuable  get hold and lift him in his house is scarcely a mile away  they had some difficulty in getting the unconscious man into the car and then its owner backed it twice into a bank before he succeeded in turning round but in three or four minutes they carried herbert into brantholme and afterward drove away at top speed in search of assistance  it was however an hour later when they returned with a doctor and he looked grave after he had examined his patient  your husband has two ribs broken he told mrs lansing  in a way thats not very serious but he seems to be prostrated by the shock there are a few things that must be done at once and then well have to keep him as quiet as possible  it was two hours later when he left the house promising to return early the next day with a nurse and herbert lay still and unconscious in a dimly lighted room     chapter xvii  herbert is patient  on the second morning after the accident herbert lying stiffly swathed in bandages opened his eyes in a partly darkened room  a nurse was standing near a table and when the injured man painfully turned his head the doctor who had been speaking to her came toward him  i think we can let you talk a little now he said  how do you feel  herberts face relaxed into a feeble smile  very far from happy  i suppose ive been badly knocked about  ive treated more serious cases and youll get over it  but youll have to reconcile yourself to lying quiet for a long while  herbert made no reply to this but his expression suggested that he was trying to think  has the thing got into the papers he asked  the doctor was a little surprised it seemed a curious point for his patient to take an interest in but he was willing to indulge him  its early yet but one of the courier people stopped me as i was driving out and i gave him a few particulars  you cant hush the matter up  no said herbert  you did quite right  hadnt you better mention exactly whats the matter with me  if i did you wouldnt understand it said the doctor who generally adopted a cheerful halfhumorous tone  in plain english you have two ribs broken besides a number of contusions and im inclined to suspect your nervous system has received a nasty shock  and the cure  complete rest patience and perhaps a change of scene when youre able to get about  that means ill have to drop all active interest in my business for some time  im afraid so by and by well consider when you can resume it  it struck the doctor that herbert was not displeased with the information and that seemed strange considering that he was a busy energetic man  he lay silent a while with an undisturbed expression  i wonder if you would write a telegram and a letter for me he asked at length  with pleasure if you dont think you have talked enough  cant you wait until tomorrow  ill feel easier when ive got it off my mind  the doctor thought this likely  he made a sign of acquiescence and took out his notebook and herbert give him the rubber companys london address and then dictated   regret i am incapacitated for business for indefinite period by motor accident  if advisable appoint new director in my place before shareholders meeting which cannot attend  compelled to remain in strict quietness   you might send these people a short note he added stating that im submitting to your advice and giving them a few particulars about my injuries  ill be glad to do so  then theres only another thing  id like some notice of the accident put into a leading london paperit will explain my retirement to people who would soon begin to wonder why i wasnt at my post  it shall be attended to but i scarcely think mr phillips and his motoring friend will appreciate the notoriety you will confer on them  herbert smiled  theres no reason why i should consider phillips  if he will drive furiously in the dark and run over peoplethis isnt his first accidenthe must take the consequences  but you can tell him with my compliments that ill let him off if hell be more cautious in future  now i feel that id like to rest or go to sleep again  the doctor went out somewhat puzzledhis patient seemed singularly resigned to inaction and glad to escape from commercial affairs instead of chafing at his misfortune  after exchanging a few words with mrs lansing he met sylvia in the hall  how is he this morning she asked  better than i expected able to take an interest in things  i was glad to find him so acquiescentit isnt usual  he didnt seem disturbed when he asked me to write a telegram expressing his willingness to give up his directors post  he had not mentioned this matter to mrs lansing  in several ways sylvia struck him as being the more capable woman though this was not the impression her appearance had upon the less practised observers she looked thoughtful at his news  i suppose such a course is necessary she remarked  i believe its advisable that is if theres any likelihood that his duties will make much demand on him for some time to come  sylvia changed the subject  have you any particular instructions  none beyond those ive given the nurse  quietness is the great thing but it doesnt look as if hell cause you much trouble  the prediction was justified  with the exception of a few complaints about his physical discomfort herbert displayed an exemplary patience and soon began to improve for his recovery was assisted by the tranquil state of his mind  the accident had happened at a very opportune time it furnished an excellent excuse for withdrawing from an embarrassing situation and it would save his credit if as seemed probable difficulties shortly threatened the rubber company  it would look as if any trouble that might fall upon the concern was the result of his having been forced to relinquish control and nobody could rationally blame him for being run over  he was lying in a sunny room one afternoon when two gentlemen were shown in  one was the caller with whom he had an interview in his office before the accident  they inquired about his progress with rather forced courtesy and then one of them said  we looked in on the doctor who wrote to us about your injury before we came here and he told us you were strong enough for a little quiet conversation  we havent appointed another director yet  then you had better do so herbert advised  you mean to stick to your withdrawal  youre the only person who can pull the company out of its difficulties  has it got into any difficulties herbert inquired  you see ive been compelled to give orders for all correspondence to be dealt with at the london office and im advised not to read the financial papers or anything that might have a disturbing effect  the man who had not yet spoken betrayed some impatience  were up to the eyes in trouble as you must have guessed  have you asked yourself what the body of the shareholders are likely to think  its fairly obvious  theyll consider it a misfortune that i was knocked over shortly before a critical time possibly theyll attribute everything unsatisfactory in the companys affairs to my not being in charge  one of the visitors glanced meaningly at his companion  there was truth in what lansing said  the angry shareholders would not discriminate carefully they would blame the present directors who would have to face a serious loss while lansing had made a profit  it was a galling situation and what made it worse was that lansings expression hinted that he found it somewhat humorous  the fact that you sold out so soon before the fall will have its significance said the first man  the thing has a suspicious look  i must risk a certain amount of misconception herbert replied languidly  i may as well point out that i still hold the shares required as a directors qualification which is all it was necessary for me to do  was it your intention to keep the stock you hold permanently  they could not answer him and he smiled  as a matter of fact we all intended to sell off a good portion as soon as the premium justified it the only difference of opinion was about the point it must reach and that of course was a matter of temperament  well i was lucky enough to get rid of part of my stock at a profit and there was nothing to prevent your doing the same instead of that you held on until the drop came it was an imprudence for which you cant blame me  our complaint is that you foresaw the fall and never said a word  granted  why didnt you foresee it  you had the right of access to all the information in my hands you could inspect accounts in the london office i suppose you read the financial papers  it would have been presumptuous if id recommended you to sell and my forecast might have proved incorrect  in that case you would have blamed me for losing your money  this was incontestable  though they knew he had betrayed them lansings position was too strong to be assailed  you might have mentioned that you contemplated retiring from the board one remarked  then we would have known what to expect  a little reflection will show the futility of your suggestion  how could i contemplate being run over by a motorcar  well said the second man in a grim tone you cant deny the accident was in some respects a fortunate one for you  im doubtful whether you would have appreciated it in my place  but you dont seem to realize that im withdrawing from the board because im incapacitated for the duties  then the nurse to whom herbert had given a hint came in and he made a sign of resignation quite as though overpowered by regret  im sorry im not allowed to talk very much yet  will you have a cigar and some refreshment before you leave  his visitors rose and one of them turned to him with a curious expression  no thanks he said pointedly  considering everything i dont think well give you the trouble  with a few conventional words they withdrew and herbert smiled at the nurse  i believe dr ballin was most concerned about the injury to my nerves he said  have you noticed anything wrong with them  not lately  they seem to be in a normal state  that said herbert is my own opinion  you wouldnt imagine that i had just finished a rather trying interview  no you look more amused than upset  there was something humorous in the situation thats often the case when you see greedy people wasting effort and ingenuity  perhaps you heard my visitors expressing their anxiety about my health though ive a suspicion that they felt more like wishing the car had made an end of me  the nurse laughed and told him that he had better rest and herbert lay back upon the cushions she arranged with calm content  during the evening sylvia entered the room dressed a little more carefully than usual and herbert glanced at her with appreciation  you look charming though thats your normal state he said  where are you going  with muriel to dine with the wests have you forgotten  but i came in because muriel told me you had a letter from george by the last post  so youre still interested in his doings herbert rejoined  of course  does that surprise you  i was beginning to think there was some risk of your forgetting him which perhaps wouldnt be altogether unnatural  hes a long way off which has often its effect and theres no denying the fact that in many respects you and he are different  doesnt the same thing apply to you and muriel  everybody knows you get on excellently in spite of it  herbert laughed  he was aware that his friends had wondered why he had married muriel and suspected that some of them believed her money had tempted him  nevertheless he made her an affectionate as well as a considerate husband  in business matters he practised the easy morality of a hungry beast of prey but he had his virtues  yes he said thats true  do you find it encouraging  sylvia had felt a little angry though she had known that it was seldom wise to provoke her host  without waiting for her answer he continued half seriously theres often one person who thinks better of us than we deserve and i dare say im fortunate in that respect  in such a case one feels it an obligation not to abuse that persons confidence  a slight flush crept into sylvias face  george believed in her and she was very shabbily rewarding his trust  im surprised to hear you moralizing  its not a habit of yours she remarked  no said herbert pointedly though it may now and then make one feel a little uncomfortable it seldom does much good  but we were talking about george  he tells me that winters beginning unusually soon theyve had what he calls a severe cold snap and the prairies deep with snow  he bought some more stock and young horses as an offset to the bad harvest and hes doubtful whether he has put up hay enough  west and he are busy hauling stovewood home from a bluff and he has had a little trouble with some shady characters as a result of his taking part in a temperance campaign  i think thats all he has to say  sylvia broke into halfincredulous merriment  its hard to imagine george as a temperance reformer  think of him making speeches  speeches arent much in georges line herbert admitted  still in one way i wasnt greatly astonished at the news  hes just the man to be drawn into difficulties he might avoid provided that somebody could convince him the thing needed doing  then you think he has been convinced  i can hardly imagine georges setting out on a work of the kind he mentioned without some persuasion said herbert with a smile  the subjects not one he ever took much interest in and hes by no means original  sylvia agreed with him but she was silent a few moments reclining in an easy chair before the cheerful fire while she glanced round the room  it was comfortably furnished warm and brightly lighted a strong contrast to the lonely canadian homestead to which her thoughts wandered  she could recall the unpolished stove filling the place with its curious unpleasant smell and the icy draughts that eddied about it  she could imagine the swish of driving snow about the quivering wooden building when the dreaded blizzards raged the strange oppressive silence when the prairie lay still in the grip of the arctic frost and george coming in with halffrozen limbs and snowdust on his furs to spend the dreary evening in trying to keep warm  the picture her memory painted was vivid and it had a disturbing effect  it was in her service that the man was toiling in western canada  well she said rising with some abruptness its time we got off id better see if muriel is ready     chapter xviii  bland makes a sacrifice  sylvia was sitting by the hearth in ethel wests drawingroom her neatly shod feet on the fender her low chair on the fleecy rug and she made a very dainty and attractive picture  she felt the cold and hated discomfort of any kind though it was characteristic of her that she generally succeeded in avoiding it  ethel sat near by watching her with calmly curious eyes for sylvia was looking pensive  mrs lansing was talking to stephen west on the opposite side of the large room  how is edgar getting on sylvia asked  i suppose you hear from him now and then  ethel guessed where the question led and responded with blunt directness  doesnt george write to you  not often  herbert has just got a letter but there was very little information in it george is not a brilliant correspondent  i thought edgar might have written by the same mail  as it happens he did said ethel  he describes the cold as fierce and gives some interesting details of his sensations when the warmth first comes back to his halffrozen hands or limbs then he adds a vivid account of a blizzard that george and he nearly got lost in  things of that kind make an impression on a newcomer sylvia languidly remarked  one gets used to them after a while  did he say anything else  there was an enthusiastic description of a girl he has met he declares shes a paragon  this of course is nothing new but its a little astonishing that he doesnt seem to contemplate making love to her in his usual haphazard manner  she seems to have inspired him with genuine respect  i cant think of any girl whos likely to do so  he gives her nameflora grant  sylvia betrayed some interest  i knew heri suppose she is a little less impossible than the rest but go on  one gathers that george is having an anxious time edgar goes into some obscure details about crops and cattleraising  then he hints at some exciting adventures they have had as a result of supporting a body thats trying to close the hotels  this was what sylvia had been leading up to  she agreed with herbert that it was most unlikely george would take any part in such proceedings without some prompting and she was curious to learn who had influenced him  there was a word or two in herberts letter to the same effect she said  the thing strikes one as amusing  george of course does not explain why he joined these people  a smile of rather malicious satisfaction crept into ethels eyes according to edgar it was because his neighbors the grants urged it  the father of the girl he mentioned seems to be a leader in the movement  sylvia carefully suppressed any sign of the annoyance she felt  it was of course impossible that george should be seriously attracted by flora but his action implied that he and the grants must be good friends  no doubt he met the girl every now and then and they had much in common  sylvia did not mean to marry george but it was pleasant to feel that she could count on his devotion and she resented the idea of his falling under the influence of anybody else  she had never thought of flora as dangerousgeorge was so steadfastbut she now realized that there might perhaps be some slight risk  a girl situated as flora was would no doubt make the most of her opportunities  sylvia grew somewhat angry she felt she was being badly treated  after all she said calmly i suppose theres no reason why george shouldnt set up as a reformer if it pleases him  it must however be rather a novelty for your brother  ethel laughed  i believe its the excitement that has tempted him still if george is taking any active part in the matter edgar will probably find it more than a light diversion  then she changed the subject  did i tell you that we expect captain bland tonight  sylvia started slightly  she was aware that ethel took what could best be described as an unsympathetic interest in her affairs but the sudden reference to bland threw her off her guard  no she said  though you have met him i didnt think you knew him well  i believe its chiefly a business visit  stephen you know has some reputation as a commercial lawyer and bland couldnt arrange to see him in town  anyway he should be here soon  bland arrived half an hour later but was unable to do more than shake hands with sylvia before west took him away to another room  it was some time before they returned and then west kept the party engaged in general conversation until it broke up  ill walk down the road with you he said to mrs lansing and afterward turned to bland  how are you going to get back  bland said that the man who had driven him from the station was waiting in the neighboring village and when they left the house he walked on with sylvia leaving mrs lansing and west to follow  it was a clear night with a chill of frost in the air  a bright halfmoon hung above the shadowy hills and the higher boughs of the bare trees cut in sharp tracery against the sky  dead leaves lay thick upon the road and here and there a belt of mist trailed across a meadow  sylvia however did not respond when her companion said something about the charm of the walk  why didnt you send me word you were coming she asked  i didnt know until this morning when i got a note from west and i must be back in time for tomorrows parade  besides you told me at the junction that i was not to be allowed to meet you again for some time  sylvia smiled at him  havent you found out that you neednt take everything i say too literally  bland stopped pressing the hand on his arm  does that apply to all you said on the evening when we sat outside the inn  no answered sylvia firmly  it does not please understand that  i must stick to what i told you then  she paused and they heard the soft fall of approaching feet before she resumed with a laugh go on if you dont want the others to think we are waiting for them  bland obeyed a little soothed though he saw she was not yet ready to allow a renewal of his pleading  sylvia had obviously meant that she wished to be left alone with him  why did you call on stephen west she asked presently  id meant to tell you  but first of all is lansing still connected with the rubber company  west didnt seem very well informed upon the point  neither am i replied sylvia thoughtfully  i only know he hasnt the large interest in it that he had  then ill have to explain because i dont know what to do  lansing gave me a tip to buy some shares and when some friends said id got a good thing i went to him again  i must say he was pretty guarded but i got a hint and acted on it with the result that i have dropped a good deal of money  this he added deprecatingly is not the kind of thing i should talk to you about but i was told that lansing couldnt receive any callers and youll see why you should know  im beginning to understand  well said bland shortly after lansings accident i wrote to the secretary asking some questions and he doesnt seem to have been cautious enough in his answeri have it here  there has been trouble about the company and i attended a meeting of some disgusted people who had put their money into it  they think they might get part of it back by attacking the promoters and im told that my letter would help them materially  do you want to help them  in a way its natural said bland with signs of warmth  i dont see why those fellows should be allowed to get off after tricking people out of the money theyve painfully earned  how much money have you ever earned  bland laughed  you have me there i havent been able to buy shares out of my pay but i made a pot by taking long chances when i backed an outside horse it comes to much the same thing  i dont think it does said sylvia with a smile  but it strikes me that your explanation isnt quite complete  i went to west instead of to another lawyer because i thought he would be acquainted with lansings present position but while he agreed that the letter might be valuable to the objectors he couldnt help me  the end of it is that i dont want to do anything that might hurt lansing  sylvia reflected  she hardly thought his loss would seriously embarrass bland she owed herbert something and might need his aid and she did not wish any discredit to be cast upon a connection of hers  well she said i believe herbert is still to some extent connected with the company he can hardly have withdrawn altogether  anyway he had a large interest in it and i think its management was in his hands  he might suffer so to speak retrospectively  yes said bland that didnt strike me  youre right theres only one course open  he took a paper from his pocket and handed it to her  give that to lansing and tell him he may do what he thinks fit with it  youre very generous said sylvia coloring as she took the letter  im afraid ive behaved badly in not keeping the thing from you but you see how i was situated and youll have to forgive me  that isnt difficult sylvia told him  they walked on in silence for a while and then bland looked around at her  theres a thing i must mention  ive had a hint to ask for a certain post abroad  it is not a very desirable one in some respects but the pays pretty good and it would bring the man who took it under the notice of people who arrange the better government appointments  i should have to stay out at least two years  sylvia was startled and annoyed  now that the man owned her sway she did not mean to accede to his wishes too readily  some obscure reason made her shrink from definitely binding herself to him but his intimation had forced on something of the nature of a crisis  do you wish to go she asked  no he said hotly you know that  then said sylvia softly i think you had better stay at home  he stopped again and faced her  you must tell me what you mean  it ought to be clear she murmured dont you think i should miss you  with restrained quietness he laid his hand on her shoulder  you must listen for a minute sylvia  up to the present ive been passed over by the authorities but now ive been given my chance  if i can hammer the raw native levies into shape and keep order along a disturbed frontier it will lead to something better  now im neither a military genius nor altogether a careless idleri believe i can do this work but coming rather late it has less attraction for me well i would let the chance slip for one reason only but if im to go on continually repressing myself and only allowed to see you at long intervals i might as well go away  you must clearly understand on what terms i remain  she made a little appealing gesture  yes she said but you must wait and not press me too hard  i am so fenced in by conventions so many peoples susceptibilities have to be considered  i havent a girls liberty  bland supposed this was as far as she ventured in allusion to her widowed state but stirred as he was by her implied submission it struck him as significant that she should so clearly recognize the restrictions conventionality imposed on her  i think he returned the two people who deserve most consideration are you and myself  ah said sylvia you deserve it most  you have been very forbearing you have done all i asked  that is why i know you will bear with a little delay when its needful  he made a sign of reluctant assent and then to his annoyance two figures emerged from the shadow of the trees not far away  there was nothing to do except to move on but he thrilled at the slight grateful pressure of sylvias hand upon his arm  my dear he said i wish most devoutly that west or mrs lansing had been lame  sylvia broke into a ripple of laughter which somehow seemed to draw them closer  at herberts gate they separated and bland walked on in an exultant mood which was broken by fits of thoughtfulness  sylvia had tacitly pledged herself to him but he was still her unacknowledged lover and the position was irksome  then he remembered her collectedness which had been rather marked but he had learned that emotion is more frequently concealed than forcibly expressed moreover he had never imagined that sylvia was wholly free from faults he suspected that there was a vein of calculating coldness in her though it caused him no concern  bland was a man of experience who had acquired a goodhumored toleration with the knowledge that one must not expect too much from human nature  while bland was being driven to the station sylvia entered the room where herbert lay and handed him the letter  captain bland came in during the evening to see stephen and sent you this she said  he told me you were to do what you thought fit with it  herbert perused the letter and then reaching out with some difficulty flung it into the fire  ive taken him at his word he said  have you read the thing  no i fear the details would have puzzled me but i understand its general import  how was it your secretary was so careless  herbert smiled  the mans smart enough as a rule but we all have our weak moments this however is not the kind of thing thats likely to lead to his advancement  he lay quiet for a moment or two and then went on im grateful to you  had you much trouble in persuading bland to let you have the letter  no he offered it voluntarily  then the man must have been desperately anxious to please you  it looks as if his condition were getting serious  i resent coarseness exclaimed sylvia  herbert laughed  oh he said you and i can face the truth  as wests a lawyer blands visit to him is of course significant the man knew that letter might have been worth something in hard cash to him as well as affording him the satisfaction of making things hot for the directors of the company among whom i was included  he would hardly have parted with it unless he had a strong inducement  his motives dont concern you retorted sylvia  you ought to appreciate his action  i appreciate it as sincerely as i do yours because you must have shown that you didnt want him to use the letter though im inclined to think your motives were rather mixed one could scarcely expect them all to be purely benevolent  sylvia smiled  he was keenwitted and she found something amusing in the ironical goodhumor which often characterized him  anyhow he continued youre a staunch and capable ally and as that gives you a claim on me you wont find me reluctant to do my part whenever the time comes  then mrs lansing came in and on the whole sylvia was glad of the interruption  herberts remarks were now and then unpleasantly suggestive  he had called her his ally but she felt more like his accomplice which was much less flattering     chapter xix  an opposition move  it was a wet and chilly night and singleton sat in an easy chair beside the hearth in his city quarters with an old pipe in his hand the room was shabbily furnished the hearthrug had a hole in it the carpet was threadbare and singletons attire harmonized with his surroundings though the box of cigars and one or two bottles and siphons on the table suggested that he expected visitors  the loose tuxedo jacket he had bought in america was marked by discolored patches his carpet slippers were dilapidated  his means though long restricted would have warranted better accommodations but his clothes were comfortable and he did not think it worth while to put on anything smarter  there was a vein of rather bitter pride in the man and he would not out of deference to any other persons views alter conditions that suited him  a notebook lay beside him and several bulky treatises on botany were scattered about but he had ceased work and was thinking  after the shadow and silence of the tropical bush to which he was most accustomed the rattle of the traffic in the wet street below was stimulating but his reflections were not pleasant  he had waited patiently for another invitation to lansings house which had not arrived and a day or two ago he had met sylvia marston upon whom his mind had steadily dwelt in a busy street  she had bowed to him courteously but she had made it clear that she did not expect him to stop and speak  it had been a bitter moment to singleton but he had calmly faced the truth  he had served his purpose and he had been dropped  now however a letter from one of the people he was expecting indicated that he might again be drawn into the rubberexploiting scheme  the two gentlemen who had called on herbert were shown in presently  it was i who wrote you the first of them said this is my colleague mr nevis  singleton bowed  will you take that chair mr jackson  he turned to the other man i think you had better have this one its comparatively sound  he was aware that they were looking about his apartment curiously and no doubt inferring something from its condition but this was of no consequence  he had learned his value and meant to insist on it without the assistance of any signs of prosperity  i couldnt get up to town as you suggested he resumed when they were seated  ive been rather busy of late  thats generally the case with us jackson said pointedly  he was a thin man very neatly and quietly dressed with a solemn face and an air of importance  nevis was stouter and more florid with a brisker manner but the stamp of the city was plainly set on both  well said singleton im at your service now youre here  the cigars are nearest you mr nevis and i can recommend the contents of the smaller bottle  its a southern speciality and rather difficult to get in england  nevis hesitated  he thought it better that the interview should be conducted on strictly business lines while to accept the proffered hospitality would tend to place him and the man he wished to deal with on a footing of social equality  but it was desirable not to offend singleton and he lighted a cigar  to begin with i must ask if you are still in any way connected with mr lansing he said  no answered singleton with some grimness  you can take it for granted that he has done with me  that clears the ground  we have been considering the report you wrote for him  in our opinion it was while not encouraging hardly sufficient to warrant his abandoning the project in which as you have been told we were associated with him  he may have had other motives singleton suggested  nevis nodded gravely as if in appreciation of his keenness  that he said is what occurred to us  but what is your idea of the scheme  its clearly stated in the report  jackson made a sign of impatience  well leave the report out and come to the point  can the rubber which you say is really to be found be collected and brought down to the coast without incurring a prohibitive expense  yes said singleton  but you must understand me  the methods generally adopted in such cases would be bound to fail  you would require an overseer with rather exceptional technical knowledge who must besides this be quite free from the usual prejudices on the native question  they would no doubt be a little difficult to avoid since at first he would have to put up with a few attempts upon his life but if he could combine resolution and strict justice with a conciliatory attitude the attempt would cease and i think he could earn you a fair return on a moderate outlay  jackson laughed  so far as my experience goes such men are scarce  but id better say that we had you in mind when we made this visit  do you think you could do anything if we sent you out  yes said singleton quietly i believe i could make the venture pay whether id think it worth while is another matter  then nevis interposed its simply a question of terms  oh no  you may be surprised to hear that payment is not the first consideration though its true  im interested in certain investigations which can be carried out only in the tropics  however youd better make your offer  nevis did so and singleton pondered for a few moments  the remuneration might suffice provided that i was given a percentage on the product and one or two special allowances but before going any farther i must understand your intentions  im a botanist and have no wish to be made use of merely for the purpose of furthering some stockjobbing scheme  do you really want this venture put upon a satisfactory working footing  ill explain said nevis  the fact is lansing let us in rather badly  we spent a good deal of money over this concession and were anxious to get it back  since we cant float the thing on the market at present we have formed a small private syndicate to develop the property though we may sell out in a year or two if you can make the undertaking commercially successful  i think you could count on the purchasers continuing operations  have you considered what lansings attitude may be  it wont matter  he has gone out of the business convinced that the things no good he cleared off most of his rubber shares for a similar reason  this raises another pointthe original companys possessions lie in the same region though ruled by another state and things are going badly there  if you could get across and see what could be done we would pay an extra fee  singleton lighted a cigar and leaned back in his chair with a thoughtful expression and for a minute or two they left him alone they were keen business men but they knew that their usual methods would not serve them with this shabbilydressed selfpossessed botanist  well he said at length your suggestion rather appeals to me but theres the difficulty that another matter claims my attention  though it isnt strictly in my line ive been asked to go out to canada and assist in the production of a variety of wheat that will ripen quickly in fact i was looking up some information bearing on the matter when you came in  its a remarkably interesting subject  they were clever enough to see that this was not an attempt to enhance the value of his services the man was obviously a botanical enthusiast and nevis showed signs of attention  he had once or twice thought that something might be made out of canadian land companies  one could imagine that he said  i understand that its a matter of high importance  the development of the whole northern portion of the prairie country depends on the success of the experiments that are being made singleton went on  their summers are hot but short if they can get a grain that ripens early they can cultivate vast stretches of land that are now from economic reasons uninhabitable and it would make farming a more prosperous business in other tracts  crops growing in the favored parts are occasionally frozen  its a coincidence that a day or two ago i got a letter inquiring about that kind of wheat from a friend in canada who is as it happens farming with a cousin of lansings  then he laughed  all this however has nothing to do with the object of your visit  give me a few more minutes to think it over  there was silence except for the rattle of wheels outside while he smoked half a cigar then he turned to his companions  ill go out and undertake your work  i believe youre acting wisely and that lansing will be sorry after a while that he threw away his interest in the scheme  they discussed the details of the project and then the business men went away satisfied  shortly afterward singleton took a letter out of a paper rack and when he had read it he leaned back in his chair lost in pleasant recollections  some years earlier he had by chance fallen in with a lad named west when fishing among the scottish hills  the young mans sister and elder brother were staying with him at the remote hotel in which singleton had quarters and somewhat to his astonishment they soon made friends with him  poverty had made him reserved he knew that he was a little awkward and unpolished but the wests had not attempted to patronize him  their cordiality set him at his ease he liked the careless goodhumored lad ethel west graveeyed direct and candid made a strong impression and he had been drawn to the quiet lawyer who was much older than either  they spent delightful days together on the lake and among the hills singleton told them something about his studies and ambitions and in the evenings they persuaded him to sing  ethel was a musician and singleton sang well  on leaving they had invited him to visit them but partly from diffidence singleton had not gone though he knew these were not the people who took a man up when he could be of service and afterward dropped him  now he had received a letter from edgar west saying that he was farming in western canada and inquiring if singleton could tell him anything about the droughtresisting and quickripening properties of certain varieties of wheat  the botanist was glad to place his knowledge at his friends disposal and taking up pen and paper he spent an hour on a treatise on the subject which was to save lansing expense and trouble and bring singleton further communications from edgar  then he smoked another pipe and went to bed and a fortnight later he sailed for the tropics  shortly after he had gone herbert heard of his departure and the letter containing the news arrived on a cheerless afternoon during which his doctor had visited him  after the doctor left herbert entered the room where his wife and sylvia were and took his place in an easy chair by a window  outside the lawn was covered with halfmelted snow and the trees raised naked dripping branches above the drooping shrubs  farther back the hedgerows ran somberly across the white fields and in the distance the hills loomed desolate and gray against a leaden sky  ballin says id better take it easy for some time yet herbert informed his wife  in fact he recommends a trip abroad algiers or egypt for preference  he indicated the dreary prospect outside the window  though he didnt actually insist on my going the ideas attractive  could you leave your business mrs lansing inquired  herbert smiled  yes i think so  i was doing pretty well when i got run over and things have since slackened down  my manager can look after them while i am away  this was correct so far as it went but he had another reason for deciding not to resume operations for a while  he suspected that his recent conduct had excited distrust and indignation in certain quarters but this would no doubt blow over before his return people forgot and he could avoid those whose confidence in him had proved expensive  if thats the case we may as well get off as soon as it can be arranged said mrs lansing  she turned to sylvia  of course you will come with us  sylvia hesitated  she believed her influence over bland would not weaken much in her absence but after all it was wiser to run no risk  moreover she would to some extent feel her separation from the man  i really dont know what i ought to do she answered  i might be a restraint upon youyou cant want me always at hand and i could spend a month or two with dorothy  she has several times told me to come  you would be better with us mrs lansing rejoined with firmness and sylvia suspected her of a wish to prevent her enjoying blands society  ill think it over she said  after they had discussed the projected journey mrs lansing withdrew on some domestic errand and herbert turned to sylvia  i neednt point out that youll be no trouble to us but perhaps id better mention that i had a letter from george this post  as theres very little to be done until the spring he thinks of coming over  i dont know how far that may affect your decision  sylvia was a little startled but she reflected rapidly  the house of the relative she had thought of visiting would be open to george as would be one or two others in which she might stay a while  it was most undesirable that he should encounter bland which would be likely to happen  then it struck her that herbert might derive as little satisfaction from his cousins visit as it would afford her  have you succeeded in selling georges shares yet she asked and though this was on the face of it an abrupt change of subject she thought herbert would follow the sequence of ideas  no he answered with a smile of comprehension  it was too late when i was able to attend to things they have dropped to such a price that ill have to keep them  im afraid it will be a blow to george and hes having trouble enough already with your farm but luckily some other shares i bought on his account show signs of a marked improvement before long  sylvia inferred from this that he had not informed his cousin of the state of his affairs and did not wish to see him until the improvement mentioned or some other favorable development should mitigate the shock of discovering what use herbert had made of his powers  it was clear that it rested with her to decide whether george made the visit or not because if she went to egypt he would remain in canada  but she was not quite ready to give her companion an answer  did i tell you that i met singleton a little while ago she said  i think he wished to speak but i merely bowed  i was in a hurry for one thing  its the first ive heard of it but you did quite right  since he was here one or two of the other directors who tried to give me some trouble have got hold of him  they have sent him out to see what can be done with the rubber property  was that worth while  i shouldnt think so  it strikes me theyre wasting their money  this was herberts firm belief but his judgment while generally accurate had in this instance proved defective  he had failed properly to estimate singletons capabilities  it was however obvious to sylvia that he had had no part in the undertaking and had abandoned his rubber schemes which implied that georges loss would be serious  there was no doubt that it would suit both herbert and herself better if george did not come back too soon  well she said that is not a matter of any consequence to me after all i think ill go south with you and muriel  herbert had foreseen this decision  its the most suitable arrangement he responded  when i write ill mention it to george  sylvia went out a little later with a sense of guilt she felt that in removing the strongest inducement for georges visit she had betrayed him  she was sorry for george but she could not allow any consideration for him to interfere with her ambitions  then she resolutely drove these thoughts away  the matter could be looked at in a more pleasant light and there were several good reasons for the course she had adopted  entering the library she carefully wrote a little note to captain bland and then went in search of mrs lansing  i think ill go over to susans for the weekend she announced  i promised her another visit and now i can explain that im going away with you  mrs lansing made no objection and three or four days afterward sylvia met bland at mrs ketterings house  he arrived after her and as there were other guests she had to wait a little while before she could get a word with him alone  she was standing in the big hall which was unoccupied rather late in the evening when he came toward her  i thought i should never escape from kettering but hes safe for a while talking guns in the smokingroom he said  sylvia thought that they would be safe from interruption for a few minutes which would serve her purpose  so you have managed to get here she said  had you any doubt of my succeeding bland asked reproachfully kettering once gave me a standing invitation and as it happens theres a famous horse dealer in this neighborhood with whom ive had some business  that and the few sunday trains formed a good excuse i however dont mind in the least if mrs kettering attaches any significance to the visit  sylvia did not wish to arouse the suspicions of her hostess but she smiled  i expected you and im glad you came she said  thats very nice to hear  dont take too much for granted  still i thought id like to see you because im going to egypt with muriel for some time  indeed i shall not be back until the spring  the man displayed dismayed surprise and sylvia waited for his answer with some eagerness  she did not wish to enter into a formal engagementit was a little too early to make an announcement yetbut she thought it wise to bind him in some degree before she left  until the spring he broke out  you expect me to let you go  you must said sylvia firmly and added in a softer voice im rather sorry  he saw that he could not shake her decision  then we must have a clear understanding he rejoined hotly  you know i want youwhen is this waiting to end  tell me now and let me tell all who care to hear that you belong to me  sylvia made a gesture of protest and coquettishly looked down  you must still have patience she murmured the time will soon pass  and then he asked with eagerness  she glanced up at him shyly  if you will ask me again when i come back i will give you your answer  she left him no reason for doubting what that answer would be and stretching out his arms he drew her strongly to him  in a minute or two however sylvia insisted on his returning to his host and soon afterward mrs kettering came in to look for her     chapter xx  a blizzard  a bitter wind searched the poplar bluff where george and his hired man grierson were cutting fuel  except in the river valleys trees of any size are scarce on the prairie but the slender trunks and leafless branches were closely massed and afforded a little shelter  outside on the open waste the cold was almost too severe to face and george once or twice glanced anxiously across the snowy levels looking for some sign of edgar who should have joined them with the team and sledge it was however difficult to see far because a gray dimness narrowed in the horizon  george stood dressed in snowflecked furs in the center of a little clearing strewn with rows of fallen trunks from which he was hewing off the branches  the work was hard his whole body strained with each stroke of the heavy ax but it failed to keep him warm and the wind was growing more bitter with the approach of night  i dont know what can be keeping west he said after a while  we havent seen the mailcarrier either and hes two hours late but he must have had a heavy trail all the way from the settlement  i expect hell cut out our place and make straight for grants  well have snow before long  there was an empty shack not far away where by georges consent the mailcarrier left letters when bad weather made it desirable to shorten his round  grierson nodded as he glanced about  the stretch of desolate white prairie had contracted since he had last noticed it the surrounding dimness was creeping nearer in and the ranks of poplar trunks were losing their sharpness of form  now that the men had ceased chopping they could hear the eerie moaning of the wind and the sharp patter of icy snowdust among the withered brush  it will take him all his time to fetch grants i wish mr west would come before it gets dark grierson said with a shiver and fell to work again  several minutes passed  george was thinking more about the mailcarriers movements than about edgars  the english letters should have arrived and he was anxiously wondering if there were any for him  then as he stopped for breath a dim moving blur grew out of the prairie and he flung down his ax  heres west well have light enough to put up the load he said  a little later edgar led two powerful horses up the narrow trail and for a while the men worked hard stacking the logs upon the sledge then they set off at the best pace the team could make and the cold struck through them when they left the bluff  stinging isnt it edgar remarked  i couldnt get over earlier flett turned up half frozen and he kept me  seems to have some business in this neighborhood though he didnt say what it is  george walking through the snow to leeward of the loaded sledge where it was a little warmer betrayed no interest in the news  temperance reform was languishing at sage butte and its leaders had received a severe rebuff from the authorities  the police who had arrested an indian suspected of conveying liquor to the reservation had been no more successful for the man had been promptly acquitted  they had afterward been kept busy investigating the matter of the shooting of georges bull which had recovered but they had found no clue to the offender and nothing of importance had happened for some time  it had grown dark and the wind was rapidly increasing  powdery snow drove along before it obscuring the mens sight and lashing their tingling faces  at times the icy white haze whirled about them so thick that they could scarcely see the blurred dark shape of the sledge but as they had hauled a good many loads of stovewood home the trail was plainly marked  it would be difficult to lose it unless deep snow fell  with lowered heads and fur caps pulled well down they plodded on until at length george stopped where the shadowy mass of a bluff loomed up close in front of them  ill leave you here and make for the shack he said  i want to see if there are any letters  its far too risky edgar pointed out  youll get lost as soon as you leave the beaten trail  ill have the bluff for a guide and it isnt far from the end of it to the small ravine  after that i shouldnt have much trouble in striking the fallow  its doubtful edgar persisted  let the letters wait until tomorrow  no said george resolutely  ive waited a week already the mail is late  besides well have worse snow before morning  seeing that he had made up his mind edgar raised no more objections and in another few moments george disappeared into a haze of driving snow  when he left the trail he found walking more difficult than he had expected but though it was hard to see beyond a few yards he had the bluff to guide him and he kept along the edge of it until the trees vanished suddenly  then he stopped buffeted by the wind to gather breath and fix clearly in his mind the salient features of the open space that he must cross  if he could walk straight for half a mile he would strike a small hollow and by following it he would reach a tract of cultivated ground this he thought should be marked by the absence of the taller clumps of grass and the short willow scrub which here and there broke through the snow  there would then be a stretch of about two hundred acres to cross before he found the little shack whose owner had gone away to work on the railroad during the winter  he expected to have some trouble in reaching it but he must get the letters and he set off again breaking through the snowcrust in places and trying to estimate the time he took  a quarter of an hour passed and as there was no sign of the ravine he began to wonder whether he had deviated much from his chosen line  in another few minutes he was getting anxious and then suddenly he plunged kneedeep into yielding snow  it got deeper at the next step and he knew that he had reached the shallow depression which had been almost filled up by the drifts  he must cross it and the effort this entailed left him gasping when he stopped again on the farther side  it was still possible to retrace his steps because he could hardly fail to strike the bluff he had left but there was no doubt that to go on would be perilous  if he missed the shack he might wander about the prairie until he sank down exhausted and after a day of fatiguing labor he knew that he could not long face the wind and frost  there was however every sign of a wild storm brewing it might be several days before he could secure the letters if he turned back and such a delay was not to be thought of  he went on following the ravine where he could trace its course which was not always possible until he decided that he must have reached the neighborhood of the farm  there was however nothing to indicate that he had done so  he could see only a few yards the snow had all been smooth and unbroken near the hollow he could distinguish no difference between any one part of it and the rest and he recognized the risk he took when he turned his back on his last guide and struggled forward into the waste  walking became more difficult the wind was getting stronger and there was no sign of the shack  perhaps he had gone too far to the south he inclined to the right but that brought him to nothing that might serve as a guide there was only smooth snow and the white haze whirling round him  he turned more to the right growing desperately afraid stopped once or twice to ascertain by the way the snow drove past whether he was wandering from his course and plodded on again savagely  at last something began to crackle beneath his feet stooping down he saw that it was stubble and he became sensible of a vast relief  he could not be more than a few minutes walk from the shack  it was only three or four yards off when he saw it and on entering he had difficulty in closing the rickety door  then when he had taken off his heavy mittens it cost him some trouble to find and strike a match with his halffrozen hands  holding up the light he glanced eagerly at a shelf and saw the two letters he had expected there was no mistaking the writing and the english stamps  he thrust them safely into a pocket beneath his furs when the match went out and struck another for his next step required consideration  the feeble radiance traveled round the little room showing the rent board walls and the beams rough from the saw that supported the cedar roofing shingles  a little snow had sifted in and lay on the floor there was a rusty stove at one end but no lamp or fuel and the hay and blankets had been removed from the wooden bunk  still as george was warmly clad and had space to move about he could pass the night there  the roar of the wind about the frail building rendered the prospects of the return journey strongly discouraging  he might however be detained all the next day by the snow but what chiefly urged him to face the risk of starting for the homestead was his inability to read his letters  the sight of them had sent a thrill through him which had banished all sense of the stinging cold  he had eagerly looked forward to a brief visit to the old country and sylvia had no doubt bidden him come  it was delightful to picture her welcome and the evenings they would spend in muriel lansings pretty drawingroom while he told her what he had done and unfolded his plans for the future  he could brook no avoidable delay in reading her message and nerving himself for a struggle he set out again  the shack vanished the moment he left it  the snow was thicker and floundering heavily through the storm george had almost given up the attempt to find the ravine when he fell violently into a clearer part of it  then he gathered courage for the bluff was large and would be difficult to miss but it did not appear when he expected it  he was breathless nearly blinded and on the verge of exhaustion when he crashed into a dwarf birch and looking up half dazed saw an indistinct mass of larger trees  he had now a guide but it was hard to follow with his strength fast falling and the savage wind buffeting him  he had stopped a moment gasping when something emerged from the driving snow  it was moving it looked like a team with a sledge or wagon and he thought that his companions had come in search of him he cried out but there was no answer and though he tried to run the beasts vanished as strangely as they had appeared  they had however left their tracks coming up from the south where the settlement lay and this convinced him that they had not been driven by edgar or grierson  he made an attempt to overtake them and falling went on again wondering a little who the strangers could be though this was not a matter of much consequence  if they had blankets or drivingrobes they might pass the night without freezing in the bluff where there was fuel but george was most clearly conscious of the urgent need for his reaching the homestead before his strength gave out  at last he struck the beaten trail which had fortunately not yet been drifted up and after keeping to it for a while he saw a faint twinkle of light in front of him  a voice answered his shout and when he stopped keeping on his feet with difficulty and utterly worn out a team came up blurred and indistinct out of the driving snow  after that somebody seized him and pushed him toward an empty sledge  get down out of the wind heres the fur robe cried a voice he recognized  we came back as soon as we had thrown off the load  george remembered very little about the remainder of the journey but at last the sledge stopped where a warm glow of light shone out into the snow  getting up with some trouble he reached the homestead door and walked heavily into the room where he sank gasping into a chair he felt faint and dizzy he could scarcely breathe but those sensations grew less troublesome as he recovered from the violent change of temperature  throwing off his furs he noticed that flett sat smoking near the stove  heres some coffee said the constable  its pretty lucky grierson found you  i cant remember a worse night  george drank the coffee  he still felt heavy and partly dazed his mind was lethargic and his hands and feet tingled painfully with the returning warmth  he knew that there was something he ought to tell flett but it was a few minutes before he could think clearly  i met a team near the bluff and lost it again almost immediately he mumbled finally  fletts face became intent  did the men who were with it see you which way were they going  no said george sleepily  anyway though i called i didnt get an answer  i think they were going west  and theres no homestead for several leagues except langsides shack theyll camp there sure  i dont see why they shouldnt george remarked with languid indifference  hasnt it struck you why those fellows should be heading into waste prairie on a night like this  guess what theyve got in the wagons a good enough reason  if the snows not too bad theyll pull out for the indian reservation soon as its light tomorrow  you think they have liquor with them asked george  flett nodded and walked toward the door and george felt the sudden fall of temperature and heard the scream of the wind  in a minute or two however the constable reappeared with edgar  id get them sure theyre in the shack right now flett declared  you would never find it edgar remonstrated  we had hard enough work to strike the homestead and we were on a beaten trail which will have drifted up since then  youll have to drop the ideaits quite impossible  its blamed hard luck grumbled flett  i may trail the fellows but i certainly wont get them with the liquor right in the wagon as it will be now and without something of that kind its mighty hard to secure a conviction  ive no use for the average jury what we want is power to drop on to a man without any fuss or fooling and fix him so he wont make more trouble  its fortunate youll never get it edgar remarked  ive a notion it would be a dangerous thing to trust even a northwest policeman with youre not all quite perfect yet  then george recovering from his lethargy remembered the letters and eagerly opened the one from sylvia  it consisted of a few sentences in which she carelessly told him that if he came over he would not see her as she was going to egypt with herbert and muriel  the hint of regret that her journey could not be put off looked merely conventional but she said he might make his visit in the early summer as she would have returned by then  georges face hardened as he read it for the disappointment was severe  he thought that sylvia might have remembered that he could not leave the farm after spring had begun  the man felt wounded and for once inclined to bitterness  his optimistic faith which idealized its object was bound to bring him suffering when dispelled by disillusion offering sincere homage to all that seemed most worthy he had not learned tolerance  though his appreciation was quick and generous he must believe in what he admired and it was perhaps a misfortune that he was unable to recognize shortcomings with cynical goodhumor  he could distinguish white from blackthe one stood for spotless purity the other was very dark indeedbut his somewhat restricted vision took no account of the more common intermediate shades  for all that he was incapable of seriously blaming sylvia  her letter had hurt him but he began to make excuses for her and several that seemed satisfactory presented themselves then feeling a little comforted he opened the letter from herbert with some anxiety  when he read it he let it drop upon the table and set his lips tight  his cousin informed him that it would be most injudicious to raise any money just then by selling shares as he had been requested to do those he had bought on georges account had depreciated in an unexpected manner and the markets were stagnant  george he said must carry on his farming operations as economically as possible until the turn came  bad news said edgar sympathetically  yes  ill have to cut out several plans id made for spring in fact i dont quite see how im to go on working on a profitable scale well have to do without the extra bunch of stock i was calculating on and im not sure i can experiment with that quickripening wheat there are a number of other things well have to dispense with  well pull through by some means edgar rejoined encouragingly and george got up  i feel rather worn out he said  i think ill go to sleep  he walked wearily from the room crumpling up the letters he had risked his life to secure     chapter xxi  grant comes to the rescue  the storm had raged for twentyfour hours but it had now passed and it was a calm night when a little party sat in georges livingroom outside the white prairie lay still and silent under the arctic frost but there was no breath of wind stirring and the room was comfortably warm  a big stove glowed in the middle of it and the atmosphere was permeated with the smell of hot iron stale tobacco and the exudations from resinous boards  grant and his daughter had called when driving back from a distant farm and trooper flett had returned to the homestead after a futile search for the liquor smugglers  he was not characterized by mental brilliancy but his persevering patience atoned for that and his superior officers considered him a sound and useful man  sitting lazily in an easy chair after a long days ride in the nipping frost he discoursed upon the situation  things arent looking good he said  weve had two cases of cattlekilling in the last month besides some horses missing and a railroad contractor knocked senseless with an empty bottle and nobodys locked up yet  i dont think you have any reason to be proud of it edgar broke in  flett spread out his hands in expostulation  its not our fault  i could put my hands on half a dozen men whore at the bottom of the trouble but what would be the use of that when the blamed jury would certainly let them off  in a case of this kind our system of justice is mighty apt to break down  its a pet idea of mine  how would you propose to alter it edgar asked to lead him on  if we must have a jury id like to pick them and theyd be men whod lost some stock  you could depend on them  theres something to be said for that grant admitted with a dry smile  this is how were fixed flett went on  were up against a small but mighty smart hard crowd we know them all right but we cant get after them  you must make good all you say in court and we cant get folks to help us  theyd rather mind the store have a game of pool or chop their cordwood  i can think of a few exceptions edgar said  mrs nelson for example  one could hardly consider her apathetic  that womans dangerous  when we were working up things against beamish she must make him look like a persecuted victim  she goes too far the others wont go far enough  guess theyre afraid of getting hurt  you couldnt say that of mr hardie flora objected  no  but some of his people would like to fire him and hes going to have trouble about his pay  anyhow this state of things is pretty hard on us  theres no use in bringing a man up when youve only got unwilling witnesses  what you want is a dramatic conviction said edgar sympathetically  sure  its what were working for and wed get it if everybody backed us up as your partner and mr grant are doing  he turned to george  my coming back here is a little rough on you  george smiled  i dare say it will be understood by the opposition but i dont mind it looks as if i were a marked man already  a few minutes later flett went out to attend to his horse george took grant into a smaller room which he used for an office and edgar and flora were left alone  the girl sat beside the stove with a thoughtful air and edgar waited for her to speak  flora inspired him with an admiration which was largely tinged with respect though being critical he sometimes speculated about the cause for this  she was pretty but her style of beauty was rather severe  she had fine eyes and clearlycut features but her face was a little too reposeful and her expression usually somewhat grave he preferred animation and a dash of coquetry  her conversation was to the pointshe had a way of getting at the truth of a matterbut there was nevertheless a certain reserve in it and he thought it might have been more sparkling  he had discovered some time ago that adroit flattery and hints that his devotion was hers to command only afforded her calm amusement  mr lansing looks a little worried she said at length  it strikes me as only natural edgar replied he has had a steer killed since the rustlers shot the bull we have foiled one or two more attempts only by keeping a good lookout and he knows that he lies open to any new attack that may be made on him  his position isnt what you could call comfortable  i hardly think that would disturb your comrade very much  edgar saw that she would not be put off with an inadequate explanation and he was a little surprised that she did not seem to mind displaying her interest in george  then he said for another thing hes disappointed about having to give up an english visit he had looked forward to  he saw a gleam that suggested comprehension in her eyes  you mean that he is badly disappointed  yes said edgar i really think he is  he left her to make what she liked of this and he imagined that there was something to be inferred from it  he thought it might be wise to give her a hint that georges affections were already engaged  besides he resumed its no secret that the loss of his harvest hit him pretty hard  well have to curtail our spring operation in several ways and study economy  flora glanced toward the door of the room her father had entered with george  edgar thought she had done so unconsciously but it was somewhat suggestive though he could not see what it implied  well she said im inclined to believe that hell get over his difficulties  so am i edgar agreed  george isnt easy to defeat  in the meanwhile grant sat in the next room smoking thoughtfully and asking george rather direct questions about his farming  ive made some inquiries about that new wheat your english botanist friend reported on he said at length  our experimental farm people strongly recommend it and theres a man i wrote to who cant say enough in its favor  youll sow it this spring  im afraid ill have to stick to the common kinds george said gloomily  ive a pretty big acreage to crop and that special seed is remarkably dear  thats so grant agreed  as a matter of fact they havent quite made their arrangements for putting it on the market yet and the surest way to get some is to bid for a round lot  after what id heard i wired a winnipeg agent and he has promised to send me on what looks like more than i can use  now ill be glad to let you have as much as you want for your lightest land  george felt grateful  he did not think that this methodical man had made any careless mistake over his order but he hesitated  thanks he said  still it doesnt get over the main difficulty  i guess it does  you would have had to pay money down for the seed and ill be glad to let the thing stand over until you have thrashed out  the price doesnt count you can give me back as many bushels as you get  then said george with a slight flush youre more generous than wise  they havent produced a wheat yet that will stand drought and hail  suppose i have another year like last  im sorry i cant let you run this risk  well quit pretending  i owe a little to the country that has made me what i am and these new hardy wheats are going to play a big part in its development  i want to see them tried on the poorest land  thats a good reason  i believe it goes some way but i hardly think it accounts for everything  his companion looked at him with fixed directness  then if you must be satisfied youre my neighbor you have had blamed hard luck and i like the way youre standing up to it  if anybodys on meaner soil than yours i want to see it  anyway heres the seed take what you need pay me back when youre able  guess youre not too proud to take a favor thats gladly offered  id be a most ungrateful brute if i refused george replied with feeling  thats done with grant said firmly and soon afterward he and george returned to the other room  after a while he went out with edgar to look at a horse and george turned to flora  your father has taken a big weight off my mind and im afraid i hardly thanked him he said  then it was a relief she asked and it failed to strike him as curious that she seemed to know what he was alluding to  yes he declared i feel ever so much more confident now that i can get that seed  the fact that it was offered somehow encouraged me  you never expected anything of the kind  ive sometimes thought youre apt to stand too much alone  you dont attach enough importance to your friends  perhaps not admitted george  ive been very wrong in this instance but i suppose one naturally prefers to hide ones difficulties  i dont think the feelings universal  but you would no doubt be more inclined to help other people out of their troubles  george looked a little embarrassed and she changed the subject with a laugh  come and see us when you can find the time  on the last occasion you sent your partner over  id made an appointment with an implement man when i got your fathers note  anyway i should have fancied that edgar would have made a pretty good substitute  mr west is a favorite of ours hes amusing and excellent company as far as he goes  her tone conveyed a hint that edgar had his limitations and he was not an altogether satisfactory exchange for his partner but george laughed  he now and then goes farther than i would care to venture  flora looked at him with faint amusement  yes she said  thats one of the differences between you youre not assertive  it has struck me that you dont always realize your value  would you like one to insist on it  oh she said theres a happy medium but im getting rather personal and i hear the others coming  she drove away a little later and when flett had gone to bed george and edgar sat talking a while beside the stove  grants a staunch friend and im more impressed with flora every time i see her said the lad  shes pleasant to talk to she can harness and handle a team with any one but for all that you recognize a trace of what i can only call the grand manner in her  though i understand that she has been to the old country its rather hard to see how she got it  george signified agreement  miss grant was undoubtedly characterized by a certain grace and now and then by an elusive hint of stateliness it was a thing quite apart from selfassertion a gracious quality which he had hitherto noticed only in the bearing of a few elderly english ladies of station  i suppose you thanked her for that seed edgar resumed  i said i was grateful to her father  ive no doubt you took the trouble to mark the distinction  it might have been more considerate if you had divided your gratitude  what do you mean  its hardly likely that the idea of helping you in that particular way originated with alan grant though i shouldnt be surprised if he had been allowed to think it did  george looked surprised and edgar laughed  you neednt mind  its most improbable that miss grant either wished or expected you to understand  shes a very intelligent young lady  it strikes me that you talk too much george said severely  he went out feeling a little disturbed by what edgar had told him but unable to analyze his sensations  putting on his furs he proceeded to look around the stable as he had fallen into a habit of doing before he went to rest  there was a clear moon in the sky and although the black shadow of the buildings stretched out across the snow george on approaching one noticed a few footprints that led toward it  there were numerous other tracks about but he thought that those he was looking at had been made since he had last entered the house  this however did not surprise him for flett had recently visited the stable  on entering the building george stopped to feel for a lantern which was kept on a shelf near the door  the place was very dark and pleasantly warm by contrast with the bitter frost outside and he could smell the peppermint in the prairie hay  familiar sounds reached himthe soft rattle of a shaking rope the crackle of crushed strawbut they were rather more numerous than usual and while he listened one or two of the horses began to move restlessly  the lantern was not to be found george wondered whether flett had carelessly forgotten to replace it  he felt his way from stall to stall letting his hand fall on the hind quarters of the horses as he passed  they were all in their places including fletts gray which lashed out at him when he touched it there was nothing to excite suspicion but when he reached the end of the row he determined to strike a match and look for the lantern  he was some time feeling for the matchbox under his furs and while he did so he heard a soft rustling in the stall nearest the door  this was curious for the stall being a cold one was unoccupied and there was something significantly stealthy in the sound but it ceased and while he listened with strained attention a horse moved and snorted  then while he fumbled impatiently at a button of his skin coat which would not come loose an icy draught stole into the building  it was obvious that the door was open he had left it shut  breaking off his search for the matches he made toward the entrance and sprang out  there was nobody upon the moonlit snow and the shadows were hardly deep enough to conceal a lurking man  he ran toward the end of the rather long building but as it happened he had to make a round to avoid a stack of wood and a wagon on the way  when he turned the corner the other side of the stable was clear in the moonlight and so far as he could see the snow about it was untrodden it looked as if he had made for the wrong end of the building and he retraced his steps toward a barn that stood near its opposite extremity  running around it he saw nobody nor any footprints that seemed to have been recently made and while he stood wondering what he should do next grierson appeared between him and the house  were you in the stables a minute or two ago george called to him  no said the other approaching  id just come out for some wood when i saw you run round the barn  george gave him a brief explanation and the man looked about  perhaps wed better search the buildings if there was any stranger prowling round he might have dodged you in the shadow  its hardly likely hed make for the prairie the first clump of brush big enough to hide a man is a quarter of a mile off  they set about the search but found nobody and george stopped outside the last building with a puzzled frown on his face  its very strange he said  i left the door shut i couldnt be mistaken  look cried grierson clutching his arm  theres no mistaking about that  turning sharply george saw a dim mounted figure cross the crest of a low rise some distance away and vanish beyond it  the fellow must have run straight for the poplar scrub keeping the house between you and him grierson explained  hed have left his horse among the brush  i suppose that was it george said angrily  as theres no chance of overtaking him well have a look at the horses with a light and then let flett know  there was nothing wrong in the stable where they found the lantern george had looked for flung down in the empty stall and in a very short space of time after they had called him flett appeared  he walked round the buildings and examined some of the footprints with a light and then he turned to george  looks like an indian by his stride he said  guess ill have to saddle up and start  you could hardly come up with the fellow hell have struck into one of the beaten trails so as to leave no tracks edgar pointed out  thats so said flett  i dont want to come up with him  it wouldnt be any use when your partner and grierson couldnt swear to the man  what could have been his object george asked  he seems to have done no harm  he wanted to see if my gray was still in the stable flett said dryly  his friends have some business theyd sooner i didnt butt into fixed up somewhere else  but you have no idea where  i havent thats the trouble  there are three or four different trails id like to watch and i quite expect to strike the wrong one then if the man knows you saw him he might take his friends warning to change their plans  all the same ill get off  he rode away shortly afterward and as the others went back toward the house edgar laughed  i dont think being a police trooper has many attractions in winter he remarked  hiding in a bluff for several hours with the temperature forty degrees below on the lookout for fellows who have probably gone another way strikes me as a very unpleasant occupation     chapter xxii  the spread of disorder  flett spent a bitter night keeping an unavailing watch among the willows where a lonely trail dipped into a ravine  not a sound broke the stillness of the white prairie and realizing that the men he wished to surprise had taken another path he left his hidingplace shortly before daylight  he was almost too cold and stiff to mount but as his hands and feet tingled painfully it was evident that they had escaped frostbite and that was something to be thankful for  reaching an outlying farm he breakfasted and rested a while after which he rode on to the indian reservation where he found signs of recent trouble  a man to whom he was at first refused access lay with a badly battered face in a shack which stood beside a few acres of roughly broken land another man suffering from what looked like an ax wound sat huddled in dirty blankets in a teepee  it was obvious that a fight which flett suspected was the result of a drunken orgy had been in progress not long before but he could find no liquor nor any man actually under its influence though the appearance of several suggested that they were recovering from a debauch  he discovered however in a poplar thicket the hide of a steer from which a recent breeze had swept its covering of snow  this was a serious matter and though the brand had been removed flett identified the skin as having belonged to an animal reported to him as missing  he had now when dusk was approaching two charges of assault and one of cattlekilling to make and it would not be prudent to remain upon the reservation during the night with anybody he arrested  the indians were in a sullen threatening mood it was difficult to extract any information and flett was alone  he was however not to be daunted by angry looks or ominous mutterings and by persistently questioning the injured men he learned enough to warrant his making two arrests though he decided that the matter of the hide must be dropped for the present  it was in a state of nervous tension that he mounted and drove his prisoners on a few paces in front of him  if he could get them into the open he thought he would be safe but the reservation was for the most part a tract of brush and bluff pierced by ravines among which he half expected an attempt would be made to facilitate their escape for all that he was so far as appearances went very calm and grim when he set out and his prisoners being ahead did not notice that he searched each taller patch of brush they entered with apprehensive glances  nor did they see his hand drop to his pistolbutt when something moved in the bushes as they went down the side of a dark declivity  there was however no interference and he felt more confident when he rode out into the moonlight which flooded the glittering prairie  here he could deal with any unfavorable developments but it was several leagues to the nearest shelter and the indians did not seem inclined to travel fast  the halffrozen constable would gladly have walked only that he felt more master of the situation upon his horse  mile after mile they crossed the vast white waste without a word being spoken except when the shivering man sternly bade his prisoners get on  handcuffed as they were he dare not relax his vigilance nor let them fall back too near him and he had spent the previous night in the bitter frost  at times he felt painfully drowsy but he had learned to overcome most bodily weaknesses and his eyes only left the dark plodding figures in front of him when he swept a searching glance across the plain  nothing moved on it and only the soft crunch of snow broke the dreary silence  at last a cluster of low buildings rose out of the waste and soon afterward flett got down with difficulty and demanded shelter  the rudely awakened farmer gave him the use of his kitchen in which a stove was burning and while the indians went to sleep on the floor flett choosing an uncomfortable upright chair lighted his pipe and sat down to keep another vigil when dawn broke his eyes were still open though his face was a little haggard and very weary  he obtained a conviction for assault but as the charges of cattlekilling and being in possession of liquor had to be dropped this was small consolation  it left the men he considered responsible absolutely untouched  afterward he played a part in other somewhat similar affairs for offenses were rapidly becoming more numerous among both indians and mean whites but in spite of his efforts the gang he suspected managed to evade the grip of the law  flett however was far from despairing he waited his time and watched  while he did so spring came unusually early  a warm west wind swept the snow away and for a week or two the softened prairie was almost impassable to vehicles  then the wind veered to the northwest with bright sunshine the soil began to dry and george set out on a visit to brandon where he had some business to transact  reaching sage butte in the afternoon he found it suffering from the effects of the thaw  a swollen creek had converted the ground on one side of the track into a shallow lake the front street resembled a muskeg furrowed deep by sinking wheels  the vehicles outside the hotels were covered with sticky mire the high plank sidewalks were slippery with it and foot passengers when forced to leave them sank far up their long boots one or two of the stores were almost cut off by the pools  it rained between gleams of sunshine and masses of dark cloud rolled by above the dripping town and wet prairie which had turned a dingy gray  as he was proceeding along one sidewalk george met hardie and it struck him that the man was looking dejected and worn  will you come back with me and wait for supper he asked  id be glad of a talk  i think not said george  youre on the far side of the town and there are two streets to cross you see im going to brandon and ill take enough gumbo into the cars with me as it is  then my train leaves in half an hour  i suppose i mustnt ask you to come into the queens  no said the clergyman  our old guard wont tolerate the smallest compromise with the enemy and theres a good deal to be said for their point of view  after all halfmeasures have seldom much result a man must be one thing or another  but we might try the new waitingroom at the station  the little room proved to be dry and comparatively clean besides being furnished with nicely made and comfortable seats  leaning back in one near the stove george turned to his companion  how are things going round here he asked  very much as i expected we tried and failed to apply a check in time and of late we have had a regular outbreak of lawlessness  at first sight its curious considering that threefourths of the inhabitants of the district are steady industrious folk and a proportion of the rest are capable of being useful citizens  then how do you account for the disorder  hardie looked thoughtful  i suppose we all have a tendency to follow a lead which is often useful in an organized state of society though it depends on the lead by way of counterbalance we have a certain impatience of restraint granting this you can see that when the general tone of a place is one of sobriety and order people who have not much love for either find it more or less easy to conform  but if you set them a different example one that slackens restrictions instead of imposing them theyll follow it and it somehow seems to be the rule that the turbulent element exerts the stronger influence  anyway it becomes the more prominent  you hear of the fellow who steals a horse in a daring manner the man who quietly goes on with his plowing excites no notice  one must agree with that george replied  popular feelings fickle a constant standard is needed to adjust it by  hardie smiled  it was given us long ago  but i cant believe that theres much general sympathy with these troublesome fellows  what i complain of is popular apathy nobody feels it his business to interfere though this state of things cant continue  the patience of respectable people will wear out and then one can look for drastic developments  in the meanwhile the other crowd are having their fling  hardie nodded  thats unfortunately true though the lawbreakers have now and then come off secondbest  a few days ago wilkie the stationagent was sitting in his office when a man who had some grievance against the railroad walked up to the window  wilkie told him he must send his claim to winnipeg and the fellow retorted that he would have satisfaction right away out of the agents hide  with that he climbed in through the window and i must confess to a feeling of satisfaction when i heard that he left the station in need of medical assistance  a week earlier taunton of the store was walking home along the track in the dark after collecting some of his accounts when a man jumped out from behind a stock of ties with a pistol and demanded his wallet taunton taken by surprise produced a wad of bills but the thief was a little too eager or careless in seizing them for taunton grabbed the pistol and got his money back  after that he marched the man three miles along the track and into his store  i dont know what happened then but i heard that there were traces of a pretty lively scuffle  george laughed but his companion continued more gravely  then we have had a number of small disturbances when the men from the new link line came into towntheyve graded the track to within a few miles nowand i hold beamish responsible they havent encouraged these fellows at the queens  in fact i mean to walk over and try to get a few words with them as soon as i leave you  one would hardly think saturday evening a very good time george commented  his train came in shortly afterward and when it had gone hardie went home for a rubber coat and then took the trail leading out of the settlement  he was forced to trudge through the tangled grass beside it because the soft gumbo soil stuck to his boots in great black lumps and the patches of dwarf brush through which he must smash made progress laborious  after a while however he saw a long trail of black smoke ahead and sounds of distant activity grew steadily louder  there was an angry red glare on the western horizon though the light was beginning to fade when he reached the end of the new line and found a crowd of men distributing piles of gravel and spiking down the rails which ran back gleaming in the sunset lurid straight and level across the expanse of grass until they were lost in the shadowy mass of a bluff  near the men stood a few jaded teams and miry wagons farther on a row of freightcars occupied a sidetrack a little smoke rising from the stacks on the roofs of one or two  their doors were open and on passing hardie noticed the dirty blue blankets and the litter of wet clothing in the rude bunks  as he approached the last car which served as store and office a man sprang down upon the line he wore wet long boots and an old rubber coat stained with soil but there was a stamp of authority upon his bronzed face  how are you getting on mr farren hardie inquired  slowly said the other cant catch up on schedule contract time weve had rain and heavy soil ever since we began  the boys have been giving me some trouble too  you wont mind my having a few words with them  why no said farren  guess they need it but im most afraid youll be wasting time  the scandinavians whore quiet enough and might agree with you cant understand and its quite likely that the crowd you want to get at wont listen  anyway you can try it after theyve dubbed the load off the gravel train shes coming now  he pointed toward a smear of smoke that trailed away across the prairie  it grew rapidly blacker and nearer and presently a grimy locomotive with a long string of clattering cars behind it came down the uneven track  it had hardly stopped when the sides of the low cars dropped and a plow moved forward from one to another hurling off masses of gravel that fell with a roar  then the train backing out came to a standstill again and a swarm of men became busy about the line  dusk was falling but the blaze of the great electric light on the locomotive streamed along the track  while hardie stood watching half a dozen men dropped their tools and walked up to his companion  were through with our lot announced one  were going to the butte and well trouble you for a sub of two dollars a man  you wont get it said farren shortly  i want the ties laid on the next load  then you can send somebody else to fix them  were doing more than we booked for  youre getting paid for it  shucks said the other contemptuously  what we want is an evening at the butte and were going to have it  hand over the two dollars  no sir said farren  ive given in once or twice and ive got no work out of you for most two days afterward  you can quit tielaying if you insist but youll get no money until payday  one of the men pulled out his watch  boys he said if we stop here talking there wont be much time left for a jag when we make the butte  are you going to let him bluff you  the growl from the others was ominous  they had been working long hours at high pressure in the rain and had suffered in temper  one of them strode forward and grasped farrens shoulder  now he demanded hand out  its our money  there was only one course open to farren  his position was not an easy one and if he yielded his authority would be gone  his left arm shot out and the man went down with a crash  then the others closed with him and a savage struggle began  hardie laid hold of a man who had picked up an iron bar and managed to wrest it from him but another struck him violently on the head and he had a very indistinct idea of what went on during the next minute or two  there was a struggling knot of men pressed against the side of the car but it broke up when more figures came running up and one man cried out sharply as he was struck by a heavy lump of gravel  then hardie found himself kneeling beside farren who lay senseless near the wheels with the blood running down his set white face  behind him stood the panting locomotive engineer trying to hold back the growing crowd  looks pretty bad he said  whats to be done with him  we had better get him into his bunk directed hardie  then ill make for the butte as fast as i can and bring the doctor out  it would take two hours objected the engineer as he gently removed farrens hat  strikes me as a mighty ugly gash the thing must be looked to right away  if i let her go throttle wide we ought to make carson in half an hour and theyve a smart doctor there  he said something to his fireman and added get hold well take him along  it looked as if the outbreak had not met with general approval for a number of the bystanders offered their help and the injured man was carefully carried to the locomotive  ill run the cars along as far as the gravel pit then i can book the journey the engineer said to hardie  but as i cant get off at the other end youll have to come along  hardie wondered how he would get back but that was not a matter of great consequence though he had to preach at sage butte in the morning and he climbed up when farren had been lifted into the cab then he sat down on the floor plates and rested the unconscious mans head and shoulders against his knees as the engine began to rock furiously  nothing was said for a while the uproar made by the banging cars would have rendered speech inaudible but when they had been left behind the engineer looked at hardie  in a general way its not the thing to interfere in a row with a boss he said  still four to two with two more watching out for a chance to butt in is pretty steep odds and farrens a straight man i felt quite good when i hit one of those fellows with a big lump of gravel  hardie could understand his sensations and did not rebuke him  so far as his experience went the western locomotive crews were of an excellent type and he was willing to admit that there were occasions when the indignation of an honest man might be expressed in vigorous action  it was really four to one which makes the odds heavier he said  i guess not rejoined the engineer with a smile  you were laying into one of them pretty lively as i ran up  hardie felt a little disconcerted  having been partly dazed by the blow he had received he had no clear recollection of the part he had taken in the scrimmage though he had been conscious of burning anger when farren was struck down  it was however difficult to believe that the engineer had been mistaken because the locomotive lamp had lighted the track brilliantly  anyway one of them put his mark on you resumed his companion  did you notice it pete  sure said the grinning fireman big lump on his right cheek  he fumbled in a box and handed a tool to hardie  better hold that spanner to it if youre going to preach tomorrow  but hows farren  no sign of consciousness  the sooner we can get him into a doctors hands the better  stir her up ordered the engineer and nodded when his comrade swung back the firedoor and hurled in coal  then he turned to hardie were losing no time  shes running to beat the imperial limited clip and the tracks not worked down yet into its bed  hardie looking about for a few moments thought the speed could not safely be increased  there was a scream of wind about the cab though when he had stood upon the track the air had been almost still a bluff which he knew was a large one leaped up hung over the line and rushed away behind the great engine was rocking and jolting so that he could hardly maintain his position and the fireman shuffled about with the erratic motion  then hardie busied himself trying to protect farren from the shaking until the scream of the whistle broke through the confused sounds and the pace diminished  the bell began to toll and rising to his feet hardie saw a cluster of lights flitting back toward him  shortly afterward they stopped beside a halfbuilt row of elevators  guess youll have to be back tomorrow the engineer said  hardie nodded  ive been rather worried about it  it would take me all night to walk  thats so agreed the other  all you have to do is to see farren safe in the doctors hands and leave the rest to me  ive got to have some water for one thing  he turned to his fireman  well put in that new journal babbit shes not running sweet  the clergyman was inclined to believe that the repair was not strictly needed though it would account for a delay but one or two of the station hands had reached the engine and following instructions they lifted farren down and wheeled him on a baggage truck to the doctors house  the doctor seemed to have no doubt of the mans recovery but said that he must not be moved again for a day or two and hardie went back to the station reassured and less troubled than he had been for some time  the attitude of the engineer fireman and construction gang was encouraging  it confirmed his belief that the lawless element was tolerated rather than regarded with sympathy and the patience of the remainder of the community would become exhausted before long  though he admitted the influence of a bad example he had firm faith in the rank and file     chapter xxiii  a harmless conspiracy  on the evening that george left for brandon edgar drove over to the grant homestead  its saturday night my partners gone and i felt i deserved a little relaxation he explained  its something to be able to feel that the men who opened up this wheatbelt never got nor wanted anything of the kind grant rejoined but as suppers nearly ready you have come at the right time  edgar turned to flora  your father always makes me feel that i belong to a decadent age  one can put up with it from him because hes willing to live up to his ideas which is not a universal rule so far as my experience of moralizers goes  anyhow ill confess that im glad to arrive in time for a meal  the cooking at our place might be improved george i regret to say never seems to notice what he eats  thats a pretty good sign said grant  it strikes me as a failing for which i have to bear part of the consequences  flora laughed  if you felt that you had to make an excuse for coming couldnt you have made a more flattering one  ah said edgar you have caught me out  but i could give you a number of better reasons  it isnt my fault you resent compliments  flora rose and they entered the room where the hired men were gathering for the meal  when it was over they returned to the smaller room and found seats near an open window grant smoking flora embroidering while edgar mused as he watched her  dressed in some simple lightcolored material which was nevertheless tastefully cut she made an attractive picture in the plainly furnished room the walls of which made an appropriate frame of uncovered native pine for he always associated her and her father with the land to which they belonged there was nothing voluptuous in any line of the girls face or figure the effect was chastely severe and he knew that it conveyed a reliable hint of her character  this was not marked by coldness but rather by an absence of superficial warmth  the calmness of her eyes spoke of depth and balance  she was steadfast and consistent a daughter of the stern snowscourged north  then he glanced at the prairie which ran west streaked with ochre stubble in the foreground then white and silvery gray with neutral smears of poplar bluffs to the blaze of crimson where it cut the sky it was vast and lonely at first sight a hard forbidding land that broke down the slack of purpose and drove out the sybarite  he had sometimes shrunk from it but it was slowly fastening its hold on him and he now understood how it molded the nature of its inhabitants  for the most part they were far from effusive some of their ways were primitive and perhaps slightly barbarous but there was vigor and staunchness in them  they stuck to the friends they had tried and were admirable in action it was when as they said they were up against it that one learned most about the strong hearts of these men and women  lansing will be away some days grant said presently  what are you going to do next week  put up the new fence most likely  the lands a little soft for plowing yet  thats so  as youll have no use for the teams it would be a good time to haul in some of the seed wheat  ive a carload coming out  a carload exclaimed edgar in surprise remembering the large carrying capacity of the canadian freightcars  at the price theyve been asking it must have cost you a pile  it did said grant  i generally try to get down to bedrock figure but i dont mind paying it  the fellow who worked up that wheat deserves his money  you mean the seeds worth its price if the crop escapes the frost  that wasnt quite all i meant  im willing to pay the man for the work he has put into it  try to figure the cross fertilizations he must have made the varieties hes tried and cut out and remember it takes time to get a permanent strain and wheat makes only one crop a year  if the stuffs as good as it seems the fellows done something hell never be paid for  anyway hes welcome to my share  theres no doubt about your admiration for hard work declared edgar as it happens you have found putting it into practise profitable which may have had some effect  grants eyes twinkled  now you have got hold of the wrong idea  you have raised a different point  then for instance would you expect a hired man who had no interest in the crop to work as hard as you would  yes grant answered rather grimly id see he did  though i dont often pay more than i can help i wouldnt blame him for screwing up his wages to the last cent he could get but if it was only half the proper rate hed have to do his share  a mans responsible to the country hes living in not to his employer the latters only an agent and if he gets too big a commission it doesnt affect the case  it affects the workman seriously  he and his master must settle that point between them grant paused and spread out his hands forcibly  you have heard what the country west of old fort garbyits winnipeg nowwas like thirty years ago do you suppose all the men who made it what it is got paid for what they did  canada couldnt raise the money and quite a few of them got frozen to death  it struck edgar as a rather stern doctrine but he admitted the truth of it what was more he felt that george and this farmer had many views in common  grant however changed the subject  you had better take your two heavy teams in to the butte on monday ive ordered my freight there until the sandy trails get loose again bring a couple of spare horses along  well load you up and you can come in again  two cloverleaf wagons will haul a large lot of seed in a double journey  its quite likely youll have to make a third  dont you think you ought to get this hauling done before lansing comes home  a light broke in on edgar  grant was with some reason occasionally called hard but he was always just and it was evident that he could be generous  he meant to make his gift complete before george could protest  yes acquiesced edgar it would be better because george might want the teams and for other reasons  the farmer nodded  thats fixed  the agent has instructions to deliver  edgar left the homestead an hour later and spent the sunday resting because he knew that he would need all of his energy during the next few days  at dawn on the following morning he and grierson started for sage butte and on their arrival loaded the wagons and put up their horses for the night  they set out again before sunrise and were glad of the spare team when they came to places where all the horses could scarcely haul one wagon through the soft black soil  there were other spots where the graded road sloped steeply to the hollow out of which it had been dug and with the lower wheels sinking they had to hold up the side of the vehicle  great clods clung to the wheels the men plodding at the horses heads could scarcely pull their feet out of the mire and they were thankful when they left the fences behind and could seek a slightly sounder surface on the grass  even here progress was difficult  the stalks were tough and tangled and mixed with stiff dwarf scrub which grew in some spots almost to ones waist  there were little rises and hollows into which the wagons jolted violently and here and there they must skirt a bluff or strike back into the cutup trail which traversed it  toward noon they reached a larger wood where the trees crowded thick upon the track when edgar floundered into it there appeared to be no bottom  getting back to the grass he surveyed the scene with strong disgust he had not quite got over his english fastidiousness  leafless branches met above the trail and little bays strewn with trampled brush which showed where somebody had tried to force a drier route indented the ranks of slender trunks  except for these the strip of sloppy black gumbo led straight through the wood interspersed with gleaming pools  having seen enough edgar beckoned grierson and climbed a low hillock  the bluff was narrow where the road pierced it but it was long and the ground was rough and covered with a smaller growth for some distance on its flanks  theres no way of getting round he said  i suppose six horses ought to haul one wagon through that sloo  it looks a bit doubtful grierson objected  we mightnt be able to pull her out if she got in very deep  we could dump half the load and come back for it  and make four journeys  its not to be thought of twos a good deal too many  they yoked the three teams to the first wagon which promptly sank a long way up its high wheels and while the men waded nearly kneedeep at their heads the straining horses made thirty or forty yards  then edgar sank over the top of his long boots and the hub of one wheel got ominously low  theyve done more than one could have expected i hate to use the whip but we must get out of this before she goes in altogether he said  grierson nodded  he was fond of his horses which were obviously distressed and flecked with spume and lather where the traces chafed their wet flanks but to be merciful would only increase their task  the whipcracks rang out like pistolshots and splashing snorting struggling amid showers of mire they drew the wagon out of its sticky bed  they made another dozen yards and then grierson turned the horses into one of the embayments where there was brush that would support the wheels  edgar sat down breathless upon a fallen trunk  people at home have two quite unfounded ideas about this country he said disgustedly  the first is that money is easily picked up herewhich doesnt seem to need any remark the second is that they have only to send over the slackers and slouchers to reform them  in my opinion a few doses of this kind of thing would be enough to fill them with a horror of work  he replaced the pipe he had taken out its a pity grierson but we cant sit here and smoke  they went on and nearly capsized the wagon in a pool the bottom of which was too soft to give them foothold while they held up the vehicle but they got through it and one or two others and presently came out dripping from the waist down on to the drier prairie  then edgar turned and viewed their track  it wont bear much looking at we had better unyoke he said  if anybody had told me in england that id ever flounder through a place like that id  he paused seeking for words to express himself fittingly  youd have called him a liar grierson suggested  that hardly strikes me as strong enough edgar laughed  they had spent two hours in the bluff when they brought the last load through and sitting down in a patch of scrub they took out their lunch  after a while edgar flung off his badly splashed hat and jacket and lay down in the sunshine  the things done the pity is it must be done again tomorrow he remarked in the meanwhile well forget it ill draw a veil over my feelings  they had finished lunch and lighted their pipes when a buggy appeared from behind a projecting dump of trees and soon afterward flora grant pulled up her horse near by  edgar rose and stood beside the vehicle bareheaded looking slender and handsome in his loose yellow shirt duck overalls and long boots though the marks of the journey were freely scattered about him  flora glanced at the jaded teams and the miry wagons and smiled at the lad  she had a good idea of the difficulties he had overcome  the trail must have been pretty bad she said  i struck off to the east by the creek but i dont think you could get through with a load  it was quite bad enough edgar assured her  flora looked thoughtful  you have only two wagons we must try to send you another though our teams are busy  didnt you say mr lansing would be back in a day or two  i did but i got a note this morning saying he thought he had better go on to winnipeg if i could get along all right  i told him to go and stop as long as he likes  considering the state of the trails i thought that was wise  flora smiled  she knew what he meant since they had agreed that all the seed must be hauled in before his comrades return  im not going to thank you it would be difficult and george can ride over and do so when he comes home edgar resumed  i know hell be astonished when he sees the granary  if he comes only to express his gratitude im inclined to believe my father would rather he stayed at home  i can believe it but ive an idea that mr grant is not the only person to whom thanks are due  flora looked at him sharply but she made no direct answer  your partner she said compels ones sympathy  and ones liking  i dont know how he does so and it isnt from any conscious desire  i suppose its a gift of his  seeing she was interested he went on with a thoughtful air  you see george isnt witty and you wouldnt consider him handsome in fact sometimes hes inclined to be dull but you feel that hes the kind of man you can rely on  theres not a trace of meanness in him and he never breaks his word  in my opinion he has a number of the useful english virtues  what are they and are they peculiarly english  ill call them teutonic i believe thats their origin  you people and your neighbors across the frontier have your share of them  thanks smiled flora  but you havent begun the catalogue  things are often easier to recognize than to describe  at the top of the list and really comprising the rest of it id place in the language of the country the practical ability to get there  were not in the highest degree intellectual were not as a rule worshipers of beautythats made obvious by the prairie townsand to be thought poetical makes us shy  in fact our artistic taste is strongly defective  if these are virtues theyre strictly negative ones flora pointed out  im clearing the ground said edgar  where we shine is in making the most of material things turning for example these wilds into wheatfields holding on through your arctic cold and blazing summer heat  we begin with a tent and an oxteam and end in spite of countless obstacles with a big brick homestead and a railroad or an automobile  men of the lansing type follow the same course consistently even when their interests are not concerned  once get an idea into their minds convince them that its right and theyll transform it into determined action  if they havent tools theyll make them or find something that will serve effort counts for nothing the purpose will be carried out  flora noticed the enthusiastic appreciation of his comrade which his somewhat humorous speech revealed and she thought it justified  one would imagine mr lansing to be resolute she said  i dare say its fortunate he had a heavy loss to face last year  yes returned edgar  as you see hes going on though he never expected anything for himself  he never expected anything flora repeated incredulously  what are you saying  edgar realized that he had been injudicious  flora did not know that sylvia marston was still the owner of the farm and he hesitated to enlighten her  well he said george isnt greedy it isnt in his nature  do you mean that hes a rich man and is merely farming for amusement  oh no said edgar far from it  he indicated the miry wagons and the tornup trails  you wouldnt expect a man to do this kind of thing if it wasnt needful  the fact is i dont always express myself very happily and george has told me that i talk too much  flora smiled and drove away shortly afterward considering what he had said  she had noticed a trace of confusion in his manner and it struck her as significant  when the buggy had grown small in the distance edgar called to grierson and they went on again     chapter xxiv  george feels grateful  when george returned from winnipeg edgar took him to the granary  you may as well look at the seed grant sent you and then youll be able to thank him for it he said  its in here i turned out the common northern stuff you bought to make room  why didnt you put it into the empty place in the barn george asked  i wasnt sure it would go in theres rather a lot of it edgar explained with a smile  george entered the granary and stopped astonished when he saw the great pile of bags  is all of that the new seed he asked incredulously  every bag said edgar watching him  georges face reddened  he was stirred by mixed emotions relief gratitude and a feeling of confusion he could not analyze  grant must have sent the whole carload he broke out  as a matter of fact he sent most of it  grierson and i hauled it in and a tough job we had of it  and you took it all without protesting or sending me word  yes said edgar coolly thats precisely what i did  you need the stuff grant meant you to have it and i didnt want to offend him  i suppose you have some idea what that seed is worth  i dare say i could guess  our people at home once experimented with some american seed potatoes at three shillings each  but arent you putting the matter on a rather low plane  george sat down and felt for his pipe  i feel that you have played a trick on me  if you had only let me know i could have objected  just so thats why i kept quiet edgar laughed  the seeds here and you ought to be thankful  anyway grant wont take it back  what have i done that i should get this favor george said half aloud  thats so characteristic edgar exclaimed  why must you always be doing things  do you imagine that whatever one receives is the result of so much exertion  i dont feel the least interest in such quibbles  i cant believe it edgar rejoined  youre more at home when you have a fence to put up or a strip of new land to break  then he dropped his bantering tone  theres nothing to be distressed about grant has been pretty generous and i think he and flora need thanking  thats true theyve made me feel half ashamed  i never expected this  in my opinion the sensations quite unnecessary  you have given a few people a lift in your time and ive an optimistic notion that actions of the kind recoil on one even though its a different person who makes you some return  i wish you would stop talking george exclaimed impatiently  edgar mentally compared flora grant with sylvia in whom he disbelieved and found it hard to restrain himself  it was he felt a great misfortune that george could not be made to see  oh well he acquiesced  i could say a good deal more if i thought it would do any good but as that doesnt seem likely ill dry up  thats a comfort george said shortly  he left the granary in a thoughtful mood and on the following evening drove over to the grant homestead  its owner was busy somewhere outside when he reached it but flora received him and he sat down with satisfaction to talk to her  it had become a pleasure to visit the grants he felt at home in their house  the absence of all ceremony the simple canadian life had a growing attraction for him  one could get to know these people which was a different thing from merely meeting them and george thought this was to some extent the effect of their surroundings  he had always been conscious of a closer and more intimate contact with his friends upon the mountainside or the banks of some salmon river than he had ever experienced in a club or drawingroom  for all that flora sometimes slightly puzzled him  she was free from the affectations and restraints of artificial conventionality but there was a reserve about her which he failed to penetrate  he wondered what lay behind it and had a curious feeling that edgar either guessed or knew  did you enjoy your visit to winnipeg she asked  it was a pleasant change and i got through my business satisfactorily of course i didnt go for amusement  flora laughed  so i supposed youre growing more canadian every day  but you meant to make a visit to england which couldnt have had any connection with business last winter didnt you  georges face grew serious  he had she thought not got over his disappointment  yes he said  but there was nothing to be done here then  so the things that should be done invariably come first with you  in this casei mean as far as they concern the farmits necessary  flora considered his answer studying him quietly though she had some sewing in her hands  supposing as she had once thought there was some english girl he had longed to see he could have made the journey later when his crop had been sown even though this entailed some neglect of minor operations that required his care  he received as she had learned with interest few english letters so there was nobody to whom he wrote regularly and yet his disappointment when forced to abandon his visit had obviously been keen  there was flora thought a mystery here  after all she said the feeling you have indicated is pretty common in the canadian wheatbelt  then why should you expect me to be an exception  as a matter of fact im at least as anxious as my neighbors to be successful  thats partly why ive come over tonight  his voice grew deeper and softer as he continued  i want to thank you and your father for your surprising generosity  surprising responded flora lightly though she was stirred by the signs of feeling he displayed  do you know youre not altogether complimentary  he smiled  youll forgive the slip when one feels strongly its difficult to choose ones words  anyway to get that seed and so much of it is an immense relief  im deeply grateful the more so because your action was so spontaneous  i havent a shadow of a claim on you  flora put down her sewing and looked at him directly  i dont think you ought to say thatdo you wish to be considered a stranger  no george declared impulsively  its the last thing i want still you see  she was pleased with his eagerness but she checked him  then as you have a gift of making friends you must take the consequences  i didnt know i had the gift  my real friends arent plentiful  if you begin to count you may find them more numerous than you think  those i have made in canada head the list  the girl felt a thrill of satisfaction  this was not a compliment he had spoken from his heart  after all i dont see why you should insist on thanking me as well as my father who really sent you the seed  she paused  you didnt do so on the last occasion i mean at the time when it was promised to you  this was correct and george was conscious of some embarrassment  well he said firmly i think im justified  flora could not contradict him and she was glad he felt as he did she liked his way of sticking to the point indeed she was sensible of a strong liking for the man  during the next minute or two her father came in  he cut short georges thanks and then took out his pipe  i was in at the butte yesterday he said  the police have got the men who knocked farren out and flett says they mean to press for a smart penalty  its about time they made an example of somebody  when i was in i fixed it up to turn langside off his holding  flora looked up with interest  but how had you the power george asked  the man owes me four hundred dollars for a horse and some secondhand implements i let him have nearly three years ago  but he has broken a big strip of his land its worth a good deal more than you lent him  just so  he owes everybody money round the butte  i saw taunton of the store and the implement man and told them langside had to quit  you seem to have found them willing to agree  grant broke into a grim smile  what i say to those men goes  then ive got security they know i could pull langside down  george looked at flora and was slightly surprised at her acquiescent manner  it sounds a little harsh a good harvest might have set him straight he said  however i suppose you have a reason for what youre doing  thats so  langsides the kind of man ive no use for he takes no interest in his place  after he has put in half a crop he goes off and spends his time doing a little railroad work and slouching round the saloons along the line  it doesnt seem sufficient to justify your ruining him  ive got a little more against the man  has it struck you that somebody round here who knows the trails and the farmers movements is standing in with the liquor boys  a light broke in upon george  now that the matter had been put before him he could recollect a number of points that seemed to prove the fanner right  when cattle had been killed their owners had been absent horses had disappeared at a time which prevented the discovery of their loss from being promptly made  it looked as if the offenses could only have been committed with the connivance of somebody in the neighborhood who had supplied their perpetrators with information  i believe youve got at the truth he replied  still it must be largely a matter of suspicion  grant leaned forward on the table and his face grew stern  youll remember what flett said about our system of justice sometimes breaking down  in this matter im the jury and ive thought the thing over for the last six months weighing up all that could be said for langside though it isnt much  whats more ive talked to the man and watched him giving him every chance  he has had his trial and he has to go theres no appeal  george could imagine the thoroughness with which his host had undertaken his task  grant would be just deciding nothing without the closest test  george felt that the man he meant to punish must be guilty  for all that he looked at flora  have you been consulted he asked  i understood said flora  and i agreed  her face was as hard as her fathers and george was puzzled  i should have thought you would have been inclined to mercy  flora colored a little but she looked at him steadily  langside deserves the punishment he has so far escaped  hes guilty of what my father thinks but theres another offense that im afraid will never be brought home to him  george admired her courage as he remembered a very unpleasant story he had heard about a pretty waitress at the settlement  as a matter of fact he had doubted it  flora went to see the girl at regina  they found her there pretty near dying grant explained quietly  recollecting a scene outside the sachem when flora had accompanied mrs nelson george realized that he had rather overlooked one side of her character  she could face unpleasant things and strive to put them right and she could be sternly just without shrinking when occasion demanded it  this however was not an aspect of hers that struck one forcibly he had generally seen her compassionate cheerful and considerate  then he told himself that there was no reason why he should take any interest in flora grants qualities  i suppose langside will be sold up he said  open auction though i guess there wont be much bidding  folks round here dont know the man as i do but theyve good reason to believe the money will go to his creditors and therell be nothing left for him  the foreclosure wont meet with general favor george said pointedly  that doesnt count  it strikes one as curious that people should be ready to sympathize with the slouch who lets his place go to ruin out of laziness and never think of the storekeepers just claim on the money hes wasted  anyway theres nothing to stop people from bidding but in case they hold off we have fixed up how well divide the property  it was obvious to george that the position of grants associates was unassailable  if any friends of langsides attempted to run prices up they would only put the money into his creditors pockets if as seemed more probable they discouraged the bidding the creditors would secure his possessions at a low figure and recoup themselves by selling later at the proper value  george realized that grant had carefully thought out his plans  i dont think you have left him any way of escape he said  no replied grant we have got him tight  you had better come along to the auctionyoull get notice of itand see how the thing goes  george said that he would do so and shortly afterward drove away  on reaching home he told edgar what he had heard and the lad listened with a thoughtful expression  one cant doubt that grant knows what hes doing but im not sure hes wise he said  though langsides a regular slacker he has a good many friends and as a rule nobody has much sympathy with exacting creditors  then its bound to come out that it was grant who set the other fellows after langside and if he buys up much of the property at a low figure the thing will look suspicious  i tried to point that out  and found you had wasted words  grant would see it before you did and it wouldnt have the least effect on him  you wouldnt expect that man to yield to popular opinion  still the thing will make trouble though i shall not be sorry if it forces on a crisis  george nodded  im getting tired of these continual petty worries and keeping a ceaseless lookout  i want to hit back  youll no doubt get your chance  what about miss grants attitude  she agreed with her father completely i was a little surprised  that was quite uncalled for said edgar with a smile  it looks as if you didnt know the girl yet  these westerners are a pretty grim people  george frowned at this though he felt that there was some truth in what his companion said  on the whole he was of the same mind as grant there were situations in which one must fearlessly take a drastic course  the sooner the trouble begins the sooner it will be over he said one has now and then to run the risk of getting hurt     chapter xxv  a counterstroke  langsides farm was duly put up at auction together with a valuable team which he hired out to his neighbors when he left the place a few implements and a little rude furniture  the sale was held outside and when george arrived upon the scene during the afternoon a row of light wagons and buggies stood behind the rickety shack near which was an unsightly pile of broken crockery discarded clothes and rusty provision cans  it was characteristic of langside that he had not taken the trouble to carry them as far as the neighboring bluff  in front of the bluff horses were picketed along the side ran a strip of black soil sprinkled with the fresh blades of wheat and all round the rest of the wide circle the prairie stretched away under cloudless sunshine flecked with brightest green  a thin crowd surrounded the auctioneers table but the men stood in loose clusters and george walking through them noticed that the undesirable element was largely represented  there were a number of small farmers attracted by curiosity or perhaps a wish to buy but these kept to themselves and men from the settlement of no fixed profession who worked spasmodically at different tasks and spent the rest of their time in the sachem were more plentiful  besides these there were some strangers and george thought the appearance of several was far from prepossessing  it was a glorious day  there was vigor in the warm breeze that swept the grassy waste the sunshine that bathed the black loam where the green blades were springing up seemed filled with promise but as the sale proceeded george became sensible of a vague compunction  the sight of the new wheat troubled himlangside had laboriously sown that crop which somebody else would reap  watching the battered domestic utensils and furniture being carried out for sale had the same disturbing effect  poor and comfortless as the shack was it had until rude hands had desecrated it been a home  george felt that he was consenting to the ruin of a defenseless man assisting to drive him forth a wanderer and an outcast  he wondered how far the terrors of loneliness had urged langside into his reckless courseshomesteaders scattered about the wide empty spaces occasionally became insanebut with an effort he overcame the sense of pity  langside had slackly given way and choosing an evil part had become a menace to the community as grant had said he must go  this was unavoidable and though the duty of getting rid of him was painful it must be carried out  george was usually unsuspicious and of easygoing nature up to a certain point but there was a vein of hardness in him  once or twice the auctioneer was interrupted by jeering cries but he kept his temper and the sale went on though george noticed that only a few strangers made any purchases  at length when the small sundries had been cleared off there was a curious silence as the land was put up  it was evident that the majority of those present had been warned not to bid  the auctioneer made a little speech in praise of the property and paused when it fell flat then while george wondered what understanding the creditors had arrived at with grant a brownfaced stranger strode forward  ive been advised to let this place alone he said  i suppose you have a right to sell  yes sir replied the auctioneer  come along and look at my authority if you want  its mortgaged property that has been foreclosed after the creditors had waited a long while for a settlement and i may say that the interest demanded is under the present market rate  everythings quite regular no injustice has been done  if youre a purchaser ill take your bid  then ill raise you a hundred dollars said the man  there was a growl of dissatisfaction and the stranger turned to the part of the crowd from which it proceeded  this is an open auction boys  i was born in the next province and ive seen a good many farms seized in the years when we have had harvest frost but this is the first time i ever saw anybody try to interfere with a legal sale  guess you may as well quit yapping unless you mean to bid against me  there was derisive laughter and a loafer from sage butte threw a clod then another growl more angry than the first broke out as grant moving forward into a prominent place nodded to the auctioneer  his rugged face was impassive and he ignored the crowd  a number of the farmers strolled toward him and stood near by with a resolute air which had its effect on the others though george saw by grants look of surprise that he had not expected this  another man made a bid and the competition proceeded languidly but except for a little mocking laughter and an occasional jeer nobody interfered  in the end the stranger bought the land and soon afterward grant walked up to george  i want the team if i can get it at a reasonable figure theyre real good beasts with the imported percheron strain strong in them he said  it will be a while before theyre put up and id be glad if you could ride round and let flora know whats keeping me  id an idea she expected there might be some trouble today  ill get off but theres a mower yonder i would like  will you buy it for me if it goes at a fair price  certainly promised grant  tell flora to give you supper and if you ride back afterward by the trail youll meet me and ill let you know about the mower  george rode away shortly afterward and grant waited some time before he secured the team after rather determined opposition  finding nobody willing to lead the horses home he hitched them to the back of his light wagon and set off at a leisurely pace  when he had gone a little distance he overtook a man plodding along the trail  the fellow stopped when grant came up  will you give me a lift he asked  the request is seldom refused on the prairie and grant pulled up his team  get in he said  where are you going  north answered the other as he clambered up  looking for a job left the railroad yesterday and spent the night in a patch of scrub heard there was stock in the bluff country thats my line  grant glanced at the fellow sharply as he got into the wagon and noticed nothing in his disfavor  his laconic account of himself was borne out by his appearance  its quite a way to the first homestead if youre making for the big bluffs he said  you had better come along with me and go on in the morning  ill be glad responded the other  these nights are pretty cold and my blankets thin  they drove on and after a while the stranger glanced at the team hitched behind the vehicle  pretty good beasts he remarked  that mares a daisy  ought to be worth a pile  she cost it grant told him  ive just bought her at a sale  i heard the boys talking about it when i was getting dinner at the settlement said the stranger carelessly  called the fellow whose place was sold up langside i think  theres nothing much wrong with the team youre driving  grant nodded they were valuable animals for he was fond of good horses  he was well satisfied with his new purchases and knew that langside had bought the mare after a profitable haulage contract during the building of a new railroad  his companions flattering opinion made him feel rather amiable toward him  it was getting near dusk when they entered a strip of broken country where the ground was sandy and lolled in low ridges and steep hillocks here and there small pines on the higher summits stood out black against the glaring crimson light birches and poplars straggled up some of the slopes and the trail which wound through the hollows was loose and heavy  the moist sand clogged the wheels and the team plodded through it laboriously until they came to a spot where the melted snow running into a depression had formed a shallow lake  this had dried up but the soil was very soft and marshy  grant pulled up and glanced dubiously at the deep ruts cut in the road  theres a way round through the sand and scrub but its mighty rough and im not sure we could get through it in the dark he said  spose you doubleyoke and drive straight ahead suggested the other i see you have some harness in the wagon  grant considered  the harness which had been thrown in with his purchase was old and short of one or two pieces it would take time and some contriving to hitch on the second team and the light was failing rapidly  when he had crossed the soft place there would still be some rough ground to traverse before he reached the smoother trail by which george would be riding  it might be as quick to go round he replied  no sir said his companion firmly  theres a blamed steep bit up the big sandhill  suspicion flashed on grant the man had led him to believe he was a stranger to the locality and it was significant that he should insist upon their stopping and harnessing the second team  thats so he returned  guess you had better get down and see if its very soft ahead  the fellow rose with a promptness which partly disarmed grants suspicions and put his foot on the edge of the vehicle ready to jump down  then he turned swiftly and flung himself upon the farmer crushing his soft felt hat down to his chin  grant could see nothing and while he strove to get a grip on his antagonist he was thrown violently backward off the driving seat  the wagon was of the usual high pattern and he came down on the ground with a crash that nearly knocked him unconscious  before he got up he was seized firmly and held with his shoulders pressed against the soil  he struggled however until somebody grasped his legs and his arms were drawn forcibly apart  it was impossible to see because the thick hat was still over his face and somebody held it fast but he had an idea that three or four men had fallen upon him  they had no doubt been hidden among the brush the affair had been carefully arranged with his treacherous companion  open his jacket try the inside pocket cried one and he felt hands fumbling about him  then there was a disappointed exclamation checkbook thats no good  the farmer made a last determined effort  after having long ruled his household and hired men as a benevolent but decidedly firmhanded autocrat it was singularly galling to be treated in this unceremonious fashion and if he could only shake off the hat and get a glimpse of his assailants he would know them again  moreover he had brought a roll of bills with him in case he should make some small purchases he was however held firmly and the hands he had felt dived into another pocket  got it now cried a hoarse voice  heres his wallet seems to have a good wad in it  grant though he was generally sternly collected boiled with fury  he felt no fear but an uncontrollable longing to grapple with the men who had so humiliated him  guess ill fix you up came an angry voice when grant managed to fling off one pair of hands  then he received a heavy blow on the head  somebody had struck him with the butt of a whip or riding quirt  the pain was distressing he felt dazed and stupid disinclined to move but he retained consciousness  there were sounds to which he could attach a meaning a rattle of harness which indicated that his driving team was being loosened a thud of hoofs as the heavier percherons were led away  in the meanwhile he could still feel a strong grasp on his shoulder holding him down and once or twice a man near him gave the others sharp instructions  grant made a languid effort to fix the voice in his memory but this was difficult because his mind worked heavily  at length the driving team was unyokedhe could hear it being led awaybut the ache in his head grew almost intolerable and his lassitude more intense  for a while he had no idea what was going on and then a hoarse cry which seemed one of alarm rang out sharply there was a patter of running feet a thud of hoofs on the soft soil and breaking through these sounds a rhythmic staccato drumming somebody was riding hard across the uneven ground  gathering his languid senses grant suddenly moved his head flinging the hat from his face and raised himself a little leaning on one elbow  there was no longer anybody near him but he could see a man riding past a shadowy clump of trees a little distance off leading a second horse  closer at hand another man was running hard beside one of the percherons and while grant watched him he made an effort to scramble up on the back of the unsaddled animal but slipped off  both these men were indistinct in the dim hollow but on a sandy ridge above which still caught the fading light there was a sharplyoutlined mounted figure sweeping across the broken ground at a reckless gallop  it must be lansing who had come to the rescue grant sent up a faint hoarse cry of exultation  he forgot his pain and dizziness he even forgot he had been assaulted he was conscious only of a burning wish to see lansing ride down the fellow who was running beside the percheron  there was a patch of thick scrub not far ahead which it would be difficult for the horseman on the rise to break through and if the fugitive could succeed in mounting he might escape while his pursuer rode round but lansing seemed to recognize this  he swept down from the ridge furiously and rode to cut off the thief  grant saw him come up with the fellow with his quirt swung high but the figures of men and horses were now indistinct against the shrub  there was a blow struck one of the animals reared plunged and fell the other went on and vanished into the gloom of the dwarf trees  then grant without remembering how he got up found himself upon his feet and lurching unsteadily toward the clump of brush  when he reached it lansing was standing beside his trembling horse which had a long red gash down its shoulder  his hands were stained and a big discolored knife lay near his feet  there was nobody else about but a beat of hoofs came back growing fainter out of the gathering dusk  george looked around when the farmer joined him and then pointed to the wound on the horse  i think it was meant for my leg he said  i hit the fellow once with the thick end of the quirt but he jumped straight at me  the horse reared when he felt the knife and i came off before he fell when i got up again the fellow had gone  grant felt scarcely capable of standing  he sat down heavily and fumbled for his pipe while george turned his attention to the horse again  though its only in the muscle the cut looks deep he said at length  id better lead him back to your place its nearer than mine  id rather you came along im a bit shaky  of course said george  i was forgetting  those fellows had you down  are you hurt  they knocked me out with something heavymy whip i guessbut im getting over it  cleaned out my pockets went off with both teams  george nodded  its pretty bad quite impossible to get after them  theyll head for montana as fast as they can ride  did you see any of them clearly  one fellow looked like langside though i couldnt swear to him but id know the man who knifed my horse  remembered that would be desirable in case he escaped me and i got a good look at him  now if you feel able shall we make a start  im afraid the horse is too lame to carry you  he picked up the knife  grant rose and they set off leading the horse which moved slowly and painfully  it had grown dark and the trail was rough but the farmer plodded homeward stopping a few moments now and then  the path however grew smoother when they had left the sandy ridges behind and by and by the lights of the homestead commenced to twinkle on the vast shadowy plain  soon after they reached it george rode away mounted on a fresh horse in search of constable flett     chapter xxvi  the climax  george was tired and sleepy when he reached the settlement early in the morning and found flett at hardies house  it transpired from their conversation that there had been a disturbance at the sachem on the return of a party which had driven out to the sale and one man who accused a companion of depriving him of a bargain had attacked and badly injured him with a decanter  flett being sent for had arrested the fellow and afterward called upon the clergyman for information about his antecedents and character  he listened with close attention while george told his tale and then examined the knife he produced  this is about the limit he exclaimed  you wouldnt have persuaded me that the thing was possible when i was first sent into the district it isnt what one expects in the wheatbelt and it certainly has to be stopped  of course said george with some impatience  but wouldnt it be wiser to consider the ways and means  at present the fellows are no doubt pushing on for the frontier with two valuable teams and a wad of stolen bills  flett smiled at him indulgently  this isnt a job that can be put through in a hurry  if theyre heading for the boundaryand i guess they aretheyll be in dakota or montana long before any of the boys ill wire to could come up with them  our authority doesnt hold on american soil  is that to be the end of it  why no flett answered dryly  as i guess you have heard they have had trouble of this kind in alberta for a while and most every time the boys were able to send back any american mavericks and beefcattle that were run into canada  as the result of it our chiefs at regina are pretty good friends with the sheriffs and deputies on the other side  theyre generally willing to help us where they can  then you shouldnt have much difficulty in trailing your men  suppose a fellow turned up with four exceptionally good horses and offered them to an american farmer or dealer wouldnt it arouse suspicion  it might said flett with a meaning smile  but the things not so simple as it looks  we all know that canadian steers and horses have been run off and disposed of across the frontier and now and then a few from that side have disappeared in canada  this points to there being a way of getting rid of them some mean white on a lonely holding will take them at halfvalue and pass them along  what we have to do is to send a man over quietly to investigate and get the sheriffs and deputies to keep their eyes open  im going to beg the regina people to let me be that man  you may as well understand that it isnt the return of the horses grant wants so much as the conviction of the men who waylaid him  then said flett pointedly he must be mighty mad  hardie joined in georges laugh but the constable went on  i believe were going to get them but it will take timeall summer perhaps  ive known our boys lay hands on a man they wanted eighteen months afterward  in one way i dont think thats much to their credit the clergyman remarked  taking up the knife george had handed him flett pointed to some initials scratched on the bone haft  kind of foolish thing for the fellow to put his name on his tools but i dont know anybody those letters might stand for  now you describe him as clearly as you can while i put it down  george did as he was bidden and added there were two moreone of them looked like langsideand i believe a fourth man though i may be mistaken in this  they were moving about pretty rapidly and the light was bad  flett got up  ill have word sent along to regina and then try to locate their trail until instructions come  i want to get about it right away but theres this blamed fellow who knocked out his partner at the sachem and it will take me most of a days ride before i can hand him on to davies  its a charge that nobodys going to worry about and its a pity he couldnt have escaped  still thats the kind of thing that cant happen too often  he went out and george turned to hardie  how does the matter strike you  ive an idea that flett was right in saying it was the limit  there was a certain romance about these disturbances when they began they were a novelty in this part of canada  people took them lightly glad of something amusing or exciting to talk about  it was through popular indifference that the gang first gained a footing but by degrees it became evident that they couldnt be dislodged without a vigorous effort  people shrank from making it and with beamish backing them the fellows got steadily bolder and better organized  all the time however they were really at the mercy of the general body of orderly citizens  now they have gone too far this last affair cant be tolerated  instead of apathy therell be an outbreak of indignation and i expect the people who might have stopped the thing at the beginning will denounce the police  george nodded  thats my idea  whats our part  i think its to assist in the reaction  your storys a striking one we had better get it into a newspaper as soon as possible  i suppose it would be correct to say that grant was cruelly beaten  his face is blue from jaw to temple  they knocked him nearly senseless with the butt of a whip while he was lying helpless on the ground  and your horse was badly wounded  i wish it werent true theres a gash about eight inches long  if it will assist the cause you can say the stab was meant for me  well said hardie i think it will make a moving tale  im afraid however ill have to lay some stress upon the singlehanded rescue  george looked dubious  id rather you left that out  we must impress the matter on peoples thoughts make it command attention a little diplomacy is allowable now and then said hardie smiling  since you dont mind getting yourself into trouble i dont see why you should object to being held up to admiration and its in an excellent cause  now however ill order breakfast for you and then you had better get some sleep  during the afternoon george set off for home and he was plowing for the summer fallow a week later when flora grant rode up to him  i suppose you have got your mail and have seen what the sentinel says about you she asked mischievously  george looked uncomfortable but he laughed  yes he confessed  it seemed to afford edgar some amusement  whos responsible for that flattering column  it doesnt read like the work of the regular staff  im afraid that i am to some extent though hardies the actual culprit  the fact is he thought the course was necessary  well i suspected something of the kind so did my father  it was a wise move and i think it will have its effect  george made no comment and she sat silent a moment or two while he watched her with appreciation  she was wellmounted on a beautiful carefullygroomed horse the simple skirt and bodice of pale gray emphasized the pure tinting of her face and hands and the warm glow of her hair in which the fierce sunshine forced up strong coppery gleams her lips formed a patch of crimson there was a red band on her wide stetson hat and her eyes shone a deep blue as she looked down at george who stood in the sandy furrow leaning against the heavy plow he was dressed in old overalls that had faded with dust and sun to the indefinite color of the soil but they displayed the fine lines of a firmly knit and muscular figure  his face was deeply bronzed but a glow of sanguine red shone through its duskier coloring  behind them both ran a broad sweep of stubble steeped in strong ochre relieved by brighter lemon hues where the light blazed on it  though i couldnt resist the temptation to tease you i quite agree with the sentinel she resumed  it really was a very gallant rescue and i suppose you know i recognize my debt to you  i was a little too startled to speak about it when you brought my father home and you went away so fast  the fellows were afraid of being identified they bolted as soon as they saw me  one didnt flora pointed out  a knifethrust like the one you avoided or a pistolshot would have obviated any risk they ran  but of course you hate to be thanked  no george replied impulsively not by you  i wonder she said with an amused air why you should make an exception of me  i suppose it lessens my sense of obligation  i feel ive done some little thing to pay you back  im not sure that was very happily expressed  is it painful to feel that you owe anything to your neighbors  george flushed  that wasnt what i meant  do you think its quite fair to lay traps for me when you can count on my falling into them  he turned and pointed to the great stretch of grain that clothed the soil with vivid green  look at your work  last fall all that plowing was strewn with a wrecked and mangled crop now its sown with wheat that will stand the drought  i was feeling nearly desperate wondering how i was to master the sandy waste when you came to the rescue and my troubles melted like the dust in summer rain  they couldnt stand before you you banished them  she looked at him rather curiously and george thought with some cause for he was a little astonished at his outbreak  this was not the kind of language that was most natural to him  i wonder she said why you should take so much for grantedi mean in holding me accountable  its obvious george declared  i understand your father hes a very generous friend but the idea of sending me the seed didnt occur to him in the first place though i havent the least doubt that he was glad to act on it  ah said flora it looks as if you had been acquiring some penetration you were not so explicit the last time you insisted on thanking me  who can have been teaching you  it seems however that im still incomprehensible  george considered  it would be undesirable to explain that his enlightenment had come from edgar and he wanted to express what he felt  no he said in answer to her last remark not altogether but ive sometimes felt that theres a barrier of reserve in you beyond which its hard to get  do you think it would be worth while to make the attempt  suppose you succeeded and found there was nothing on the other side  he made a sign of negation and she watched him with some interest the man was trying to thrash out his ideas  that couldnt happen he declared gravely  somehow you make one feel there is much in you that wants discovery but that one will learn it by and by  after all its only the shallow people you never really get to know  it would seem an easy task on the face of it  as a matter of fact it isnt  they have a way of enveloping themselves in an air of importance and mystery and when they dont do so theyre casual and inconsequent  one likes people with so to speak some continuity of character  by degrees one gets to know how theyll act and it gives one a sense of reliance  he paused and added diffidently anything you did would be wise and generous  by degrees smiled flora  so its slowly by patient sapping the barriers go down  one could imagine that such things might be violently stormed  but youre not rash are you or often in a hurry however its time i was getting home  she waved her hand and rode away and george getting into the saddle started his team and thought about her while he listened to the crackling of the stubble going down beneath the hoofs and the soft thud of thrownback soil as the lengthening rows of clods broke away from the gleaming shares  what she might have meant by her last remark he could not tell though so far as it concerned him he was ready to admit that he was addicted to steady plodding  then his thoughts took a wider range and he began to make comparisons  flora was not characterized by sylvias fastidious refinement she was more virile and yet more reposeful  sylvias activities spread bustle around her she required much assistance and everybody in her neighborhood was usually impressed into her service though their combined efforts often led to nothing  floras work was done silently the results were most apparent  still the charm sylvia exerted was always obvious a thing to rejoice in and be thankful for  flora had not the same effect on one though he suspected there was a depth of tenderness in her behind the barrier  it struck him as a pity that she showed no signs of interest in west who of late seemed to have been attracted by the pretty daughter of a storekeeper at the settlement but after all the lad was hardly old or serious enough for flora  there was however nobody else in the district who was nearly good enough for her and george felt glad that she was reserved and critical  it would be disagreeable to contemplate her yielding to any suitor unless he were a man of exceptional merit  then he laughed and called to his horses  he was thinking about matters that did not concern him his work was to drive the long furrow for sylvias benefit and he found pleasure in it  bright sunshine smote the burnished clods scattered whiteedged clouds drove across the sky of dazzling blue flinging down cool gray shadows that sped athwart the stubble young wheat wavy lines of bluff and widespread prairie were steeped in glowing color  the man rejoiced in the rush of the breeze the play of straining muscles swelling and sinking on the bodies of the team before him was pleasant to watch he felt at home in the sun and wind which tempered as they often were by gentle rain were staunchly assisting him  by and by all the foreground of the picture he gazed upon would be covered with the coppery ears of wheat he had once shrunk from returning to canada but now through all the stress of cold and heat he was growing fond of the new land  what was more he felt the power to work at such a task as he was now engaged in to be a privilege     chapter xxvii  a sign from flett  summer drew on with swift strides  crimson flowers flecked the prairie grass the wild barley waved its bristling ears along the trails saskatoons glowed red in the shadows of each bluff  day by day swiftmoving clouds cast flitting shadows across the sunscorched plain but though they shed no moisture the wheat stood nearly waisthigh upon the marston farm  the sand that whirled about it did the strong stalks no harm  earlier in the season there had been drenching thunder showers and beyond the grain the flax spread in sheets of delicate blue that broke off on the verge of the brownheaded timothy  still farther back lay the green of alsike and alfalfa for the band of red and white cattle that roamed about the bluffs but while the fodder crop was bountiful george had decided to supplement it with the natural prairie hay there was no pause in his exertions task followed task in swift succession  rising in the sharp cold of the dawn he toiled assiduously until the sunset splendors died out in paling green and crimson on the far rim of the plain  the early summer was marked by signs of approaching change in sage butte affairs  there were still a few disturbances and hardie had troubles to face but he and his supporters noticed that the indifference with which they had been regarded was giving place to sympathy  when grant first visited the settlement after his misadventure he was received with expressions of indignant commiseration and he afterward told flora dryly that he was astonished at the number of his friends  mrs nelson and a few of the stalwarts pressed hardie to make new and more vigorous efforts toward the expulsion of the offenders but the clergyman refrained  things were going as he wished it was scarcely wise to expose such a tender thing as halfformed opinion to a severe test and the failure that might follow a premature attempt could hardly be recovered from  it seemed better to wait until grants assailants should be arrested and the story of their doings elicited in court to rouse general indignation and he thought this would happen  flett had disappeared some weeks ago and nothing had been heard of him but hardie believed his chiefs had sent him out on the robbers trail  the constable combined sound sense with dogged pertinacity and these were serviceable qualities  it was a hot afternoon when george brought home his last load of wild sloo hay walking beside his team while flora curbed her reckless horse a few yards off  she had ridden over with her father and finding that george had not returned had gone on to prevent a hired man from being sent for him  they had met each other frequently of late and george was sensible of an increasing pleasure in the girls society though what flora felt did not appear  behind them the jolting wagon strained beneath its highpiled load that diffused an odor of peppermint in front the shadow of a bluff lay cool upon the sunscorched prairie  i suppose you heard that baxter lost a steer last week she said most likely it was killed but though the police searched the reservation there was no trace of the hide  we have had a little quietness but im not convinced that our troubles wont break out again  nobody seems to have heard anything of flett  hes no doubt busy somewhere  im inclined to believe so and in a way his silence is reassuring flett can work without making a disturbance and that is in his favor but what has become of mr west  we havent seen much of him of late  he has fallen into a habit of riding over to the settlement in his spare time which isnt plentiful  ah exclaimed flora that agrees with some suspicions of mine dont you feel a certain amount of responsibility  i do george admitted  still hes rather headstrong and he hasnt told me why he goes to the butte though the girls father gave me a hint  i like tauntonhes perfectly straightforwardand id almost made up my mind to ask your opinion about the matter but i was diffident  ill give it to you without reservetheres no ground for uneasiness on wests account he might fall into much worse hands  if helen taunton has any influence over him it will be wisely used  besides she has been well educated she spent a few years in montreal  she has a nice face in fact shes decidedly pretty  and that would cover a multitude of shortcomings  well said george thoughtfully mere physical beauty is something to be thankful for though im not sure that beauty can be so to speak altogether physical  when i said the girl had a nice face i meant that its expression suggested a wholesome character  you seem to have been cultivating your powers of observation flora told him  but im more disposed to consider the matter from helens point of view  as it happens shes a friend of mine and ive reasons for believing that your partners readily susceptible and inclined to be fickle  of course im not jealous  george laughed  hes too venturesome now and then but he has been a little spoiled ive an idea that this affair is likely to be permanent  he has shown a keen interest in the price of land and the finances of farming which struck me as having its meaning  they had now nearly reached the bluff and a horseman in khaki uniform rode out of it to meet them  ive been over to your place he said to george when he had dismounted  i was sent to show you a photograph and ask if you can recognize anybody in it  he untied a packet and george studied the picture handed him  it showed the rutted main street of a little western town with the sunlight on a row of wooden buildings  in the distance a band of cattle were being driven forward by two mounted men nearer at hand a few wagons stood outside a livery stable and in the foreground three or four figures occupied the veranda of a frame hotel  the ease of their attitudes suggested that they did not know they were being photographed and their faces were distinct  george looked triumphantly excited and unhesitatingly laid a finger on one face  this is the man that drove off mr grants percheron and stabbed my horse  the trooper produced a thin piece of card and a small readingglass  take another look through this it came along with the photograph now would you be willing to swear to him  ill be glad to do so if i have the chance  shall i put a mark against the fellow  not on that  the trooper handed george the card which proved to be a carefully drawn keyplan of the photograph with the figures outlined  you can mark this one  george did as he was told and then handed the photograph to flora  how did your people get it he asked the trooper  i cant say they dont go into explanations  but what do you think  did flett take the photograph  no sir i heard him tell the sergeant he knew nothing about a camera he may have got somebody to take it or may have bought the thing  do you know where he is  i only know he got special orders after mr grant was robbed  its my idea he was somewhere around when the photograph was taken  i wonder where it was taken  in alberta perhaps though im inclined to think it was on the other side of the frontier  that is my opinion said flora  theres not a great difference between us and our neighbors but the dress of the mounted men and the style of the stores are somehow american  id say montana or perhaps dakota  montana said the trooper  the big bunch of cattle seems to fix it  then you think flett is over there asked george  im interested so is miss grant and you neednt be afraid of either of us spreading what you say  its my notion that flett has spotted his men but i guess hes now watching out near the boundary in canada  these rustler fellows cant do all their business on one side theyll have to cross now and then fletts in touch with some of the american sheriffs wholl give him the tip and the first time the fellows slip over the frontier hell get them  that would suit everybody better and save a blamed lot of formalities  flora nodded  it strikes me as very likely and fletts perhaps the best man you could have sent  but have you shown the photograph to my father  i did that before i left the homestead  theres nobody in the picture like the fellow who drove with mr grant and he tells me he saw nobody else  now i must be getting on  he rode away and flora reverted to the topic she and george had been discussing  so you believe mr west is thinking of living here altogether  i suppose he would be able to take a farm of moderate size  it wouldnt be very large he cant have much money but his people would help him to make a start if they were satisfied  that means they would consult me  flora smiled  and you feel you would be in a difficult position if you were asked whether it would be wise to let him marry a prairie girl  have you formed any decision about the matter  she spoke in an indifferent tone but george imagined that she was interested  i cant see why he shouldnt do so  think a little  west has been what you call well brought up hes fastidious and i havent found english people free from social prejudices  could you as his friend contemplate his marrying the daughter of a storekeeper in a rather primitive western town  taunton of course is not a polished man  i dont think that counts hes a very good type in spite of it  the girls pretty she has excellent manners and she strikes me as having senseand in some respects edgar has very little  ill admit that at one time i might not have approved of the idea but i believe ive got rid of one or two foolish opinions that i brought out with me  if miss taunton is what she appears to be hes lucky in getting her  dont you think so  he had spoken with a little warmth though as flora knew he was seldom emphatic and a rather curious expression crept into her face he did not quite understand it but he thought she was pleased for some reason or other  oh she said lightly i have told you my opinion  nothing further was said about the subject but george walked beside his team in a state of calm content  his companion was unusually gracious she made a picture that was pleasant to watch as she sat finely poised on the big horse with the strong sunlight on her face her voice was attractive too it reached him clear and musical through the thud of hoofs and the creak of slowlyturning wheels for he made no attempt to hurry his team  when they reached the homestead the conversation centered on the constables visit and when the grants left edgar stood outside with george watching the slender mounted figure grow smaller beside the jolting buggy  george he said ive met very few girls who could compare with flora grant taking her all round  thats correct george told him  as a matter of fact im doubtful whether you have met any who would bear the comparison  it was the sillier ones who made a fuss over you  i know of one edgar resumed  as it happens shes in canada  id a suspicion of something of the kind george said dryly  edgar made no answer but presently he changed the subject  whats the least one could take up a farm here with and have a fair chance of success  one understands it has been done with practically nothing on preempted land though im rather dubious  in your case id fix five thousand dollars as the minimum more would be decidedly better  yes said edgar thoughtfully thats about my idea and i suppose it could be raised though my share of what was left us has nearly all been spent in cramming me with knowledge ive no great use for stephen however has done pretty well and i think he always realized that it would be his privilege to give me a lift ive no doubt hell write to you as soon as i mention the matter and your answer will have its effect  he looked at george with anxious eyes  i venture to think youll strain a point to say what you can in my favor  in the first place ill ride over to the butte and have supper with taunton as soon as i can find the time  thanks responded edgar gratefully you wont have any doubts after that  then he broke into laughter  youll excuse me but its really funny george  i dont see the joke george said shortly  edgar tried to look serious and failed  i can imagine your trying to weigh up helen starting a subtle conversation to elucidate her character and showing what you were after and your profound ignorance with every word though you mustnt suppose id be afraid of submitting her to the severest test  why you wouldnt even know when a girl was in love with you unless she told you so  perhaps its some excuse that your minds fixed on one woman to the exclusion of all the rest though one could imagine that as you think of her shes as unreal and as far removed from anything made of flesh and blood as a saint in a picture  after all i dare say its a very proper feeling  george left him half amused and half disturbed  he did not resent edgars freedom of speech but the latter had a way of mixing hints that were not altogether foolish with his badinage and his comrade was inclined to wonder what he had meant by one suggestive remark  it troubled him as he strolled along the edge of the tall green wheat but he comforted himself with the thought that after all edgars conversation was often unworthy of serious consideration  a week later george rode over to the store at the settlement feeling a little diffident because he had undertaken the visit only from a sense of duty  he was cordially received and was presently taken in to supper which was served in a pretty room and presided over by a very attractive girl  she had a pleasant voice and a quiet face though he thought she must have guessed his errand she treated him with a composure that set him at his ease  indeed she was by no means the kind of girl he had expected edgar to choose but this was in her favor  george could find no fault in her  shortly after the meal was finished his host was called away and the girl looked up at george with a flush of color creeping most becomingly into her face  edgar told me i neednt be afraid of you she said  george smiled  i can understand his confidence though it had a better foundation than my goodnature  i wonder whether i might venture to say that he has shown remarkably good sense  im glad you dont think he has been very foolish replied the girl and it was obvious to george that she understood the situation  he made her a little grave bow  what ive said im ready to stick to  im a friend of edgars and that carried an obligation  yes she assented but it was because you are a friend of his and in a way represent his people in england that i was a little uneasy  her speech implied a good deal and george admired her candor  well he said so far as i am concerned you must never feel anything of the kind again  but i think you should have known it was quite unnecessary  she gave him a grateful glance and soon afterward her father came in  guess well take a smoke in the back office he said to george  george followed him and thought he understood why he was led into the little untidy room strewn with packets of goods though his host had a fine commodious house  taunton would not attempt to dissociate himself from his profession he meant to be taken for what he was but he knew his value  he was a gaunt elderly man as far as his general appearance went a typical inhabitant of a remote and halfdeveloped western town though there was a hint of authority in his face  giving george an excellent cigar he pointed to a chair  now he began we must have a talk  when your partner first came hanging round my store buying things he didnt want i was kind of short with him  helen helps me now and then with the books and he seemed to know when she came in  i noticed he came home in a rather bad temper once or twice george said with a laugh  i used to wonder when he produced sardine cans at supper but after a while i began to understand  well continued taunton i didnt intend to have any blamed percy trying to turn my girls head until i knew what he meant  id nobody to talk it over withi lost her mother long agoso i kind of froze him out until one day he came dawdling in and asked if he might take helen to jim haxtons dance  does she know you have come to me about it i said  cant say he told me coolly with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth  i havent mentioned the matter yet i thought id ask you first  spose i object i said  then he allowed quite tranquil the thing will have to be considered  theres not the slightest reason why you should object  id a notion i could agree with himi liked the way he talkedand i told him helen could go but the next time he called he was to walk right into the office instead of hanging round the counter  i asked him what hed done with all the canned truck hed bought and he said he was inclined to think his partner had eaten most of it  since then hes been over pretty often and i figured it was time i gave you a hint  thanks responded george  he was in a way placed in my hands but ive no real control over him  thats so hes of age  what i felt was thisive nothing against west but my girls good enough for anybody and i cant have his people in england looking down on her and making trouble  if theyre not satisfied they had better call him back right now  theres to be no hightoned condescension in this matter  i dont think you need be afraid of that said george  it would be altogether uncalled for  its very likely that i shall be consulted and ill have pleasure in telling his people that i consider him a lucky man  theres another pointhas west any means  i believe about five thousand dollars could be raised to put him on a farm  taunton nodded  its not very much but i dont know that im sorry  ill see theyre fixed right whatever west gets ill beat  my girl shant be indebted to her husbands folks  but theres not a word to be said about this yet  west must wait another year before we decide on anything  george thought the storekeepers attitude could not be found fault with and when he drove home through the soft dusk of the summer night he was glad to feel that there was no need for anxiety about the choice edgar had made     chapter xxviii  the leading witness  three or four weeks passed quietly without any news from flett until one evening when edgar sat talking to miss taunton in the office of her fathers store at sage butte  the little dusty room was unpleasantly hot and filled with the smell of resinous pine boards there was a drawl of voices and an occasional patter of footsteps outside the door and a big book which seemed to have no claim on her attention lay open on the table in front of the girl  she was listening to edgar with a smile in her eyes and looking so he thought remarkably attractive in her light summer dress which left her pretty round arms uncovered to the elbow and displayed the polished whiteness of her neck  he was expressing his approval of the current fashions which he said were rational and particularly becoming to people with skins like ivory  indeed he was so engrossed in his subject that he did not hear footsteps approaching until his companion flashed a warning glance at him and he swung round with some annoyance as the door opened  i guessed i would find you here said the stationagent looking in with an indulgent smile  youre a thoughtful man retorted edgar  you may as well tell me what you want  ive a wire from flett sent at hatfield down the line  what can he be doing there edgar exclaimed and miss taunton showed her interest  he was coming through on the train  wanted mr lansing to meet him at the station if he was in town  hadnt you better go along  i suppose so said edgar resignedly glancing at his watch  it looks as if your men had taken their time  flett should be here in about a quarter of an hour now  operator had train orders to get through we have two freights sidetracked the agent explained  dont be late shes coming along on time  he hurried out and a few minutes later edgar crossed the street and strolled along the low wooden platform upon which a smart constable was waiting  a long trail of smoke drawing rapidly nearer streaked the gray and ochre of the level plain and presently the big engine and dusty cars rolled into the station amid the hoarse tolling of the bell as they ran slowly past him edgar saw a police trooper leaning out from a vestibule and when the train stopped the constable on the platform hurried toward the car  a hum of excited voices broke out and edgar had some difficulty in pushing through the growing crowd to reach the steps  a constable who had hard work to keep the others back let him pass and he found flett standing on the platform above looking rather jaded with a pistol loose in his holster  isnt mr lansing here flett asked eagerly and then turned to the trooper  keep those fellows off  no answered edgar he hasnt come into town  but whats the cause of this commotion  have you got your men  three of them said flett with a look of pride  i expect well get the fourth  but come in a minute out of the noise  the car was besieged  curious men were clambering up the side of it trying to peer in through the windows others disputed angrily with the trooper who drove them off the steps  eager questions were shouted and scraps of random information given and groups of people were excitedly running across the street to the station  it was however a little quieter in the vestibule when flett had banged the door  he next opened the inner door that led to the smoking compartment of the colonist car  in spite of its roominess it was almost insufferably hot and very dirty the sunlight struck in through the windows sand and fine cinders lay thick upon the floor  a pile of old blue blankets lay neatly folded on one of the wooden seats and on those adjoining sat three men  two wore brown duck overalls gray shirts and big soft hats one was dressed in threadbare cloth but there was nothing that particularly suggested the criminal in any of their sunburned faces they looked hot and weary with the journey and though their expression was perhaps a little hard they looked like harvest hands traveling in search of work  one who was quietly smoking took his pipe from his mouth and spoke to flett  cant you get us some ice he asked  the water in the tank isnt fit to drink  they havent any here  youll have to wait until we get to the junction flett told him and drew edgar back into the vestibule  were taking them right along to regina he explained  im sorry i couldnt see mr lansing but ill ride over as soon as im sent back if hes likely to be away hed better send word to the station  i dont expect hell leave the farm during the next few weeks said edgar  then one of the constables looked in  conductor says he cant hold up the train  ill be off said edgar with a smile at flett  this should mean promotion its a fine piece of work  he jumped down as the train pulled out and hurried back to the store where miss taunton was eagerly awaiting news  soon afterward he left and as he rode up to the homestead day was breaking but he found george already at work in the stable  its lucky we dont need your horse  if youre going to keep up this kind of thing you had better buy an automobile he remarked  edgar laughed  i dont feel remarkably fresh but ill hold out until tonight theres the fallowing to be got on with i suppose nothing must interfere with that  but arent you up a little earlier than usual  i want to haul in the posts for the new fence  grierson has his hands full and now that there are four of us jake spends so much time in cooking  a reckless waste of precious minutes edgar exclaimed ironically if one could only get over these troublesome bodily needs you could add hours of work to every week and make sylvia marston rich  by the way jakes cooking is getting awful  he put up his horse and busied himself with several tasks before he went in to breakfast  when it was finished and the others went out he detained george  what did you think of that meal he asked  well said george it might have been better  edgar laughed scornfully  it would take some time to tell you my opinion but i may as well point out that youre paying a big bill for stores to taunton though we never get anything fit to eat  helen and i were talking over your account and she wondered what we did with the things besides giving me an idea  its thiswhy dont you tell grierson to bring out his wife  i never thought of it  she might not come and she may not cook much better than jake  she certainly couldnt cook worse  i expect she would save her wages and she would set a hired man free  jake can drive a team  its a good idea george agreed  send grierson in  the man came a few minutes later  we get on pretty well i suppose you are willing to stay with me george said to him  grierson hesitated and looked disturbed  the fact is id be very sorry to leave but im afraid ill have to by and by  you see ive got to find a place i can take my wife to  can she cook  yes said grierson indicating the remnants on the table with contempt  she would do better than this with her eyes shut  then he continued eagerly she can wash and mend clothes  ive noticed that you and mr west throw half your things away long before you need to  thats true edgar admitted  its the custom of the country times too valuable to spend in mending anything though ive noticed that one or two of the people who tell you about the value of time get through a good deal of it lounging round the sachem  anyway amateur launderings an abomination and im most successful in washing the buttons and wristbands off  he turned to his companion  george youll have to send for mrs grierson  the matter was promptly arranged and when grierson went out with a look of keen satisfaction edgar laughed  i feel like pointing out how far an idea can go  helen only thought of making me a little more comfortable and you see the result of itgrierson and his wife united things put into shape here four people content  of course one could cite a more striking example i mean when sylvia marston thought you had better go out and look after her farm  theres no need to mention the farreaching consequences that opinion had  i volunteered to go out george corrected him  well said edgar i quite believe you did so  but youre no doubt pining to get at the fence  they went off to work but edgar driving the gangplow through the stubble under a scorching sun thought that sylvias idea might bear more fruit than she had calculated on and that it would be bitter to her  his mind however was chiefly occupied with a more attractive person and once when he turned the heavy horses at the end of the furrows he said softly may i deserve her and looked up with a tense expression in his hot face as if making some firm resolve which was a procedure that would have astonished even those who knew him well  a week passed each day growing brighter and hotter until the glare flung back by sandy soil and whitening grass became painful and george and his assistants discarded most of their clothing when they went about their tasks  the oats began to show a silvery gleam as they swayed in the strong light the wheat was changing color and there were warm coppery gleams among the heavy ears horses and cattle sought the poplars shade  then one evening when the grants had driven over flett arrived at the homestead and sitting on the stoop as the air grew cooler related his adventures  i guess my chiefs wouldnt be pleased to hear me were not encouraged to talk but theres a reason for it as youll see when im through he said and plunged abruptly into his narrative  it proved to be a moving tale of weary rides in scorching heat and in the dusk of night of rebuffs and daunting failures  flett as he admitted had several times been cleverly misled and had done some unwise things but he had never lost his patience nor relaxed his efforts  slowly and doggedly picking up scraps of information where he could he had trailed his men to the frontier where his real troubles had begun  once that he crossed it he had no authority and the american sheriffs and deputies were not invariably sympathetic some he concluded were unduly influenced by local opinion which was not in favor of interfering with people who confined their depredations to canadian horses  others who acknowledged past favors from regina foresaw troublesome complications before he could be allowed to deport the offenders but some with a strong sense of duty offered willing help and that was how he had been able to make the arrests on canadian soil  now he concluded we tracked these men from point to point and ive evidence to prove most of their moves but they never had the four horses in a bunch until they made montana which is a point against us we can show they were working as a gang that they were altogether with the horses on american soil but as we havent corralled the only man mr grant could swear to theres only one way of proving how they got them  you see where all this leads  it looks as if you depended on my evidence for a conviction said george  flett nodded  you saw mr grant attacked and the horses run off  you can identify one man and well connect him with the rest  he took out a paper and handed it to george  its my duty to serve you with this and now that its done ill warn you to watch out until after the trial  if we can convict these fellows we smash the crowd but wed be helpless without you  george opened the document and found it a formal summons to attend the court at regina on a date specified  then he produced another paper and gave it to flett with a smile  the opposition seem to recognize my importance and they move more quickly than the police  the trooper took the letter which was typed and bore no date or name of place  keep off this trial and youll have no more trouble he read aloud back up the police and youll be sorry  if you mean to drop them drive over to the butte thursday and get supper at the queens  yesterday was thursday and i didnt go george said after a moments silence  the quiet intimation was not a surprise to any of them and flett nodded as he examined the letter  not much of a clue he remarked  toronto paper thats sold at every store mailed two stations down the line  nobody would have met you at the queens but most anybody in town would know if you had been there anyway ill take this along he rose  i cant stop but i want to say were not afraid of your backing down  he rode off in a few more minutes and after a while the grants took their leave but flora walked down the trail with george while the team was being harnessed  youll be careful wont you she said  these men are dangerous they know yours is the most important evidence  i shall be anxious until the trial  there was something in her eyes and voice that sent a curious thrill through george  i dont think thats needful i certainly wont be reckless he said  then flora got into the vehicle and during the next week or two george took precautions  indeed he now and then felt a little uncomfortable when he had occasion to pass a shadowy bluff  he carried a pistol when he went around the outbuildings at night and fell into a habit of stopping to listen ready to strike or shoot each time he opened the door of one in the dark  for all that nothing occurred to excite suspicion and after a while he felt inclined to smile at his nervousness  at length one day when the trial was close at hand and edgar had gone to the butte the mailcarrier brought him a note from grant  it consisted of a couple of lines asking him to come over during the evening and as supper had been finished two hours before george realized that there was not much time to spare  laying down the note he walked to the door and called his canadian hired man  put the saddle on the brown horse jake im going to grants  the man did as he was bidden and when george was about to mount handed him a repeating rifle  better take this along cylinders full he said  it will be dark before you get there  george hesitated  the rifle was heavy but it was a more reliable weapon than a pistol and he rode off with it  the sun had dipped when he started the air was rapidly cooling and after spending the day sinking holes for fence posts in the scorching sun he found the swift motion and the little breeze that fanned his face pleasant  to the northwest a flush of vivid crimson glowed along the horizon but the sweep of grass was growing dim and a bluff he reached at length stood out a sharpcut dusky mass against the fading light  he pulled up his horse on its outskirts  a narrow trail led through the wood its entrance marked by a dark gap among the shadowy trees and it somehow looked forbidding  the bluff however stretched across his path it was getting late and george was a little impatient of the caution he had been forced to exercise  laying his rifle ready across the saddle he sent his horse forward  it was quite dark in the bluff though here and there he could see a glimmer of faint red and orange between the trees and the stillness had a slightly disturbing effect on him  not a leaf moved the beat of his horses hoofs rang sharply down the narrow trail above which the thin birch branches met  he wanted to get out into the open where he could see about as soon as possible  there was however no ostensible cause for uneasiness and he rode on quietly until he heard a soft rustling among the slender trunks  pulling up the horse he called out and as he half expected got no answer  then he cast a swift glance ahead  there was a gleam of dim light not far away where the trail led out of the bluff  throwing the rifle to his shoulder george fired into the shadows  the horse plunged violently and broke into a frightened gallop  george heard a whistle and a sharper rustling and rode toward the light at a furious pace  then his horse suddenly stumbled and came down  the rifle flew out of georges hand and he was hurled against a tree  the next moment he felt himself rudely seized and what he thought was a jacket was wrapped about his head  shaken by his fall he could make no effective resistance and he was dragged a few yards through the bush and flung into a wagon  he tried to pull the jacket from his face and failed somebody brutally beat him down against the side of the vehicle when he struggled to get up  he heard a whip crack the wagon swayed and jolted and he knew the team was starting at a gallop     chapter xxix  floras enlightenment  it was nearly midnight when edgar returned from the settlement and saw to his surprise lights still burning in the homestead  entering the livingroom he found grierson sitting there with jake and it struck him that they looked uneasy  whats keeping you up he asked  i thought id wait for the boss said the canadian  he went over to grants after supper and hes not come back  thats curious  he said nothing about going  a note came by the mail  its lying yonder  edgar picked it up and brought it near the lamp  the paper was good and printed with grants postal address which was lengthy  i figured id go and meet him jake resumed took the shotgun and rode through the bluff  didnt see anything of him and it struck me grant might have kept him all night as it was getting late  hes stayed there before  edgar examined the note for he was far from satisfied  george had only twice spent a night at grants once when he was driving cattle and again when it would have been risky to face the weather  the paper was undoubtedly grants but edgar could not identify the farmers hand the notes that had come over had been written by flora  then he remembered that george had bought some implements from grant and had filed the ranchers receipt  edgar hurriedly found it and compared it with the letter  then his face grew troubled for the writing was not the same  im afraid mr lansing never got to grants he said  ill ride over at once  then im coming jake said shortly  ill bring the gun along  grierson lifted a clenched brown hand  so am i  if mr lansings hurt somebodys got to pay  edgar was stirred by something in their looks and voices george had gained a hold on these mens loyalty which the regular payment of wages could never have given him  he merely signified assent and running out sprang into the saddle  the others had evidently had their horses ready for he heard them riding after him in a minute or two though he was galloping recklessly through the bluff when they came up  the homestead was dark when they reached it and they shouted once or twice before grant came down  is george here edgar asked  no said grant we didnt expect him  then get on your clothes quick  theres work on hand  grant brought him in and struck a light then hurriedly left the room and flora came with him fully dressed when he reappeared  edgar supposed she had heard his sharp inquiry at the door and he noticed that her expression was strained  he threw the note on the table  after what you said i neednt ask if you wrote that  i didnt grant told him  its not like my hand  i suppose lansing started when he got it and has not come back  you have guessed right  where are they likely to have waylaid him and where will they probably take him  the bluff sure  they might head north for empty country or south for the frontier  the frontier flora broke in  its what i think said edgar  shall i send a man for flett or will you  thats fixed anyway said a voice outside the open door  were not going  it was obvious that the hired men had followed them as far as the passage for grierson entering the room explained  he means weve made up our minds to look for mr lansing  grant nodded in assent  then my man goes  turn out the boys jake you know the place  i want three horses saddled quick  four said flora firmly  im coming  grant did not try to dissuade her  write to flett he said  he went out hastily in search of blankets and provisions and when he returned his hired men had gathered about the door and the note was finished  he threw it to one of them  ride with that as hard as you can he said and called another youll come with us  were a strong party already edgar broke in  youre leaving the place poorly guarded and the rustlers may have counted on something of the kind  suppose they finish their work by driving off every beast thats left as soon as we have gone  ive got to take my chances well want the boys to make a thorough search  grant swung round toward the remaining men  you two will watch out behind the woodstack or in the granary  no strangers to come near house or stable  the woodpile said flora with a hard white face and an ominous sparkle in her eyes  you would command the outbuildings there  if anybody tries to creep up at night call once and then shoot to kill  edgar saw that she meant her instructions to be carried out but he forced a smile  and this is the canadian wheatbelt which i was told was so peaceful and orderly  it looks as if you had been misinformed flora rejoined with a cold collectedness which he thought of as dangerous  one however now and then hears of violent crime in london  they were mounted in a few minutes and after a hard ride the party broke up at dawn dispersing so that each member of it could make independent search and inquiries at the scattered homesteads  meeting places and means of communication were arranged but flora and her father rode together pushing on steadily southward over the vast gray plain  little was said except when they called at some outlying farm but grant now and then glanced at the girls set face with keenly scrutinizing eyes  in the middle of the scorching afternoon he suggested that she should await his return at a homestead in the distance but was not surprised when she uncompromisingly refused they spent the night at a small ranch borrowed fresh horses in the morning and set out again but they found no trace of the fugitives during the day and it was evening when edgar and grierson joined them as arranged at a lonely farm  the two men rode in wearily on jaded horses and flora who was the first to notice their approach went out to meet them  nothing she said when she saw their dejected faces  nothing edgar listlessly answered  if the people we have seen arent in league with the rustlersand i dont think thats probablethe fellows must have gone a different way  theyve gone south flora insisted  we may be a little too far to the east of their track  then we must try a different line of country tomorrow  the farmers wife had promised to find flora quarters the men were offered accommodation in a barn and when the air cooled sharply in the evening edgar walked out on to the prairie with the girl  she had kept near him since his arrival but he was inclined to believe this was rather on account of his association with george than because she found any charm in his society  by and by they sat down on a low rise from which they could see the sweep of grass run on changing to shades of blue and purple toward the smoky red glare of sunset on its western rim  to the south it was all dim and steeped in dull neutral tones conveying an idea of vast distance  flora shivered drawing her thin linen jacket together while she buttoned it and edgar noticed something beneath it that broke the outline of her waist  whats that at your belt he asked  a magazine pistol she answered with a rather harsh laugh producing the beautifully made weapon  its a pretty thing  i wonder whether you can use it  will you stand up at about twenty paces and hold out your hat  certainly not said edgar firmly  i wouldnt mind putting it on a stick only that the shot would bring the others out  but ive no doubt you can handle a pistol youre a curious people  he thought the last remark was justified  here was a girl as refined and highly trained in many ways as any he had met and yet who owned a dangerous weapon and could use it effectively  then there was her father an industrious peaceable farmer whose attention was as a rule strictly confined to the amassing of money but who was nevertheless capable of riding or shooting down the outlaws who molested him or his friends  what made the thing more striking was that neither of them had been used to alarms they had dwelt in calm security until the past twelve months  edgar however remembered that they sprang from a stock that had struggled sternly for existence with forest and flood and frost no doubt in time of stress the strong primitive strain came uppermost  their nature had not been altogether softened by civilization  the thought flung a useful light upon floras character  if the trials a lengthy one and these fellows hold him up until its over it will be a serious thing for george he resumed by way of implying that this was the worst that could befall his comrade  the grains ripening fast and he hasnt made his arrangements for harvest yet  men seem pretty scarce around here just now  its a good crop im glad of that said flora willing to avoid the graver side of the topic  mr lansing was anxious about it but this harvest should set him on his feet  i suppose he hasnt paid off the full price of the farm  as a matter of fact he hasnt paid anything at all  then has he only rented the place  there was surprise and strong interest in the girls expression and edgar saw that he had made a telling admission  however he did not regret it  no he said thats not the case either  the farm is still mrs marstons  ah  theres something i dont understand  edgar was sorry for her and he felt that she was entitled to an explanation  indeed since george was strangely unobservant he thought it should have been made earlier but the matter had appeared too delicate for him to meddle with  now however when the girls nature was strongly stirred there was a risk that supposing his comrade was discovered wounded or was rescued in some dramatic way she might be driven to a betrayal of her feelings that would seriously embarrass george and afterward cause her distress  george he explained is merely carrying on the farm as mrs marstons trustee  but that hardly accounts for his keen eagerness to make his farming profitable  it strikes one as springing from something stronger than his duty as trustee  edgar nodded  well you see he is in love with her  flora sat quite still for a moment or two and then laugheda little bitter laugh she was overstrained and could not repress it  a flood of hot color surged into her face but in another moment she had recovered some degree of composure  so that is why he came out she said  yes he was in love with her before she married marston  at least thats his impression  his impression echoed flora keenly anxious to cover any signs of the shock she had received and to learn all that could be told  do you mean that mr lansing doesnt know whether he is in love with her or not  no not exactly  edgar felt that he was on dangerous ground  im afraid i cant quite explain what i really do mean  george of course is convinced about the thing but ive a suspicion that he may be mistaken though hed be very indignant if he heard me say so  he paused doubtful whether he was handling the matter prudently but he felt that something must be done to relieve the strain and continued  george has the faculty of respectful admiration highly developed but he doesnt use it with much judgment in fact hes a rather reckless idealist  there are excuses for him he was never much thrown into womens society  you think that explains it flora forced a smile  but go on  my idea is that george has been led by admiration and pity and not by love at all  i dont think he knows the difference hes not much of a psychologist  then you see hes thorough and having got an idea into his mind it possesses him and drives him to action  he doesnt stop to analyze his feelings  so he came out to look after mrs marstons property because he felt sorry for her and believed her worthy of respect  what is your opinion of her  ill confess that i wish she hadnt captivated george  floras face grew very scornful  i havent your chivalrous scruples and i know mrs marston  shes utterly worthless  what is likely to happen when your comrade finds it out  then she rose abruptly  after all thats a matter which chiefly concerns mr lansing and i dare say the woman he believes in will be capable of dealing with the situation  lets talk of something else  they turned back toward the farm but edgar found it difficult to start a fresh topic  all the workings of his mind centered upon george and he suspected that his companions thoughts had a similar tendency  it was getting dark when they rejoined the rest of the party and the next morning flett and another constable rode in  they had discovered nothing but as they were ready to take up the trail grant left the task to them and turned back with his men  flora long remembered the dreary two days ride for although she had borne it with courage edgars news had caused her a painful shock she had from the beginning been strongly drawn to george and when he had been carried off the knowledge that she loved him had been brought home to her  now looking back with rudely opened eyes there was little comfort in recognizing that he had made no demands on her affection  bitter as she was she could not blame him she had been madly foolish and must suffer for it  she called her pride to the rescue but it failed her  the torturing anxiety about the mans fate remained and with it a humiliating regret which was not altogether selfish that it was sylvia marston he had chosen  sylvia who was clever had of course tricked him but this was no consolation  it was however needful to hide her feelings from her father and assume an interest in his remarks though when he spoke it was always of lansing and what had probably befallen him  the prairie was dazzlingly bright the trail they followed was thick with fine black dust and most of the day the heat was trying the girl felt utterly jaded and very heavy of heart but when it appeared desirable she forced herself to talk  her father must never suspect her folly though she wondered uneasily how far she might have betrayed it to west  reaching the homestead at length she resumed her duties and anxiously waited for news of george  once that she heard he was safe it would she thought be easier to drive him out of her mind forever  as it happened george had received only a few bruises in the bluff and after realizing that there was no chance of escape for the present he lay still in the bottom of the wagon  he blamed himself for riding so readily into the trap since it was obvious that his assailants had known he was going to visit grant and had stretched a strand of fence wire or something of the kind across the trail  they would have removed it afterward and there would be nothing left to show what had befallen him  this however was a matter of minor consequence and he endeavored to determine which way his captors were driving judging the nature of the trail by the jolting he decided that they meant to leave the wood where he entered it which suggested that they were going south and this was what he had anticipated  though he was sore from the effect of his fall and the rough handling which had followed it he did not think he would suffer any further violence so long as he made no attempt to get away  the men no doubt only intended to prevent his giving evidence by keeping him a prisoner until after the trial  when morning came the wagon was still moving at a good pace though the roughness of the motion indicated that it was not following a trail  this was all george could discover because one of the men tied his arms and legs before removing the jacket which had muffled his head  i guess you cant get up but it wouldnt be wise to try the fellow pointed out significantly  george took the hint  he meant to escape and attend the court but he had no wish to ruin any chance of his doing so by making a premature attempt  his captors meant to prevent his seeing which way they were going but he could make out that the sky was brightest on the left side of the wagon which indicated that they were heading south  they stopped at noon in a thick bluff from which when he was released and allowed to get down he could see nothing of the prairie  only one man remained to watch him but as he was armed and george could hear the others not far away he decided that his escape must be postponed  during the afternoon they went on again george occupying his former position in the bottom of the wagon where it was unpleasantly hot but the strongest glare was now on his right side which showed him that they were still holding south  their destination was evidently the american frontier  in the evening they camped near a thicket of low scrub and after supper george was permitted to wander about and stretch his aching limbs  it was rolling country broken by low rises and he could not see more than a mile or two  there was nothing that served as a landmark and as soon as he began to stroll away from the camp he was sharply recalled  in the end he sat down to smoke and did not move until he was told to get into the wagon where a blanket was thrown him  so far he had been permitted to see only one of his captors near at hand  the next morning they set out again  george thought that fresh horses had been obtained in the night because they drove at a rapid pace most of the day and he was tired and sore with the jolting when they camped in another bluff at sunset  two more days were spent in much the same way and then late at night they stopped at a little building standing in the midst of an unbroken plain and george was released and told to get out  one of the men lighted a lantern and led him into an empty stable built of thick sods  it looked as if it had not been occupied for a long time but part of it had been roughly boarded off as if for a harness room or store  you have got your blanket said his companion  put it down where you like  theres only one door to this place and you cant get at it without passing me  i got a sleep in the wagon and dont want any more tonight  george heard the vehicle jolt away and sat down to smoke while the beat of hoofs gradually sank into the silence of the plain  then he wrapped his blanket about him and went to sleep on the earthen floor     chapter xxx  the escape  george got up the next morning feeling cramped and sore after his journey and carefully looked about  the building had solid walls of sod such rude stalls as it had been fitted with had been removed perhaps for the sake of the lumber  he could not reach the door without alarming his jailer who had taken up his quarters behind the board partition and there was only one small window placed high up and intended mainly for ventilation  the window was very dusty but it opened and george could see out by standing up though the aperture was not large enough to squeeze through  outside stood some timbers which had once formed part of a shack and a few strands of fence wire trailing from tottering posts ran into the grass  the place appeared to have been a farm whose owner had no doubt abandoned it after finding the soil too light or after losing a crop by frost but george was more curious to discover if there were any other homesteads in the vicinity  his view was restricted but there was no sign of life on the quartercircle it commanded  a flat grassy waste broken only by a few clumps of brush ran back to the horizon and by the cold blue of the sky and the drift of a few light clouds floating before the prevalent westerly wind he knew he was looking north  this was the way he must take if he could escape but there was no house in which he could seek refuge and scarcely any cover  it was clear that he must obtain a good start before he was missed  he had an idea that he would escape though he admitted that it was more optimistic than rational  then he turned with a start to see his jailer standing beside him grinning  the man had a hard determined face  guess you cant get out that way and it wouldnt be much use anyhow he drawled  the countrys pretty open it would take you a mighty long while to get out of sight  thats how it struck me george confessed with an air of goodhumored resignation  do you mean to keep me here any time  until the trial the other answered standing a little away from him with his hand thrust suggestively into a pocket  well be glad to get rid of you when its finished but you certainly cant get away before we let you go  george cast a glance of keen but unobtrusive scrutiny at the man  they were he thought about equal in physical strength the others superiority consisted in his being armed and george had no doubt that he was proficient with his weapons  he had seen a rifle carried into the building the mans hand was now resting on a pistol and there was a light ax outside  it looked as if an attempt to escape would be attended with a serious risk and george realized that he must wait until chance or some slackening of vigilance on his custodians part equalized matters  he was given breakfast and afterward told that he could go out and split some wood which he was glad to do  there was a pile of branches and a few rotten boards that had once formed part of the shack and he set to work to break them up while the rustler sat and smoked in the doorway  the man ran no risk in doing so there was not a bush within a quarter of a mile and george knew that a bullet would speedily cut short his flight  he could see nothing that promised a secure hiding place all the way to the skyline and he thought that the plain ran on beyond it as little broken  when he had cut some wood he turned back toward the door and the man regarded him with a meaning smile  come in if you want but leave the ax right there he said  he moved back a few paces out of reach of a sudden spring as george entered and the latter realized that he did not mean to be taken by surprise  during the afternoon another man arrived on horseback with some provisions and remained until george went to sleep  the following morning the stranger had disappeared but he came again once or twice and this was all that broke the monotony of the next few days  george however was beginning to feel the strain his nerves were getting raw the constant watchfulness was wearing him  the trial would now be beginning and it was time the binders were driven into his grain the oats would be ripe and his neighbors would pick up all the ontario hands who reached the settlement  another day passed and he was feeling desperate when the relief watcher arrived in the afternoon listening with strained attention he heard the men talking outside only a few words reached him but one was adjourned and it filled him with fresh determination  if he could escape it might not be too late  it was an oppressive afternoon the fresh northwest breeze had dropped the sky was clouded the air hot and heavy  both men remained about the building but george sat quietly on the earth floor smoking and waiting for night  a few large drops of rain fell splashing upon roof and grass while he ate his supper but it stopped and the evening was marked by a deep stillness  he felt listless and disinclined to move his guards to judge by their voices for they were playing cards outside were languidly irritable  dusk came and a thick obscurity unlike the usual clearness of the summer nights shut in the lonely building  it was intensely dark in the stable george could not see the relief mans horse though he could now and then hear it move  voices rose at intervals from beyond the partition but they ceased at last and only an occasional crackle of the dry grass that served for seats and bedding told that one at least of the rustlers was keeping watch  george felt his limbs quiver while he waited and he was conscious of an unpleasant tension on his nerves  there was thunder brewing and he thought the storm might offer him an opportunity for getting out  at length it struck him that the silence was unusually deep  rising to his feet he moved about  there was no challenge and by way of further experiment he kicked his tin plate so that it rattled  still nobody called to him though the horse made a little noise in moving  george sat down and took off his boots while his heart throbbed painfully  it looked as if his guards had gone to sleep  he moved a few yards stopped to listen and went on for several paces more  there was no sound yet beyond the partition and he crept softly past the horse he longed to lead it out but decided that the risk would be too great  then he stood in the gap between the wall and the partition straining eyes and ears and wondering where the rifle lay  he could see nothing however and creeping on cautiously with tingling nerves and an intolerable feeling of suspense he drew level with the doorway  it was hard to refrain from leaping out but this might make some noise crossing the threshold with careful movements he made for the spot where he had cut the wood  he struck something that rattled but he found the ax and the feel of it sent a thrill through him  it was light enough to be carried easily and he did not mean to be recaptured  for some minutes he moved straight on hurting his feet on the stronger grass stalks and then sitting down he hastily put on his boots after that he broke into a steady run which he meant to keep up as long as possible  he was now anxious that the threatened storm should not break because if the rustlers had gone to sleep the longer they remained so the better  he failed to understand how he had escaped perhaps his guards had been lulled into false security by his tranquil demeanor perhaps they had trusted to each other or one rendered listless by the tension in the air had relaxed his watchfulness for a few moments  this however did not matter  george was free and he only wished that he had some idea as to where he was heading  he wanted to place a long distance between him and the stable by morning  dripping with perspiration breathing hard he kept up a steady pace for so he thought an hour after which he walked a mile or two and then broke into a run again  the grass was short he struck no brush and the ax did not encumber him  he imagined that dawn must be getting near when a dazzling flash swept the prairie and there was a long reverberatory rumbling overhead  he was almost blinded and bewildered doubly uncertain where he was going and then a great stream of white fire fell from the zenith  the thunder that followed was deafening and for the next few minutes blaze succeeded blaze and there was a constant crashing and rumbling overhead  after that came a rush of chilly wind and the air was filled with falling water  a hot steamy smell rose about him but george who had been walking again began to run  he must use every exertion for if he were right in concluding that he had been detained on american soil his pursuers would follow him north and when daylight came a mounted mans view would command a wide sweep of level prairie  the storm passed away muttering into the distance the rain ceased and the air was fresh and cool until the sun sprang up  it was on his right hand he thought he had kept his line but he stopped to consider on the edge of a ravine  the sides of the hollow were clothed with tall wet grass and brush it would offer good cover but he could hardly avoid leaving a track if he followed it and his pursuers would search such spots  it seemed wiser to push on across the plain  descending through the thinnest brush he could find he stopped for a drink from the creek at the bottom and then went on as fast as possible  he was becoming conscious of a pain in his left side one foot felt sore and as the sun got hotter a longing to lie down a while grew steadily stronger  still he could see nothing but short gray grass ahead he must hold on there might be bluffs or broken country beyond the skyline  at length a small square block cut against the dazzling brightness and slowly grew into a lonely homestead  after some consideration george headed for it and toward noon reached a little birchlog dwelling with a sod stable beside it  both had an uncaredfor appearance which suggested their owners poverty  as george approached the door a gaunt hardfaced man in dilapidated overalls came out and gazed at him in surprise  georges clothing which had been torn when he was seized in the bluff had further suffered during the deluge  he looked a weary ragged outcast  can you give me something to eat and hire me a horse he asked  the farmer seemed suspicious  guess i want my horses for the binder im harvesting oats  ill pay you well for the time you lose george broke out  how much  thrusting his hand into his pocket george found with dismay that his wallet which contained some bills was missing  anything you ask in reason but youll have to take a check on a brandon bank  have you got a pen and paper in the house  how am i to know your checks good  the farmer laughed ironically  george was doubtful of the man but he must take a risk  my names lansing from the marston homestead beyond sage butte its a pretty big place any check i give you will be honored  the farmer looked at him with growing interest  well he said you cant have my horse  it was evident from his manner that reasoning would be useless  how does sage butte lie from here george asked him  cant tell you ive never been in the place  george realized that he had blundered both in calling at the homestead and in mentioning his name which had figured in the newspaper account of the attack on grant  the farmer it seemed had a good idea of the situation and if not in league with the rustlers was afraid of them george was wasting time and giving information that might put his pursuers on his trail  in the meanwhile he noticed a face at the window and a voice called to the man who stepped back into the house and appeared again with a big slab of cold pie  take this and light out he said  having eaten nothing since his supper george was glad of the food but he walked on smartly for an hour before he sat down in a clump of brush and made a meal  then he lighted his pipe and spent a couple of hours in much needed rest  haste was highly desirable he had no doubt that he was being followed but he could go no farther for a while  it was very hot when he got up he was sore all over and his foot was paining but he set off at a run and kept it up until he had crossed a rise two miles away  the country was getting more broken which was in his favor because the clumps of bush and the small elevations would tend to hide him  he went on until dusk without finding any water and then lay down among some tall grass in the open  there was a little bluff not far off but if the rustlers came that way he thought they would search it  it grew cold as darkness crept down indeed he imagined that the temperature had fallen to near freezingpoint as it sometimes does on the plains after a scorching day  part of the night he lay awake shivering but during the rest he slept and he rose at dawn very cold and wet with dew  his foot was very sore and he had a sharp pain in his side  for the first hour walking cost him an effort but as he grew warmer it became less difficult and his foot felt easier  then as he crossed a slight elevation he saw a faint gray smear on the far horizon and it sent a thrill through him  canadian locomotives burning native coal pour out clouds of thick black smoke which can be seen a long way in the clear air of the prairie  george was thirty or forty feet he thought above the general level of the plain the light was strong and he imagined that it would take him most of the day to reach the spot over which the smoke had floated  he was however heading for the track and he gathered his courage  he saw no more smoke for a long timethe increasing brightness seemed to diminish the clarity of the air  before noon the pain in his side had become almost insupportable and his head was swimming he felt worn out scarcely able to keep on his feet but again a gray streak on the horizon put heart into him  it did not appear to move for a while and he thought it must have been made by a freightengine working about a station  then as he came down the gradual slope of a wide depression a long bluff on its opposite verge cut the skyline a hazy smear of neutral color  he determined to reach the wood and lie down for a time in its shadow  it scarcely seemed to grow any nearer and an hour had passed before it assumed any regularity of outline  when it had grown into shape george stopped and looked about  it was fiercely hot the grass was dazzlingly bright there was no house or sign of cultivation as far as his sight ranged but on glancing back he started as he saw three small mounted figures on the plain  they had not been there when he last turned around and they were moving spread out about a mile apart  it was obvious that the rustlers were on his trail  for another moment he looked at the bluff breathing hard with his lips tight set  if he could reach the wood before he was overtaken it would offer him cover from a bullet and if he could not evade his enemies he might make a stand with the ax among the thicker trees  it was an irrational idea as he half recognized but he had grown savage with fatigue and he had already suffered as much as he was capable of bearing at the hands of the cattle thieves  now he meant to turn on them but he would be at their mercy in the open  his weariness seemed to fall away from him to give place to grim fury as he broke into a run and he did not look back for a while  when he did so the figures had grown larger one could see that they were moving swiftly and the bluff was still far away  george believed that he had been noticed and he strove to quicken his pace  the beat of hoofs was in his ears when he next looked around the three horsemen were converging growing more distinct and the bluff was still a mile ahead  he was stumbling and reeling his hat fell off and he dared not stop to pick it up  a mile was covered he would not look back again though the thud of hoofs had swelled into a sharp staccato drumming  with face fiercely set and the perspiration dripping from him he held on scorched and partly dazzled by the glare  the wood was getting closer he thought it was scarcely a quarter of a mile off  his heart throbbed madly the pain in his side had grown excruciating but somehow he must keep going  his eyes smarted with the moisture that ran into them his lips and mouth were salty he was suffering torment but he kept on his feet  at length when the trees were close ahead a faint smudge of smoke appeared on the edge of them there was a report like a whipcrack and he stopped in despair  his last refuge was held against him  then as he turned in savage desperation to meet the rustlers onslaught with the ax he saw there were only two horsemen who pulled up suddenly about sixty yards away  the third was not visible but his horse which had fallen was struggling in the grass  as the meaning of this dawned on george he broke in a wild breathless yell of exultation there was another crack behind him and the two horsemen wheeled  they were not too soon for a mounted man in khaki with something that flashed across his saddle was riding hard from behind the bluff to cut them off  another appeared going at a furious gallop and george stood watching while the four figures grew smaller upon the prairie  turning at a shout he saw flett and edgar walking toward him and he went with them to the fallen horse  a man lay gray in face among the grass held down by the body of the animal which partly rested upon him  get me out he begged hoarsely  legs broke  george felt incapable of helping  he sat down while the other two extricated the man then flett placed his carbine against the horses head and after the report it ceased its struggling  she came down on me sudden couldnt get my foot clear in time the rustler explained  you had to be stopped  i sighted at a hundred a quick shot flett remarked  is there anything else the matter except your leg  i guess its enough said the helpless man  flett turned to george  walk into the bluff and youll strike our camp  west must stay with me until we put on some fixing that will hold this fellows leg together  george did as he was bidden and sat down again limply when he reached an opening in the wood where a pile of branches with a kettle suspended over them had been laid ready for lighting  presently the others rejoined him  the fellow cant be moved until we get a wagon said flett  weve been looking for you all over the country but it was quite a while before we got a hint that sent us down this way  we had stopped in the bluff when we saw a fellow running with three mounted men after him and we lay close expecting to get the bunch  its unfortunate they got too near you and i had to shoot but i guess the boys will bring them back  edgar looked at his comrade reproachfully  if you could only have sprinted a little and kept ahead we would either have outflanked them or have had the finest imaginable ride with every chance of running the fellows down  as things turned out i couldnt go off with the troopers until i found that you had got through unhurt  im sorry george told him with a little dry laugh  but i dont think i spared any effort during the last quarter of a mile  then he related his adventures and answered a number of questions  youll take my horse said flett and start for the railroad as soon as you feel able  get on to regina by the first train judging by the last wire i got youll still be in time  west had better go with you to the station and he can send a wagon for the man whos hurt  now i guess well get you something to eat  i shouldnt mind said george  its twentyfour hours since my last meal and that one was remarkably small  he drank a canful of cold tea and then went suddenly to sleep while the others lighted the fire     chapter xxxi  the reaction  the trial at regina proved sensational  crimes attended with violence were not unknown in the vicinity and cattle were now and then stolen in the neighboring province of alberta but that such things as the prosecutors tale revealed should happen aroused widespread astonishment and virtuous indignation  nevertheless they were proved for flett had procured a number of witnesses and what was more had secured their attendance  in addition to this other offenses were hinted at the doings of an organized gang of desperadoes and their accomplices were detailed and facts were brought to light which made the withdrawal of the sachem license inevitable  the defense took strong exception to this mode of procedure pointing out that the court was only concerned with a specified offense and that it was not permissible to drag in extraneous and largely supposititious matter  during the sweltering days the trial lasted there were brisk encounters between the lawyers and several points the prosecution sought to prove were ruled irrelevant  as a climax came georges story which caused a sensation though the closepacked assembly felt that he scarcely did justice to his theme  in concluding the crown prosecutor pointed out how rapidly the outbreaks of turbulent lawlessness had spread  they were all he contended connected with and leading up to the last outrage of which the men before him were accused  it was obvious that this unruliness must be sternly stamped out before it spread farther and if the court agreed with him that the charge was fully proved he must press for a drastic and deterrent penalty  the odds were heavily against the defense from the beginning  the credibility of fletts witnesses could not be assailed and crossexamination only threw a more favorable light upon their character  inside the court and out of it as the newspapers circulated grant stood revealed as a fearless citizen with a stern sense of his duty to the community george somewhat to his annoyance as a more romantic personage of the same description and hardie who had been brought in to prove certain points against which the defense protested as one who had fought and suffered in a righteous cause  in the end the three prisoners were convicted and when the court broke up the police applied for several fresh warrants which were issued  as george was walking toward his hotel he met flett to whom he had not spoken since they separated in the bluff  i was waiting for you said the constable  im sorry well have to call you up again as soon as the rustlers leg is better  hes in the guardroom and the boys got one of the other fellows but we can talk about it on the train  im going back to my post  george arranged to meet him and they were sitting in a roomy smoking compartment as the big express sped across wide gray levels and past vast stretches of ripening grain when the next allusion was made to the matter  i suppose youll be sergeant shortly george remarked  corporal comes first said flett  they stick to the regular rotation  thats true but they seem to use some discretion in exceptional cases  i hardly think youll remain a corporal  fletts eyes twinkled  i did get something that sounded like a hint  ill confess that i felt like whooping after it  you have deserved all youll get george declared  they spent the night at a junction where flett had some business and it was the next evening when the local train ran into sage butte  the platform was crowded and as george and flett alighted there was a cheer and somewhat to their astonishment the reeve of the town advanced to meet them  im here to welcome you in the name of the citizens of the butte he said  we have to request the favor of your company at supper at the queens  its an honor george responded  im sensible of it but you see im in a hurry to get back to work and i wired for a team  my harvest should have been started a week ago  dont you worry bout that said the reeve  it wasnt our wish that you should suffer through discharging your duty and we made a few arrangements  four binders have been working steady in your oats and if you dont like the way we have fixed things you can alter them tomorrow  then west touched georges arm  youll have to come  theyve got two other victimshardie and grantand the suppers ready  the reeve looked at him in stern rebuke  that isnt the way to speak of this function percy  if you feel like a victim you can drop right out  george was touched by the mans intimation  he expressed his satisfaction and the whole assembly escorted him to the hotel  there he and grant and hardie were seated at the top of a long table near the reeve who made a short opening speech  business first and then the supper boys he said  corporal flett cant come his bosses wouldnt approve of it but ill see it put in the sentinel that he was asked and we wont mind if that has some effect on them  theres another thingout of deference to mr hardie and the change in opinion he has ably ledyoull only get tea and coffee at this entertainment  those who havent signed his book must hold out until its over  an excellent meal had been finished when he got up again with three illuminated strips of parchment in his hand  ill be brief but theres something to be said  our guests have set us an example which wont be lost  they saw the danger of letting things drift one of them warned us plainly although to do so needed grit and some of us rounded on him and if the others didnt talk it was because that wasnt their end of the job  they knew their duty to the country and they did it though it cost them something  we owe it to them that the police have smashed the rustler gang and that from now on no small homesteader can be bluffed or tempted into doing whats sure to bring him into trouble and no man with a big farm need fear to let his cattle run  whats more instead of a haunt of toughs and hobos were going to have a quiet and prosperous town  im now proud that its my duty to hand our guests the assurance of our grateful appreciation  corporal fletts will be sent on to him  he handed them the parchments and george felt inclined to blush as he glanced at the decorated words of eulogy while a halfironical twinkle crept into grants eyes  then hardie rose to reply and faltered once or twice with a sob of emotion in his voice for the testimonial had a deeper significance to him than it had to the others  his audience however encouraged him and there was a roar of applause when he sat down  soon after that the gathering broke up  george went to the parlor which served as writingroom and found flora there  she smiled as she noticed the end of the parchment sticking out of his pocket  i dare say youre relieved that the ceremonys over she said  it was a little trying george confessed  i was badly afraid id have to make a speech but luckily we had hardie who was equal to the task  after all you neednt be ashamed of the testimonial  i really think you deserved it and i suppose i must congratulate you on the fortunate end of your dramatic adventures  george stood looking at her  he was somewhat puzzled for there was a hint of light mockery in her voice  ill excuse you if you feel that it requires an effort he said  oh you have had so much applause that mine can hardly count  you ought to know that its my friends good opinion i really value  flora changed the subject  you will be driving out in the morning  im starting as soon as edgar has the team ready  theres a good moon and i must get to work the first thing tomorrow  the girls face hardened  you seem desperately anxious about your crop  i think thats natural  theres a good deal to be done and ive lost some time  i came in to write a note before i see what edgars doing  then i mustnt disturb you and its time i went over to mrs nelsonsshe expects me to stay the night  i was merely waiting for a word with my father  she stopped george who had meant to accompany her  no you neednt comeits only a few blocks away  get your note written  seeing that she did not desire his escort george let her go but he frowned as he sat down and took out some paper  soon afterward edgar came in and they drove off in a few more minutes  did you see miss grant edgar asked when they were jolting down the rutted trail  i did george said shortly  you seem disturbed about it  i was a little perplexed george owned  there was something that struck me as different in her manner  it may have been imagination but i felt she wasnt exactly pleased with me  i cant understand how i have offended her  no said edgar  it would have been remarkable if you had done so i suppose you told her you couldnt rest until you got to work at the harvest  i believe i said something of the kind  what has that to do with it  it isnt very obvious  perhaps she felt tired or moody it has been a blazing hot day  theres every sign of its being the same tomorrow i suppose youll make a start after breakfast  ill make a start as soon as its daylight george told him  he kept his word and for the next few weeks toiled with determined energy among the tall white oats and the coppery ears of wheat  it was fiercely hot but from sunrise until the light failed the plodding teams and clinking binders moved round the lessening squares of grain and ranks of splendid sheaves lengthened fast behind them  the nights were getting sharp the dawns were cold and clear and george rose each morning aching in every limb but with a keen sense of satisfaction each days work added to the store of money he would shortly hand to sylvia  he saw little of flora but when they met by chance as happened once or twice he was still conscious of something subtly unfamiliar in her manner  he felt they were no longer on the old confidential footing a stronger barrier of reserve had risen between them  before the last sheaves were stacked the days were growing cool  the fresh western breezes had died away and a faint ethereal haze and a deep stillness had fallen upon the prairie  it was rudely broken when the thrashers arrived and from early morning the clatter of the engine filled the air with sound  loaded wagons crashed through the stubble the voices of dusty men mingled with the rustle of the sheaves and a long trail of sooty smoke stained the soft blue of the sky  this work was finished in turn and day by day the wagons loaded high with bags of grain rolled slowly across the broad white levels toward the elevators  many a tense effort was needed to get them to their destination for the trails were dry and loose but markets were strong and george had decided to haul in all the big crop  sometimes though the nights were frosty he slept beside his jaded team in the shelter of a bluff sometimes he spent a day he grudged laying straw on a road rest for more than three or four hours was unknown to him and meals were snatched at irregular intervals when matters of more importance were less pressing  for all that he was uniformly cheerful the work brought him the greatest pleasure he had known and he had grown fond of the wide open land in which he had once looked forward to dwelling with misgivings  the freedom of its vast spaces its clear air and its bright sunshine appealed to him and he began to realize that he would be sorry to leave it which he must shortly do sylvia it was a pity could not live in western canada  at length on a frosty evening he saw the last load vanish into the dusty elevator and a curious feeling of regret crept over him  it was very doubtful if he would haul in another harvest and he wondered whether the time would now and then hang heavily on his hands in england  there was a roar of machinery above him in the tail building that cut sharply against the sky below long rows of wagons stood waiting their turn and the voices of the teamsters bantering one another struck cheerfully on his ears  sidetrack and little station were bathed in dazzling electric glare two locomotives were pushing in wheat cars and lights had begun to glimmer in the wooden houses of the butte though all round there was the vast sweep of prairie  there was a touch of rawness in the picture a hint of incompleteness with a promise of much to come  sage butte was perhaps a trifle barbarous but its crude frame buildings would some day give place to more imposing piles of concrete and steel  its inhabitants were passing through a transition stage showing signs at times of the primitive strain but as a rule reaching out eagerly toward what was new and better  they would make swift progress and even now he liked the strenuous optimistic and somewhat rugged life they led he reflected that he would find things different in sheltered england  after giving grierson a few instructions george turned away  his work was done instead of driving home through the sharp cold of the night he was to spend it comfortably at the hotel  a week later he and west drove over to the grant homestead and found only its owner in the generalroom  grant listened with a rather curious expression when george told him that he was starting for england the following day and then they quietly talked over the arrangements that had been made for carrying on the farm until edgars return for georges future movements were uncertain  edgar however was sensible of a constraint in the farmers manner which was presently felt by george and the conversation was languishing when flora came in  shortly afterward george said that they must go and flora strolled toward the fence with him while the team was being harnessed  so you are leaving us tomorrow and may not come back she said in an indifferent tone  i cant tell what i shall do until i get to england  flora glanced at him with a composure that cost her an effort  she supposed his decision would turn upon mrs marstons attitude but she knew sylvia well and had a suspicion that there was a disappointment in store for lansing  edgar had explained that he was not rich and he was not the kind of man sylvia was likely to regard with favor  well she said lightly when i came in you really didnt look as cheerful as one might have expected  are you sorry you are going away  its a good deal harder than i thought  the prairie seems to have got hold of me i have good friends here  havent you plenty in england  acquaintances only a few friends  i cant help regretting those i must leave behind  in facthe spoke impulsively expressing a thought that had haunted himit would be a relief if i knew i should come back again  after all this is a hard country and were a rather primitive people  youre reliable  staunch friends determined enemies and even among the latter i found a kind of sporting feeling which made it a little easier for one to forget ones injuries  he glanced at the prairie which stretched away white and silent in the clear evening light its irrational in a way but id be glad to feel i was going to work as usual tomorrow  i suppose you could do so if you really wanted to flora suggested  george turned and looked fixedly at her while a mad idea crept into his mind  she was very alluring he thought he knew her nature which was altogether wholesome and it flashed upon him that many of the excellent qualities she possessed were lacking in sylvia  then he loyally drove out the temptation wondering that it had assailed him though he was still clearly conscious of his companions attractiveness  no he said in a somewhat strained voice i hardly think thats possible  i must go back  flora smiled though it was difficult  she half believed she could shake the mans devotion to her rival but she was too proud to try if he came to her he must come willingly and not because she had exerted her utmost power to draw him  well she responded one could consider the reluctant way you spoke the last few words as flattering  i suppose its a compliment to canada  he failed to understand the light touch of mocking amusement in her tone it had not dawned on him that this was her defense  its a compliment to the canadians though my appreciation cant be worth very much  but i dont feel in a mood to joke  in fact theres a feeling of depression abroad tonight even your father seems affected  id expected a pleasant talk with him but we were very dull  what made you think he was less cheerful than usual  flora cast a quick and rather startled glance at him  i dont know but something seemed wrong  edgars the only one who looks undisturbed and if he talks much going home hell get on my nerves  its hardly fair to blame him for a depression thats your fault said flora  you deserve to feel it since you will go away  then edgar came up with the wagon and george took floras hands  i shall think of you often he told her  it will always be with pleasure  now and then you might perhaps spare a thought for me  i think i can promise that flora replied quietly  then he shook hands with grant and got into the wagon  edgar cracked the whip and the team plunged forward  with a violent jolting and a rattle of wheels they left the farm behind and drove out on to the prairie  flora stood watching them for a while and then walked back to the house in the gathering dusk with her face set hard and a pain at her heart  grant was sitting on the stoop filling his pipe but when she joined him he paused in his occupation and pointed toward the plain  the wagon was scarcely discernible but a rhythmic beat of hoofs still came back through the stillness  i like that man but hes a blamed fool he remarked  strong bitterness was mingled with the regret in his voice and flora started  she was glad that the light was too dim for him to see her clearly  i wonder what makes you say that  for one thing he might have done well here flora suspected that her father was not expressing all he had meant  hes the kind of man we want and now hes going back to fool his life away slouching round playing games and talking to idle people in the old country  guess some girl over there has got a hold on him  then his indignation flamed out unchecked  i never could stand those percy women anyway saw a bunch of them all dress and airs when i was last in winnipeg one was standing outside a ticketoffice at portage studying the people through an eyeglass on an ivory stick as if they were some strange savages and making remarks about them to her friends though i guess there isnt a young woman in the city with nerve enough to wear the clothes she had on  it makes a sensible man mighty tired to hear those creatures talk  flora laughed rather drearily though she guessed with some uneasiness the cause of her fathers outbreak  it appeared injudicious to offer him any encouragement  after all one must be fair she said  i met some very nice people in the old country  he turned to her abruptly  do you know who has taken lansing back he asked  i believe from something west said it is mrs marston  that trash  grants sharp cry expressed incredulity  the man cant have any sense  hes going to be sorry all the time if he gets her  then he knocked out his pipe as if he were too indignant to smoke and went into the house     chapter xxxii  a revelation  it was a winter evening and sylvia was standing near the hearth in mrs ketterings hall where the lamps were burning though a little pale daylight still filtered through the drizzle outside  sylvia was fond of warmth and brightness but she was alone except for ethel west who sat writing at a table in a recess although her hostess had other guests including a few men who were out shooting  after a while ethel looked up  have you or herbert heard anything from george during the last few weeks she asked  sylvia turned languidly  her thoughts had been fixed on captain bland whom she was expecting every moment  indeed she was anxious to get rid of ethel before he came in  no she said with indifference  i think his last letter came a month ago  it was optimistic  they seem to have had a good harvest from what edgar wrote he hinted that he might make a trip across  its rather an expensive journey  that wouldnt trouble edgar and theres a reason for the visit  he has made up his mind to start farming and wants to talk over his plans in fact he thinks of getting married  sylvia showed some interest  to whom  why didnt you tell me earlier  i only arrived this morning and i wrote some time ago asking if you could meet stephen and me  you were with the graysons then but you didnt answer  i forgot i dont always answer letters  but who is the girl  not miss grant  helen taunton  do you know her  sylvia laughed  the storekeepers daughter  shes passably goodlooking and her fathers not badly off but thats about all one could say for her  do you know anything against the girl  oh no said sylvia languidly  shes quite respectablein fact theyre rather a straightlaced people and she doesnt talk badly for all that i think youll get a shock if edgar brings her home  that is not georges opinion  we wrote to him  sylvia laughed  he would believe in anybody who looked innocent and pretty  ethels expression hardened sylvia had not been considerate  i dont think thats true  hes generous and though he has made mistakes it was only because his confidence was misled with a highly finished skill  one wouldnt look for the same ability in a girl brought up in a primitive western town  after all said sylvia tranquilly she is a girl and no doubt edgar is worth powder and shot from her point of view  it doesnt seem to be a commercial one ethel retorted  stephen had a very straightforward letter from this storekeeper  but im inclined to think i had better go on with my writing  sylvia moved away  she had no reason for being gracious to ethel and she took some pleasure in irritating her  in a few minutes bland came in  the hall was large and ethel was hidden from him in the recess  he strode toward sylvia eagerly but she checked him with a gesture  you have come back early she said  wasnt the sport good  what has become of kettering and the others  the man looked a little surprised  this was hardly the greeting he had expected after having been promised a quiet halfhour with sylvia but looking round he saw the skirt of ethels dress and understood had it been george she wished to warn she would have used different means but bland she was thankful was not hypercritical  the sport was poor he told her  the pheasants arent very strong yet and it was hard to drive them out of the covers  as id only a light waterproof i got rather wet outside the last wood and i left the others  kettering wanted to see the keeper about tomorrows beat but i didnt wait  since you have been in the rain all day you had better have some tea said sylvia  theyll bring it here if you ring  he followed her to a small table across the hall and after a tray had been set before them they sat talking in low voices  presently bland laid his hand on sylvias arm  you know why i came down he said  i must go back tomorrow and i want the announcement made before i leave  sylvia blushed and lowered her eyes  oh well she conceded you have really been very patient and perhaps it would be hardly fair to make you wait any longer  bland took her hand and held it fast  you are worth waiting for  but there were times when it was very hard not to rebel  id have done so only i was afraid  you did rebel  not to much purpose  though no one would suspect it from your looks youre a very determined person sylvia  now i dont know how to express my feelings i want to do something dramatic even if its absurd and i cant even speak aloud  couldnt you have got rid of miss west by some means  how could i tell what you wished to say sylvia asked with a shy smile  besides ethel wouldnt go  she stuck there in the most determined fashion  then well have to disregard her  it must be early next year sylvia ill see lansing tomorrow  he continued in a quietly exultant strain and sylvia felt relieved that her fate was decided  she had some time ago led him to believe she would marry him but she had with vague misgivings and prompted by halfunderstood reasons put off a definite engagement  now she had given her pledge and though she thought of george with faint regret she was on the whole conscious of satisfaction  bland she believed had a good deal to offer her which she could not have enjoyed with his rival  presently a servant brought ethel something on a salver and a few moments later she approached the other two with a telegram in her hand  i thought i had better tell you sylvia she explained  stephen has just got a letter from edgar written a day or two before he sailed he should arrive on saturday and george is with him  sylvia had not expected this and she was off her guard  she started and sat looking at ethel incredulously with something like consternation  its quite true said ethel bluntly  hell be here in three more days  then sylvia recovered her composure  in that case ill have to let muriel know at once hell go straight there and shes staying with lucy  perhaps i had better telegraph  she rose and left them and bland sought mrs kettering and acquainted her of his engagement and begged her to make it known which she promised to do  he failed to find sylvia until she was coming down to dinner when she beckoned him  have you told susan yet she asked  yes bland beamed i told her at once  i should have liked to go about proclaiming the delightful news  sylvia looked disturbed bland could almost have fancied she was angry as a matter of fact troubled thoughts were flying through her mind it was obvious that she would shortly be called upon to face a crisis  after all she said with an air of resignation which struck him as out of place i suppose you had to do so but you lost no time  not a moment he assured her  i felt i couldnt neglect anything that brought you nearer to me  then they went on and meeting the other guests in the hall sylvia acknowledged the shower of congratulations with a smiling face  she escaped after dinner however without a sign to bland and did not reappear  during the evening he found ethel west sitting alone in a quiet nook  mrs marston seemed a little disturbed at the news you gave her he remarked  so i thought said ethel  i suppose the george you mentioned is her trustee who went to canada and took your brother  you once told me something about him  yes said ethel  you seem to have the gift of arriving at correct conclusions  hes an elderly mana business man of his cousins stampi presume  ethel laughed  oh no theyre of very different type  i should imagine that hes younger than you are  he was at herberts one afternoon when you called  ah said bland  i shall no doubt get to know him when next i come down  then he talked about other matters until he left her and after a while he found kettering alone  did you ever meet george lansing he asked  oh yes said his host  i know his cousin better  he has been out in canada hasnt he  yes went out to look after mrs marstons property  i understand he has been more or less successful  when did he leave england  kettering told him and bland considered  so lansing has been out and no doubt going to a good deal of trouble for two years he said  thats something beyond an ordinary executors duty  what made him undertake it  kettering smiled  its an open secretyoure bound to hear itthat he had an admiration for sylvia  still theres no ground for jealousy  lansing hadnt a chance from the beginning  bland concealed his feelings  how is that  he must be an unusually good fellow if he stayed out there to look after things so long  for one reason hes not sylvias kind  it was quite out of the question that she should ever have married him  feeling that he had perhaps said too much kettering began to talk of the next days sport and soon afterward bland left him and went out on the terrace to smoke and ponder  putting what he had learned together he thought he understood the situation and it was not a pleasant one though he was not very indignant with sylvia  it looked as if she made an unfair use of lansings regard for her unless in spite of ketterings opinion she had until lately been undecided how to choose between them  nevertheless bland could not feel that he had now been rudely undeceived for he had always recognized some of sylvias failings  he did not expect perfection and he could be generous when he had won  he asked sylvia no injudicious questions when they met the next morning and during the day he called on herbert lansing who was back in his office  the latter heard him explain his errand with somewhat mixed feelings for there were certain rather troublesome facts that must be mentioned  well he said i have of course no objections to make but as one of her trustees its my duty to look after sylvias interests  as you know she is not rich  i suppose these points must he talked over bland said with indifference  its usual and in the present case necessary  what provision are you able to make  bland looked a little uncomfortable  as a matter of fact id find it difficult to make any provision  i get along fairly well as it is but ive only about four hundred a year besides my pay  how far does your pay go herbert asked dryly  it covers my mess bills and a few expenses of that nature  herbert leaned back in his chair with a smile  hasnt it struck you that you should have chosen a wife with money  now said bland rather sternly i dont want to lie open to any misconception but i understood that mrs marston had some means  im quite prepared to hear theyre small  thats fortunate because it may save you a shock  sylvia owns a farm in canada which did not repay the cost of working it last year during the present one there has been an improvement and we expect a small surplus on the two years operations  the place has been valued atbut perhaps i had better give you a few figures showing you how matters stand  opening a drawer he handed a paper to bland who studied it with a sense of dismay  ill confess that this is an unpleasant surprise he said at length and then while herbert waited he pulled himself together with a laugh  after that admission i must add that the mistake is the result of my having a sanguine imagination sylvia scarcely mentioned her canadian property  now however theres only one thing to be doneto face the situation as cheerfully as possible  it cant be an altogether attractive one herbert admired his courage and the attitude he had adopted  i shall certainly have to economize bland admitted and that is a thing im not accustomed to but i may get some appointment and by and by a small share in some family property will revert to me  though i must go straight back to my garrison duties now ill come down for an hour or two and explain things to sylvia as soon as i can  he paused and broke into a faint smile  i dare say the surprise will be mutual she may have believed my means to be larger than they are  i should consider it very possible replied herbert dryly  as i must see sylvia ill give her an idea how matters stand and clear the ground for you  bland said that he would be glad of this and after some further conversation he took his leave and walked to the station disturbed in mind but conscious of a little ironical amusement  there was no doubt that sylvia had cleverly deluded him but he admitted that he had done much the same thing to her  had he realized the true state of her affairs at the beginning he would have withdrawn but he had no thought of doing so now  it was obvious that sylvias principles were not very high and he regretted it although he could not claim much superiority in this respect  he was tolerant and after all she had a charm that atoned for many failings  it was three or four days later when he arrived at mrs ketterings house one evening and found sylvia awaiting him in a room reserved for her hostesss use  she was very becomingly dressed and looked he thought even more attractive than usual  she submitted to his caress with an air of resignation but he augured a good deal from the fact that she did not repulse him  as it happened sylvia had carefully thought over the situation  sit down she said i want to talk with you  i think ill stand  its more difficult to feel penitent in a comfortable position  it looks as if you had seen herbert lansing  i have sylvias tone was harsh  what have you to say for yourself  not a great deal which is fortunate because i havent much time to say it in bland told her with a smile  to begin with ill state the unflattering truthit strikes me that in one way were each as bad as the other  i suppose its one of my privileges to mention such facts to you though id never think of admitting them to anybody else  its a husbands privilege sylvia rejoined pointedly  dont be premature  well said bland i can only make one defense but i think you ought to realize how strong it is  we were thrown into each others society and it isnt in the least surprising that i lost my head and was carried away  my power of reasoning went when i fell in love with you  that sounds pretty but its unfortunate you didnt think of me a little more pouted sylvia  think of you bland broke out  i thought of nothing else  then it wasnt to much purpose  dont you see what you want to bring me to  cant you realize what i should have to give up  how could we ever manage on the little we have  the man frowned  he was sorry for her and somewhat ashamed but she jarred on him in her present mood  i believe people who were sufficiently fond of each other have often got along pretty satisfactorily on less even in the service  its a matter of keen regret to me that you will have to make a sacrifice but things are not quite so bad as they look and theres reason for believing they may get better  you will have as pleasant society as you enjoy now my friends will stand by my wife  a look of pride crept into his face  i dare say they have their failings but theyll only expect charm from you and you can give it to them  they wont value you by the display you make or your possessions  were free from that taint  but have you considered what you must give up  bland had hardly expected this but he smiled  oh yes  i spent an evening over it and i was a little surprised to find how many things there were i could readily do without  in fact it was a most instructive evening  the next day i wrote a bundle of letters resigning from clubs i rarely went to and canceling orders for odds and ends i hadnt the least real use for  but ill confess that ive derived a good deal more pleasure from thinking of how much i shall get  sylvia was touched but she did not mean to yield too readily  it would be dreadfully imprudent  just so one has often to take a risk  its rather exciting to fling prudence overboard  i want to fix my whole attention on the fact that we love each other  bland glanced at his watch  now it strikes me that we have been sufficiently practical and as i must start back tonight i havent much time left  dont you think it would be a pity to waste it  he drew her down beside him on a lounge and sylvia surrendered  after all the man had made a good defense and as far as her nature permitted she had grown fond of him     chapter xxxiii  george makes up his mind  dusk was closing in when george and edgar alighted at a little english station  casting an eager glance about george was disappointed to see nobody from his cousins house waiting to meet him  in another moment however he was warmly greeted by ethel west  a very hearty welcome george she said  youre looking very fit but thinner than you were when you left us  stephens waiting outside he told muriel we would drive you over herberts away somewhere  hows everybody george inquired  sylvia looked as charming as ever when i last saw her a few days ago ethel answered with a smile which george was too eager to notice was somewhat forced  the rest of us are much as usual  but come along well send over afterward for your heavy things  they turned toward the outlet and found stephen having some trouble with a horse that was startled by the roar of steam  edgar got up in front of the high trap george helped ethel to the seat behind and they set off the next moment flying down the wet road amid a cheerful hammer of hoofs and a rattle of wheels  for the first few minutes george said little as he looked about  on one side great oaks and ashes raised their naked boughs in sharp tracery against the pale saffron glow in the western sky  ahead across a deep valley which was streaked with trains of mist wide moors and hills rolled away gray and darkly blue  down the long slope to the hollow ran small fields with great trees breaking the lines of hedgerows and the brawling of a river swollen by recent rain came sharply up to him  it was all good to look upon a beautiful wellcaredfor land and he felt a thrill of pride and satisfaction  this was home and he had come back to it with his work done  a roseate future stretched away before him its peaceful duties brightened by love and the contrast between it and the stress and struggle of the past two years added to its charm  still to his astonishment he thought of the sterner and more strenuous life he had led on the western plains with a faint halftender regret  by and by edgars laugh rang out  the change in my brother is remarkable ethel declared  it was a very happy thought that made us let him go with you  im not responsible george rejoined  you have the country to thank  in some way its a hard land but its a good one  perhaps something is due to miss tauntons influence  edgar leaned over the back of the seat  that he said is a subject of which ive a monopoly and ive volumes to say upon it as soon as theres a chance of doing it justice george i hear that singleton who told us about the wheat is home on a visit  stephen has asked him over you must meet him  george said he would be glad to do so and turned to ethel when edgar resumed his conversation with his brother  i wired herbert to have everything ready at my place though i shall spend the night at brantholme  the lodge is let  didnt you know  i understood that the mans tenancy ran out a few weeks ago  he renewed it  herbert didnt know you were coming over the terms were good  then im homeless for a time  oh no said ethel  stephen wanted me to insist on your coming with us now but i know you will want to see muriel and have a talk with her  however well expect you to come and take up your quarters with us tomorrow  george looked at her in some surprise  id be delighted but herbert will expect me to stay with him and of course  sylvia hadnt arrived this afternoon she was at mrs ketterings ethel told him  but remember that you must stay with us until you make your arrangements  we should find it hard to forgive you if you went to anybody else  i wouldnt think of it only that herberts the obvious person to entertain me george replied though he was a little puzzled by the insistence and ethel abruptly began to talk of something else  darkness came but there were gleams of cheerful light from roadside cottages and george found the fresh moist air and the shadowy woods they skirted pleasantly familiar  this was the quiet english countryside he loved and a sense of deep and tranquil content possessed him  he failed to notice that ethel cleverly avoided answering some of his questions and talked rather more than usual about matters of small importance  at length they reached the brantholme gates and stephen looked down as george alighted  well expect you over shortly ill send for your baggage he said as he drove off  george to his keen disappointment found only mrs lansing waiting for him in the hall though she received him very cordially  herbert had to go up to london he didnt get your wire in time to put off the journey she explained  im sorry he cant be back for a few days  it doesnt matter he has to attend to his business george rejoined but wheres sylvia  she hasnt come back from susans said mrs lansing quickly changing the subject and explaining why herbert had relet the lodge after that she asked george questions until she sent him off to prepare for dinner  george was perplexed as well as disappointed  neither ethel nor muriel seemed inclined to speak about sylviait looked as if they had some reason for avoiding any reference to her but he assured himself that this was imagination and during dinner he confined his inquiries to other friends  when it was over and muriel led him into the drawingroom his uneasiness grew more keen  herbert thought you would like to know as soon as possible how things were going muriel said as she took a big envelope from a drawer and gave it to him  he told me this was a rough statement of your business affairs  thanks said george thrusting it carelessly into his pocket  i must study it sometime  but ive been looking forward all day to meeting sylvia  wouldnt susan let her come  mrs lansing hesitated and then leaning forward laid her hand on his arm  ive kept it back a little george but you must be told  im afraid it will be a shocksylvia is to marry captain bland in the next few weeks  george rose and turned rather gray in the face as he leaned on the back of a chair  i suppose he said hoarsely theres no doubt of this  its all arranged mrs lansing made a compassionate gesture  i cant tell you how sorry i am or how hateful it was to have to give you such news  i can understand why sylvia preferred to leave it to you he said slowly  how long has this matter been going on  mrs lansings eyes sparkled with anger  i believe it began soon after you left  i dont know whether sylvia expects me to make excuses for her but i wont do anything of the kind there are none that could be made  she has behaved shamefully  one must be just george said with an effort  after all she promised me nothing  perhaps not in so many words  but she knew what you expected and i have no doubt she led you to believe  george raised his hand  i think theres nothing to be saidthe thing must be faced somehow i feel rather badly hit you wont mind if i go out and walk about a little  mrs lansing was glad to let him go the sight of his hardset face hurt her  in another minute he was walking up and down the terrace but he stopped presently and leaned on the low wall  hitherto he had believed in sylvia with an unshaken faith but now a flood of suspicion poured in on him above all there was the telling fact that as soon as he had gone she had begun to lead on his rival  the shock he had suffered had brought george illumination  sylvia could never have had an atom of affection for him she had merely made his loyalty serve her turn  she had done so even before she married dick marston though he had somehow retained his confidence in her then  he had been a fool from the beginning  the intense bitterness of which he was conscious was wholly new to him but it was comprehensible  just in all his dealings he expected honesty from others and though generous in many ways he had not blands tolerant nature he looked for more than the latter and had less charity  there was a vein of hardness in the man who had loved sylvia largely because he believed in her  trickery and falseness were abhorrent to him and now the woman he had worshiped stood revealed in her deterrent reality  after a while he pulled himself together and going back to the house entered herberts library where less because of his interest in the matter than as a relief from painful thoughts he opened the envelope given him and took out the statement  for a few moments the figures puzzled him and then he broke into a bitter laugh  the money that he had entrusted to his cousins care had melted away  during the next two or three minutes he leaned back motionless in his chair then he took up a pencil and lighted a cigar  since he was ruined he might as well ascertain how it had happened and two facts became obvious from his study of the document herbert had sold sound securities and had mortgaged land and then placed the proceeds in rubber shares  this was perhaps permissible but it did not explain what had induced an astute business man to hold the shares until they had fallen to their remarkably low value  there was a mystery here and george in his present mood was keenly suspicious  he had no doubt that herbert had left the statement because it would save him the unpleasantness of giving a personal explanation moreover george believed that he had left home with that purpose  then he made a few rough calculations which seemed to prove that enough remained to buy and stock a farm in western canada  this was something though it did not strike him as a matter of much consequence and he listlessly smoked out his cigar  then he rose and rejoined mrs lansing  if you dont mind ill go over to wests tomorrow he said  they pressed me to spend some time with them and there are arrangements to be made on which they want my opinion  edgar is taking up land in canada  mrs lansing looked troubled  was there anything disturbing in the paper herbert gave me for you he doesnt tell me much about his business but i gathered that he was vexed about some shares he bought on your account  i should be sorry if they have gone down  you would hardly understand the things a little complicated george said with reassuring gentleness  im afraid i have lost some money but after all it isnt my worst misfortune  ill have a talk with herbert as soon as he comes home  he left brantholme the next morning and was received by ethel when he arrived at wests  we have been expecting you she said cordially  then you know  yes  im very sorry but i suppose it will hardly bear talking about stephen is waiting for you hes taking a day off and edgars friend singleton arrives tonight  singleton duly made his appearance but he was not present when george and stephen west sat down for a talk after dinner in the latters smokingroom  presently george took out the statement and handed it to his host  i want advice badly and i cant go to an outsider for it he said i feel quite safe in confiding in you  west studied the document for a while before he looked up  the main point to be decided iswhether you should sell these shares at once for what they will bring or wait a little  with your permission well ask singleton he knows more about the matter than anybody else  singleton came in and lighted a cigar and then listened carefully with a curious little smile while west supplied a few explanations  hold on to these shares even if you have to make a sacrifice to do so he advised  but they seem to be almost worthless george objected  perhaps i had better go into the matter fully said singleton  ill do so on the understanding that what im about to tell you reaches nobody else  george looked at west who nodded  well explained singleton ive come over on a flying visit about this rubber business  the original companythe one in which you hold shareswas got up mainly with the idea of profiting by the rather reckless general buying of such stock  its tropical possessions were badly managed though a little good rubber was shipped and when prices reached their highest point mr lansing sold out  if he had sold my shares at the same time there should have been a satisfactory margin  undoubtedly  extensive selling however shakes the confidence of speculators and a man desirous of unloading would accordingly prefer everybody else to hold on  i think i am beginning to understand now george said grimly  then singleton went on a new company was projected by the promoters of the first one and i was sent out to report on its prospects  at the last moment mr lansing withdrew but his associates sent me south again  the slump he had foreseen came nobody wanted rubber shares in any but firmly established and prosperous companies lansing had cleared out in time and left his colleagues to face a crushing loss  i dont see how all this bears upon the subject george interrupted  wait  you may be thankful lansing didnt sell your shares  i found that the company could be placed upon a paying basis and what is more that the older one possessed resources its promoters had never suspected  in fact i discovered how its output could be greatly increased at an insignificant cost  i came home at once with a scheme which has been adopted and ive every reason to believe that there will be marked rise in the shares before long  anyway theres no doubt that the company will be able to place highclass rubber on the market at a cost which will leave a very satisfactory margin  george was conscious of strong relief  it looked as if his loss would be small and there was a chance of his stock becoming valuable but another thought struck him  when was it that herbert sold his shares  at the beginning of last winter  shortly before we mentioned that you might come home west interposed pointedly  this confirmed georges suspicions he could readily understand herberts preferring that he should stay away but he remembered that it was sylvias letter which had decided him to remain in canada  in the statement left him he had been charged with half of certain loans herbert had made to her and he wondered whether this pointed to some collusion between them  he thought it by no means improbable  i understand that herbert knows nothing about these new developments and has no idea that the future of the two undertakings is promising he said  singleton laughed  not the slightest notion  if he suspected it there would be nothing to prevent his buying shares nothing will transpire until the shareholders meeting which will not be held for some time  lansing retired and sold out because he was convinced that both companies were worthless  he paused and added dryly i cant see why we should enlighten him  nor can i responded george and west nodded  then said singleton when lansing learns the truth it will be too late for him to profit by the knowledge  i believe he has thrown away the best chance he ever had  shortly afterward edgar came in and they talked of something else but two days later herbert returned and george went over to brantholme  he was shown into the library where herbert was sitting and the latter was on his guard when he saw his cousins face  he greeted him affably however and made a few inquiries about his farming  george stood looking at him with a fixed expression  i think he said shortly we had better talk business  oh well replied herbert  i suppose you have studied my statement i neednt say that i regret the way matters have turned out but one cant foresee every turn of the market or avoid a miscalculation now and then  it would hurt me if i thought this thing had anything to do with your going to stephens  we wont discuss that  i gave you authority to look after my affairs i want it back  herbert took a document from a drawer and laid it on the table  here it is  but wont you let me try to straighten matters out  can they be straightened out  well said herbert with some embarrassment im afraid theres a serious loss but it would be wiser to face it and sell off the shares  i can do what seems most desirable without any further assistance  george leaned forward and as he picked up the document a flush crept into his cousins face  i hardly expected you would take this line  do you think its right to blame me because i couldnt anticipate the fall in value  it strikes me that the situation is one that had better not be discussed between us george rejoined with marked coldness besides my opinion wont count for much in face of the very satisfactory financial results you have secured  im sorry for what has happened on muriels account  he turned and went out and met ethel on reaching wests house  i must try to arrange for an interview with sylvia and captain bland he told her  there are matters that should be explained to them  wont it be painful  that cant be allowed to count  after all said ethel thoughtfully its no doubt the proper course  a week later he visited mrs ketterings and was shown into a room where sylvia awaited him alone  after the first glance at him she turned her eyes away  george she said im afraid ive behaved badly  can you forgive me  i think so he answered with a forced smile  anyway ill try and id like you to be happy  but it wouldnt be flattering if i pretended that i wasnt hurt  ah she exclaimed you were always so generous  he stood silent a moment or two looking at her  she had cunningly tricked him and killed his love but she was very attractive with her pretty helpless air  he knew this was false but there was no profit in bitterness he would not cause her pain  its more to the purpose that im hard which is fortunate in several ways  but i came to talk about the farm that is why i suggested that captain bland should be present  the farm  sylvia regarded him with a trace of mockery  that you should think of it is so characteristic of you  george smiled  i cant help my matteroffact nature and ive found it serviceable anyway the farm must be thought of  he laid a hand gently on her shoulder  sylvia im told that bland isnt rich  if he loves you take him fully into your confidence  she blushed which he had scarcely expected  i have done soat least i allowed herbert to explainthere is nothing hidden  then her tone changed to one of light raillery  you were always an extremist george you cant hit the happy medium  once you believed i was everything that was most admirable and now  i think you have done right and wisely in letting bland know how things stand  it was only my interest in your future that warranted what i said  well she replied we will go up and talk to him hes waiting  you can give your account to him  george followed her but for a while he was conscious of a certain restraint which he fancied was shared by bland  it was difficult to talk about indifferent subjects and he took out some papers  i came to explain the state of sylvias canadian affairs she wished you to know he said  if you will give me a few minutes ill try to make things clear  bland listened gravely and then made a sign of satisfaction  its obvious that sylvia placed her property in most capable hands we can only give you our sincere thanks  theres a point to be considered george resumed  have you decided what to do with the property  sylvia and i have talked it over we thought of selling  i dont see how we could carry on the farm  if you will let the matter stand over for a few weeks i might be a purchaser  the lands poor but theres a good deal of it and i believe that with proper treatment it could be made to pay  sylvia looked astonished bland slightly embarrassed  we never contemplated your buying the place he said  ive grown fond of it i believe i understand how it should be worked theres no reason why either of you should object to my becoming a purchaser  i suppose thats true bland agreed  anyway i can promise that well do nothing about the matter until we hear from you i dont think theres any likelihood of our disputing about the price  you can fix that at what its worth to you  george changed the subject and when he went out sylvia smiled at bland  you neednt have been so sensitive about his buying the farm she said  it will have to be sold  i suppose so but i wish we could have given it to him  sylvia touched his cheek caressingly  dont be foolish its out of the question  you will have to be economical enough as it is but you shant make any sacrifice that isnt strictly necessary  during the next few weeks george made some visits among his friends but he returned to the wests shortly before edgar sailed for canada on the night preceding his departure they were sitting together when edgar looked at him thoughtfully  george he remarked i wonder if it has ever struck you that youre a very shortsighted person  i mean that you dont realize where your interest lies  its possible said george  what particular oversight are you referring to  it isnt easy to answer bluntly and if i threw out any delicate suggestions theyd probably be wasted  you saw a good deal of flora grant and if you had any sense you would have recognized what kind of girl she is  miss grant doesnt need your praise  im glad you admit it appreciations sometimes mutual  now i cant undertake to say what flora implied from your visits but ive no doubt about what her father expected  the blood crept into georges face as he remembered grants manner during their last interview  i did nothing that could have led him to believe  oh no said edgar  you behaved with the greatest prudence perhaps frigid insensibility would describe it better  of course this is a deplorable intrusion but i feel i must point out that it may not be too late yet  ive felt greatly tempted to buy sylvias farm george said thoughtfully  thats good news  if youre wise youll consider what ive said  george did so after edgars departure though the idea was not new to him  he had long been sensible of floras charm and had now and then felt in canada that it would not be difficult to love her  since he had learned the truth about sylvia flora had occupied a prominent place in his mind  by degrees a desire for her had grown stronger he had seen how admirable in many ways she was how staunch and fearless and upright  still he feared to go back she was proud and might scorn his tardy affection  he grew disturbed and occasionally moody and then one day a cablegram was delivered to him  believe you had better come back it read and was signed by helen taunton  george understood what it was intended to convey and before night he had arranged to purchase sylvias farm  three days later he was crossing the atlantic with an eager and thankful heart
