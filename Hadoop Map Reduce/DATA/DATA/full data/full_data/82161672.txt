82161672	moonface and other stories  by jack london    contents       moonface      the leopard mans story      local color      amateur night      the minions of midas      the shadow and the flash      all gold canyon      planchette     moonface   john claverhouse was a moonfaced man you know the kind cheekbones wide apart chin and forehead melting into the cheeks to complete the perfect round and the nose broad and pudgy equidistant from the circumference flattened against the very centre of the face like a doughball upon the ceiling perhaps that is why i hated him for truly he had become an offense to my eyes and i believed the earth to be cumbered with his presence perhaps my mother may have been superstitious of the moon and looked upon it over the wrong shoulder at the wrong time  be that as it may i hated john claverhouse not that he had done me what society would consider a wrong or an ill turn far from it the evil was of a deeper subtler sort so elusive so intangible as to defy clear definite analysis in words we all experience such things at some period in our lives for the first time we see a certain individual one who the very instant before we did not dream existed and yet at the first moment of meeting we say i do not like that man why do we not like him ah we do not know why we know only that we do not we have taken a dislike that is all and so i with john claverhouse  what right had such a man to be happy yet he was an optimist he was always gleeful and laughing all things were always all right curse him ah i how it grated on my soul that he should be so happy other men could laugh and it did not bother me i even used to laugh myselfbefore i met john claverhouse  but his laugh it irritated me maddened me as nothing else under the sun could irritate or madden me it haunted me gripped hold of me and would not let me go it was a huge gargantuan laugh waking or sleeping it was always with me whirring and jarring across my heartstrings like an enormous rasp at break of day it came whooping across the fields to spoil my pleasant morning revery under the aching noonday glare when the green things drooped and the birds withdrew to the depths of the forest and all nature drowsed his great ha ha and ho ho rose up to the sky and challenged the sun and at black midnight from the lonely crossroads where he turned from town into his own place came his plaguey cachinnations to rouse me from my sleep and make me writhe and clench my nails into my palms  i went forth privily in the nighttime and turned his cattle into his fields and in the morning heard his whooping laugh as he drove them out again it is nothing he said the poor dumb beasties are not to be blamed for straying into fatter pastures  he had a dog he called mars a big splendid brute part deerhound and part bloodhound and resembling both mars was a great delight to him and they were always together but i bided my time and one day when opportunity was ripe lured the animal away and settled for him with strychnine and beefsteak it made positively no impression on john claverhouse his laugh was as hearty and frequent as ever and his face as much like the full moon as it always had been  then i set fire to his haystacks and his barn but the next morning being sunday he went forth blithe and cheerful  where are you going i asked him as he went by the crossroads  trout he said and his face beamed like a full moon i just dote on trout  was there ever such an impossible man his whole harvest had gone up in his haystacks and barn it was uninsured i knew and yet in the face of famine and the rigorous winter he went out gayly in quest of a mess of trout forsooth because he doted on them had gloom but rested no matter how lightly on his brow or had his bovine countenance grown long and serious and less like the moon or had he removed that smile but once from off his face i am sure i could have forgiven him for existing but no he grew only more cheerful under misfortune  i insulted him he looked at me in slow and smiling surprise  i fight you why he asked slowly and then he laughed you are so funny ho ho youll be the death of me he he he oh ho ho ho  what would you it was past endurance by the blood of judas how i hated him then there was that nameclaverhouse what a name wasnt it absurd claverhouse merciful heaven why claverhouse again and again i asked myself that question i should not have minded smith or brown or jonesbut claverhouse i leave it to you repeat it to yourselfclaverhouse just listen to the ridiculous sound of itclaverhouse should a man live with such a name i ask of you no you say and no said i  but i bethought me of his mortgage what of his crops and barn destroyed i knew he would be unable to meet it so i got a shrewd closemouthed tightfisted moneylender to get the mortgage transferred to him i did not appear but through this agent i forced the foreclosure and but few days no more believe me than the law allowed were given john claverhouse to remove his goods and chattels from the premises then i strolled down to see how he took it for he had lived there upward of twenty years but he met me with his saucereyes twinkling and the light glowing and spreading in his face till it was as a fullrisen moon  ha ha ha he laughed the funniest tike that youngster of mine did you ever hear the like let me tell you he was down playing by the edge of the river when a piece of the bank caved in and splashed him o papa he cried a great big puddle flewed up and hit me  he stopped and waited for me to join him in his infernal glee  i dont see any laugh in it i said shortly and i know my face went sour  he regarded me with wonderment and then came the damnable light glowing and spreading as i have described it till his face shone soft and warm like the summer moon and then the laughha ha thats funny you dont see it eh he he ho ho ho he doesnt see it why look here you know a puddle  but i turned on my heel and left him that was the last i could stand it no longer the thing must end right there i thought curse him the earth should be quit of him and as i went over the hill i could hear his monstrous laugh reverberating against the sky  now i pride myself on doing things neatly and when i resolved to kill john claverhouse i had it in mind to do so in such fashion that i should not look back upon it and feel ashamed i hate bungling and i hate brutality to me there is something repugnant in merely striking a man with ones naked fistfaugh it is sickening so to shoot or stab or club john claverhouse oh that name did not appeal to me and not only was i impelled to do it neatly and artistically but also in such manner that not the slightest possible suspicion could be directed against me  to this end i bent my intellect and after a week of profound incubation i hatched the scheme then i set to work i bought a water spaniel bitch five months old and devoted my whole attention to her training had any one spied upon me they would have remarked that this training consisted entirely of one thingretrieving i taught the dog which i called bellona to fetch sticks i threw into the water and not only to fetch but to fetch at once without mouthing or playing with them the point was that she was to stop for nothing but to deliver the stick in all haste i made a practice of running away and leaving her to chase me with the stick in her mouth till she caught me she was a bright animal and took to the game with such eagerness that i was soon content  after that at the first casual opportunity i presented bellona to john claverhouse i knew what i was about for i was aware of a little weakness of his and of a little private sinning of which he was regularly and inveterately guilty  no he said when i placed the end of the rope in his hand no you dont mean it and his mouth opened wide and he grinned all over his damnable moonface  ii kind of thought somehow you didnt like me he explained wasnt it funny for me to make such a mistake and at the thought he held his sides with laughter  what is her name he managed to ask between paroxysms  bellona i said  he he he tittered what a funny name  i gritted my teeth for his mirth put them on edge and snapped out between them she was the wife of mars you know  then the light of the full moon began to suffuse his face until he exploded with that was my other dog well i guess shes a widow now oh ho ho e he he ho he whooped after me and i turned and fled swiftly over the hill  the week passed by and on saturday evening i said to him you go away monday dont you  he nodded his head and grinned  then you wont have another chance to get a mess of those trout you just dote on  but he did not notice the sneer oh i dont know he chuckled im going up tomorrow to try pretty hard  thus was assurance made doubly sure and i went back to my house hugging myself with rapture  early next morning i saw him go by with a dipnet and gunnysack and bellona trotting at his heels i knew where he was bound and cut out by the back pasture and climbed through the underbrush to the top of the mountain keeping carefully out of sight i followed the crest along for a couple of miles to a natural amphitheatre in the hills where the little river raced down out of a gorge and stopped for breath in a large and placid rockbound pool that was the spot i sat down on the croup of the mountain where i could see all that occurred and lighted my pipe  ere many minutes had passed john claverhouse came plodding up the bed of the stream bellona was ambling about him and they were in high feather her short snappy barks mingling with his deeper chestnotes arrived at the pool he threw down the dipnet and sack and drew from his hippocket what looked like a large fat candle but i knew it to be a stick of giant for such was his method of catching trout he dynamited them he attached the fuse by wrapping the giant tightly in a piece of cotton then he ignited the fuse and tossed the explosive into the pool  like a flash bellona was into the pool after it i could have shrieked aloud for joy claverhouse yelled at her but without avail he pelted her with clods and rocks but she swam steadily on till she got the stick of giant in her mouth when she whirled about and headed for shore then for the first time he realized his danger and started to run as foreseen and planned by me she made the bank and took out after him oh i tell you it was great as i have said the pool lay in a sort of amphitheatre above and below the stream could be crossed on steppingstones and around and around up and down and across the stones raced claverhouse and bellona i could never have believed that such an ungainly man could run so fast but run he did bellona hotfooted after him and gaining and then just as she caught up he in full stride and she leaping with nose at his knee there was a sudden flash a burst of smoke a terrific detonation and where man and dog had been the instant before there was naught to be seen but a big hole in the ground  death from accident while engaged in illegal fishing that was the verdict of the coroners jury and that is why i pride myself on the neat and artistic way in which i finished off john claverhouse there was no bungling no brutality nothing of which to be ashamed in the whole transaction as i am sure you will agree no more does his infernal laugh go echoing among the hills and no more does his fat moonface rise up to vex me my days are peaceful now and my nights sleep deep     the leopard mans story   he had a dreamy faraway look in his eyes and his sad insistent voice gentlespoken as a maids seemed the placid embodiment of some deepseated melancholy he was the leopard man but he did not look it his business in life whereby he lived was to appear in a cage of performing leopards before vast audiences and to thrill those audiences by certain exhibitions of nerve for which his employers rewarded him on a scale commensurate with the thrills he produced  as i say he did not look it he was narrowhipped narrowshouldered and anaemic while he seemed not so much oppressed by gloom as by a sweet and gentle sadness the weight of which was as sweetly and gently borne for an hour i had been trying to get a story out of him but he appeared to lack imagination to him there was no romance in his gorgeous career no deeds of daring no thrillsnothing but a gray sameness and infinite boredom  lions oh yes he had fought with them it was nothing all you had to do was to stay sober anybody could whip a lion to a standstill with an ordinary stick he had fought one for half an hour once just hit him on the nose every time he rushed and when he got artful and rushed with his head down why the thing to do was to stick out your leg when he grabbed at the leg you drew it back and hit hint on the nose again that was all  with the faraway look in his eyes and his soft flow of words he showed me his scars there were many of them and one recent one where a tigress had reached for his shoulder and gone down to the bone i could see the neatly mended rents in the coat he had on his right arm from the elbow down looked as though it had gone through a threshing machine what of the ravage wrought by claws and fangs but it was nothing he said only the old wounds bothered him somewhat when rainy weather came on  suddenly his face brightened with a recollection for he was really as anxious to give me a story as i was to get it  i suppose youve heard of the liontamer who was hated by another man he asked  he paused and looked pensively at a sick lion in the cage opposite  got the toothache he explained well the liontamers big play to the audience was putting his head in a lions mouth the man who hated him attended every performance in the hope sometime of seeing that lion crunch down he followed the show about all over the country the years went by and he grew old and the liontamer grew old and the lion grew old and at last one day sitting in a front seat he saw what he had waited for the lion crunched down and there wasnt any need to call a doctor  the leopard man glanced casually over his finger nails in a manner which would have been critical had it not been so sad  now thats what i call patience he continued and its my style but it was not the style of a fellow i knew he was a little thin sawedoff swordswallowing and juggling frenchman de ville he called himself and he had a nice wife she did trapeze work and used to dive from under the roof into a net turning over once on the way as nice as you please  de ville had a quick temper as quick as his hand and his hand was as quick as the paw of a tiger one day because the ringmaster called him a frogeater or something like that and maybe a little worse he shoved him against the soft pine background he used in his knifethrowing act so quick the ringmaster didnt have time to think and there before the audience de ville kept the air on fire with his knives sinking them into the wood all around the ringmaster so close that they passed through his clothes and most of them bit into his skin  the clowns had to pull the knives out to get him loose for he was pinned fast so the word went around to watch out for de ville and no one dared be more than barely civil to his wife and she was a sly bit of baggage too only all hands were afraid of de ville  but there was one man wallace who was afraid of nothing he was the liontamer and he had the selfsame trick of putting his head into the lions mouth hed put it into the mouths of any of them though he preferred augustus a big goodnatured beast who could always be depended upon  as i was saying wallaceking wallace we called himwas afraid of nothing alive or dead he was a king and no mistake ive seen him drunk and on a wager go into the cage of a lion thatd turned nasty and without a stick beat him to a finish just did it with his fist on the nose  madame de ville  at an uproar behind us the leopard man turned quietly around it was a divided cage and a monkey poking through the bars and around the partition had had its paw seized by a big gray wolf who was trying to pull it off by main strength the arm seemed stretching out longer end longer like a thick elastic and the unfortunate monkeys mates were raising a terrible din no keeper was at hand so the leopard man stepped over a couple of paces dealt the wolf a sharp blow on the nose with the light cane he carried and returned with a sadly apologetic smile to take up his unfinished sentence as though there had been no interruption  looked at king wallace and king wallace looked at her while de ville looked black we warned wallace but it was no use he laughed at us as he laughed at de ville one day when he shoved de villes head into a bucket of paste because he wanted to fight  de ville was in a pretty messi helped to scrape him off but he was cool as a cucumber and made no threats at all but i saw a glitter in his eyes which i had seen often in the eyes of wild beasts and i went out of my way to give wallace a final warning he laughed but he did not look so much in madame de villes direction after that  several months passed by nothing had happened and i was beginning to think it all a scare over nothing we were west by that time showing in frisco it was during the afternoon performance and the big tent was filled with women and children when i went looking for red denny the head canvasman who had walked off with my pocketknife  passing by one of the dressing tents i glanced in through a hole in the canvas to see if i could locate him he wasnt there but directly in front of me was king wallace in tights waiting for his turn to go on with his cage of performing lions he was watching with much amusement a quarrel between a couple of trapeze artists all the rest of the people in the dressing tent were watching the same thing with the exception of de ville whom i noticed staring at wallace with undisguised hatred wallace and the rest were all too busy following the quarrel to notice this or what followed  but i saw it through the hole in the canvas de ville drew his handkerchief from his pocket made as though to mop the sweat from his face with it it was a hot day and at the same time walked past wallaces back the look troubled me at the time for not only did i see hatred in it but i saw triumph as well  de ville will bear watching i said to myself and i really breathed easier when i saw him go out the entrance to the circus grounds and board an electric car for down town a few minutes later i was in the big tent where i had overhauled red denny king wallace was doing his turn and holding the audience spellbound he was in a particularly vicious mood and he kept the lions stirred up till they were all snarling that is all of them except old augustus and he was just too fat and lazy and old to get stirred up over anything  finally wallace cracked the old lions knees with his whip and got him into position old augustus blinking goodnaturedly opened his mouth and in popped wallaces head then the jaws came together crunch just like that  the leopard man smiled in a sweetly wistful fashion and the faraway look came into his eyes  and that was the end of king wallace he went on in his sad low voice after the excitement cooled down i watched my chance and bent over and smelled wallaces head then i sneezed  it it was i queried with halting eagerness  snuffthat de ville dropped on his hair in the dressing tent old augustus never meant to do it he only sneezed     local color   i do not see why you should not turn this immense amount of unusual information to account i told him unlike most men equipped with similar knowledge you have expression your style is  is sufficientlyerjournalese he interrupted suavely  precisely you could turn a pretty penny  but he interlocked his fingers meditatively shrugged his shoulders and dismissed the subject  i have tried it it does not pay  it was paid for and published he added after a pause and i was also honored with sixty days in the hobo  the hobo i ventured  the hobo he fixed his eyes on my spencer and ran along the titles while he cast his definition the hobo my dear fellow is the name for that particular place of detention in city and county jails wherein are assembled tramps drunks beggars and the riffraff of petty offenders the word itself is a pretty one and it has a history hautboistheres the french of it haut meaning high and bois wood in english it becomes hautboy a wooden musical instrument of twofoot tone i believe played with a double reed an oboe in fact you remember in henry iv      the case of a treble hautboy      was a mansion for him a court  from this to hoboy is but a step and for that matter the english used the terms interchangeably butand mark you the leap paralyzes onecrossing the western ocean in new york city hautboy or hoboy becomes the name by which the nightscavenger is known in a way one understands its being born of the contempt for wandering players and musical fellows but see the beauty of it the burn and the brand the nightscavenger the pariah the miserable the despised the man without caste and in its next incarnation consistently and logically it attaches itself to the american outcast namely the tramp then as others have mutilated its sense the tramp mutilates its form and hoboy becomes exultantly hobo wherefore the large stone and brick cells lined with double and tripletiered bunks in which the law is wont to incarcerate him he calls the hobo interesting isnt it  and i sat back and marvelled secretly at this encyclopaedicminded man this leith clayrandolph this common tramp who made himself at home in my den charmed such friends as gathered at my small table outshone me with his brilliance and his manners spent my spending money smoked my best cigars and selected from my ties and studs with a cultivated and discriminating eye  he absently walked over to the shelves and looked into lorias economic foundation of society  i like to talk with you he remarked you are not indifferently schooled youve read the books and your economic interpretation of history as you choose to call it this with a sneer eminently fits you for an intellectual outlook on life but your sociologic judgments are vitiated by your lack of practical knowledge now i who know the books pardon me somewhat better than you know life too i have lived it naked taken it up in both my hands and looked at it and tasted it the flesh and the blood of it and being purely an intellectual i have been biased by neither passion nor prejudice all of which is necessary for clear concepts and all of which you lack ah a really clever passage listen  and he read aloud to me in his remarkable style paralleling the text with a running criticism and commentary lucidly wording involved and lumbering periods casting side and cross lights upon the subject introducing points the author had blundered past and objections he had ignored catching up lost ends flinging a contrast into a paradox and reducing it to a coherent and succinctly stated truthin short flashing his luminous genius in a blaze of fire over pages erstwhile dull and heavy and lifeless  it is long since that leith clayrandolph note the hyphenated surname knocked at the back door of idlewild and melted the heart of gunda now gunda was cold as her norway hills though in her least frigid moods she was capable of permitting especially nicelooking tramps to sit on the back stoop and devour lone crusts and forlorn and forsaken chops but that a tatterdemalion out of the night should invade the sanctity of her kitchenkingdom and delay dinner while she set a place for him in the warmest corner was a matter of such moment that the sunflower went to see ah the sunflower of the soft heart and swift sympathy leith clayrandolph threw his glamour over her for fifteen long minutes whilst i brooded with my cigar and then she fluttered back with vague words and the suggestion of a castoff suit i would never miss  surely i shall never miss it i said and i had in mind the dark gray suit with the pockets draggled from the freightage of many booksbooks that had spoiled more than one days fishing sport  i should advise you however i added to mend the pockets first  but the sunflowers face clouded no she said the black one  the black one this explosively incredulously i wear it quite often ii intended wearing it tonight  you have two better ones and you know i never liked it dear the sunflower hurried on besides its shiny  shiny  itit soon will be which is just the same and the man is really estimable he is nice and refined and i am sure he  has seen better days  yes and the weather is raw and beastly and his clothes are threadbare and you have many suits  five i corrected counting in the dark gray fishing outfit with the draggled pockets  and he has none no home nothing  not even a sunflowerputting my arm around herwherefore he is deserving of all things give him the black suit dearnay the best one the very best one under high heaven for such lack there must be compensation  you are a dear and the sunflower moved to the door and looked back alluringly you are a perfect dear  and this after seven years i marvelled till she was back again timid and apologetic  ii gave him one of your white shirts he wore a cheap horrid cotton thing and i knew it would look ridiculous and then his shoes were so slipshod i let him have a pair of yours the old ones with the narrow caps  old ones  well they pinched horribly and you know they did  it was ever thus the sunflower vindicated things  and so leith clayrandolph came to idlewild to stay how long i did not dream nor did i dream how often he was to come for he was like an erratic comet fresh he would arrive and cleanly clad from grand folk who were his friends as i was his friend and again weary and worn he would creep up the brierrose path from the montanas or mexico and without a word when his wanderlust gripped him he was off and away into that great mysterious underworld he called the road  i could not bring myself to leave until i had thanked you you of the open hand and heart he said on the night he donned my good black suit  and i confess i was startled when i glanced over the top of my paper and saw a loftybrowed and eminently respectablelooking gentleman boldly and carelessly at ease the sunflower was right he must have known better days for the black suit and white shirt to have effected such a transformation involuntarily i rose to my feet prompted to meet him on equal ground and then it was that the clayrandolph glamour descended upon me he slept at idlewild that night and the next night and for many nights and he was a man to love the son of anak otherwise rufus the blueeyed and also plebeianly known as tots rioted with him from brierrose path to farthest orchard scalped him in the haymow with barbaric yells and once with pharisaic zeal was near to crucifying him under the attic roof beams the sunflower would have loved him for the son of anaks sake had she not loved him for his own as for myself let the sunflower tell in the times he elected to be gone of how often i wondered when leith would come back again leith the lovable yet he was a man of whom we knew nothing beyond the fact that he was kentuckyborn his past was a blank he never spoke of it and he was a man who prided himself upon his utter divorce of reason from emotion to him the world spelled itself out in problems i charged him once with being guilty of emotion when roaring round the den with the son of anak pickaback not so he held could he not cuddle a sensedelight for the problems sake  he was elusive a man who intermingled nameless argot with polysyllabic and technical terms he would seem sometimes the veriest criminal in speech face expression everything at other times the cultured and polished gentleman and again the philosopher and scientist but there was something glimmering there which i never caughtflashes of sincerity of real feeling i imagined which were sped ere i could grasp echoes of the man he once was possibly or hints of the man behind the mask but the mask he never lifted and the real man we never knew  but the sixty days with which you were rewarded for your journalism i asked never mind loria tell me  well if i must he flung one knee over the other with a short laugh  in a town that shall be nameless he began in fact a city of fifty thousand a fair and beautiful city wherein men slave for dollars and women for dress an idea came to me my front was prepossessing as fronts go and my pockets empty i had in recollection a thought i once entertained of writing a reconciliation of kant and spencer not that they are reconcilable of course but the room offered for scientific satire  i waved my hand impatiently and he broke off  i was just tracing my mental states for you in order to show the genesis of the action he explained however the idea came what was the matter with a tramp sketch for the daily press the irreconcilability of the constable and the tramp for instance so i hit the drag the drag my dear fellow is merely the street or the high places if you will for a newspaper office the elevator whisked me into the sky and cerberus in the guise of an anaemic office boy guarded the door consumption one could see it at a glance nerve irish colossal tenacity undoubted dead inside the year  pale youth quoth i i pray thee the way to the sanctumsanctorum to the most high cockalorum  he deigned to look at me scornfully with infinite weariness  gwan an see the janitor i dont know nothin about the gas  nay my lilywhite the editor  wich editor he snapped like a young bullterrier dramatic sportin society sunday weekly daily telegraph local news editorial wich  which i did not know the editor i proclaimed stoutly the only editor  aw spargo he sniffed  of course spargo i answered who else  gimme yer card says he  my what  yer cardsay wots yer business anyway  and the anaemic cerberus sized me up with so insolent an eye that i reached over and took him out of his chair i knocked on his meagre chest with my fore knuckle and fetched forth a weak gaspy cough but he looked at me unflinchingly much like a defiant sparrow held in the hand  i am the censustaker time i boomed in sepulchral tones beware lest i knock too loud  oh i dont know he sneered  whereupon i rapped him smartly and he choked and turned purplish  well whatcher want he wheezed with returning breath  i want spargo the only spargo  then leave go an ill glide an see  no you dont my lilywhite and i took a tighter grip on his collar no bouncers in mine understand ill go along  leith dreamily surveyed the long ash of his cigar and turned to me do you know anak you cant appreciate the joy of being the buffoon playing the clown you couldnt do it if you wished your pitiful little conventions and smug assumptions of decency would prevent but simply to turn loose your soul to every whimsicality to play the fool unafraid of any possible result why that requires a man other than a householder and lawrespecting citizen  however as i was saying i saw the only spargo he was a big beefy redfaced personage fulljowled and doublechinned sweating at his desk in his shirtsleeves it was august you know he was talking into a telephone when i entered or swearing rather i should say and the while studying me with his eyes when he hung up he turned to me expectantly  you are a very busy man i said  he jerked a nod with his head and waited  and after all is it worth it i went on what does life mean that it should make you sweat what justification do you find in sweat now look at me i toil not neither do i spin  who are you what are you he bellowed with a suddenness that was well rude tearing the words out as a dog does a bone  a very pertinent question sir i acknowledged first i am a man next a downtrodden american citizen i am cursed with neither profession trade nor expectations like esau i am pottageless my residence is everywhere the sky is my coverlet i am one of the dispossessed a sansculotte a proletarian or in simpler phraseology addressed to your understanding a tramp  what the hell  nay fair sir a tramp a man of devious ways and strange lodgements and multifarious  quit it he shouted what do you want  i want money  he started and half reached for an open drawer where must have reposed a revolver then bethought himself and growled this is no bank  nor have i checks to cash but i have sir an idea which by your leave and kind assistance i shall transmute into cash in short how does a tramp sketch done by a tramp to the life strike you are you open to it do your readers hunger for it do they crave after it can they be happy without it  i thought for a moment that he would have apoplexy but he quelled the unruly blood and said he liked my nerve i thanked him and assured him i liked it myself then he offered me a cigar and said he thought hed do business with me  but mind you he said when he had jabbed a bunch of copy paper into my hand and given me a pencil from his vest pocket mind you i wont stand for the high and flighty philosophical and i perceive you have a tendency that way throw in the local color wads of it and a bit of sentiment perhaps but no slumgullion about political economy nor social strata or such stuff make it concrete to the point with snap and go and life crisp and crackling and interestingtumble  and i tumbled and borrowed a dollar  dont forget the local color he shouted after me through the door  and anak it was the local color that did for me  the anaemic cerberus grinned when i took the elevator got the bounce eh  nay pale youth so lilywhite i chortled waving the copy paper not the bounce but a detail ill be city editor in three months and then ill make you jump  and as the elevator stopped at the next floor down to take on a pair of maids he strolled over to the shaft and without frills or verbiage consigned me and my detail to perdition but i liked him he had pluck and was unafraid and he knew as well as i that death clutched him close  but how could you leith i cried the picture of the consumptive lad strong before me how could you treat him so barbarously  leith laughed dryly my dear fellow how often must i explain to you your confusions orthodox sentiment and stereotyped emotion master you and then your temperament you are really incapable of rational judgments cerberus pshaw a flash expiring a mote of fading sparkle a dimpulsing and dying organismpouf a snap of the fingers a puff of breath what would you a pawn in the game of life not even a problem there is no problem in a stillborn babe nor in a dead child they never arrived nor did cerberus now for a really pretty problem  but the local color i prodded him  thats right he replied keep me in the running well i took my handful of copy paper down to the railroad yards for local color dangled my legs from a sidedoor pullman which is another name for a boxcar and ran off the stuff of course i made it clever and brilliant and all that with my little unanswerable slings at the state and my social paradoxes and withal made it concrete enough to dissatisfy the average citizen  from the tramp standpoint the constabulary of the township was particularly rotten and i proceeded to open the eyes of the good people it is a proposition mathematically demonstrable that it costs the community more to arrest convict and confine its tramps in jail than to send them as guests for like periods of time to the best hotel and this i developed giving the facts and figures the constable fees and the mileage and the court and jail expenses oh it was convincing and it was true and i did it in a lightly humorous fashion which fetched the laugh and left the sting the main objection to the system i contended was the defraudment and robbery of the tramp the good money which the community paid out for him should enable him to riot in luxury instead of rotting in dungeons i even drew the figures so fine as to permit him not only to live in the best hotel but to smoke two twentyfivecent cigars and indulge in a tencent shine each day and still not cost the taxpayers so much as they were accustomed to pay for his conviction and jail entertainment and as subsequent events proved it made the taxpayers wince  one of the constables i drew to the life nor did i forget a certain sol glenhart as rotten a police judge as was to be found between the seas and this i say out of a vast experience while he was notorious in local trampdom his civic sins were not only not unknown but a crying reproach to the townspeople of course i refrained from mentioning name or habitat drawing the picture in an impersonal composite sort of way which none the less blinded no one to the faithfulness of the local color  naturally myself a tramp the tenor of the article was a protest against the maltreatment of the tramp cutting the taxpayers to the pits of their purses threw them open to sentiment and then in i tossed the sentiment lumps and chunks of it trust me it was excellently done and the rhetoricsay just listen to the tail of my peroration  so as we go mooching along the drag with a sharp lamp out for john law we cannot help remembering that we are beyond the pale that our ways are not their ways and that the ways of john law with us are different from his ways with other men poor lost souls wailing for a crust in the dark we know full well our helplessness and ignominy and well may we repeat after a stricken brother overseas our pride it is to know no spur of pride man has forgotten us god has forgotten us only are we remembered by the harpies of justice who prey upon our distress and coin our sighs and tears into bright shining dollars  incidentally my picture of sol glenhart the police judge was good a striking likeness and unmistakable with phrases tripping along like this this crooknosed grossbodied harpy this civic sinner this judicial highwayman possessing the morals of the tenderloin and an honor which thieves honor puts to shame who compounds criminality with shystersharks and in atonement railroads the unfortunate and impecunious to rotting cellsand so forth and so forth style sophomoric and devoid of the dignity and tone one would employ in a dissertation on surplus value or the fallacies of marxism but just the stuff the dear public likes  humph grunted spargo when i put the copy in his fist swift gait you strike my man  i fixed a hypnotic eye on his vest pocket and he passed out one of his superior cigars which i burned while he ran through the stuff twice or thrice he looked over the top of the paper at me searchingly but said nothing till he had finished  whered you work you pencilpusher he asked  my maiden effort i simpered modestly scraping one foot and faintly simulating embarrassment  maiden hell what salary do you want  nay nay i answered no salary in mine thank you most to death i am a free downtrodden american citizen and no man shall say my time is his  save john law he chuckled  save john law said i  how did you know i was bucking the police department he demanded abruptly  i didnt know but i knew you were in training i answered yesterday morning a charitably inclined female presented me with three biscuits a piece of cheese and a funereal slab of chocolate cake all wrapped in the current clarion wherein i noted an unholy glee because the cowbells candidate for chief of police had been turned down likewise i learned the municipal election was at hand and put two and two together another mayor and the right kind means new police commissioners new police commissioners means new chief of police new chief of police means cowbells candidate ergo your turn to play  he stood up shook my hand and emptied his plethoric vest pocket i put them away and puffed on the old one  youll do he jubilated this stuff patting my copy is the first gun of the campaign youll touch off many another before were done ive been looking for you for years come on in on the editorial  but i shook my head  come now he admonished sharply no shenanagan the cowbell must have you it hungers for you craves after you wont be happy till it gets you what say  in short he wrestled with me but i was bricks and at the end of half an hour the only spargo gave it up  remember he said any time you reconsider im open no matter where you are wire me and ill send the ducats to come on at once  i thanked him and asked the pay for my copydope he called it  oh regular routine he said get it the first thursday after publication  then ill have to trouble you for a few scad until  he looked at me and smiled better cough up eh  sure i said nobody to identify me so make it cash  and cash it was made thirty plunks a plunk is a dollar my dear anak and i pulled my freight ehoh departed  pale youth i said to cerberus i am bounced he grinned with pallid joy and in token of the sincere esteem i bear you receive this little his eyes flushed and he threw up one hand swiftly to guard his head from the expected blowthis little memento  i had intended to slip a fiver into his hand but for all his surprise he was too quick for me  aw keep yer dirt he snarled  i like you still better i said adding a second fiver you grow perfect but you must take it  he backed away growling but i caught him round the neck roughed what little wind he had out of him and left him doubled up with the two fives in his pocket but hardly had the elevator started when the two coins tinkled on the roof and fell down between the car and the shaft as luck had it the door was not closed and i put out my hand and caught them the elevator boys eyes bulged  its a way i have i said pocketing them  some blokes dropped em down the shaft he whispered awed by the circumstance  it stands to reason said i  ill take charge of em he volunteered  nonsense  youd better turn em over he threatened or i stop the works  pshaw  and stop he did between floors  young man i said have you a mother he looked serious as though regretting his act and further to impress him i rolled up my right sleeve with greatest care are you prepared to die i got a stealthy crouch on and put a catfoot forward but a minute a brief minute stands between you and eternity here i crooked my right hand into a claw and slid the other foot up young man young man i trumpeted in thirty seconds i shall tear your heart dripping from your bosom and stoop to hear you shriek in hell  it fetched him he gave one whoop the car shot down and i was on the drag you see anak its a habit i cant shake off of leaving vivid memories behind no one ever forgets me  i had not got to the corner when i heard a familiar voice at my shoulder  hello cinders which way  it was chi slim who had been with me once when i was thrown off a freight in jacksonville couldnt see em fer cinders he described it and the monica stuck by me monica from monos the tramp nickname  bound south i answered and hows slim  bum bulls is horstile  wheres the push  at the hangout ill put you wise  whos the main guy  me and dont yer ferget it  the lingo was rippling from leiths lips but perforce i stopped him pray translate remember i am a foreigner  certainly he answered cheerfully slim is in poor luck bull means policeman he tells me the bulls are hostile i ask where the push is the gang he travels with by putting me wise he will direct me to where the gang is hanging out the main guy is the leader slim claims that distinction  slim and i hiked out to a neck of woods just beyond town and there was the push a score of husky hobos charmingly located on the bank of a little purling stream  come on you mugs slim addressed them throw yer feet heres cinders an we must do em proud  all of which signifies that the hobos had better strike out and do some lively begging in order to get the wherewithal to celebrate my return to the fold after a years separation but i flashed my dough and slim sent several of the younger men off to buy the booze take my word for it anak it was a blowout memorable in trampdom to this day its amazing the quantity of booze thirty plunks will buy and it is equally amazing the quantity of booze outside of which twenty stiffs will get beer and cheap wine made up the card with alcohol thrown in for the blowdintheglass stiffs it was greatan orgy under the sky a contest of beakermen a study in primitive beastliness to me there is something fascinating in a drunken man and were i a college president i should institute pg psychology courses in practical drunkenness it would beat the books and compete with the laboratory  all of which is neither here nor there for after sixteen hours of it early next morning the whole push was copped by an overwhelming array of constables and carted off to jail after breakfast about ten oclock we were lined upstairs into court limp and spiritless the twenty of us and there under his purple panoply nose crooked like a napoleonic eagle and eyes glittering and beady sat sol glenhart  john ambrose the clerk called out and chi slim with the ease of long practice stood up  vagrant your honor the bailiff volunteered and his honor not deigning to look at the prisoner snapped ten days and chi slim sat down  and so it went with the monotony of clockwork fifteen seconds to the man four men to the minute the mugs bobbing up and down in turn like marionettes the clerk called the name the bailiff the offence the judge the sentence and the man sat down that was all simple eh superb  chi slim nudged me givem a spiel cinders you kin do it  i shook my head  gwan he urged give m a ghost story the mugsll take it all right and you kin throw yer feet fer tobacco for us till we get out  l c randolph the clerk called  i stood up but a hitch came in the proceedings the clerk whispered to the judge and the bailiff smiled  you are a newspaper man i understand mr randolph his honor remarked sweetly  it took me by surprise for i had forgotten the cowbell in the excitement of succeeding events and i now saw myself on the edge of the pit i had digged  thats yer graft work it slim prompted  its all over but the shouting i groaned back but slim unaware of the article was puzzled  your honor i answered when i can get work that is my occupation  you take quite an interest in local affairs i see here his honor took up the mornings cowbell and ran his eye up and down a column i knew was mine color is good he commented an appreciative twinkle in his eyes pictures excellent characterized by broad sargentlike effects now thist his judge you have depicted you ah draw from life i presume  rarely your i honor i answered composites ideals rather  er types i may say  but you have color sir unmistakable color he continued  that is splashed on afterward i explained  this judge then is not modelled from life as one might be led to believe  no your honor  ah i see merely a type of judicial wickedness  nay more your honor i said boldly an ideal  splashed with local color afterward ha good and may i venture to ask how much you received for this bit of work  thirty dollars your honor  hum good and his tone abruptly changed young man local color is a bad thing i find you guilty of it and sentence you to thirty days imprisonment or at your pleasure impose a fine of thirty dollars  alas said i i spent the thirty dollars in riotous living  and thirty days more for wasting your substance  next case said his honor to the clerk  slim was stunned gee he whispered gee the push gets ten days and you get sixty gee  leith struck a match lighted his dead cigar and opened the book on his knees returning to the original conversation dont you find anak that though loria handles the bipartition of the revenues with scrupulous care he yet omits one important factor namely  yes i said absently yes     amateur night   the elevator boy smiled knowingly to himself when he took her up he had noted the sparkle in her eyes the color in her cheeks his little cage had quite warmed with the glow of her repressed eagerness and now on the down trip it was glacierlike the sparkle and the color were gone she was frowning and what little he could see of her eyes was cold and steelgray oh he knew the symptoms he did he was an observer and he knew it too and some day when he was big enough he was going to be a reporter sure and in the meantime he studied the procession of life as it streamed up and down eighteen skyscraper floors in his elevator car he slid the door open for her sympathetically and watched her trip determinedly out into the street  there was a robustness in her carriage which came of the soil rather than of the city pavement but it was a robustness in a finer than the wonted sense a vigorous daintiness it might be called which gave an impression of virility with none of the womanly left out it told of a heredity of seekers and fighters of people that worked stoutly with head and hand of ghosts that reached down out of the misty past and moulded and made her to be a doer of things  but she was a little angry and a great deal hurt i can guess what you would tell me the editor had kindly but firmly interrupted her lengthy preamble in the longlookedforwardto interview just ended and you have told me enough he had gone on heartlessly she was sure as she went over the conversation in its freshness you have done no newspaper work you are undrilled undisciplined unhammered into shape you have received a highschool education and possibly topped it off with normal school or college you have stood well in english your friends have all told you how cleverly you write and how beautifully and so forth and so forth you think you can do newspaper work and you want me to put you on well i am sorry but there are no openings if you knew how crowded  but if there are no openings she had interrupted in turn how did those who are in get in how am i to show that i am eligible to get in  they made themselves indispensable was the terse response make yourself indispensable  but how can i if i do not get the chance  make your chance  but how she had insisted at the same time privately deeming him a most unreasonable man  how that is your business not mine he said conclusively rising in token that the interview was at an end i must inform you my dear young lady that there have been at least eighteen other aspiring young ladies here this week and that i have not the time to tell each and every one of them how the function i perform on this paper is hardly that of instructor in a school of journalism  she caught an outbound car and ere she descended from it she had conned the conversation over and over again but how she repeated to herself as she climbed the three flights of stairs to the rooms where she and her sister bached but how and so she continued to put the interrogation for the stubborn scotch blood though many times removed from scottish soil was still strong in her and further there was need that she should learn how her sister letty and she had come up from an interior town to the city to make their way in the world john wyman was landpoor disastrous business enterprises had burdened his acres and forced his two girls edna and letty into doing something for themselves a year of schoolteaching and of nightstudy of shorthand and typewriting had capitalized their city project and fitted them for the venture which same venture was turning out anything but successful the city seemed crowded with inexperienced stenographers and typewriters and they had nothing but their own inexperience to offer ednas secret ambition had been journalism but she had planned a clerical position first so that she might have time and space in which to determine where and on what line of journalism she would embark but the clerical position had not been forthcoming either for letty or her and day by day their little hoard dwindled though the room rent remained normal and the stove consumed coal with undiminished voracity and it was a slim little hoard by now  theres max irwin letty said talking it over hes a journalist with a national reputation go and see him ed he knows how and he should be able to tell you how  but i dont know him edna objected  no more than you knew the editor you saw today  yes long and judicially but thats different  not a bit different from the strange men and women youll interview when youve learned how letty encouraged  i hadnt looked at it in that light edna conceded after all wheres the difference between interviewing mr max irwin for some paper or interviewing mr max irwin for myself it will be practice too ill go and look him up in the directory  letty i know i can write if i get the chance she announced decisively a moment later i just feel that i have the feel of it if you know what i mean  and letty knew and nodded i wonder what he is like she asked softly  ill make it my business to find out edna assured her and ill let you know inside fortyeight hours  letty clapped her hands good thats the newspaper spirit make it twentyfour hours and you are perfect                      and i am very sorry to trouble you she concluded the statement of her case to max irwin famous war correspondent and veteran journalist  not at all he answered with a deprecatory wave of the hand if you dont do your own talking whos to do it for you now i understand your predicament precisely you want to get on the intelligencer you want to get in at once and you have had no previous experience in the first place then have you any pull there are a dozen men in the city a line from whom would be an opensesame after that you would stand or fall by your own ability theres senator longbridge for instance and claus inskeep the streetcar magnate and lane and mcchesney he paused with voice suspended  i am sure i know none of them she answered despondently  its not necessary do you know any one that knows them or any one that knows any one else that knows them  edna shook her head  then we must think of something else he went on cheerfully youll have to do something yourself let me see  he stopped and thought for a moment with closed eyes and wrinkled forehead she was watching him studying him intently when his blue eyes opened with a snap and his face suddenly brightened  i have it but no wait a minute  and for a minute it was his turn to study her and study her he did till she could feel her cheeks flushing under his gaze  youll do i think though it remains to be seen he said enigmatically it will show the stuff thats in you besides and it will be a better claim upon the intelligencer people than all the lines from all the senators and magnates in the world the thing for you is to do amateur night at the loops  ii hardly understand edna said for his suggestion conveyed no meaning to her what are the loops and what is amateur night  i forgot you said you were from the interior but so much the better if youve only got the journalistic grip it will be a first impression and first impressions are always unbiased unprejudiced fresh vivid the loops are out on the rim of the city near the parka place of diversion theres a scenic railway a water toboggan slide a concert band a theatre wild animals moving pictures and so forth and so forth the common people go there to look at the animals and enjoy themselves and the other people go there to enjoy themselves by watching the common people enjoy themselves a democratic freshairbreathing frolicking affair thats what the loops are  but the theatre is what concerns you its vaudeville one turn follows anotherjugglers acrobats rubberjointed wonders firedancers coonsong artists singers players female impersonators sentimental soloists and so forth and so forth these people are professional vaudevillists they make their living that way many are excellently paid some are free rovers doing a turn wherever they can get an opening at the obermann the orpheus the alcatraz the louvre and so forth and so forth others cover circuit pretty well all over the country an interesting phase of life and the pay is big enough to attract many aspirants  now the management of the loops in its bid for popularity instituted what is called amateur night that is to say twice a week after the professionals have done their turns the stage is given over to the aspiring amateurs the audience remains to criticise the populace becomes the arbiter of artor it thinks it does which is the same thing and it pays its money and is well pleased with itself and amateur night is a paying proposition to the management  but the point of amateur night and it is well to note it is that these amateurs are not really amateurs they are paid for doing their turn at the best they may be termed professional amateurs it stands to reason that the management could not get people to face a rampant audience for nothing and on such occasions the audience certainly goes mad its great funfor the audience but the thing for you to do and it requires nerve i assure you is to go out make arrangements for two turns wednesday and saturday nights i believe do your two turns and write it up for the sunday intelligencer  butbut she quavered ii and there was a suggestion of disappointment and tears in her voice  i see he said kindly you were expecting something else something different something better we all do at first but remember the admiral of the queens navee who swept the floor and polished up the handle of the big front door you must face the drudgery of apprenticeship or quit right now what do you say  the abruptness with which he demanded her decision startled her as she faltered she could see a shade of disappointment beginning to darken his face  in a way it must be considered a test he added encouragingly a severe one but so much the better now is the time are you game  ill try she said faintly at the same time making a note of the directness abruptness and haste of these city men with whom she was coming in contact  good why when i started in i had the dreariest deadliest details imaginable and after that for a weary time i did the police and divorce courts but it all came well in the end and did me good you are luckier in making your start with sunday work its not particularly great what of it do it show the stuff youre made of and youll get a call for better workbetter class and better pay now you go out this afternoon to the loops and engage to do two turns  but what kind of turns can i do edna asked dubiously  do thats easy can you sing never mind dont need to sing screech do anythingthats what youre paid for to afford amusement to give bad art for the populace to howl down and when you do your turn take some one along for chaperon be afraid of no one talk up move about among the amateurs waiting their turn pump them study them photograph them in your brain get the atmosphere the color strong color lots of it dig right in with both hands and get the essence of it the spirit the significance what does it mean find out what it means thats what youre there for thats what the readers of the sunday intelligencer want to know  be terse in style vigorous of phrase apt concretely apt in similitude avoid platitudes and commonplaces exercise selection seize upon things salient eliminate the rest and you have pictures paint those pictures in words and the intelligencer will have you get hold of a few back numbers and study the sunday intelligencer feature story tell it all in the opening paragraph as advertisement of contents and in the contents tell it all over again then put a snapper at the end so if theyre crowded for space they can cut off your contents anywhere reattach the snapper and the story will still retain form there thats enough study the rest out for yourself  they both rose to their feet edna quite carried away by his enthusiasm and his quick jerky sentences bristling with the things she wanted to know  and remember miss wyman if youre ambitious that the aim and end of journalism is not the feature article avoid the rut the feature is a trick master it but dont let it master you but master it you must for if you cant learn to do a feature well you can never expect to do anything better in short put your whole self into it and yet outside of it above it remain yourself if you follow me and now good luck to you  they had reached the door and were shaking hands  and one thing more he interrupted her thanks let me see your copy before you turn it in i may be able to put you straight here and there  edna found the manager of the loops a fullfleshed heavyjowled man bushy of eyebrow and generally belligerent of aspect with an absentminded scowl on his face and a black cigar stuck in the midst thereof symes was his name she had learned ernst symes  whatcher turn he demanded ere half her brief application had left her lips  sentimental soloist soprano she answered promptly remembering irwins advice to talk up  whatcher name mr symes asked scarcely deigning to glance at her  she hesitated so rapidly had she been rushed into the adventure that she had not considered the question of a name at all  any name stage name he bellowed impatiently  nan bellayne she invented on the spur of the moment bellayne yes thats it  he scribbled it into a notebook all right take your turn wednesday and saturday  how much do i get edna demanded  twoanahalf a turn two turns five getcher pay first monday after second turn  and without the simple courtesy of good day he turned his back on her and plunged into the newspaper he had been reading when she entered  edna came early on wednesday evening letty with her and in a telescope basket her costumea simple affair a plaid shawl borrowed from the washerwoman a ragged scrubbing skirt borrowed from the charwoman and a gray wig rented from a costumer for twentyfive cents a night completed the outfit for edna had elected to be an old irishwoman singing brokenheartedly after her wandering boy  though they had come early she found everything in uproar the main performance was under way the orchestra was playing and the audience intermittently applauding the infusion of the amateurs clogged the working of things behind the stage crowded the passages dressing rooms and wings and forced everybody into everybody elses way this was particularly distasteful to the professionals who carried themselves as befitted those of a higher caste and whose behavior toward the pariah amateurs was marked by hauteur and even brutality and edna bullied and elbowed and shoved about clinging desperately to her basket and seeking a dressing room took note of it all  a dressing room she finally found jammed with three other amateur ladies who were making up with much noise highpitched voices and squabbling over a lone mirror her own makeup was so simple that it was quickly accomplished and she left the trio of ladies holding an armed truce while they passed judgment upon her letty was close at her shoulder and with patience and persistence they managed to get a nook in one of the wings which commanded a view of the stage  a small dark man dapper and debonair swallowtailed and tophatted was waltzing about the stage with dainty mincing steps and in a thin little voice singing something or other about somebody or something evidently pathetic as his waning voice neared the end of the lines a large woman crowned with an amazing wealth of blond hair thrust rudely past edna trod heavily on her toes and shoved her contemptuously to the side bloomin hamateur she hissed as she went past and the next instant she was on the stage graciously bowing to the audience while the small dark man twirled extravagantly about on his tiptoes  hello girls  this greeting drawled with an inimitable vocal caress in every syllable close in her ear caused edna to give a startled little jump a smoothfaced moonfaced young man was smiling at her goodnaturedly his makeup was plainly that of the stock tramp of the stage though the inevitable whiskers were lacking  oh it dont take a minute to slapm on he explained divining the search in her eyes and waving in his hand the adornment in question they make a feller sweat he explained further and then whats yer turn  sopranosentimental she answered trying to be offhand and at ease  whata you doin it for he demanded directly  for fun what else she countered  i just sized you up for that as soon as i put eyes on you you aint graftin for a paper are you  i never met but one editor in my life she replied evasively and i hewell we didnt get on very well together  hittin m for a job  edna nodded carelessly though inwardly anxious and cudgelling her brains for something to turn the conversation  whatd he say  that eighteen other girls had already been there that week  gave you the icy mit eh the moonfaced young man laughed and slapped his thighs you see were kind of suspicious the sunday papers d like to get amateur night done up brown in a nice little package and the manager dont see it that way gets wildeyed at the thought of it  and whats your turn she asked  who me oh im doin the tramp act tonight im charley welsh you know  she felt that by the mention of his name he intended to convey to her complete enlightenment but the best she could do was to say politely oh is that so  she wanted to laugh at the hurt disappointment which came into his face but concealed her amusement  come now he said brusquely you cant stand there and tell me youve never heard of charley welsh well you must be young why im an only the only amateur at that sure you must have seen me im everywhere i could be a professional but i get more dough out of it by doin the amateur  but whats an only she queried i want to learn  sure charley welsh said gallantly ill put you wise an only is a nonpareil the feller that does one kind of a turn bettern any other feller hes the only see  and edna saw  to get a line on the biz he continued throw yer lamps on me im the only allround amateur tonight i make a bluff at the tramp act its harder to bluff it than to really do it but then its acting its amateur its art see i do everything from sheeny monologue to team song and dance and dutch comedian sure im charley welsh the only charley welsh  and in this fashion while the thin dark man and the large blond woman warbled dulcetly out on the stage and the other professionals followed in their turns did charley welsh put edna wise giving her much miscellaneous and superfluous information and much that she stored away for the sunday intelligencer  well tra la loo he said suddenly theres his highness chasin you up yer first on the bill never mind the row when you go on just finish yer turn like a lady  it was at that moment that edna felt her journalistic ambition departing from her and was aware of an overmastering desire to be somewhere else but the stage manager like an ogre barred her retreat she could hear the opening bars of her song going up from the orchestra and the noises of the house dying away to the silence of anticipation  go ahead letty whispered pressing her hand and from the other side came the peremptory dont flunk of charley welsh  but her feet seemed rooted to the floor and she leaned weakly against a shift scene the orchestra was beginning over again and a lone voice from the house piped with startling distinctness  puzzle picture find nannie  a roar of laughter greeted the sally and edna shrank back but the strong hand of the manager descended on her shoulder and with a quick powerful shove propelled her out on to the stage his hand and arm had flashed into full view and the audience grasping the situation thundered its appreciation the orchestra was drowned out by the terrible din and edna could see the bows scraping away across the violins apparently without sound it was impossible for her to begin in time and as she patiently waited arms akimbo and ears straining for the music the house let loose again a favorite trick she afterward learned of confusing the amateur by preventing him or her from hearing the orchestra  but edna was recovering her presence of mind she became aware pit to dome of a vast sea of smiling and fundistorted faces of vast roars of laughter rising wave on wave and then her scotch blood went cold and angry the hardworking but silent orchestra gave her the cue and without making a sound she began to move her lips stretch forth her arms and sway her body as though she were really singing the noise in the house redoubled in the attempt to drown her voice but she serenely went on with her pantomime this seemed to continue an interminable time when the audience tiring of its prank and in order to hear suddenly stilled its clamor and discovered the dumb show she had been making for a moment all was silent save for the orchestra her lips moving on without a sound and then the audience realized that it had been sold and broke out afresh this time with genuine applause in acknowledgment of her victory she chose this as the happy moment for her exit and with a bow and a backward retreat she was off the stage in lettys arms  the worst was past and for the rest of the evening she moved about among the amateurs and professionals talking listening observing finding out what it meant and taking mental notes of it all charley welsh constituted himself her preceptor and guardian angel and so well did he perform the selfallotted task that when it was all over she felt fully prepared to write her article but the proposition had been to do two turns and her native pluck forced her to live up to it also in the course of the intervening days she discovered fleeting impressions that required verification so on saturday she was back again with her telescope basket and letty  the manager seemed looking for her and she caught an expression of relief in his eyes when he first saw her he hurried up greeted her and bowed with a respect ludicrously at variance with his previous ogrelike behavior and as he bowed across his shoulders she saw charley welsh deliberately wink  but the surprise had just begun the manager begged to be introduced to her sister chatted entertainingly with the pair of them and strove greatly and anxiously to be agreeable he even went so far as to give edna a dressing room to herself to the unspeakable envy of the three other amateur ladies of previous acquaintance edna was nonplussed and it was not till she met charley welsh in the passage that light was thrown on the mystery  hello he greeted her on easy street eh everything slidin your way  she smiled brightly  thinks yer a female reporter sure i almost split when i sawm layin himself out sweet an pleasin honest now that aint yer graft is it  i told you my experience with editors she parried and honest now it was honest too  but the only charley welsh shook his head dubiously not that i care a rap he declared and if you are just gimme a couple of lines of notice the right kind good ad you know and if yer not why yer all right anyway yer not our class thats straight  after her turn which she did this time with the nerve of an old campaigner the manager returned to the charge and after saying nice things and being generally nice himself he came to the point  youll treat us well i hope he said insinuatingly do the right thing by us and all that  oh she answered innocently you couldnt persuade me to do another turn i know i seemed to take and that youd like to have me but i really really cant  you know what i mean he said with a touch of his old bulldozing manner  no i really wont she persisted vaudevilles tootoo wearing on the nerves my nerves at any rate  whereat he looked puzzled and doubtful and forbore to press the point further  but on monday morning when she came to his office to get her pay for the two turns it was he who puzzled her  you surely must have mistaken me he lied glibly i remember saying something about paying your car fare we always do this you know but we never never pay amateurs that would take the life and sparkle out of the whole thing no charley welsh was stringing you he gets paid nothing for his turns no amateur gets paid the idea is ridiculous however heres fifty cents it will pay your sisters car fare also andvery suavelyspeaking for the loops permit me to thank you for the kind and successful contribution of your services  that afternoon true to her promise to max irwin she placed her typewritten copy into his hands and while he ran over it he nodded his head from time to time and maintained a running fire of commendatory remarks goodthats itthats the stuffpsychologys all rightthe very ideayouve caught itexcellentmissed it a bit here but itll gothats vigorousstrongvividpictures picturesexcellentmost excellent  and when he had run down to the bottom of the last page holding out his hand my dear miss wyman i congratulate you i must say you have exceeded my expectations which to say the least were large you are a journalist a natural journalist youve got the grip and youre sure to get on the intelligencer will take it without doubt and take you too theyll have to take you if they dont some of the other papers will get you  but whats this he queried the next instant his face going serious youve said nothing about receiving the pay for your turns and thats one of the points of the feature i expressly mentioned it if youll remember  it will never do he said shaking his head ominously when she had explained you simply must collect that money somehow let me see let me think a moment  never mind mr irwin she said ive bothered you enough let me use your phone please and ill try mr ernst symes again  he vacated his chair by the desk and edna took down the receiver  charley welsh is sick she began when the connection had been made what no im not charley welsh charley welsh is sick and his sister wants to know if she can come out this afternoon and draw his pay for him  tell charley welshs sister that charley welsh was out this morning and drew his own pay came back the managers familiar tones crisp with asperity  all right edna went on and now nan bellayne wants to know if she and her sister can come out this afternoon and draw nan bellaynes pay  whatd he say whatd he say max irwin cried excitedly as she hung up  that nan bellayne was too much for him and that she and her sister could come out and get her pay and the freedom of the loops to boot  one thing more he interrupted her thanks at the door as on her previous visit now that youve shown the stuff youre made of i should esteem it ahem a privilege to give you a line myself to the intelligencer people     the minions of midas   wade atsheler is deaddead by his own hand to say that this was entirely unexpected by the small coterie which knew him would be to say an untruth and yet never once had we his intimates ever canvassed the idea rather had we been prepared for it in some incomprehensible subconscious way before the perpetration of the deed its possibility is remotest from our thoughts but when we did know that he was dead it seemed somehow that we had understood and looked forward to it all the time this by retrospective analysis we could easily explain by the fact of his great trouble i use great trouble advisedly young handsome with an assured position as the righthand man of eben hale the great streetrailway magnate there could be no reason for him to complain of fortunes favors yet we had watched his smooth brow furrow and corrugate as under some carking care or devouring sorrow we had watched his thick black hair thin and silver as green grain under brazen skies and parching drought who can forget in the midst of the hilarious scenes he toward the last sought with greater and greater aviditywho can forget i say the deep abstractions and black moods into which he fell at such times when the fun rippled and soared from height to height suddenly without rhyme or reason his eyes would turn lacklustre his brows knit as with clenched hands and face overshot with spasms of mental pain he wrestled on the edge of the abyss with some unknown danger  he never spoke of his trouble nor were we indiscreet enough to ask but it was just as well for had we and had he spoken our help and strength could have availed nothing when eben hale died whose confidential secretary he wasnay wellnigh adopted son and full business partnerhe no longer came among us not as i now know that our company was distasteful to him but because his trouble had so grown that he could not respond to our happiness nor find surcease with us why this should be so we could not at the time understand for when eben hales will was probated the world learned that he was sole heir to his employers many millions and it was expressly stipulated that this great inheritance was given to him without qualification hitch or hindrance in the exercise thereof not a share of stock not a penny of cash was bequeathed to the dead mans relatives as for his direct family one astounding clause expressly stated that wade atsheler was to dispense to eben hales wife and sons and daughters whatever moneys his judgement dictated at whatever times he deemed advisable had there been any scandal in the dead mans family or had his sons been wild or undutiful then there might have been a glimmering of reason in this most unusual action but eben hales domestic happiness had been proverbial in the community and one would have to travel far and wide to discover a cleaner saner wholesomer progeny of sons and daughters while his wifewell by those who knew her best she was endearingly termed the mother of the gracchi needless to state this inexplicable will was a nine days wonder but the expectant public was disappointed in that no contest was made  it was only the other day that eben hale was laid away in his stately marble mausoleum and now wade atsheler is dead the news was printed in this mornings paper i have just received through the mail a letter from him posted evidently but a short hour before he hurled himself into eternity this letter which lies before me is a narrative in his own handwriting linking together numerous newspaper clippings and facsimiles of letters the original correspondence he has told me is in the hands of the police he has begged me also as a warning to society against a most frightful and diabolical danger which threatens its very existence to make public the terrible series of tragedies in which he has been innocently concerned i herewith append the text in full  it was in august 1899 just after my return from my summer vacation that the blow fell we did not know it at the time we had not yet learned to school our minds to such awful possibilities mr hale opened the letter read it and tossed it upon my desk with a laugh when i had looked it over i also laughed saying some ghastly joke mr hale and one in very poor taste find here my dear john an exact duplicate of the letter in question  office of the m of m august 17 1899  mr eben hale money baron  dear sirwe desire you to realize upon whatever portion of your vast holdings is necessary to obtain in cash twenty millions of dollars this sum we require you to pay over to us or to our agents you will note we do not specify any given time for it is not our wish to hurry you in this matter you may even if it be easier for you pay us in ten fifteen or twenty instalments but we will accept no single instalment of less than a million  believe us dear mr hale when we say that we embark upon this course of action utterly devoid of animus we are members of that intellectual proletariat the increasing numbers of which mark in red lettering the last days of the nineteenth century we have from a thorough study of economics decided to enter upon this business it has many merits chief among which may be noted that we can indulge in large and lucrative operations without capital so far we have been fairly successful and we hope our dealings with you may be pleasant and satisfactory  pray attend while we explain our views more fully at the base of the present system of society is to be found the property right and this right of the individual to hold property is demonstrated in the last analysis to rest solely and wholly upon might the mailed gentlemen of william the conqueror divided and apportioned england amongst themselves with the naked sword this we are sure you will grant is true of all feudal possessions with the invention of steam and the industrial revolution there came into existence the capitalist class in the modern sense of the word these capitalists quickly towered above the ancient nobility the captains of industry have virtually dispossessed the descendants of the captains of war mind and not muscle wins in todays struggle for existence but this state of affairs is none the less based upon might the change has been qualitative the oldtime feudal baronage ravaged the world with fire and sword the modern money baronage exploits the world by mastering and applying the worlds economic forces brain and not brawn endures and those best fitted to survive are the intellectually and commercially powerful  we the m of m are not content to become wage slaves the great trusts and business combinations with which you have your rating prevent us from rising to the place among you which our intellects qualify us to occupy why because we are without capital we are of the unwashed but with this difference our brains are of the best and we have no foolish ethical nor social scruples as wage slaves toiling early and late and living abstemiously we could not save in threescore yearsnor in twenty times threescore yearsa sum of money sufficient successfully to cope with the great aggregations of massed capital which now exist nevertheless we have entered the arena we now throw down the gage to the capital of the world whether it wishes to fight or not it shall have to fight  mr hale our interests dictate us to demand of you twenty millions of dollars while we are considerate enough to give you reasonable time in which to carry out your share of the transaction please do not delay too long when you have agreed to our terms insert a suitable notice in the agony column of the morning blazer we shall then acquaint you with our plan for transferring the sum mentioned you had better do this some time prior to october 1st if you do not in order to show that we are in earnest we shall on that date kill a man on east thirtyninth street he will be a workingman this man you do not know nor do we you represent a force in modern society we also represent a forcea new force without anger or malice we have closed in battle as you will readily discern we are simply a business proposition you are the upper and we the nether millstone this mans life shall be ground out between you may save him if you agree to our conditions and act in time  there was once a king cursed with a golden touch his name we have taken to do duty as our official seal some day to protect ourselves against competitors we shall copyright it  we beg to remain  the minions of midas  i leave it to you dear john why should we not have laughed over such a preposterous communication the idea we could not but grant was well conceived but it was too grotesque to be taken seriously mr hale said he would preserve it as a literary curiosity and shoved it away in a pigeonhole then we promptly forgot its existence and as promptly on the 1st of october going over the morning mail we read the following  office of the m of m october 1 1899  mr eben hale money baron  dear siryour victim has met his fate an hour ago on east thirtyninth street a workingman was thrust through the heart with a knife ere you read this his body will be lying at the morgue go and look upon your handiwork  on october 14th in token of our earnestness in this matter and in case you do not relent we shall kill a policeman on or near the corner of polk street and clermont avenue  very cordially  the minions of midas  again mr hale laughed his mind was full of a prospective deal with a chicago syndicate for the sale of all his street railways in that city and so he went on dictating to the stenographer never giving it a second thought but somehow i know not why a heavy depression fell upon me what if it were not a joke i asked myself and turned involuntarily to the morning paper there it was as befitted an obscure person of the lower classes a paltry halfdozen lines tucked away in a corner next a patent medicine advertisement  shortly after five oclock this morning on east thirtyninth street a laborer named pete lascalle while on his way to work was stabbed to the heart by an unknown assailant who escaped by running the police have been unable to discover any motive for the murder  impossible was mr hales rejoinder when i had read the item aloud but the incident evidently weighed upon his mind for late in the afternoon with many epithets denunciatory of his foolishness he asked me to acquaint the police with the affair i had the pleasure of being laughed at in the inspectors private office although i went away with the assurance that they would look into it and that the vicinity of polk and clermont would be doubly patrolled on the night mentioned there it dropped till the two weeks had sped by when the following note came to us through the mail  office of the m of m october 15 1899  mr eben hale money baron  dear siryour second victim has fallen on schedule time we are in no hurry but to increase the pressure we shall henceforth kill weekly to protect ourselves against police interference we shall hereafter inform you of the event but a little prior to or simultaneously with the deed trusting this finds you in good health  we are  the minions of midas  this time mr hale took up the paper and after a brief search read to me this account  a dastardly crime  joseph donahue assigned only last night to special patrol duty in the eleventh ward at midnight was shot through the brain and instantly killed the tragedy was enacted in the full glare of the street lights on the corner of polk street and clermont avenue our society is indeed unstable when the custodians of its peace are thus openly and wantonly shot down the police have so far been unable to obtain the slightest clue  barely had he finished this when the police arrivedthe inspector himself and two of his keenest sleuths alarm sat upon their faces and it was plain that they were seriously perturbed though the facts were so few and simple we talked long going over the affair again and again when the inspector went away he confidently assured us that everything would soon be straightened out and the assassins run to earth in the meantime he thought it well to detail guards for the protection of mr hale and myself and several more to be constantly on the vigil about the house and grounds after the lapse of a week at one oclock in the afternoon this telegram was received  office of the m of m october 21 1899  mr eben hale money baron  dear sirwe are sorry to note how completely you have misunderstood us you have seen fit to surround yourself and household with armed guards as though forsooth we were common criminals apt to break in upon you and wrest away by force your twenty millions believe us this is farthest from our intention  you will readily comprehend after a little sober thought that your life is dear to us do not be afraid we would not hurt you for the world it is our policy to cherish you tenderly and protect you from all harm your death means nothing to us if it did rest assured that we would not hesitate a moment in destroying you think this over mr hale when you have paid us our price there will be need of retrenchment dismiss your guards now and cut down your expenses  within minutes of the time you receive this a nursegirl will have been choked to death in brentwood park the body may be found in the shrubbery lining the path which leads off to the left from the bandstand  cordially yours  the minions of midas  the next instant mr hale was at the telephone warning the inspector of the impending murder the inspector excused himself in order to call up police substation f and despatch men to the scene fifteen minutes later he rang us up and informed us that the body had been discovered yet warm in the place indicated that evening the papers teemed with glaring jackthestrangler headlines denouncing the brutality of the deed and complaining about the laxity of the police we were also closeted with the inspector who begged us by all means to keep the affair secret success he said depended upon silence  as you know john mr hale was a man of iron he refused to surrender but oh john it was terrible nay horriblethis awful something this blind force in the dark we could not fight could not plan could do nothing save hold our hands and wait and week by week as certain as the rising of the sun came the notification and death of some person man or woman innocent of evil but just as much killed by us as though we had done it with our own hands a word from mr hale and the slaughter would have ceased but he hardened his heart and waited the lines deepening the mouth and eyes growing sterner and firmer and the face aging with the hours it is needless for me to speak of my own suffering during that frightful period find here the letters and telegrams of the m of m and the newspaper accounts etc of the various murders  you will notice also the letters warning mr hale of certain machinations of commercial enemies and secret manipulations of stock the m of m seemed to have its hand on the inner pulse of the business and financial world they possessed themselves of and forwarded to us information which our agents could not obtain one timely note from them at a critical moment in a certain deal saved all of five millions to mr hale at another time they sent us a telegram which probably was the means of preventing an anarchist crank from taking my employers life we captured the man on his arrival and turned him over to the police who found upon him enough of a new and powerful explosive to sink a battleship  we persisted mr hale was grit clear through he disbursed at the rate of one hundred thousand per week for secret service the aid of the pinkertons and of countless private detective agencies was called in and in addition to this thousands were upon our payroll our agents swarmed everywhere in all guises penetrating all classes of society they grasped at a myriad clues hundreds of suspects were jailed and at various times thousands of suspicious persons were under surveillance but nothing tangible came to light with its communications the m of m continually changed its method of delivery and every messenger they sent us was arrested forthwith but these inevitably proved to be innocent individuals while their descriptions of the persons who had employed them for the errand never tallied on the last day of december we received this notification  office of the m of m december 31 1899  mr eben hale money baron  dear sirpursuant of our policy with which we flatter ourselves you are already well versed we beg to state that we shall give a passport from this vale of tears to inspector bying with whom because of our attentions you have become so well acquainted it is his custom to be in his private office at this hour even as you read this he breathes his last  cordially yours  the minions of midas  i dropped the letter and sprang to the telephone great was my relief when i heard the inspectors hearty voice but even as he spoke his voice died away in the receiver to a gurgling sob and i heard faintly the crash of a falling body then a strange voice hellod me sent me the regards of the m of m and broke the switch like a flash i called up the public office of the central police telling them to go at once to the inspectors aid in his private office i then held the line and a few minutes later received the intelligence that he had been found bathed in his own blood and breathing his last there were no eyewitnesses and no trace was discoverable of the murderer  whereupon mr hale immediately increased his secret service till a quarter of a million flowed weekly from his coffers he was determined to win out his graduated rewards aggregated over ten millions you have a fair idea of his resources and you can see in what manner he drew upon them it was the principle he affirmed that he was fighting for not the gold and it must be admitted that his course proved the nobility of his motive the police departments of all the great cities cooperated and even the united states government stepped in and the affair became one of the highest questions of state certain contingent funds of the nation were devoted to the unearthing of the m of m and every government agent was on the alert but all in vain the minions of midas carried on their damnable work unhampered they had their way and struck unerringly  but while he fought to the last mr hale could not wash his hands of the blood with which they were dyed though not technically a murderer though no jury of his peers would ever have convicted him none the less the death of every individual was due to him as i said before a word from him and the slaughter would have ceased but he refused to give that word he insisted that the integrity of society was assailed that he was not sufficiently a coward to desert his post and that it was manifestly just that a few should be martyred for the ultimate welfare of the many nevertheless this blood was upon his head and he sank into deeper and deeper gloom i was likewise whelmed with the guilt of an accomplice babies were ruthlessly killed children aged men and not only were these murders local but they were distributed over the country in the middle of february one evening as we sat in the library there came a sharp knock at the door on responding to it i found lying on the carpet of the corridor the following missive  office of the m of m february 15 1900  mr eben hale money baron  dear sirdoes not your soul cry out upon the red harvest it is reaping perhaps we have been too abstract in conducting our business let us now be concrete miss adelaide laidlaw is a talented young woman as good we understand as she is beautiful she is the daughter of your old friend judge laidlaw and we happen to know that you carried her in your arms when she was an infant she is your daughters closest friend and at present is visiting her when your eyes have read thus far her visit will have terminated  very cordially  the minions of midas  my god did we not instantly realize the terrible import we rushed through the dayroomsshe was not thereand on to her own apartments the door was locked but we crashed it down by hurling ourselves against it there she lay just as she had finished dressing for the opera smothered with pillows torn from the couch the flush of life yet on her flesh the body still flexible and warm let me pass over the rest of this horror you will surely remember john the newspaper accounts  late that night mr hale summoned me to him and before god did pledge me most solemnly to stand by him and not to compromise even if all kith and kin were destroyed  the next day i was surprised at his cheerfulness i had thought he would be deeply shocked by this last tragedyhow deep i was soon to learn all day he was lighthearted and highspirited as though at last he had found a way out of the frightful difficulty the next morning we found him dead in his bed a peaceful smile upon his careworn faceasphyxiation through the connivance of the police and the authorities it was given out to the world as heart disease we deemed it wise to withhold the truth but little good has it done us little good has anything done us  barely had i left that chamber of death whenbut too latethe following extraordinary letter was received  office of the m of m february 17 1900  mr eben hale money baron  dear siryou will pardon our intrusion we hope so closely upon the sad event of day before yesterday but what we wish to say may be of the utmost importance to you it is in our mind that you may attempt to escape us there is but one way apparently as you have ere this doubtless discovered but we wish to inform you that even this one way is barred you may die but you die failing and acknowledging your failure note this we are part and parcel of your possessions with your millions we pass down to your heirs and assigns forever  we are the inevitable we are the culmination of industrial and social wrong we turn upon the society that has created us we are the successful failures of the age the scourges of a degraded civilization  we are the creatures of a perverse social selection we meet force with force only the strong shall endure we believe in the survival of the fittest you have crushed your wage slaves into the dirt and you have survived the captains of war at your command have shot down like dogs your employees in a score of bloody strikes by such means you have endured we do not grumble at the result for we acknowledge and have our being in the same natural law and now the question has arisen under the present social environment which of us shall survive we believe we are the fittest you believe you are the fittest we leave the eventuality to time and law  cordially yours  the minions of midas  john do you wonder now that i shunned pleasure and avoided friends but why explain surely this narrative will make everything clear three weeks ago adelaide laidlaw died since then i have waited in hope and fear yesterday the will was probated and made public today i was notified that a woman of the middle class would be killed in golden gate park in faraway san francisco the despatches in tonights papers give the details of the brutal happeningdetails which correspond with those furnished me in advance  it is useless i cannot struggle against the inevitable i have been faithful to mr hale and have worked hard why my faithfulness should have been thus rewarded i cannot understand yet i cannot be false to my trust nor break my word by compromising still i have resolved that no more deaths shall be upon my head i have willed the many millions i lately received to their rightful owners let the stalwart sons of eben hale work out their own salvation ere you read this i shall have passed on the minions of midas are allpowerful the police are impotent i have learned from them that other millionnaires have been likewise mulcted or persecutedhow many is not known for when one yields to the m of m his mouth is thenceforth sealed those who have not yielded are even now reaping their scarlet harvest the grim game is being played out the federal government can do nothing i also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in europe society is shaken to its foundations principalities and powers are as brands ripe for the burning instead of the masses against the classes it is a class against the classes we the guardians of human progress are being singled out and struck down law and order have failed  the officials have begged me to keep this secret i have done so but can do so no longer it has become a question of public import fraught with the direst consequences and i shall do my duty before i leave this world by informing it of its peril do you john as my last request make this public do not be frightened the fate of humanity rests in your hand let the press strike off millions of copies let the electric currents sweep it round the world wherever men meet and speak let them speak of it in fear and trembling and then when thoroughly aroused let society arise in its might and cast out this abomination  yours in long farewell  wade atsheler     the shadow and the flash   when i look back i realize what a peculiar friendship it was first there was lloyd inwood tall slender and finely knit nervous and dark and then paul tichlorne tall slender and finely knit nervous and blond each was the replica of the other in everything except color lloyds eyes were black pauls were blue under stress of excitement the blood coursed olive in the face of lloyd crimson in the face of paul but outside this matter of coloring they were as like as two peas both were highstrung prone to excessive tension and endurance and they lived at concert pitch  but there was a trio involved in this remarkable friendship and the third was short and fat and chunky and lazy and loath to say it was i paul and lloyd seemed born to rivalry with each other and i to be peacemaker between them we grew up together the three of us and full often have i received the angry blows each intended for the other they were always competing striving to outdo each other and when entered upon some such struggle there was no limit either to their endeavors or passions  this intense spirit of rivalry obtained in their studies and their games if paul memorized one canto of marmion lloyd memorized two cantos paul came back with three and lloyd again with four till each knew the whole poem by heart i remember an incident that occurred at the swimming holean incident tragically significant of the lifestruggle between them the boys had a game of diving to the bottom of a tenfoot pool and holding on by submerged roots to see who could stay under the longest paul and lloyd allowed themselves to be bantered into making the descent together when i saw their faces set and determined disappear in the water as they sank swiftly down i felt a foreboding of something dreadful the moments sped the ripples died away the face of the pool grew placid and untroubled and neither black nor golden head broke surface in quest of air we above grew anxious the longest record of the longestwinded boy had been exceeded and still there was no sign air bubbles trickled slowly upward showing that the breath had been expelled from their lungs and after that the bubbles ceased to trickle upward each second became interminable and unable longer to endure the suspense i plunged into the water  i found them down at the bottom clutching tight to the roots their heads not a foot apart their eyes wide open each glaring fixedly at the other they were suffering frightful torment writhing and twisting in the pangs of voluntary suffocation for neither would let go and acknowledge himself beaten i tried to break pauls hold on the root but he resisted me fiercely then i lost my breath and came to the surface badly scared i quickly explained the situation and half a dozen of us went down and by main strength tore them loose by the time we got them out both were unconscious and it was only after much barrelrolling and rubbing and pounding that they finally came to their senses they would have drowned there had no one rescued them  when paul tichlorne entered college he let it be generally understood that he was going in for the social sciences lloyd inwood entering at the same time elected to take the same course but paul had had it secretly in mind all the time to study the natural sciences specializing on chemistry and at the last moment he switched over though lloyd had already arranged his years work and attended the first lectures he at once followed pauls lead and went in for the natural sciences and especially for chemistry their rivalry soon became a noted thing throughout the university each was a spur to the other and they went into chemistry deeper than did ever students beforeso deep in fact that ere they took their sheepskins they could have stumped any chemistry or cow college professor in the institution save old moss head of the department and even him they puzzled and edified more than once lloyds discovery of the death bacillus of the sea toad and his experiments on it with potassium cyanide sent his name and that of his university ringing round the world nor was paul a whit behind when he succeeded in producing laboratory colloids exhibiting amoebalike activities and when he cast new light upon the processes of fertilization through his startling experiments with simple sodium chlorides and magnesium solutions on low forms of marine life  it was in their undergraduate days however in the midst of their profoundest plunges into the mysteries of organic chemistry that doris van benschoten entered into their lives lloyd met her first but within twentyfour hours paul saw to it that he also made her acquaintance of course they fell in love with her and she became the only thing in life worth living for they wooed her with equal ardor and fire and so intense became their struggle for her that half the studentbody took to wagering wildly on the result even old moss one day after an astounding demonstration in his private laboratory by paul was guilty to the extent of a months salary of backing him to become the bridegroom of doris van benschoten  in the end she solved the problem in her own way to everybodys satisfaction except pauls and lloyds getting them together she said that she really could not choose between them because she loved them both equally well and that unfortunately since polyandry was not permitted in the united states she would be compelled to forego the honor and happiness of marrying either of them each blamed the other for this lamentable outcome and the bitterness between them grew more bitter  but things came to a head enough it was at my home after they had taken their degrees and dropped out of the worlds sight that the beginning of the end came to pass both were men of means with little inclination and no necessity for professional life my friendship and their mutual animosity were the two things that linked them in any way together while they were very often at my place they made it a fastidious point to avoid each other on such visits though it was inevitable under the circumstances that they should come upon each other occasionally  on the day i have in recollection paul tichlorne had been mooning all morning in my study over a current scientific review this left me free to my own affairs and i was out among my roses when lloyd inwood arrived clipping and pruning and tacking the climbers on the porch with my mouth full of nails and lloyd following me about and lending a hand now and again we fell to discussing the mythical race of invisible people that strange and vagrant people the traditions of which have come down to us lloyd warmed to the talk in his nervous jerky fashion and was soon interrogating the physical properties and possibilities of invisibility a perfectly black object he contended would elude and defy the acutest vision  color is a sensation he was saying it has no objective reality without light we can see neither colors nor objects themselves all objects are black in the dark and in the dark it is impossible to see them if no light strikes upon them then no light is flung back from them to the eye and so we have no visionevidence of their being  but we see black objects in daylight i objected  very true he went on warmly and that is because they are not perfectly black were they perfectly black absolutely black as it were we could not see themay not in the blaze of a thousand suns could we see them and so i say with the right pigments properly compounded an absolutely black paint could be produced which would render invisible whatever it was applied to  it would be a remarkable discovery i said noncommittally for the whole thing seemed too fantastic for aught but speculative purposes  remarkable lloyd slapped me on the shoulder i should say so why old chap to coat myself with such a paint would be to put the world at my feet the secrets of kings and courts would be mine the machinations of diplomats and politicians the play of stockgamblers the plans of trusts and corporations i could keep my hand on the inner pulse of things and become the greatest power in the world and i he broke off shortly then added well i have begun my experiments and i dont mind telling you that im right in line for it  a laugh from the doorway startled us paul tichlorne was standing there a smile of mockery on his lips  you forget my dear lloyd he said  forget what  you forget paul went onah you forget the shadow  i saw lloyds face drop but he answered sneeringly i can carry a sunshade you know then he turned suddenly and fiercely upon him look here paul youll keep out of this if you know whats good for you  a rupture seemed imminent but paul laughed goodnaturedly i wouldnt lay fingers on your dirty pigments succeed beyond your most sanguine expectations yet you will always fetch up against the shadow you cant get away from it now i shall go on the very opposite tack in the very nature of my proposition the shadow will be eliminated  transparency ejaculated lloyd instantly but it cant be achieved  oh no of course not and paul shrugged his shoulders and strolled off down the briarrose path  this was the beginning of it both men attacked the problem with all the tremendous energy for which they were noted and with a rancor and bitterness that made me tremble for the success of either each trusted me to the utmost and in the long weeks of experimentation that followed i was made a party to both sides listening to their theorizings and witnessing their demonstrations never by word or sign did i convey to either the slightest hint of the others progress and they respected me for the seal i put upon my lips  lloyd inwood after prolonged and unintermittent application when the tension upon his mind and body became too great to bear had a strange way of obtaining relief he attended prize fights it was at one of these brutal exhibitions whither he had dragged me in order to tell his latest results that his theory received striking confirmation  do you see that redwhiskered man he asked pointing across the ring to the fifth tier of seats on the opposite side and do you see the next man to him the one in the white hat well there is quite a gap between them is there not  certainly i answered they are a seat apart the gap is the unoccupied seat  he leaned over to me and spoke seriously between the redwhiskered man and the whitehatted man sits ben wasson you have heard me speak of him he is the cleverest pugilist of his weight in the country he is also a caribbean negro fullblooded and the blackest in the united states he has on a black overcoat buttoned up i saw him when he came in and took that seat as soon as he sat down he disappeared watch closely he may smile  i was for crossing over to verify lloyds statement but he restrained me wait he said  i waited and watched till the redwhiskered man turned his head as though addressing the unoccupied seat and then in that empty space i saw the rolling whites of a pair of eyes and the white doublecrescent of two rows of teeth and for the instant i could make out a negros face but with the passing of the smile his visibility passed and the chair seemed vacant as before  were he perfectly black you could sit alongside him and not see him lloyd said and i confess the illustration was apt enough to make me wellnigh convinced  i visited lloyds laboratory a number of times after that and found him always deep in his search after the absolute black his experiments covered all sorts of pigments such as lampblacks tars carbonized vegetable matters soots of oils and fats and the various carbonized animal substances  white light is composed of the seven primary colors he argued to me but it is itself of itself invisible only by being reflected from objects do it and the objects become visible but only that portion of it that is reflected becomes visible for instance here is a blue tobaccobox the white light strikes against it and with one exception all its component colorsviolet indigo green yellow orange and redare absorbed the one exception is blue it is not absorbed but reflected wherefore the tobaccobox gives us a sensation of blueness we do not see the other colors because they are absorbed we see only the blue for the same reason grass is green the green waves of white light are thrown upon our eyes  when we paint our houses we do not apply color to them he said at another time what we do is to apply certain substances that have the property of absorbing from white light all the colors except those that we would have our houses appear when a substance reflects all the colors to the eye it seems to us white when it absorbs all the colors it is black but as i said before we have as yet no perfect black all the colors are not absorbed the perfect black guarding against high lights will be utterly and absolutely invisible look at that for example  he pointed to the palette lying on his worktable different shades of black pigments were brushed on it one in particular i could hardly see it gave my eyes a blurring sensation and i rubbed them and looked again  that he said impressively is the blackest black you or any mortal man ever looked upon but just you wait and ill have a black so black that no mortal man will be able to look upon itand see it  on the other hand i used to find paul tichlorne plunged as deeply into the study of light polarization diffraction and interference single and double refraction and all manner of strange organic compounds  transparency a state or quality of body which permits all rays of light to pass through he defined for me that is what i am seeking lloyd blunders up against the shadow with his perfect opaqueness but i escape it a transparent body casts no shadow neither does it reflect lightwavesthat is the perfectly transparent does not so avoiding high lights not only will such a body cast no shadow but since it reflects no light it will also be invisible  we were standing by the window at another time paul was engaged in polishing a number of lenses which were ranged along the sill suddenly after a pause in the conversation he said oh ive dropped a lens stick your head out old man and see where it went to  out i started to thrust my head but a sharp blow on the forehead caused me to recoil i rubbed my bruised brow and gazed with reproachful inquiry at paul who was laughing in gleeful boyish fashion  well he said  well i echoed  why dont you investigate he demanded and investigate i did before thrusting out my head my senses automatically active had told me there was nothing there that nothing intervened between me and outofdoors that the aperture of the window opening was utterly empty i stretched forth my hand and felt a hard object smooth and cool and flat which my touch out of its experience told me to be glass i looked again but could see positively nothing  white quartzose sand paul rattled off sodic carbonate slaked lime cutlet manganese peroxidethere you have it the finest french plate glass made by the great st gobain company who made the finest plate glass in the world and this is the finest piece they ever made it cost a kings ransom but look at it you cant see it you dont know its there till you run your head against it  eh old boy thats merely an objectlessoncertain elements in themselves opaque yet so compounded as to give a resultant body which is transparent but that is a matter of inorganic chemistry you say very true but i dare to assert standing here on my two feet that in the organic i can duplicate whatever occurs in the inorganic  here he held a testtube between me and the light and i noted the cloudy or muddy liquid it contained he emptied the contents of another testtube into it and almost instantly it became clear and sparkling  or here with quick nervous movements among his array of testtubes he turned a white solution to a wine color and a light yellow solution to a dark brown he dropped a piece of litmus paper into an acid when it changed instantly to red and on floating it in an alkali it turned as quickly to blue  the litmus paper is still the litmus paper he enunciated in the formal manner of the lecturer i have not changed it into something else then what did i do i merely changed the arrangement of its molecules where at first it absorbed all colors from the light but red its molecular structure was so changed that it absorbed red and all colors except blue and so it goes ad infinitum now what i purpose to do is this he paused for a space i purpose to seekay and to findthe proper reagents which acting upon the living organism will bring about molecular changes analogous to those you have just witnessed but these reagents which i shall find and for that matter upon which i already have my hands will not turn the living body to blue or red or black but they will turn it to transparency all light will pass through it it will be invisible it will cast no shadow  a few weeks later i went hunting with paul he had been promising me for some time that i should have the pleasure of shooting over a wonderful dogthe most wonderful dog in fact that ever man shot over so he averred and continued to aver till my curiosity was aroused but on the morning in question i was disappointed for there was no dog in evidence  dont see him about paul remarked unconcernedly and we set off across the fields  i could not imagine at the time what was ailing me but i had a feeling of some impending and deadly illness my nerves were all awry and from the astounding tricks they played me my senses seemed to have run riot strange sounds disturbed me at times i heard the swishswish of grass being shoved aside and once the patter of feet across a patch of stony ground  did you hear anything paul i asked once  but he shook his head and thrust his feet steadily forward  while climbing a fence i heard the low eager whine of a dog apparently from within a couple of feet of me but on looking about me i saw nothing  i dropped to the ground limp and trembling  paul i said we had better return to the house i am afraid i am going to be sick  nonsense old man he answered the sunshine has gone to your head like wine youll be all right its famous weather  but passing along a narrow path through a clump of cottonwoods some object brushed against my legs and i stumbled and nearly fell i looked with sudden anxiety at paul  whats the matter he asked tripping over your own feet  i kept my tongue between my teeth and plodded on though sore perplexed and thoroughly satisfied that some acute and mysterious malady had attacked my nerves so far my eyes had escaped but when we got to the open fields again even my vision went back on me strange flashes of varicolored rainbow light began to appear and disappear on the path before me still i managed to keep myself in hand till the varicolored lights persisted for a space of fully twenty seconds dancing and flashing in continuous play then i sat down weak and shaky  its all up with me i gasped covering my eyes with my hands it has attacked my eyes paul take me home  but paul laughed long and loud what did i tell youthe most wonderful dog eh well what do you think  he turned partly from me and began to whistle i heard the patter of feet the panting of a heated animal and the unmistakable yelp of a dog then paul stooped down and apparently fondled the empty air  here give me your fist  and he rubbed my hand over the cold nose and jowls of a dog a dog it certainly was with the shape and the smooth short coat of a pointer  suffice to say i speedily recovered my spirits and control paul put a collar about the animals neck and tied his handkerchief to its tail and then was vouchsafed us the remarkable sight of an empty collar and a waving handkerchief cavorting over the fields it was something to see that collar and handkerchief pin a bevy of quail in a clump of locusts and remain rigid and immovable till we had flushed the birds  now and again the dog emitted the varicolored lightflashes i have mentioned the one thing paul explained which he had not anticipated and which he doubted could be overcome  theyre a large family he said these sun dogs wind dogs rainbows halos and parhelia they are produced by refraction of light from mineral and ice crystals from mist rain spray and no end of things and i am afraid they are the penalty i must pay for transparency i escaped lloyds shadow only to fetch up against the rainbow flash  a couple of days later before the entrance to pauls laboratory i encountered a terrible stench so overpowering was it that it was easy to discover the sourcea mass of putrescent matter on the doorstep which in general outlines resembled a dog  paul was startled when he investigated my find it was his invisible dog or rather what had been his invisible dog for it was now plainly visible it had been playing about but a few minutes before in all health and strength closer examination revealed that the skull had been crushed by some heavy blow while it was strange that the animal should have been killed the inexplicable thing was that it should so quickly decay  the reagents i injected into its system were harmless paul explained yet they were powerful and it appears that when death comes they force practically instantaneous disintegration remarkable most remarkable well the only thing is not to die they do not harm so long as one lives but i do wonder who smashed in that dogs head  light however was thrown upon this when a frightened housemaid brought the news that gaffer bedshaw had that very morning not more than an hour back gone violently insane and was strapped down at home in the huntsmans lodge where he raved of a battle with a ferocious and gigantic beast that he had encountered in the tichlorne pasture he claimed that the thing whatever it was was invisible that with his own eyes he had seen that it was invisible wherefore his tearful wife and daughters shook their heads and wherefore he but waxed the more violent and the gardener and the coachman tightened the straps by another hole  nor while paul tichlorne was thus successfully mastering the problem of invisibility was lloyd inwood a whit behind i went over in answer to a message of his to come and see how he was getting on now his laboratory occupied an isolated situation in the midst of his vast grounds it was built in a pleasant little glade surrounded on all sides by a dense forest growth and was to be gained by way of a winding and erratic path but i have travelled that path so often as to know every foot of it and conceive my surprise when i came upon the glade and found no laboratory the quaint shed structure with its red sandstone chimney was not nor did it look as if it ever had been there were no signs of ruin no debris nothing  i started to walk across what had once been its site this i said to myself should be where the step went up to the door barely were the words out of my mouth when i stubbed my toe on some obstacle pitched forward and butted my head into something that felt very much like a door i reached out my hand it was a door i found the knob and turned it and at once as the door swung inward on its hinges the whole interior of the laboratory impinged upon my vision greeting lloyd i closed the door and backed up the path a few paces i could see nothing of the building returning and opening the door at once all the furniture and every detail of the interior were visible it was indeed startling the sudden transition from void to light and form and color  what do you think of it eh lloyd asked wringing my hand i slapped a couple of coats of absolute black on the outside yesterday afternoon to see how it worked hows your head you bumped it pretty solidly i imagine  never mind that he interrupted my congratulations ive something better for you to do  while he talked he began to strip and when he stood naked before me he thrust a pot and brush into my hand and said here give me a coat of this  it was an oily shellaclike stuff which spread quickly and easily over the skin and dried immediately  merely preliminary and precautionary he explained when i had finished but now for the real stuff  i picked up another pot he indicated and glanced inside but could see nothing  its empty i said  stick your finger in it  i obeyed and was aware of a sensation of cool moistness on withdrawing my hand i glanced at the forefinger the one i had immersed but it had disappeared i moved and knew from the alternate tension and relaxation of the muscles that i moved it but it defied my sense of sight to all appearances i had been shorn of a finger nor could i get any visual impression of it till i extended it under the skylight and saw its shadow plainly blotted on the floor  lloyd chuckled now spread it on and keep your eyes open  i dipped the brush into the seemingly empty pot and gave him a long stroke across his chest with the passage of the brush the living flesh disappeared from beneath i covered his right leg and he was a onelegged man defying all laws of gravitation and so stroke by stroke member by member i painted lloyd inwood into nothingness it was a creepy experience and i was glad when naught remained in sight but his burning black eyes poised apparently unsupported in midair  i have a refined and harmless solution for them he said a fine spray with an airbrush and presto i am not  this deftly accomplished he said now i shall move about and do you tell me what sensations you experience  in the first place i cannot see you i said and i could hear his gleeful laugh from the midst of the emptiness of course i continued you cannot escape your shadow but that was to be expected when you pass between my eye and an object the object disappears but so unusual and incomprehensible is its disappearance that it seems to me as though my eyes had blurred when you move rapidly i experience a bewildering succession of blurs the blurring sensation makes my eyes ache and my brain tired  have you any other warnings of my presence he asked  no and yes i answered when you are near me i have feelings similar to those produced by dank warehouses gloomy crypts and deep mines and as sailors feel the loom of the land on dark nights so i think i feel the loom of your body but it is all very vague and intangible  long we talked that last morning in his laboratory and when i turned to go he put his unseen hand in mine with nervous grip and said now i shall conquer the world and i could not dare to tell him of paul tichlornes equal success  at home i found a note from paul asking me to come up immediately and it was high noon when i came spinning up the driveway on my wheel paul called me from the tennis court and i dismounted and went over but the court was empty as i stood there gaping openmouthed a tennis ball struck me on the arm and as i turned about another whizzed past my ear for aught i could see of my assailant they came whirling at me from out of space and right well was i peppered with them but when the balls already flung at me began to come back for a second whack i realized the situation seizing a racquet and keeping my eyes open i quickly saw a rainbow flash appearing and disappearing and darting over the ground i took out after it and when i laid the racquet upon it for a halfdozen stout blows pauls voice rang out  enough enough oh ouch stop youre landing on my naked skin you know ow oww ill be good ill be good i only wanted you to see my metamorphosis he said ruefully and i imagined he was rubbing his hurts  a few minutes later we were playing tennisa handicap on my part for i could have no knowledge of his position save when all the angles between himself the sun and me were in proper conjunction then he flashed and only then but the flashes were more brilliant than the rainbowpurest blue most delicate violet brightest yellow and all the intermediary shades with the scintillant brilliancy of the diamond dazzling blinding iridescent  but in the midst of our play i felt a sudden cold chill reminding me of deep mines and gloomy crypts such a chill as i had experienced that very morning the next moment close to the net i saw a ball rebound in midair and empty space and at the same instant a score of feet away paul tichlorne emitted a rainbow flash it could not be he from whom the ball had rebounded and with sickening dread i realized that lloyd inwood had come upon the scene to make sure i looked for his shadow and there it was a shapeless blotch the girth of his body the sun was overhead moving along the ground i remembered his threat and felt sure that all the long years of rivalry were about to culminate in uncanny battle  i cried a warning to paul and heard a snarl as of a wild beast and an answering snarl i saw the dark blotch move swiftly across the court and a brilliant burst of varicolored light moving with equal swiftness to meet it and then shadow and flash came together and there was the sound of unseen blows the net went down before my frightened eyes i sprang toward the fighters crying  for gods sake  but their locked bodies smote against my knees and i was overthrown  you keep out of this old man i heard the voice of lloyd inwood from out of the emptiness and then pauls voice crying yes weve had enough of peacemaking  from the sound of their voices i knew they had separated i could not locate paul and so approached the shadow that represented lloyd but from the other side came a stunning blow on the point of my jaw and i heard paul scream angrily now will you keep away  then they came together again the impact of their blows their groans and gasps and the swift flashings and shadowmovings telling plainly of the deadliness of the struggle  i shouted for help and gaffer bedshaw came running into the court i could see as he approached that he was looking at me strangely but he collided with the combatants and was hurled headlong to the ground with despairing shriek and a cry of o lord ive got em he sprang to his feet and tore madly out of the court  i could do nothing so i sat up fascinated and powerless and watched the struggle the noonday sun beat down with dazzling brightness on the naked tennis court and it was naked all i could see was the blotch of shadow and the rainbow flashes the dust rising from the invisible feet the earth tearing up from beneath the straining footgrips and the wire screen bulge once or twice as their bodies hurled against it that was all and after a time even that ceased there were no more flashes and the shadow had become long and stationary and i remembered their set boyish faces when they clung to the roots in the deep coolness of the pool  they found me an hour afterward some inkling of what had happened got to the servants and they quitted the tichlorne service in a body gaffer bedshaw never recovered from the second shock he received and is confined in a madhouse hopelessly incurable the secrets of their marvellous discoveries died with paul and lloyd both laboratories being destroyed by griefstricken relatives as for myself i no longer care for chemical research and science is a tabooed topic in my household i have returned to my roses natures colors are good enough for me     all gold canyon   it was the green heart of the canyon where the walls swerved back from the rigid plan and relieved their harshness of line by making a little sheltered nook and filling it to the brim with sweetness and roundness and softness here all things rested even the narrow stream ceased its turbulent downrush long enough to form a quiet pool kneedeep in the water with drooping head and halfshut eyes drowsed a redcoated manyantlered buck  on one side beginning at the very lip of the pool was a tiny meadow a cool resilient surface of green that extended to the base of the frowning wall beyond the pool a gentle slope of earth ran up and up to meet the opposing wall fine grass covered the slopegrass that was spangled with flowers with here and there patches of color orange and purple and golden below the canyon was shut in there was no view the walls leaned together abruptly and the canyon ended in a chaos of rocks mosscovered and hidden by a green screen of vines and creepers and boughs of trees up the canyon rose far hills and peaks the big foothills pinecovered and remote and far beyond like clouds upon the border of the slay towered minarets of white where the sierras eternal snows flashed austerely the blazes of the sun  there was no dust in the canyon the leaves and flowers were clean and virginal the grass was young velvet over the pool three cottonwoods sent their scurvy fluffs fluttering down the quiet air on the slope the blossoms of the winewooded manzanita filled the air with springtime odors while the leaves wise with experience were already beginning their vertical twist against the coming aridity of summer in the open spaces on the slope beyond the farthest shadowreach of the manzanita poised the mariposa lilies like so many flights of jewelled moths suddenly arrested and on the verge of trembling into flight again here and there that woods harlequin the madrone permitting itself to be caught in the act of changing its peagreen trunk to madderred breathed its fragrance into the air from great clusters of waxen bells creamy white were these bells shaped like liliesofthevalley with the sweetness of perfume that is of the springtime  there was not a sigh of wind the air was drowsy with its weight of perfume it was a sweetness that would have been cloying had the air been heavy and humid but the air was sharp and thin it was as starlight transmuted into atmosphere shot through and warmed by sunshine and flowerdrenched with sweetness  an occasional butterfly drifted in and out through the patches of light and shade and from all about rose the low and sleepy hum of mountain beesfeasting sybarites that jostled one another goodnaturedly at the board nor found time for rough discourtesy so quietly did the little stream drip and ripple its way through the canyon that it spoke only in faint and occasional gurgles the voice of the stream was as a drowsy whisper ever interrupted by dozings and silences ever lifted again in the awakenings  the motion of all things was a drifting in the heart of the canyon sunshine and butterflies drifted in and out among the trees the hum of the bees and the whisper of the stream were a drifting of sound and the drifting sound and drifting color seemed to weave together in the making of a delicate and intangible fabric which was the spirit of the place it was a spirit of peace that was not of death but of smoothpulsing life of quietude that was not silence of movement that was not action of repose that was quick with existence without being violent with struggle and travail the spirit of the place was the spirit of the peace of the living somnolent with the easement and content of prosperity and undisturbed by rumors of far wars  the redcoated manyantlered buck acknowledged the lordship of the spirit of the place and dozed kneedeep in the cool shaded pool there seemed no flies to vex him and he was languid with rest sometimes his ears moved when the stream awoke and whispered but they moved lazily with foreknowledge that it was merely the stream grown garrulous at discovery that it had slept  but there came a time when the bucks ears lifted and tensed with swift eagerness for sound his head was turned down the canyon his sensitive quivering nostrils scented the air his eyes could not pierce the green screen through which the stream rippled away but to his ears came the voice of a man it was a steady monotonous singsong voice once the buck heard the harsh clash of metal upon rock at the sound he snorted with a sudden start that jerked him through the air from water to meadow and his feet sank into the young velvet while he pricked his ears and again scented the air then he stole across the tiny meadow pausing once and again to listen and faded away out of the canyon like a wraith softfooted and without sound  the clash of steelshod soles against the rocks began to be heard and the mans voice grew louder it was raised in a sort of chant and became distinct with nearness so that the words could be heard      turn around an tun yo face     untoe them sweet hills of grace       d powrs of sin yo am scornin     look about an look aroun     fling yo sinpack on d groun       yo will meet wid d lord in d mornin  a sound of scrambling accompanied the song and the spirit of the place fled away on the heels of the redcoated buck the green screen was burst asunder and a man peered out at the meadow and the pool and the sloping sidehill he was a deliberate sort of man he took in the scene with one embracing glance then ran his eyes over the details to verify the general impression then and not until then did he open his mouth in vivid and solemn approval  smoke of life an snakes of purgatory will you just look at that wood an water an grass an a sidehill a pockethunters delight an a cayuses paradise cool green for tired eyes pink pills for pale people aint in it a secret pasture for prospectors and a restingplace for tired burros by damn  he was a sandycomplexioned man in whose face geniality and humor seemed the salient characteristics it was a mobile face quickchanging to inward mood and thought thinking was in him a visible process ideas chased across his face like windflaws across the surface of a lake his hair sparse and unkempt of growth was as indeterminate and colorless as his complexion it would seem that all the color of his frame had gone into his eyes for they were startlingly blue also they were laughing and merry eyes within them much of the naivete and wonder of the child and yet in an unassertive way they contained much of calm selfreliance and strength of purpose founded upon selfexperience and experience of the world  from out the screen of vines and creepers he flung ahead of him a miners pick and shovel and goldpan then he crawled out himself into the open he was clad in faded overalls and black cotton shirt with hobnailed brogans on his feet and on his head a hat whose shapelessness and stains advertised the rough usage of wind and rain and sun and campsmoke he stood erect seeing wideeyed the secrecy of the scene and sensuously inhaling the warm sweet breath of the canyongarden through nostrils that dilated and quivered with delight his eyes narrowed to laughing slits of blue his face wreathed itself in joy and his mouth curled in a smile as he cried aloud  jumping dandelions and happy hollyhocks but that smells good to me talk about your attar o roses an cologne factories they aint in it  he had the habit of soliloquy his quickchanging facial expressions might tell every thought and mood but the tongue perforce ran hard after repeating like a second boswell  the man lay down on the lip of the pool and drank long and deep of its water tastes good to me he murmured lifting his head and gazing across the pool at the sidehill while he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand the sidehill attracted his attention still lying on his stomach he studied the hill formation long and carefully it was a practised eye that travelled up the slope to the crumbling canyonwall and back and down again to the edge of the pool he scrambled to his feet and favored the sidehill with a second survey  looks good to me he concluded picking up his pick and shovel and goldpan  he crossed the stream below the pool stepping agilely from stone to stone where the sidehill touched the water he dug up a shovelful of dirt and put it into the goldpan he squatted down holding the pan in his two hands and partly immersing it in the stream then he imparted to the pan a deft circular motion that sent the water sluicing in and out through the dirt and gravel the larger and the lighter particles worked to the surface and these by a skilful dipping movement of the pan he spilled out and over the edge occasionally to expedite matters he rested the pan and with his fingers raked out the large pebbles and pieces of rock  the contents of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the smallest bits of gravel remained at this stage he began to work very deliberately and carefully it was fine washing and he washed fine and finer with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch at last the pan seemed empty of everything but water but with a quick semicircular flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into the stream he disclosed a layer of black sand on the bottom of the pan so thin was this layer that it was like a streak of paint he examined it closely in the midst of it was a tiny golden speck he dribbled a little water in over the depressed edge of the pan with a quick flirt he sent the water sluicing across the bottom turning the grains of black sand over and over a second tiny golden speck rewarded his effort  the washing had now become very finefine beyond all need of ordinary placermining he worked the black sand a small portion at a time up the shallow rim of the pan each small portion he examined sharply so that his eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to slide over the edge and away jealously bit by bit he let the black sand slip away a golden speck no larger than a pinpoint appeared on the rim and by his manipulation of the riveter it returned to the bottom of the pan and in such fashion another speck was disclosed and another great was his care of them like a shepherd he herded his flock of golden specks so that not one should be lost at last of the pan of dirt nothing remained but his golden herd he counted it and then after all his labor sent it flying out of the pan with one final swirl of water  but his blue eyes were shining with desire as he rose to his feet seven he muttered aloud asserting the sum of the specks for which he had toiled so hard and which he had so wantonly thrown away seven he repeated with the emphasis of one trying to impress a number on his memory  he stood still a long while surveying the hillside in his eyes was a curiosity newaroused and burning there was an exultance about his bearing and a keenness like that of a hunting animal catching the fresh scent of game  he moved down the stream a few steps and took a second panful of dirt  again came the careful washing the jealous herding of the golden specks and the wantonness with which he sent them flying into the stream when he had counted their number  five he muttered and repeated five  he could not forbear another survey of the hill before filling the pan farther down the stream his golden herds diminished four three two two one were his memorytabulations as he moved down the stream when but one speck of gold rewarded his washing he stopped and built a fire of dry twigs into this he thrust the goldpan and burned it till it was blueblack he held up the pan and examined it critically then he nodded approbation against such a colorbackground he could defy the tiniest yellow speck to elude him  still moving down the stream he panned again a single speck was his reward a third pan contained no gold at all not satisfied with this he panned three times again taking his shovels of dirt within a foot of one another each pan proved empty of gold and the fact instead of discouraging him seemed to give him satisfaction his elation increased with each barren washing until he arose exclaiming jubilantly  if it aint the real thing may god knock off my head with sour apples  returning to where he had started operations he began to pan up the stream at first his golden herds increasedincreased prodigiously fourteen eighteen twentyone twentysix ran his memory tabulations just above the pool he struck his richest panthirtyfive colors  almost enough to save he remarked regretfully as he allowed the water to sweep them away  the sun climbed to the top of the sky the man worked on pan by pan he went up the stream the tally of results steadily decreasing  its just booful the way it peters out he exulted when a shovelful of dirt contained no more than a single speck of gold  and when no specks at all were found in several pans he straightened up and favored the hillside with a confident glance  ah ha mr pocket he cried out as though to an auditor hidden somewhere above him beneath the surface of the slope ah ha mr pocket im acomin im acomin an im shorely gwine to get yer you heah me mr pocket im gwine to get yer as shore as punkins aint cauliflowers  he turned and flung a measuring glance at the sun poised above him in the azure of the cloudless sky then he went down the canyon following the line of shovelholes he had made in filling the pans he crossed the stream below the pool and disappeared through the green screen there was little opportunity for the spirit of the place to return with its quietude and repose for the mans voice raised in ragtime song still dominated the canyon with possession  after a time with a greater clashing of steelshod feet on rock he returned the green screen was tremendously agitated it surged back and forth in the throes of a struggle there was a loud grating and clanging of metal the mans voice leaped to a higher pitch and was sharp with imperativeness a large body plunged and panted there was a snapping and ripping and rending and amid a shower of falling leaves a horse burst through the screen on its back was a pack and from this trailed broken vines and torn creepers the animal gazed with astonished eyes at the scene into which it had been precipitated then dropped its head to the grass and began contentedly to graze a second horse scrambled into view slipping once on the mossy rocks and regaining equilibrium when its hoofs sank into the yielding surface of the meadow it was riderless though on its back was a highhorned mexican saddle scarred and discolored by long usage  the man brought up the rear he threw off pack and saddle with an eye to camp location and gave the animals their freedom to graze he unpacked his food and got out fryingpan and coffeepot he gathered an armful of dry wood and with a few stones made a place for his fire  my he said but ive got an appetite i could scoff ironfilings an horseshoe nails an thank you kindly maam for a second helpin  he straightened up and while he reached for matches in the pocket of his overalls his eyes travelled across the pool to the sidehill his fingers had clutched the matchbox but they relaxed their hold and the hand came out empty the man wavered perceptibly he looked at his preparations for cooking and he looked at the hill  guess ill take another whack at her he concluded starting to cross the stream  they aint no sense in it i know he mumbled apologetically but keepin grub back an hour aint goin to hurt none i reckon  a few feet back from his first line of testpans he started a second line the sun dropped down the western sky the shadows lengthened but the man worked on he began a third line of testpans he was crosscutting the hillside line by line as he ascended the centre of each line produced the richest pans while the ends came where no colors showed in the pan and as he ascended the hillside the lines grew perceptibly shorter the regularity with which their length diminished served to indicate that somewhere up the slope the last line would be so short as to have scarcely length at all and that beyond could come only a point the design was growing into an inverted v the converging sides of this v marked the boundaries of the goldbearing dirt  the apex of the v was evidently the mans goal often he ran his eye along the converging sides and on up the hill trying to divine the apex the point where the goldbearing dirt must cease here resided mr pocketfor so the man familiarly addressed the imaginary point above him on the slope crying out  come down out o that mr pocket be right smart an agreeable an come down  all right he would add later in a voice resigned to determination all right mr pocket its plain to me i got to come right up an snatch you out baldheaded an ill do it ill do it he would threaten still later  each pan he carried down to the water to wash and as he went higher up the hill the pans grew richer until he began to save the gold in an empty bakingpowder can which he carried carelessly in his hippocket so engrossed was he in his toil that he did not notice the long twilight of oncoming night it was not until he tried vainly to see the gold colors in the bottom of the pan that he realized the passage of time he straightened up abruptly an expression of whimsical wonderment and awe overspread his face as he drawled  gosh darn my buttons if i didnt plumb forget dinner  he stumbled across the stream in the darkness and lighted his longdelayed fire flapjacks and bacon and warmedover beans constituted his supper then he smoked a pipe by the smouldering coals listening to the night noises and watching the moonlight stream through the canyon after that he unrolled his bed took off his heavy shoes and pulled the blankets up to his chin his face showed white in the moonlight like the face of a corpse but it was a corpse that knew its resurrection for the man rose suddenly on one elbow and gazed across at his hillside  good night mr pocket he called sleepily good night  he slept through the early gray of morning until the direct rays of the sun smote his closed eyelids when he awoke with a start and looked about him until he had established the continuity of his existence and identified his present self with the days previously lived  to dress he had merely to buckle on his shoes he glanced at his fireplace and at his hillside wavered but fought down the temptation and started the fire  keep yer shirt on bill keep yer shirt on he admonished himself whats the good of rushin no use in gettin all het up an sweaty mr pocketll wait for you he aint arunnin away before you can get yer breakfast now what you want bill is something fresh in yer bill o fare so its up to you to go an get it  he cut a short pole at the waters edge and drew from one of his pockets a bit of line and a draggled fly that had once been a royal coachman  mebbe theyll bite in the early morning he muttered as he made his first cast into the pool and a moment later he was gleefully crying whatd i tell you eh whatd i tell you  he had no reel nor any inclination to waste time and by main strength and swiftly he drew out of the water a flashing teninch trout three more caught in rapid succession furnished his breakfast when he came to the steppingstones on his way to his hillside he was struck by a sudden thought and paused  id just better take a hike downstream a ways he said theres no tellin what cuss may be snoopin around  but he crossed over on the stones and with a i really oughter take that hike the need of the precaution passed out of his mind and he fell to work  at nightfall he straightened up the small of his back was stiff from stooping toil and as he put his hand behind him to soothe the protesting muscles he said  now what dye think of that by damn i clean forgot my dinner again if i dont watch out ill sure be degeneratin into a twomealaday crank  pockets is the damnedest things i ever see for makin a man absentminded he communed that night as he crawled into his blankets nor did he forget to call up the hillside good night mr pocket good night  rising with the sun and snatching a hasty breakfast he was early at work a fever seemed to be growing in him nor did the increasing richness of the testpans allay this fever there was a flush in his cheek other than that made by the heat of the sun and he was oblivious to fatigue and the passage of time when he filled a pan with dirt he ran down the hill to wash it nor could he forbear running up the hill again panting and stumbling profanely to refill the pan  he was now a hundred yards from the water and the inverted v was assuming definite proportions the width of the paydirt steadily decreased and the man extended in his minds eye the sides of the v to their meetingplace far up the hill this was his goal the apex of the v and he panned many times to locate it  just about two yards above that manzanita bush an a yard to the right he finally concluded  then the temptation seized him as plain as the nose on your face he said as he abandoned his laborious crosscutting and climbed to the indicated apex he filled a pan and carried it down the hill to wash it contained no trace of gold he dug deep and he dug shallow filling and washing a dozen pans and was unrewarded even by the tiniest golden speck he was enraged at having yielded to the temptation and cursed himself blasphemously and pridelessly then he went down the hill and took up the crosscutting  slow an certain bill slow an certain he crooned shortcuts to fortune aint in your line an its about time you know it get wise bill get wise slow an certains the only hand you can play so go to it an keep to it too  as the crosscuts decreased showing that the sides of the v were converging the depth of the v increased the goldtrace was dipping into the hill it was only at thirty inches beneath the surface that he could get colors in his pan the dirt he found at twentyfive inches from the surface and at thirtyfive inches yielded barren pans at the base of the v by the waters edge he had found the gold colors at the grass roots the higher he went up the hill the deeper the gold dipped  to dig a hole three feet deep in order to get one testpan was a task of no mean magnitude while between the man and the apex intervened an untold number of such holes to be an theres no tellin how much deeper itll pitch he sighed in a moments pause while his fingers soothed his aching back  feverish with desire with aching back and stiffening muscles with pick and shovel gouging and mauling the soft brown earth the man toiled up the hill before him was the smooth slope spangled with flowers and made sweet with their breath behind him was devastation it looked like some terrible eruption breaking out on the smooth skin of the hill his slow progress was like that of a slug befouling beauty with a monstrous trail  though the dipping goldtrace increased the mans work he found consolation in the increasing richness of the pans twenty cents thirty cents fifty cents sixty cents were the values of the gold found in the pans and at nightfall he washed his banner pan which gave him a dollars worth of golddust from a shovelful of dirt  ill just bet its my luck to have some inquisitive cuss come buttin in here on my pasture he mumbled sleepily that night as he pulled the blankets up to his chin  suddenly he sat upright bill he called sharply now listen to me bill dye hear its up to you tomorrow mornin to mosey round an see what you can see understand tomorrow morning an dont you forget it  he yawned and glanced across at his sidehill good night mr pocket he called  in the morning he stole a march on the sun for he had finished breakfast when its first rays caught him and he was climbing the wall of the canyon where it crumbled away and gave footing from the outlook at the top he found himself in the midst of loneliness as far as he could see chain after chain of mountains heaved themselves into his vision to the east his eyes leaping the miles between range and range and between many ranges brought up at last against the whitepeaked sierrasthe main crest where the backbone of the western world reared itself against the sky to the north and south he could see more distinctly the crosssystems that broke through the main trend of the sea of mountains to the west the ranges fell away one behind the other diminishing and fading into the gentle foothills that in turn descended into the great valley which he could not see  and in all that mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor of the handiwork of mansave only the torn bosom of the hillside at his feet the man looked long and carefully once far down his own canyon he thought he saw in the air a faint hint of smoke he looked again and decided that it was the purple haze of the hills made dark by a convolution of the canyon wall at its back  hey you mr pocket he called down into the canyon stand out from under im acomin mr pocket im acomin  the heavy brogans on the mans feet made him appear clumsyfooted but he swung down from the giddy height as lightly and airily as a mountain goat a rock turning under his foot on the edge of the precipice did not disconcert him he seemed to know the precise time required for the turn to culminate in disaster and in the meantime he utilized the false footing itself for the momentary earthcontact necessary to carry him on into safety where the earth sloped so steeply that it was impossible to stand for a second upright the man did not hesitate his foot pressed the impossible surface for but a fraction of the fatal second and gave him the bound that carried him onward again where even the fraction of a seconds footing was out of the question he would swing his body past by a moments handgrip on a jutting knob of rock a crevice or a precariously rooted shrub at last with a wild leap and yell he exchanged the face of the wall for an earthslide and finished the descent in the midst of several tons of sliding earth and gravel  his first pan of the morning washed out over two dollars in coarse gold it was from the centre of the v to either side the diminution in the values of the pans was swift his lines of crosscutting holes were growing very short the converging sides of the inverted v were only a few yards apart their meetingpoint was only a few yards above him but the paystreak was dipping deeper and deeper into the earth by early afternoon he was sinking the testholes five feet before the pans could show the goldtrace  for that matter the goldtrace had become something more than a trace it was a placer mine in itself and the man resolved to come back after he had found the pocket and work over the ground but the increasing richness of the pans began to worry him by late afternoon the worth of the pans had grown to three and four dollars the man scratched his head perplexedly and looked a few feet up the hill at the manzanita bush that marked approximately the apex of the v he nodded his head and said oracularly  its one o two things bill one o two things either mr pockets spilled himself all out an down the hill or else mr pockets that damned rich you maybe wont be able to carry him all away with you and thatd be hell wouldnt it now he chuckled at contemplation of so pleasant a dilemma  nightfall found him by the edge of the stream his eyes wrestling with the gathering darkness over the washing of a fivedollar pan  wisht i had an electric light to go on working he said  he found sleep difficult that night many times he composed himself and closed his eyes for slumber to overtake him but his blood pounded with too strong desire and as many times his eyes opened and he murmured wearily wisht it was sunup  sleep came to him in the end but his eyes were open with the first paling of the stars and the gray of dawn caught him with breakfast finished and climbing the hillside in the direction of the secret abidingplace of mr pocket  the first crosscut the man made there was space for only three holes so narrow had become the paystreak and so close was he to the fountainhead of the golden stream he had been following for four days  be cam bill be cam he admonished himself as he broke ground for the final hole where the sides of the v had at last come together in a point  ive got the almighty cinch on you mr pocket an you cant lose me he said many times as he sank the hole deeper and deeper  four feet five feet six feet he dug his way down into the earth the digging grew harder his pick grated on broken rock he examined the rock rotten quartz was his conclusion as with the shovel he cleared the bottom of the hole of loose dirt he attacked the crumbling quartz with the pick bursting the disintegrating rock asunder with every stroke  he thrust his shovel into the loose mass his eye caught a gleam of yellow he dropped the shovel and squatted suddenly on his heels as a farmer rubs the clinging earth from freshdug potatoes so the man a piece of rotten quartz held in both hands rubbed the dirt away  sufferin sardanopolis he cried lumps an chunks of it lumps an chunks of it  it was only half rock he held in his hand the other half was virgin gold he dropped it into his pan and examined another piece little yellow was to be seen but with his strong fingers he crumbled the rotten quartz away till both hands were filled with glowing yellow he rubbed the dirt away from fragment after fragment tossing them into the goldpan it was a treasurehole so much had the quartz rotted away that there was less of it than there was of gold now and again he found a piece to which no rock clunga piece that was all gold a chunk where the pick had laid open the heart of the gold glittered like a handful of yellow jewels and he cocked his head at it and slowly turned it around and over to observe the rich play of the light upon it  talk about yer too much gold diggins the man snorted contemptuously why this diggin d make it look like thirty cents this diggin is all gold an right here an now i name this yere canyon all gold canyon b gosh  still squatting on his heels he continued examining the fragments and tossing them into the pan suddenly there came to him a premonition of danger it seemed a shadow had fallen upon him but there was no shadow his heart had given a great jump up into his throat and was choking him then his blood slowly chilled and he felt the sweat of his shirt cold against his flesh  he did not spring up nor look around he did not move he was considering the nature of the premonition he had received trying to locate the source of the mysterious force that had warned him striving to sense the imperative presence of the unseen thing that threatened him there is an aura of things hostile made manifest by messengers refined for the senses to know and this aura he felt but knew not how he felt it his was the feeling as when a cloud passes over the sun it seemed that between him and life had passed something dark and smothering and menacing a gloom as it were that swallowed up life and made for deathhis death  every force of his being impelled him to spring up and confront the unseen danger but his soul dominated the panic and he remained squatting on his heels in his hands a chunk of gold he did not dare to look around but he knew by now that there was something behind him and above him he made believe to be interested in the gold in his hand he examined it critically turned it over and over and rubbed the dirt from it and all the time he knew that something behind him was looking at the gold over his shoulder  still feigning interest in the chunk of gold in his hand he listened intently and he heard the breathing of the thing behind him his eyes searched the ground in front of him for a weapon but they saw only the uprooted gold worthless to him now in his extremity there was his pick a handy weapon on occasion but this was not such an occasion the man realized his predicament he was in a narrow hole that was seven feet deep his head did not come to the surface of the ground he was in a trap  he remained squatting on his heels he was quite cool and collected but his mind considering every factor showed him only his helplessness he continued rubbing the dirt from the quartz fragments and throwing the gold into the pan there was nothing else for him to do yet he knew that he would have to rise up sooner or later and face the danger that breathed at his back  the minutes passed and with the passage of each minute he knew that by so much he was nearer the time when he must stand up or elseand his wet shirt went cold against his flesh again at the thoughtor else he might receive death as he stooped there over his treasure  still he squatted on his heels rubbing dirt from gold and debating in just what manner he should rise up he might rise up with a rush and claw his way out of the hole to meet whatever threatened on the even footing above ground or he might rise up slowly and carelessly and feign casually to discover the thing that breathed at his back his instinct and every fighting fibre of his body favored the mad clawing rush to the surface his intellect and the craft thereof favored the slow and cautious meeting with the thing that menaced and which he could not see and while he debated a loud crashing noise burst on his ear at the same instant he received a stunning blow on the left side of the back and from the point of impact felt a rush of flame through his flesh he sprang up in the air but halfway to his feet collapsed his body crumpled in like a leaf withered in sudden heat and he came down his chest across his pan of gold his face in the dirt and rock his legs tangled and twisted because of the restricted space at the bottom of the hole his legs twitched convulsively several times his body was shaken as with a mighty ague there was a slow expansion of the lungs accompanied by a deep sigh then the air was slowly very slowly exhaled and his body as slowly flattened itself down into inertness  above revolver in hand a man was peering down over the edge of the hole he peered for a long time at the prone and motionless body beneath him after a while the stranger sat down on the edge of the hole so that he could see into it and rested the revolver on his knee reaching his hand into a pocket he drew out a wisp of brown paper into this he dropped a few crumbs of tobacco the combination became a cigarette brown and squat with the ends turned in not once did he take his eyes from the body at the bottom of the hole he lighted the cigarette and drew its smoke into his lungs with a caressing intake of the breath he smoked slowly once the cigarette went out and he relighted it and all the while he studied the body beneath him  in the end he tossed the cigarette stub away and rose to his feet he moved to the edge of the hole spanning it a hand resting on each edge and with the revolver still in the right hand he muscled his body down into the hole while his feet were yet a yard from the bottom he released his hands and dropped down  at the instant his feet struck bottom he saw the pocketminers arm leap out and his own legs knew a swift jerking grip that overthrew him in the nature of the jump his revolverhand was above his head swiftly as the grip had flashed about his legs just as swiftly he brought the revolver down he was still in the air his fall in process of completion when he pulled the trigger the explosion was deafening in the confined space the smoke filled the hole so that he could see nothing he struck the bottom on his back and like a cats the pocketminers body was on top of him even as the miners body passed on top the stranger crooked in his right arm to fire and even in that instant the miner with a quick thrust of elbow struck his wrist the muzzle was thrown up and the bullet thudded into the dirt of the side of the hole  the next instant the stranger felt the miners hand grip his wrist the struggle was now for the revolver each man strove to turn it against the others body the smoke in the hole was clearing the stranger lying on his back was beginning to see dimly but suddenly he was blinded by a handful of dirt deliberately flung into his eyes by his antagonist in that moment of shock his grip on the revolver was broken in the next moment he felt a smashing darkness descend upon his brain and in the midst of the darkness even the darkness ceased  but the pocketminer fired again and again until the revolver was empty then he tossed it from him and breathing heavily sat down on the dead mans legs  the miner was sobbing and struggling for breath measly skunk he panted acampin on my trail an lettin me do the work an then shootin me in the back  he was half crying from anger and exhaustion he peered at the face of the dead man it was sprinkled with loose dirt and gravel and it was difficult to distinguish the features  never laid eyes on him before the miner concluded his scrutiny just a common an ordinary thief damn him an he shot me in the back he shot me in the back  he opened his shirt and felt himself front and back on his left side  went clean through and no harm done he cried jubilantly ill bet he aimed right all right but he drew the gun over when he pulled the triggerthe cuss but i fixed m oh i fixed m  his fingers were investigating the bullethole in his side and a shade of regret passed over his face its goin to be stiffern hell he said an its up to me to get mended an get out o here  he crawled out of the hole and went down the hill to his camp half an hour later he returned leading his packhorse his open shirt disclosed the rude bandages with which he had dressed his wound he was slow and awkward with his lefthand movements but that did not prevent his using the arm  the bight of the packrope under the dead mans shoulders enabled him to heave the body out of the hole then he set to work gathering up his gold he worked steadily for several hours pausing often to rest his stiffening shoulder and to exclaim  he shot me in the back the measly skunk he shot me in the back  when his treasure was quite cleaned up and wrapped securely into a number of blanketcovered parcels he made an estimate of its value  four hundred pounds or im a hottentot he concluded say two hundred in quartz an dirtthat leaves two hundred pounds of gold bill wake up two hundred pounds of gold forty thousand dollars an its yournall yourn  he scratched his head delightedly and his fingers blundered into an unfamiliar groove they quested along it for several inches it was a crease through his scalp where the second bullet had ploughed  he walked angrily over to the dead man  you would would you he bullied you would eh well i fixed you good an plenty an ill give you decent burial too thats moren youd have done for me  he dragged the body to the edge of the hole and toppled it in it struck the bottom with a dull crash on its side the face twisted up to the light the miner peered down at it  an you shot me in the back he said accusingly  with pick and shovel he filled the hole then he loaded the gold on his horse it was too great a load for the animal and when he had gained his camp he transferred part of it to his saddlehorse even so he was compelled to abandon a portion of his outfitpick and shovel and goldpan extra food and cooking utensils and divers odds and ends  the sun was at the zenith when the man forced the horses at the screen of vines and creepers to climb the huge boulders the animals were compelled to uprear and struggle blindly through the tangled mass of vegetation once the saddlehorse fell heavily and the man removed the pack to get the animal on its feet after it started on its way again the man thrust his head out from among the leaves and peered up at the hillside  the measly skunk he said and disappeared  there was a ripping and tearing of vines and boughs the trees surged back and forth marking the passage of the animals through the midst of them there was a clashing of steelshod hoofs on stone and now and again an oath or a sharp cry of command then the voice of the man was raised in song      tun around an tun yo face     untoe them sweet hills of grace       d powrs of sin yo am scornin     look about an look aroun     fling yo sinpack on d groun       yo will meet wid d lord in d mornin  the song grew faint and fainter and through the silence crept back the spirit of the place the stream once more drowsed and whispered the hum of the mountain bees rose sleepily down through the perfumeweighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods the butterflies drifted in and out among the trees and over all blazed the quiet sunshine only remained the hoofmarks in the meadow and the torn hillside to mark the boisterous trail of the life that had broken the peace of the place and passed on     planchette   it is my right to know the girl said  her voice was firmfibred with determination there was no hint of pleading in it yet it was the determination that is reached through a long period of pleading but in her case it had been pleading not of speech but of personality her lips had been ever mute but her face and eyes and the very attitude of her soul had been for a long time eloquent with questioning this the man had known but he had never answered and now she was demanding by the spoken word that he answer  it is my right the girl repeated  i know it he answered desperately and helplessly  she waited in the silence which followed her eyes fixed upon the light that filtered down through the lofty boughs and bathed the great redwood trunks in mellow warmth this light subdued and colored seemed almost a radiation from the trunks themselves so strongly did they saturate it with their hue the girl saw without seeing as she heard without hearing the deep gurgling of the stream far below on the canyon bottom  she looked down at the man well she asked with the firmness which feigns belief that obedience will be forthcoming  she was sitting upright her back against a fallen treetrunk while he lay near to her on his side an elbow on the ground and the hand supporting his head  dear dear lute he murmured  she shivered at the sound of his voicenot from repulsion but from struggle against the fascination of its caressing gentleness she had come to know well the lure of the manthe wealth of easement and rest that was promised by every caressing intonation of his voice by the mere touch of hand on hand or the faint impact of his breath on neck or cheek the man could not express himself by word nor look nor touch without weaving into the expression subtly and occultly the feeling as of a hand that passed and that in passing stroked softly and soothingly nor was this allpervading caress a something that cloyed with too great sweetness nor was it sickly sentimental nor was it maudlin with loves madness it was vigorous compelling masculine for that matter it was largely unconscious on the mans part he was only dimly aware of it it was a part of him the breath of his soul as it were involuntary and unpremeditated  but now resolved and desperate she steeled herself against him he tried to face her but her gray eyes looked out to him steadily from under cool level brows and he dropped his head upon her knee her hand strayed into his hair softly and her face melted into solicitude and tenderness but when he looked up again her gray eyes were steady her brows cool and level  what more can i tell you the man said he raised his head and met her gaze i cannot marry you i cannot marry any woman i love youyou know thatbetter than my own life i weigh you in the scales against all the dear things of living and you outweigh everything i would give everything to possess you yet i may not i cannot marry you i can never marry you  her lips were compressed with the effort of control his head was sinking back to her knee when she checked him  you are already married chris  no no he cried vehemently i have never been married i want to marry only you and i cannot  then  dont he interrupted dont ask me  it is my right to know she repeated  i know it he again interrupted but i cannot tell you  you have not considered me chris she went on gently  i know i know he broke in  you cannot have considered me you do not know what i have to bear from my people because of you  i did not think they felt so very unkindly toward me he said bitterly  it is true they can scarcely tolerate you they do not show it to you but they almost hate you it is i who have had to bear all this it was not always so though they liked you at first as as i liked you but that was four years ago the time passed bya year two years and then they began to turn against you they are not to be blamed you spoke no word they felt that you were destroying my life it is four years now and you have never once mentioned marriage to them what were they to think what they have thought that you were destroying my life  as she talked she continued to pass her fingers caressingly through his hair sorrowful for the pain that she was inflicting  they did like you at first who can help liking you you seem to draw affection from all living things as the trees draw the moisture from the ground it comes to you as it were your birthright aunt mildred and uncle robert thought there was nobody like you the sun rose and set in you they thought i was the luckiest girl alive to win the love of a man like you for it looks very much like it uncle robert used to say wagging his head wickedly at me of course they liked you aunt mildred used to sigh and look across teasingly at uncle and say when i think of chris it almost makes me wish i were younger myself and uncle would answer i dont blame you my dear not in the least and then the pair of them would beam upon me their congratulations that i had won the love of a man like you  and they knew i loved you as well how could i hide itthis great wonderful thing that had entered into my life and swallowed up all my days for four years chris i have lived only for you every moment was yours waking i loved you sleeping i dreamed of you every act i have performed was shaped by you by the thought of you even my thoughts were moulded by you by the invisible presence of you i had no end petty or great that you were not there for me  i had no idea of imposing such slavery he muttered  you imposed nothing you always let me have my own way it was you who were the obedient slave you did for me without offending me you forestalled my wishes without the semblance of forestalling them so natural and inevitable was everything you did for me i said without offending me you were no dancing puppet you made no fuss dont you see you did not seem to do things at all somehow they were always there just done as a matter of course  the slavery was loves slavery it was just my love for you that made you swallow up all my days you did not force yourself into my thoughts you crept in always and you were there alwayshow much you will never know  but as time went by aunt mildred and uncle grew to dislike you they grew afraid what was to become of me you were destroying my life my music you know how my dream of it has dimmed away that spring when i first met youi was twenty and i was about to start for germany i was going to study hard that was four years ago and i am still here in california  i had other lovers you drove them awayno no i dont mean that it was i that drove them away what did i care for lovers for anything when you were near but as i said aunt mildred and uncle grew afraid there has been talkfriends busybodies and all the rest the time went by you did not speak i could only wonder wonder i knew you loved me much was said against you by uncle at first and then by aunt mildred they were father and mother to me you know i could not defend you yet i was loyal to you i refused to discuss you i closed up there was halfestrangement in my homeuncle robert with a face like an undertaker and aunt mildreds heart breaking but what could i do chris what could i do  the man his head resting on her knee again groaned but made no other reply  aunt mildred was mother to me yet i went to her no more with my confidences my childhoods book was closed it was a sweet book chris the tears come into my eyes sometimes when i think of it but never mind that great happiness has been mine as well i am glad i can talk frankly of my love for you and the attaining of such frankness has been very sweet i do love you chris i love you i cannot tell you how you are everything to me and more besides you remember that christmas tree of the childrenwhen we played blindmans buff and you caught me by the arm so with such a clutching of fingers that i cried out with the hurt i never told you but the arm was badly bruised and such sweet i got of it you could never guess there black and blue was the imprint of your fingersyour fingers chris your fingers it was the touch of you made visible it was there a week and i kissed the marksoh so often i hated to see them go i wanted to rebruise the arm and make them linger i was jealous of the returning white that drove the bruise away somehowoh i cannot explain but i loved you so  in the silence that fell she continued her caressing of his hair while she idly watched a great gray squirrel boisterous and hilarious as it scampered back and forth in a distant vista of the redwoods a crimsoncrested woodpecker energetically drilling a fallen trunk caught and transferred her gaze the man did not lift his head rather he crushed his face closer against her knee while his heaving shoulders marked the hardness with which he breathed  you must tell me chris the girl said gently this mysteryit is killing me i must know why we cannot be married are we always to be this waymerely lovers meeting often it is true and yet with the long absences between the meetings is it all the world holds for you and me chris are we never to be more to each other oh it is good just to love i knowyou have made me madly happy but one does get so hungry at times for something more i want more and more of you chris i want all of you i want all our days to be together i want all the companionship the comradeship which cannot be ours now and which will be ours when we are married she caught her breath quickly but we are never to be married i forgot and you must tell me why  the man raised his head and looked her in the eyes it was a way he had with whomever he talked of looking them in the eyes  i have considered you lute he began doggedly i did consider you at the very first i should never have gone on with it i should have gone away i knew it and i considered you in the light of that knowledge and yet i did not go away my god what was i to do i loved you i could not go away i could not help it i stayed i resolved but i broke my resolves i was like a drunkard i was drunk of you i was weak i know i failed i could not go away i tried i went awayyou will remember though you did not know why you know now i went away but i could not remain away knowing that we could never marry i came back to you i am here now with you send me away lute i have not the strength to go myself  but why should you go away she asked besides i must know why before i can send you away  dont ask me  tell me she said her voice tenderly imperative  dont lute dont force me the man pleaded and there was appeal in his eyes and voice  but you must tell me she insisted it is justice you owe me  the man wavered if i do he began then he ended with determination i should never be able to forgive myself no i cannot tell you dont try to compel me lute you would be as sorry as i  if there is anything if there are obstacles if this mystery does really prevent she was speaking slowly with long pauses seeking the more delicate ways of speech for the framing of her thought chris i do love you i love you as deeply as it is possible for any woman to love i am sure if you were to say to me now come i would go with you i would follow wherever you led i would be your page as in the days of old when ladies went with their knights to far lands you are my knight chris and you can do no wrong your will is my wish i was once afraid of the censure of the world now that you have come into my life i am no longer afraid i would laugh at the world and its censure for your sakefor my sake too i would laugh for i should have you and you are more to me than the good will and approval of the world if you say come i will  dont dont he cried it is impossible marriage or not i cannot even say come i dare not ill show you ill tell you  he sat up beside her the action stamped with resolve he took her hand in his and held it closely his lips moved to the verge of speech the mystery trembled for utterance the air was palpitant with its presence as if it were an irrevocable decree the girl steeled herself to hear but the man paused gazing straight out before him she felt his hand relax in hers and she pressed it sympathetically encouragingly but she felt the rigidity going out of his tensed body and she knew that spirit and flesh were relaxing together his resolution was ebbing he would not speakshe knew it and she knew likewise with the sureness of faith that it was because he could not  she gazed despairingly before her a numb feeling at her heart as though hope and happiness had died she watched the sun flickering down through the warmtrunked redwoods but she watched in a mechanical absent way she looked at the scene as from a long way off without interest herself an alien no longer an intimate part of the earth and trees and flowers she loved so well  so far removed did she seem that she was aware of a curiosity strangely impersonal in what lay around her through a near vista she looked at a buckeye tree in full blossom as though her eyes encountered it for the first time her eyes paused and dwelt upon a yellow cluster of diogenes lanterns that grew on the edge of an open space it was the way of flowers always to give her quick pleasurethrills but no thrill was hers now she pondered the flower slowly and thoughtfully as a hasheesheater heavy with the drug might ponder some whimflower that obtruded on his vision in her ears was the voice of the streama hoarsethroated sleepy old giant muttering and mumbling his somnolent fancies but her fancy was not in turn aroused as was its wont she knew the sound merely for water rushing over the rocks of the deep canyonbottom that and nothing more  her gaze wandered on beyond the diogenes lanterns into the open space kneedeep in the wild oats of the hillside grazed two horses chestnutsorrels the pair of them perfectly matched warm and golden in the sunshine their springcoats a sheen of highlights shot through with colorflashes that glowed like fiery jewels she recognized almost with a shock that one of them was hers dolly the companion of her girlhood and womanhood on whose neck she had sobbed her sorrows and sung her joys a moistness welled into her eyes at the sight and she came back from the remoteness of her mood quick with passion and sorrow to be part of the world again  the man sank forward from the hips relaxing entirely and with a groan dropped his head on her knee she leaned over him and pressed her lips softly and lingeringly to his hair  come let us go she said almost in a whisper  she caught her breath in a halfsob then tightened her lips as she rose his face was white to ghastliness so shaken was he by the struggle through which he had passed they did not look at each other but walked directly to the horses she leaned against dollys neck while he tightened the girths then she gathered the reins in her hand and waited he looked at her as he bent down an appeal for forgiveness in his eyes and in that moment her own eyes answered her foot rested in his hands and from there she vaulted into the saddle without speaking without further looking at each other they turned the horses heads and took the narrow trail that wound down through the sombre redwood aisles and across the open glades to the pasturelands below the trail became a cowpath the cowpath became a woodroad which later joined with a hayroad and they rode down through the lowrolling tawny california hills to where a set of bars let out on the county road which ran along the bottom of the valley the girl sat her horse while the man dismounted and began taking down the bars  nowait she cried before he had touched the two lower bars  she urged the mare forward a couple of strides and then the animal lifted over the bars in a clean little jump the mans eyes sparkled and he clapped his hands  you beauty you beauty the girl cried leaning forward impulsively in the saddle and pressing her cheek to the mares neck where it burned flamecolor in the sun  lets trade horses for the ride in she suggested when he had led his horse through and finished putting up the bars youve never sufficiently appreciated dolly  no no he protested  you think she is too old too sedate lute insisted shes only sixteen and she can outrun nine colts out of ten only she never cuts up shes too steady and you dont approve of herno dont deny it sir i know and i know also that she can outrun your vaunted washoe ban there i challenge you and furthermore you may ride her yourself you know what ban can do so you must ride dolly and see for yourself what she can do  they proceeded to exchange the saddles on the horses glad of the diversion and making the most of it  im glad i was born in california lute remarked as she swung astride of ban its an outrage both to horse and woman to ride in a sidesaddle  you look like a young amazon the man said approvingly his eyes passing tenderly over the girl as she swung the horse around  are you ready she asked  all ready  to the old mill she called as the horses sprang forward thats less than a mile  to a finish he demanded  she nodded and the horses feeling the urge of the reins caught the spirit of the race the dust rose in clouds behind as they tore along the level road they swung around the bend horses and riders tilted at sharp angles to the ground and more than once the riders ducked low to escape the branches of outreaching and overhanging trees they clattered over the small plank bridges and thundered over the larger iron ones to an ominous clanking of loose rods  they rode side by side saving the animals for the rush at the finish yet putting them at a pace that drew upon vitality and staying power curving around a clump of white oaks the road straightened out before them for several hundred yards at the end of which they could see the ruined mill  now for it the girl cried  she urged the horse by suddenly leaning forward with her body at the same time for an instant letting the rein slack and touching the neck with her bridle hand she began to draw away from the man  touch her on the neck she cried to him  with this the mare pulled alongside and began gradually to pass the girl chris and lute looked at each other for a moment the mare still drawing ahead so that chris was compelled slowly to turn his head the mill was a hundred yards away  shall i give him the spurs lute shouted  the man nodded and the girl drove the spurs in sharply and quickly calling upon the horse for its utmost but watched her own horse forge slowly ahead of her  beaten by three lengths lute beamed triumphantly as they pulled into a walk confess sir confess you didnt think the old mare had it in her  lute leaned to the side and rested her hand for a moment on dollys wet neck  bans a sluggard alongside of her chris affirmed dollys all right if she is in her indian summer  lute nodded approval thats a sweet way of putting itindian summer it just describes her but shes not lazy she has all the fire and none of the folly she is very wise what of her years  that accounts for it chris demurred her folly passed with her youth manys the lively time shes given you  no lute answered i never knew her really to cut up i think the only trouble she ever gave me was when i was training her to open gates she was afraid when they swung back upon herthe animals fear of the trap perhaps but she bravely got over it and she never was vicious she never bolted nor bucked nor cut up in all her lifenever not once  the horses went on at a walk still breathing heavily from their run the road wound along the bottom of the valley now and again crossing the stream from either side rose the drowsy purr of mowingmachines punctuated by occasional sharp cries of the men who were gathering the haycrop on the western side of the valley the hills rose green and dark but the eastern side was already burned brown and tan by the sun  there is summer here is spring lute said oh beautiful sonoma valley  her eyes were glistening and her face was radiant with love of the land her gaze wandered on across orchard patches and sweeping vineyard stretches seeking out the purple which seemed to hang like a dim smoke in the wrinkles of the hills and in the more distant canyon gorges far up among the more rugged crests where the steep slopes were covered with manzanita she caught a glimpse of a clear space where the wild grass had not yet lost its green  have you ever heard of the secret pasture she asked her eyes still fixed on the remote green  a snort of fear brought her eyes back to the man beside her dolly upreared with distended nostrils and wild eyes was pawing the air madly with her fore legs chris threw himself forward against her neck to keep her from falling backward and at the same time touched her with the spurs to compel her to drop her fore feet to the ground in order to obey the goahead impulse of the spurs  why dolly this is most remarkable lute began reprovingly  but to her surprise the mare threw her head down arched her back as she went up in the air and returning struck the ground stifflegged and bunched  a genuine buck chris called out and the next moment the mare was rising under him in a second buck  lute looked on astounded at the unprecedented conduct of her mare and admiring her lovers horsemanship he was quite cool and was himself evidently enjoying the performance again and again half a dozen times dolly arched herself into the air and struck stiffly bunched then she threw her head straight up and rose on her hind legs pivoting about and striking with her fore feet lute whirled into safety the horse she was riding and as she did so caught a glimpse of dollys eyes with the look in them of blind brute madness bulging until it seemed they must burst from her head the faint pink in the white of the eyes was gone replaced by a white that was like dull marble and that yet flashed as from some inner fire  a faint cry of fear suppressed in the instant of utterance slipped past lutes lips one hind leg of the mare seemed to collapse and for a moment the whole quivering body upreared and perpendicular swayed back and forth and there was uncertainty as to whether it would fall forward or backward the man halfslipping sidewise from the saddle so as to fall clear if the mare toppled backward threw his weight to the front and alongside her neck this overcame the dangerous teetering balance and the mare struck the ground on her feet again  but there was no letup dolly straightened out so that the line of the face was almost a continuation of the line of the stretched neck this position enabled her to master the bit which she did by bolting straight ahead down the road  for the first time lute became really frightened she spurred washoe ban in pursuit but he could not hold his own with the mad mare and dropped gradually behind lute saw dolly check and rear in the air again and caught up just as the mare made a second bolt as dolly dashed around a bend she stopped suddenly stifflegged lute saw her lover torn out of the saddle his thighgrip broken by the sudden jerk though he had lost his seat he had not been thrown and as the mare dashed on lute saw him clinging to the side of the horse a hand in the mane and a leg across the saddle with a quick cavort he regained his seat and proceeded to fight with the mare for control  but dolly swerved from the road and dashed down a grassy slope yellowed with innumerable mariposa lilies an ancient fence at the bottom was no obstacle she burst through as though it were filmy spiderweb and disappeared in the underbrush lute followed unhesitatingly putting ban through the gap in the fence and plunging on into the thicket she lay along his neck closely to escape the ripping and tearing of the trees and vines she felt the horse drop down through leafy branches and into the cool gravel of a streams bottom from ahead came a splashing of water and she caught a glimpse of dolly dashing up the small bank and into a clump of scruboaks against the trunks of which she was trying to scrape off her rider  lute almost caught up amongst the trees but was hopelessly outdistanced on the fallow field adjoining across which the mare tore with a fine disregard for heavy ground and gopherholes when she turned at a sharp angle into the thicketland beyond lute took the long diagonal skirted the ticket and reined in ban at the other side she had arrived first from within the thicket she could hear a tremendous crashing of brush and branches then the mare burst through and into the open falling to her knees exhausted on the soft earth she arose and staggered forward then came limply to a halt she was in lathersweat of fear and stood trembling pitiably  chris was still on her back his shirt was in ribbons the backs of his hands were bruised and lacerated while his face was streaming blood from a gash near the temple lute had controlled herself well but now she was aware of a quick nausea and a trembling of weakness  chris she said so softly that it was almost a whisper then she sighed thank god  oh im all right he cried to her putting into his voice all the heartiness he could command which was not much for he had himself been under no mean nervous strain  he showed the reaction he was undergoing when he swung down out of the saddle he began with a brave muscular display as he lifted his leg over but ended on his feet leaning against the limp dolly for support lute flashed out of her saddle and her arms were about him in an embrace of thankfulness  i know where there is a spring she said a moment later  they left the horses standing untethered and she led her lover into the cool recesses of the thicket to where crystal water bubbled from out the base of the mountain  what was that you said about dollys never cutting up he asked when the blood had been stanched and his nerves and pulsebeats were normal again  i am stunned lute answered i cannot understand it she never did anything like it in all her life and all animals like you soits not because of that why she is a childs horse i was only a little girl when i first rode her and to this day  well this day she was everything but a childs horse chris broke in she was a devil she tried to scrape me off against the trees and to batter my brains out against the limbs she tried all the lowest and narrowest places she could find you should have seen her squeeze through and did you see those bucks  lute nodded  regular buckingbronco proposition  but what should she know about bucking lute demanded she was never known to bucknever  he shrugged his shoulders some forgotten instinct perhaps longlapsed and come to life again  the girl rose to her feet determinedly im going to find out she said  they went back to the horses where they subjected dolly to a rigid examination that disclosed nothing hoofs legs bit mouth bodyeverything was as it should be the saddle and saddlecloth were innocent of bur or sticker the back was smooth and unbroken they searched for sign of snakebite and sting of fly or insect but found nothing  whatever it was it was subjective that much is certain chris said  obsession lute suggested  they laughed together at the idea for both were twentiethcentury products healthyminded and normal with souls that delighted in the butterflychase of ideals but that halted before the brink where superstition begins  an evil spirit chris laughed but what evil have i done that i should be so punished  you think too much of yourself sir she rejoined it is more likely some evil i dont know what that dolly has done you were a mere accident i might have been on her back at the time or aunt mildred or anybody  as she talked she took hold of the stirrupstrap and started to shorten it  what are you doing chris demanded  im going to ride dolly in  no youre not he announced it would be bad discipline after what has happened i am simply compelled to ride her in myself  but it was a very weak and very sick mare he rode stumbling and halting afflicted with nervous jerks and recurring muscular spasmsthe aftermath of the tremendous orgasm through which she had passed  i feel like a book of verse and a hammock after all that has happened lute said as they rode into camp  it was a summer camp of citytired people pitched in a grove of towering redwoods through whose lofty boughs the sunshine trickled down broken and subdued to soft light and cool shadow apart from the main camp were the kitchen and the servants tents and midway between was the great dining hall walled by the living redwood columns where fresh whispers of air were always to be found and where no canopy was needed to keep the sun away  poor dolly she is really sick lute said that evening when they had returned from a last look at the mare but you werent hurt chris and thats enough for one small woman to be thankful for i thought i knew but i really did not know till today how much you meant to me i could hear only the plunging and struggle in the thicket i could not see you nor know how it went with you  my thoughts were of you chris answered and felt the responsive pressure of the hand that rested on his arm  she turned her face up to his and met his lips  good night she said  dear lute dear lute he caressed her with his voice as she moved away among the shadows                      whos going for the mail called a womans voice through the trees  lute closed the book from which they had been reading and sighed  we werent going to ride today she said  let me go chris proposed you stay here ill be down and back in no time  she shook her head  whos going for the mail the voice insisted  wheres martin lute called lifting her voice in answer  i dont know came the voice i think robert took him along somewherehorsebuying or fishing or i dont know what theres really nobody left but chris and you besides it will give you an appetite for dinner youve been lounging in the hammock all day and uncle robert must have his newspaper  all right aunty were starting lute called back getting out of the hammock  a few minutes later in ridingclothes they were saddling the horses they rode out on to the county road where blazed the afternoon sun and turned toward glen ellen the little town slept in the sun and the somnolent storekeeper and postmaster scarcely kept his eyes open long enough to make up the packet of letters and newspapers  an hour later lute and chris turned aside from the road and dipped along a cowpath down the high bank to water the horses before going into camp  dolly looks as though shed forgotten all about yesterday chris said as they sat their horses kneedeep in the rushing water look at her  the mare had raised her head and cocked her ears at the rustling of a quail in the thicket chris leaned over and rubbed around her ears dollys enjoyment was evident and she drooped her head over against the shoulder of his own horse  like a kitten was lutes comment  yet i shall never be able wholly to trust her again chris said not after yesterdays mad freak  i have a feeling myself that you are safer on ban lute laughed it is strange my trust in dolly is as implicit as ever i feel confident so far as i am concerned but i should never care to see you on her back again now with ban my faith is still unshaken look at that neck isnt he handsome hell be as wise as dolly when he is as old as she  i feel the same way chris laughed back ban could never possibly betray me  they turned their horses out of the stream dolly stopped to brush a fly from her knee with her nose and ban urged past into the narrow way of the path the space was too restricted to make him return save with much trouble and chris allowed him to go on lute riding behind dwelt with her eyes upon her lovers back pleasuring in the lines of the bare neck and the sweep out to the muscular shoulders  suddenly she reined in her horse she could do nothing but look so brief was the duration of the happening beneath and above was the almost perpendicular bank the path itself was barely wide enough for footing yet washoe ban whirling and rearing at the same time toppled for a moment in the air and fell backward off the path  so unexpected and so quick was it that the man was involved in the fall there had been no time for him to throw himself to the path he was falling ere he knew it and he did the only thing possibleslipped the stirrups and threw his body into the air to the side and at the same time down it was twelve feet to the rocks below he maintained an upright position his head up and his eyes fixed on the horse above him and falling upon him  chris struck like a cat on his feet on the instant making a leap to the side the next instant ban crashed down beside him the animal struggled little but sounded the terrible cry that horses sometimes sound when they have received mortal hurt he had struck almost squarely on his back and in that position he remained his head twisted partly under his hind legs relaxed and motionless his fore legs futilely striking the air  chris looked up reassuringly  i am getting used to it lute smiled down to him of course i need not ask if you are hurt can i do anything  he smiled back and went over to the fallen beast letting go the girths of the saddle and getting the head straightened out  i thought so he said after a cursory examination i thought so at the time did you hear that sort of crunching snap  she shuddered  well that was the punctuation of life the final period dropped at the end of bans usefulness he started around to come up by the path ive been astride of ban for the last time let us go home  at the top of the bank chris turned and looked down  goodby washoe ban he called out goodby old fellow  the animal was struggling to lift its head there were tears in chriss eyes as he turned abruptly away and tears in lutes eyes as they met his she was silent in her sympathy though the pressure of her hand was firm in his as he walked beside her horse down the dusty road  it was done deliberately chris burst forth suddenly there was no warning he deliberately flung himself over backward  there was no warning lute concurred i was looking i saw him he whirled and threw himself at the same time just as if you had done it yourself with a tremendous jerk and backward pull on the bit  it was not my hand i swear it i was not even thinking of him he was going up with a fairly loose rein as a matter of course  i should have seen it had you done it lute said but it was all done before you had a chance to do anything it was not your hand not even your unconscious hand  then it was some invisible hand reaching out from i dont know where  he looked up whimsically at the sky and smiled at the conceit  martin stepped forward to receive dolly when they came into the stable end of the grove but his face expressed no surprise at sight of chris coming in on foot chris lingered behind lute for moment  can you shoot a horse he asked  the groom nodded then added yes sir with a second and deeper nod  how do you do it  draw a line from the eyes to the earsi mean the opposite ears sir and where the lines cross  that will do chris interrupted you know the watering place at the second bend youll find ban there with a broken back                      oh here you are sir i have been looking for you everywhere since dinner you are wanted immediately  chris tossed his cigar away then went over and pressed his foot on its glowing fire  you havent told anybody about itban he queried  lute shook her head theyll learn soon enough martin will mention it to uncle robert tomorrow  but dont feel too bad about it she said after a moments pause slipping her hand into his  he was my colt he said nobody has ridden him but you i broke him myself i knew him from the time he was born i knew every bit of him every trick every caper and i would have staked my life that it was impossible for him to do a thing like this there was no warning no fighting for the bit no previous unruliness i have been thinking it over he didnt fight for the bit for that matter he wasnt unruly nor disobedient there wasnt time it was an impulse and he acted upon it like lightning i am astounded now at the swiftness with which it took place inside the first second we were over the edge and falling  it was deliberatedeliberate suicide and attempted murder it was a trap i was the victim he had me and he threw himself over with me yet he did not hate me he loved me as much as it is possible for a horse to love i am confounded i cannot understand it any more than you can understand dollys behavior yesterday  but horses go insane chris lute said you know that its merely coincidence that two horses in two days should have spells under you  thats the only explanation he answered starting off with her but why am i wanted urgently  planchette  oh i remember it will be a new experience to me somehow i missed it when it was all the rage long ago  so did all of us lute replied except mrs grantly it is her favorite phantom it seems  a weird little thing he remarked bundle of nerves and black eyes ill wager she doesnt weigh ninety pounds and most of thats magnetism  positively uncanny at times lute shivered involuntarily she gives me the creeps  contact of the healthy with the morbid he explained dryly you will notice it is the healthy that always has the creeps the morbid never has the creeps it gives the creeps thats its function where did you people pick her up anyway  i dont knowyes i do too aunt mildred met her in boston i thinkoh i dont know at any rate mrs grantly came to california and of course had to visit aunt mildred you know the open house we keep  they halted where a passageway between two great redwood trunks gave entrance to the dining room above through lacing boughs could be seen the stars candles lighted the treecolumned space about the table examining the planchette contrivance were four persons chriss gaze roved over them and he was aware of a guilty sorrowpang as he paused for a moment on lutes aunt mildred and uncle robert mellow with ripe middle age and genial with the gentle buffets life had dealt them he passed amusedly over the blackeyed frailbodied mrs grantly and halted on the fourth person a portly massiveheaded man whose gray temples belied the youthful solidity of his face  whos that chris whispered  a mr barton the train was late thats why you didnt see him at dinner hes only a capitalistwaterpowerlongdistanceelectricity transmitter or something like that  doesnt look as though he could give an ox points on imagination  he cant he inherited his money but he knows enough to hold on to it and hire other mens brains he is very conservative  that is to be expected was chriss comment his gaze went back to the man and woman who had been father and mother to the girl beside him do you know he said it came to me with a shock yesterday when you told me that they had turned against me and that i was scarcely tolerated i met them afterwards last evening guiltily in fear and tremblingand today too and yet i could see no difference from of old  dear man lute sighed hospitality is as natural to them as the act of breathing but it isnt that after all it is all genuine in their dear hearts no matter how severe the censure they put upon you when you are absent the moment they are with you they soften and are all kindness and warmth as soon as their eyes rest on you affection and love come bubbling up you are so made every animal likes you all people like you they cant help it you cant help it you are universally lovable and the best of it is that you dont know it you dont know it now even as i tell it to you you dont realize it you wont realize itand that very incapacity to realize it is one of the reasons why you are so loved you are incredulous now and you shake your head but i know who am your slave as all people know for they likewise are your slaves  why in a minute we shall go in and join them mark the affection almost maternal that will well up in aunt mildreds eyes listen to the tones of uncle roberts voice when he says well chris my boy watch mrs grantly melt literally melt like a dewdrop in the sun  take mr barton there you have never seen him before why you will invite him out to smoke a cigar with you when the rest of us have gone to bedyou a mere nobody and he a man of many millions a man of power a man obtuse and stupid like the ox and he will follow you about smoking the cigar like a little dog your little dog trotting at your back he will not know he is doing it but he will be doing it just the same dont i know chris oh i have watched you watched you so often and loved you for it and loved you again for it because you were so delightfully and blindly unaware of what you were doing  im almost bursting with vanity from listening to you he laughed passing his arm around her and drawing her against him  yes she whispered and in this very moment when you are laughing at all that i have said you the feel of you your soulcall it what you will it is youis calling for all the love that is in me  she leaned more closely against him and sighed as with fatigue he breathed a kiss into her hair and held her with firm tenderness  aunt mildred stirred briskly and looked up from the planchette board  come let us begin she said it will soon grow chilly robert where are those children  here we are lute called out disengaging herself  now for a bundle of creeps chris whispered as they started in  lutes prophecy of the manner in which her lover would be received was realized mrs grantly unreal unhealthy scintillant with frigid magnetism warmed and melted as though of truth she were dew and he sun mr barton beamed broadly upon him and was colossally gracious aunt mildred greeted him with a glow of fondness and motherly kindness while uncle robert genially and heartily demanded well chris my boy and what of the riding  but aunt mildred drew her shawl more closely around her and hastened them to the business in hand on the table was a sheet of paper on the paper rifling on three supports was a small triangular board two of the supports were easily moving casters the third support placed at the apex of the triangle was a lead pencil  whos first uncle robert demanded  there was a moments hesitancy then aunt mildred placed her hand on the board and said some one has always to be the fool for the delectation of the rest  brave woman applauded her husband now mrs grantly do your worst  i that lady queried i do nothing the power or whatever you care to think it is outside of me as it is outside of all of you as to what that power is i will not dare to say there is such a power i have had evidences of it and you will undoubtedly have evidences of it now please be quiet everybody touch the board very lightly but firmly mrs story but do nothing of your own volition  aunt mildred nodded and stood with her hand on planchette while the rest formed about her in a silent and expectant circle but nothing happened the minutes ticked away and planchette remained motionless  be patient mrs grantly counselled do not struggle against any influences you may feel working on you but do not do anything yourself the influence will take care of that you will feel impelled to do things and such impulses will be practically irresistible  i wish the influence would hurry up aunt mildred protested at the end of five motionless minutes  just a little longer mrs story just a little longer mrs grantly said soothingly  suddenly aunt mildreds hand began to twitch into movement a mild concern showed in her face as she observed the movement of her hand and heard the scratching of the pencilpoint at the apex of planchette  for another five minutes this continued when aunt mildred withdrew her hand with an effort and said with a nervous laugh  i dont know whether i did it myself or not i do know that i was growing nervous standing there like a psychic fool with all your solemn faces turned upon me  henscratches was uncle roberts judgement when he looked over the paper upon which she had scrawled  quite illegible was mrs grantlys dictum it does not resemble writing at all the influences have not got to working yet do you try it mr barton  that gentleman stepped forward ponderously willing to please and placed his hand on the board and for ten solid stolid minutes he stood there motionless like a statue the frozen personification of the commercial age uncle roberts face began to work he blinked stiffened his mouth uttered suppressed throaty sounds deep down finally he snorted lost his selfcontrol and broke out in a roar of laughter all joined in this merriment including mrs grantly mr barton laughed with them but he was vaguely nettled  you try it story he said  uncle robert still laughing and urged on by lute and his wife took the board suddenly his face sobered his hand had begun to move and the pencil could be heard scratching across the paper  by george he muttered thats curious look at it im not doing it i know im not doing it look at that hand go just look at it  now robert none of your ridiculousness his wife warned him  i tell you im not doing it he replied indignantly the force has got hold of me ask mrs grantly tell her to make it stop if you want it to stop i cant stop it by george look at that flourish i didnt do that i never wrote a flourish in my life  do try to be serious mrs grantly warned them an atmosphere of levity does not conduce to the best operation of planchette  there that will do i guess uncle robert said as he took his hand away now lets see  he bent over and adjusted his glasses its handwriting at any rate and thats better than the rest of you did here lute your eyes are young  oh what flourishes lute exclaimed as she looked at the paper and look there there are two different handwritings  she began to read this is the first lecture concentrate on this sentence i am a positive spirit and not negative to any condition then follow with concentration on positive love after that peace and harmony will vibrate through and around your body your soulthe other writing breaks right in this is the way it goes bullfrog 95 dixie 16 golden anchor 65 gold mountain 13 jim butler 70 jumbo 75 north star 42 rescue 7 black butte 75 brown hope 16 iron top 3  iron tops pretty low mr barton murmured  robert youve been dabbling again aunt mildred cried accusingly  no ive not he denied i only read the quotations but how the devili beg your pardonthey got there on that piece of paper id like to know  your subconscious mind chris suggested you read the quotations in todays paper  no i didnt but last week i glanced over the column  a day or a year is all the same in the subconscious mind said mrs grantly the subconscious mind never forgets but i am not saying that this is due to the subconscious mind i refuse to state to what i think it is due  but how about that other stuff uncle robert demanded sounds like what id think christian science ought to sound like  or theosophy aunt mildred volunteered some message to a neophyte  go on read the rest her husband commanded  this puts you in touch with the mightier spirits lute read you shall become one with us and your name shall be arya and you shallconqueror 20 empire 12 columbia mountain 18 midway 140and and that is all oh no heres a last flourish arya from kandorthat must surely be the mahatma  id like to have you explain that theosophy stuff on the basis of the subconscious mind chris uncle robert challenged  chris shrugged his shoulders no explanation you must have got a message intended for some one else  lines were crossed eh uncle robert chuckled multiplex spiritual wireless telegraphy id call it  it is nonsense mrs grantly said i never knew planchette to behave so outrageously there are disturbing influences at work i felt them from the first perhaps it is because you are all making too much fun of it you are too hilarious  a certain befitting gravity should grace the occasion chris agreed placing his hand on planchette let me try and not one of you must laugh or giggle or even think laugh or giggle and if you dare to snort even once uncle robert there is no telling what occult vengeance may be wreaked upon you  ill be good uncle robert rejoined but if i really must snort may i silently slip away  chris nodded his hand had already begun to work there had been no preliminary twitchings nor tentative essays at writing at once his hand had started off and planchette was moving swiftly and smoothly across the paper  look at him lute whispered to her aunt see how white he is  chris betrayed disturbance at the sound of her voice and thereafter silence was maintained only could be heard the steady scratching of the pencil suddenly as though it had been stung he jerked his hand away with a sigh and a yawn he stepped back from the table then glanced with the curiosity of a newly awakened man at their faces  i think i wrote something he said  i should say you did mrs grantly remarked with satisfaction holding up the sheet of paper and glancing at it  read it aloud uncle robert said  here it is then it begins with beware written three times and in much larger characters than the rest of the writing beware beware beware chris dunbar i intend to destroy you i have already made two attempts upon your life and failed i shall yet succeed so sure am i that i shall succeed that i dare to tell you i do not need to tell you why in your own heart you know the wrong you are doingand here it abruptly ends  mrs grantly laid the paper down on the table and looked at chris who had already become the centre of all eyes and who was yawning as from an overpowering drowsiness  quite a sanguinary turn i should say uncle robert remarked  i have already made two attempts upon your life mrs grantly read from the paper which she was going over a second time  on my life chris demanded between yawns why my life hasnt been attempted even once my i am sleepy  ah my boy you are thinking of fleshandblood men uncle robert laughed but this is a spirit your life has been attempted by unseen things most likely ghostly hands have tried to throttle you in your sleep  oh chris lute cried impulsively this afternoon the hand you said must have seized your rein  but i was joking he objected  nevertheless lute left her thought unspoken  mrs grantly had become keen on the scent what was that about this afternoon was your life in danger  chriss drowsiness had disappeared im becoming interested myself he acknowledged we havent said anything about it ban broke his back this afternoon he threw himself off the bank and i ran the risk of being caught underneath  i wonder i wonder mrs grantly communed aloud there is something in this it is a warning ah you were hurt yesterday riding miss storys horse that makes the two attempts  she looked triumphantly at them planchette had been vindicated  nonsense laughed uncle robert but with a slight hint of irritation in his manner such things do not happen these days this is the twentieth century my dear madam the thing at the very latest smacks of mediaevalism  i have had such wonderful tests with planchette mrs grantly began then broke off suddenly to go to the table and place her hand on the board  who are you she asked what is your name  the board immediately began to write by this time all heads with the exception of mr bartons were bent over the table and following the pencil  its dick aunt mildred cried a note of the mildly hysterical in her voice  her husband straightened up his face for the first time grave  its dicks signature he said id know his fist in a thousand  dick curtis mrs grantly read aloud who is dick curtis  by jove thats remarkable mr barton broke in the handwriting in both instances is the same clever i should say really clever he added admiringly  let me see uncle robert demanded taking the paper and examining it yes it is dicks handwriting  but who is dick mrs grantly insisted who is this dick curtis  dick curtis why he was captain richard curtis uncle robert answered  he was lutes father aunt mildred supplemented lute took our name she never saw him he died when she was a few weeks old he was my brother  remarkable most remarkable mrs grantly was revolving the message in her mind there were two attempts on mr dunbars life the subconscious mind cannot explain that for none of us knew of the accident today  i knew chris answered and it was i that operated planchette the explanation is simple  but the handwriting interposed mr barton what you wrote and what mrs grantly wrote are identical  chris bent over and compared the handwriting  besides mrs grantly cried mr story recognizes the handwriting  she looked at him for verification  he nodded his head yes it is dicks fist ill swear to that  but to lute had come a visioning while the rest argued pro and con and the air was filled with phrasespsychic phenomena selfhypnotism residuum of unexplained truth and spiritismshe was reviving mentally the girlhood pictures she had conjured of this soldierfather she had never seen she possessed his sword there were several oldfashioned daguerreotypes there was much that had been said of him stories told of himand all this had constituted the material out of which she had builded him in her childhood fancy  there is the possibility of one mind unconsciously suggesting to another mind mrs grantly was saying but through lutes mind was trooping her father on his great roan warhorse now he was leading his men she saw him on lonely scouts or in the midst of the yelling indians at salt meadows when of his command he returned with one man in ten and in the picture she had of him in the physical semblance she had made of him was reflected his spiritual nature reflected by her worshipful artistry in form and feature and expressionhis bravery his quick temper his impulsive championship his madness of wrath in a righteous cause his warm generosity and swift forgiveness and his chivalry that epitomized codes and ideals primitive as the days of knighthood and first last and always dominating all she saw in the face of him the hot passion and quickness of deed that had earned for him the name fighting dick curtis  let me put it to the test she heard mrs grantly saying let miss story try planchette there may be a further message  no no i beg of you aunt mildred interposed it is too uncanny it surely is wrong to tamper with the dead besides i am nervous or better let me go to bed leaving you to go on with your experiments that will be the best way and you can tell me in the morning mingled with the goodnights were halfhearted protests from mrs grantly as aunt mildred withdrew  robert can return she called back as soon as he has seen me to my tent  it would be a shame to give it up now mrs grantly said there is no telling what we are on the verge of wont you try it miss story  lute obeyed but when she placed her hand on the board she was conscious of a vague and nameless fear at this toying with the supernatural she was twentiethcentury and the thing in essence as her uncle had said was mediaeval yet she could not shake off the instinctive fear that arose in hermans inheritance from the wild and howling ages when his hairy apelike prototype was afraid of the dark and personified the elements into things of fear  but as the mysterious influence seized her hand and sent it meriting across the paper all the unusual passed out of the situation and she was unaware of more than a feeble curiosity for she was intent on another visioningthis time of her mother who was also unremembered in the flesh not sharp and vivid like that of her father but dim and nebulous was the picture she shaped of her mothera saints head in an aureole of sweetness and goodness and meekness and withal shot through with a hint of reposeful determination of will stubborn and unobtrusive that in life had expressed itself mainly in resignation  lutes hand had ceased moving and mrs grantly was already reading the message that had been written  it is a different handwriting she said a womans hand martha it is signed who is martha  lute was not surprised it is my mother she said simply what does she say  she had not been made sleepy as chris had but the keen edge of her vitality had been blunted and she was experiencing a sweet and pleasing lassitude and while the message was being read in her eyes persisted the vision of her mother  dear child mrs grantly read do not mind him he was ever quick of speech and rash be no niggard with your love love cannot hurt you to deny love is to sin obey your heart and you can do no wrong obey worldly considerations obey pride obey those that prompt you against your hearts prompting and you do sin do not mind your father he is angry now as was his way in the earthlife but he will come to see the wisdom of my counsel for this too was his way in the earthlife love my child and love wellmartha  let me see it lute cried seizing the paper and devouring the handwriting with her eyes she was thrilling with unexpressed love for the mother she had never seen and this written speech from the grave seemed to give more tangibility to her having ever existed than did the vision of her  this is remarkable mrs grantly was reiterating there was never anything like it think of it my dear both your father and mother here with us tonight  lute shivered the lassitude was gone and she was her natural self again vibrant with the instinctive fear of things unseen and it was offensive to her mind that real or illusion the presence or the memorized existences of her father and mother should be touched by these two persons who were practically strangersmrs grantly unhealthy and morbid and mr barton stolid and stupid with a grossness both of the flesh and the spirit and it further seemed a trespass that these strangers should thus enter into the intimacy between her and chris  she could hear the steps of her uncle approaching and the situation flashed upon her luminous and clear she hurriedly folded the sheet of paper and thrust it into her bosom  dont say anything to him about this second message mrs grantly please and mr barton nor to aunt mildred it would only cause them irritation and needless anxiety  in her mind there was also the desire to protect her lover for she knew that the strain of his present standing with her aunt and uncle would be added to unconsciously in their minds by the weird message of planchette  and please dont let us have any more planchette lute continued hastily let us forget all the nonsense that has occurred  nonsense my dear child mrs grantly was indignantly protesting when uncle robert strode into the circle  hello he demanded whats being done  too late lute answered lightly no more stock quotations for you planchette is adjourned and were just winding up the discussion of the theory of it do you know how late it is                      well what did you do last night after we left  oh took a stroll chris answered  lutes eyes were quizzical as she asked with a tentativeness that was palpably assumed withawith mr barton  why yes  and a smoke  yes and now whats it all about  lute broke into merry laughter just as i told you that you would do am i not a prophet but i knew before i saw you that my forecast had come true i have just left mr barton and i knew he had walked with you last night for he is vowing by all his fetishes and idols that you are a perfectly splendid young man i could see it with my eyes shut the chris dunbar glamour has fallen upon him but i have not finished the catechism by any means where have you been all morning  where i am going to take you this afternoon  you plan well without knowing my wishes  i knew well what your wishes are it is to see a horse i have found  her voice betrayed her delight as she cried oh good  he is a beauty chris said  but her face had suddenly gone grave and apprehension brooded in her eyes  hes called comanche chris went on a beauty a regular beauty the perfect type of the californian cowpony and his lineswhy whats the matter  dont let us ride any more lute said at least for a while really i think i am a tiny bit tired of it too  he was looking at her in astonishment and she was bravely meeting his eyes  i see hearses and flowers for you he began and a funeral oration i see the end of the world and the stars falling out of the sky and the heavens rolling up as a scroll i see the living and the dead gathered together for the final judgement the sheep and the goats the lambs and the rams and all the rest of it the whiterobed saints the sound of golden harps and the lost souls howling as they fall into the pitall this i see on the day that you lute story no longer care to ride a horse a horse lute a horse  for a while at least she pleaded  ridiculous he cried whats the matter arent you wellyou who are always so abominably and adorably well  no its not that she answered i know it is ridiculous chris i know it but the doubt will arise i cannot help it you always say i am so sanely rooted to the earth and reality and all that butperhaps its superstition i dont knowbut the whole occurrence the messages of planchette the possibility of my fathers hand i know not how reaching out to bans rein and hurling him and you to death the correspondence between my fathers statement that he has twice attempted your life and the fact that in the last two days your life has twice been endangered by horsesmy father was a great horsemanall this i say causes the doubt to arise in my mind what if there be something in it i am not so sure science may be too dogmatic in its denial of the unseen the forces of the unseen of the spirit may well be too subtle too sublimated for science to lay hold of and recognize and formulate dont you see chris that there is rationality in the very doubt it may be a very small doubtoh so small but i love you too much to run even that slight risk besides i am a woman and that should in itself fully account for my predisposition toward superstition  yes yes i know call it unreality but ive heard you paradoxing upon the reality of the unrealthe reality of delusion to the mind that is sick and so with me if you will it is delusion and unreal but to me constituted as i am it is very realis real as a nightmare is real in the throes of it before one awakes  the most logical argument for illogic i have ever heard chris smiled it is a good gaming proposition at any rate you manage to embrace more chances in your philosophy than do i in mine it reminds me of samthe gardener you had a couple of years ago i overheard him and martin arguing in the stable you know what a bigoted atheist martin is well martin had deluged sam with floods of logic sam pondered awhile and then he said foh a fack mis martin you jis tawk like a house afire but you aint got de show i has hows that martin asked well you see mis martin you has one chance to mah two i dont see it martin said mis martin its dis way you has jis de chance lak you say to become worms foh de fruitification of de cabbage garden but is got de chance to lif mah voice to de glory of de lawd as i go paddin dem golden streetsalong ith de chance to be jis worms along ith you mis martin  you refuse to take me seriously lute said when she had laughed her appreciation  how can i take that planchette rigmarole seriously he asked  you dont explain itthe handwriting of my father which uncle robert recognizedoh the whole thing you dont explain it  i dont know all the mysteries of mind chris answered but i believe such phenomena will all yield to scientific explanation in the not distant future  just the same i have a sneaking desire to find out some more from planchette lute confessed the board is still down in the dining room we could try it now you and i and no one would know  chris caught her hand crying come on it will be a lark  hand in hand they ran down the path to the treepillared room  the camp is deserted lute said as she placed planchette on the table mrs grantly and aunt mildred are lying down and mr barton has gone off with uncle robert there is nobody to disturb us she placed her hand on the board now begin  for a few minutes nothing happened chris started to speak but she hushed him to silence the preliminary twitchings had appeared in her hand and arm then the pencil began to write they read the message word by word as it was written  there is wisdom greater than the wisdom of reason love proceeds not out of the dryasdust way of the mind love is of the heart and is beyond all reason and logic and philosophy trust your own heart my daughter and if your heart bids you have faith in your lover then laugh at the mind and its cold wisdom and obey your heart and have faith in your lovermartha  but that whole message is the dictate of your own heart chris cried dont you see lute the thought is your very own and your subconscious mind has expressed it there on the paper  but there is one thing i dont see she objected  and that  is the handwriting look at it it does not resemble mine at all it is mincing it is oldfashioned it is the oldfashioned feminine of a generation ago  but you dont mean to tell me that you really believe that this is a message from the dead he interrupted  i dont know chris she wavered i am sure i dont know  it is absurd he cried these are cobwebs of fancy when one dies he is dead he is dust he goes to the worms as martin says the dead i laugh at the dead they do not exist they are not i defy the powers of the grave the men dead and dust and gone  and what have you to say to that he challenged placing his hand on planchette  on the instant his hand began to write both were startled by the suddenness of it the message was brief  beware beware beware  he was distinctly sobered but he laughed it is like a miracle play death we have speaking to us from the grave but good deeds where art thou and kindred and joy and household goods and friendship and all the goodly company  but lute did not share his bravado her fright showed itself in her face she laid her trembling hand on his arm  oh chris let us stop i am sorry we began it let us leave the quiet dead to their rest it is wrong it must be wrong i confess i am affected by it i cannot help it as my body is trembling so is my soul this speech of the grave this dead man reaching out from the mould of a generation to protect me from you there is reason in it there is the living mystery that prevents you from marrying me were my father alive he would protect me from you dead he still strives to protect me his hands his ghostly hands are against your life  do be calm chris said soothingly listen to me it is all a lark we are playing with the subjective forces of our own being with phenomena which science has not yet explained that is all psychology is so young a science the subconscious mind has just been discovered one might say it is all mystery as yet the laws of it are yet to be formulated this is simply unexplained phenomena but that is no reason that we should immediately account for it by labelling it spiritism as yet we do not know that is all as for planchette  he abruptly ceased for at that moment to enforce his remark he had placed his hand on planchette and at that moment his hand had been seized as by a paroxysm and sent dashing willynilly across the paper writing as the hand of an angry person would write  no i dont care for any more of it lute said when the message was completed it is like witnessing a fight between you and my father in the flesh there is the savor in it of struggle and blows  she pointed out a sentence that read you cannot escape me nor the just punishment that is yours  perhaps i visualize too vividly for my own comfort for i can see his hands at your throat i know that he is as you say dead and dust but for all that i can see him as a man that is alive and walks the earth i see the anger in his face the anger and the vengeance and i see it all directed against you  she crumpled up the scrawled sheets of paper and put planchette away  we wont bother with it any more chris said i didnt think it would affect you so strongly but its all subjective im sure with possibly a bit of suggestion thrown inthat and nothing more and the whole strain of our situation has made conditions unusually favorable for striking phenomena  and about our situation lute said as they went slowly up the path they had run down what we are to do i dont know are we to go on as we have gone on what is best have you thought of anything  he debated for a few steps i have thought of telling your uncle and aunt  what you couldnt tell me she asked quickly  no he answered slowly but just as much as i have told you i have no right to tell them more than i have told you  this time it was she that debated no dont tell them she said finally they wouldnt understand i dont understand for that matter but i have faith in you and in the nature of things they are not capable of this same implicit faith you raise up before me a mystery that prevents our marriage and i believe you but they could not believe you without doubts arising as to the wrong and illnature of the mystery besides it would but make their anxieties greater  i should go away i know i should go away he said half under his breath and i can i am no weakling because i have failed to remain away once is no reason that i shall fail again  she caught her breath with a quick gasp it is like a bereavement to hear you speak of going away and remaining away i should never see you again it is too terrible and do not reproach yourself for weakness it is i who am to blame it is i who prevented you from remaining away before i know i wanted you so i want you so  there is nothing to be done chris nothing to be done but to go on with it and let it work itself out somehow that is one thing we are sure of it will work out somehow  but it would be easier if i went away he suggested  i am happier when you are here  the cruelty of circumstance he muttered savagely  go or staythat will be part of the working out but i do not want you to go chris you know that and now no more about it talk cannot mend it let us never mention it againunless unless some time some wonderful happy time you can come to me and say lute all is well with me the mystery no longer binds me i am free until that time let us bury it along with planchette and all the rest and make the most of the little that is given us  and now to show you how prepared i am to make the most of that little i am even ready to go with you this afternoon to see the horsethough i wish you wouldnt ride any more for a few days anyway or for a week what did you say was his name  comanche he answered i know you will like him                      chris lay on his back his head propped by the bare jutting wall of stone his gaze attentively directed across the canyon to the opposing treecovered slope there was a sound of crashing through underbrush the ringing of steelshod hoofs on stone and an occasional and mossy descent of a dislodged boulder that bounded from the hill and fetched up with a final splash in the torrent that rushed over a wild chaos of rocks beneath him now and again he caught glimpses framed in green foliage of the golden brown of lutes corduroy ridinghabit and of the bay horse that moved beneath her  she rode out into an open space where a loose earthslide denied lodgement to trees and grass she halted the horse at the brink of the slide and glanced down it with a measuring eye forty feet beneath the slide terminated in a small firmsurfaced terrace the banked accumulation of fallen earth and gravel  its a good test she called across the canyon im going to put him down it  the animal gingerly launched himself on the treacherous footing irregularly losing and gaining his hind feet keeping his fore legs stiff and steadily and calmly without panic or nervousness extricating the fore feet as fast as they sank too deep into the sliding earth that surged along in a wave before him when the firm footing at the bottom was reached he strode out on the little terrace with a quickness and springiness of gait and with glintings of muscular fires that gave the lie to the calm deliberation of his movements on the slide  bravo chris shouted across the canyon clapping his hands  the wisestfooted clearestheaded horse i ever saw lute called back as she turned the animal to the side and dropped down a broken slope of rubble and into the trees again  chris followed her by the sound of her progress and by occasional glimpses where the foliage was more open as she zigzagged down the steep and trailless descent she emerged below him at the rugged rim of the torrent dropped the horse down a threefoot wall and halted to study the crossing  four feet out in the stream a narrow ledge thrust above the surface of the water beyond the ledge boiled an angry pool but to the left from the ledge and several feet lower was a tiny bed of gravel a giant boulder prevented direct access to the gravel bed the only way to gain it was by first leaping to the ledge of rock she studied it carefully and the tightening of her bridlearm advertised that she had made up her mind  chris in his anxiety had sat up to observe more closely what she meditated  dont tackle it he called  i have faith in comanche she called in return  he cant make that sidejump to the gravel chris warned hell never keep his legs hell topple over into the pool not one horse in a thousand could do that stunt  and comanche is that very horse she answered watch him  she gave the animal his head and he leaped cleanly and accurately to the ledge striking with feet close together on the narrow space on the instant he struck lute lightly touched his neck with the rein impelling him to the left and in that instant tottering on the insecure footing with front feet slipping over into the pool beyond he lifted on his hind legs with a half turn sprang to the left and dropped squarely down to the tiny gravel bed an easy jump brought him across the stream and lute angled him up the bank and halted before her lover  well she asked  i am all tense chris answered i was holding my breath  buy him by all means lute said dismounting he is a bargain i could dare anything on him i never in my life had such confidence in a horses feet  his owner says that he has never been known to lose his feet that it is impossible to get him down  buy him buy him at once she counselled before the man changes his mind if you dont i shall oh such feet i feel such confidence in them that when i am on him i dont consider he has feet at all and hes quick as a cat and instantly obedient bridlewise is no name for it you could guide him with silken threads oh i know im enthusiastic but if you dont buy him chris i shall remember ive second refusal  chris smiled agreement as he changed the saddles meanwhile she compared the two horses  of course he doesnt match dolly the way ban did she concluded regretfully but his coat is splendid just the same and think of the horse that is under the coat  chris gave her a hand into the saddle and followed her up the slope to the county road she reined in suddenly saying  we wont go straight back to camp  you forget dinner he warned  but i remember comanche she retorted well ride directly over to the ranch and buy him dinner will keep  but the cook wont chris laughed shes already threatened to leave what of our latecomings  even so was the answer aunt mildred may have to get another cook but at any rate we shall have got comanche  they turned the horses in the other direction and took the climb of the nun canyon road that led over the divide and down into the napa valley but the climb was hard the going was slow sometimes they topped the bed of the torrent by hundreds of feet and again they dipped down and crossed and recrossed it twenty times in twice as many rods they rode through the deep shade of cleanbunked maples and towering redwoods to emerge on open stretches of mountain shoulder where the earth lay dry and cracked under the sun  on one such shoulder they emerged where the road stretched level before them for a quarter of a mile on one side rose the huge bulk of the mountain on the other side the steep wall of the canyon fell away in impossible slopes and sheer drops to the torrent at the bottom it was an abyss of green beauty and shady depths pierced by vagrant shafts of the sun and mottled here and there by the suns broader blazes the sound of rushing water ascended on the windless air and there was a hum of mountain bees  the horses broke into an easy lope chris rode on the outside looking down into the great depths and pleasuring with his eyes in what he saw dissociating itself from the murmur of the bees a murmur arose of falling water it grew louder with every stride of the horses  look he cried  lute leaned well out from her horse to see beneath them the water slid foaming down a smoothfaced rock to the lip whence it leaped cleara pulsating ribbon of white abreath with movement ever falling and ever remaining changing its substance but never its form an aerial waterway as immaterial as gauze and as permanent as the hills that spanned space and the free air from the lip of the rock to the tops of the trees far below into whose green screen it disappeared to fall into a secret pool  they had flashed past the descending water became a distant murmur that merged again into the murmur of the bees and ceased swayed by a common impulse they looked at each other  oh chris it is good to be alive and to have you here by my side  he answered her by the warm light in his eyes  all things tended to key them to an exquisite pitchthe movement of their bodies at one with the moving bodies of the animals beneath them the gently stimulated blood caressing the flesh through and through with the soft vigors of health the warm air fanning their faces flowing over the skin with balmy and tonic touch permeating them and bathing them subtly with faint sensuous delight and the beauty of the world more subtly still flowing upon them and bathing them in the delight that is of the spirit and is personal and holy that is inexpressible yet communicable by the flash of an eye and the dissolving of the veils of the soul  so looked they at each other the horses bounding beneath them the spring of the world and the spring of their youth astir in their blood the secret of being trembling in their eyes to the brink of disclosure as if about to dispel with one magic word all the irks and riddles of existence  the road curved before them so that the upper reaches of the canyon could be seen the distant bed of it towering high above their heads they were rounding the curve leaning toward the inside gazing before them at the swiftgrowing picture there was no sound of warning she heard nothing but even before the horse went down she experienced the feeling that the unison of the two leaping animals was broken she turned her head and so quickly that she saw comanche fall it was not a stumble nor a trip he fell as though abruptly in midleap he had died or been struck a stunning blow  and in that moment she remembered planchette it seared her brain as a lightningflash of allembracing memory her horse was back on its haunches the weight of her body on the reins but her head was turned and her eyes were on the falling comanche he struck the roadbed squarely with his legs loose and lifeless beneath him  it all occurred in one of those agelong seconds that embrace an eternity of happening there was a slight but perceptible rebound from the impact of comanches body with the earth the violence with which he struck forced the air from his great lungs in an audible groan his momentum swept him onward and over the edge the weight of the rider on his neck turned him over head first as he pitched to the fall  she was off her horse she knew not how and to the edge her lover was out of the saddle and clear of comanche though held to the animal by his right foot which was caught in the stirrup the slope was too steep for them to come to a stop earth and small stones dislodged by their struggles were rolling down with them and before them in a miniature avalanche she stood very quietly holding one hand against her heart and gazing down but while she saw the real happening in her eyes was also the vision of her father dealing the spectral blow that had smashed comanche down in midleap and sent horse and rider hurtling over the edge  beneath horse and man the steep terminated in an upanddown wall from the base of which in turn a second slope ran down to a second wall a third slope terminated in a final wall that based itself on the canyonbed four hundred feet beneath the point where the girl stood and watched she could see chris vainly kicking his leg to free the foot from the trap of the stirrup comanche fetched up hard against an outputting point of rock for a fraction of a second his fall was stopped and in the slight interval the man managed to grip hold of a young shoot of manzanita lute saw him complete the grip with his other hand then comanches fall began again she saw the stirrupstrap draw taut then her lovers body and arms the manzanita shoot yielded its roots and horse and man plunged over the edge and out of sight  they came into view on the next slope together and rolling over and over with sometimes the man under and sometimes the horse chris no longer struggled and together they dashed over to the third slope near the edge of the final wall comanche lodged on a buttock of stone he lay quietly and near him still attached to him by the stirrup face downward lay his rider  if only he will lie quietly lute breathed aloud her mind at work on the means of rescue  but she saw comanche begin to struggle again and clear on her vision it seemed was the spectral arm of her father clutching the reins and dragging the animal over comanche floundered across the hummock the inert body following and together horse and man they plunged from sight they did not appear again they had fetched bottom  lute looked about her she stood alone on the world her lover was gone there was naught to show of his existence save the marks of comanches hoofs on the road and of his body where it had slid over the brink  chris she called once and twice but she called hopelessly  out of the depths on the windless air arose only the murmur of bees and of running water  chris she called yet a third time and sank slowly down in the dust of the road  she felt the touch of dollys muzzle on her arm and she leaned her head against the mares neck and waited she knew not why she waited nor for what only there seemed nothing else but waiting left for her to do
