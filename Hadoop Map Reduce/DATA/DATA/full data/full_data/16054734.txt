    nathaniel hawthorne   daffydowndilly was so called because in his nature he resembled a flower and loved to do only what was beautiful and agreeable and took no delight in labor of any kind  but while daffydowndilly was yet a little boy his mother sent him away from his pleasant home and put him under the care of a very strict schoolmaster who went by the name of mr toil those who knew him best affirmed that this mr toil was a very worthy character and that he had done more good both to children and grown people than anybody else in the world  certainly he had lived long enough to do a great deal of good for if all stories be true he had dwelt upon earth ever since adam was driven from the garden of eden  nevertheless mr toil had a severe and ugly countenance especially for such little boys or big men as were inclined to be idle his voice too was harsh and all his ways and customs seemed very disagreeable to our friend daffydowndilly  the whole day long this terrible old schoolmaster sat at his desk overlooking the scholars or stalked about the schoolroom with a certain awful birch rod in his hand  now came a rap over the shoulders of a boy whom mr toil had caught at play now he punished a whole class who were behindhand with their lessons and in short unless a lad chose to attend quietly and constantly to his book he had no chance of enjoying a quiet moment in the schoolroom of mr toil  this will never do for me thought daffydowndilly  now the whole of daffydowndillys life had hitherto been passed with his dear mother who had a much sweeter face than old mr toil and who had always been very indulgent to her little boy  no wonder therefore that poor daffydowndilly found it a woful change to be sent away from the good ladys side and put under the care of this uglyvisaged schoolmaster who never gave him any apples or cakes and seemed to think that little boys were created only to get lessons  i cant bear it any longer said daffydowndilly to himself when he had been at school about a week  ill run away and try to find my dear mother and at any rate i shall never find anybody half so disagreeable as this old mr toil  so the very next morning off started poor daffydowndilly and began his rambles about the world with only some bread and cheese for his breakfast and very little pocketmoney to pay his expenses  but he had gone only a short distance when he overtook a man of grave and sedate appearance who was trudging at a moderate pace along the road  good morning my fine lad said the stranger and his voice seemed hard and severe but yet had a sort of kindness in it whence do you come so early and whither are you going  little daffydowndilly was a boy of very ingenuous disposition and had never been known to tell a lie in all his life  nor did he tell one now he hesitated a moment or two but finally confessed that he had run away from school on account of his great dislike to mr toil and that he was resolved to find some place in the world where he should never see or hear of the old schoolmaster again  o very well my little friend answered the stranger  then we will go together for i likewise have had a good deal to do with mr toil and should be glad to find some place where he was never heard of  our friend daffydowndilly would have been better pleased with a companion of his own age with whom he might have gathered flowers along the roadside or have chased butterflies or have done many other things to make the journey pleasant  but he had wisdom enough to understand that he should get along through the world much easier by having a man of experience to show him the way  so he accepted the strangers proposal and they walked on very sociably together  they had not gone far when the road passed by a field where some haymakers were at work mowing down the tall grass and spreading it out in the sun to dry  daffydowndilly was delighted with the sweet smell of the newmown grass and thought how much pleasanter it must be to make hay in the sunshine under the blue sky and with the birds singing sweetly in the neighboring trees and bushes than to be shut up in a dismal schoolroom learning lessons all day long and continually scolded by old mr toil  but in the midst of these thoughts while he was stopping to peep over the stone wall he started back and caught hold of his companions hand  quick quick cried he  let us run away or he will catch us  who will catch us asked the stranger  mr toil the old schoolmaster answered daffydowndilly  dont you see him amongst the haymakers  and daffydowndilly pointed to an elderly man who seemed to be the owner of the field and the employer of the men at work there  he had stripped off his coat and waistcoat and was busily at work in his shirtsleeves the drops of sweat stood upon his brow but he gave himself not a moments rest and kept crying out to the haymakers to make hay while the sun shone  now strange to say the figure and features of this old farmer were precisely the same as those of old mr toil who at that very moment must have been just entering his schoolroom  dont be afraid said the stranger  this is not mr toil the schoolmaster but a brother of his who was bred a farmer and people say he is the most disagreeable man of the two  however he wont trouble you unless you become a laborer on the farm  little daffydowndilly believed what his companion said but was very glad nevertheless when they were out of sight of the old farmer who bore such a singular resemblance to mr toil  the two travellers had gone but little farther when they came to a spot where some carpenters were erecting a house  daffydowndilly begged his companion to stop a moment for it was a very pretty sight to see how neatly the carpenters did their work with their broadaxes and saws and planes and hammers shaping out the doors and putting in the windowsashes and nailing on the clapboards and he could not help thinking that he should like to take a broadaxe a saw a plane and a hammer and build a little house for himself  and then when he should have a house of his own old mr toil would never dare to molest him  but just while he was delighting himself with this idea little daffydowndilly beheld something that made him catch hold of his companions hand all in a fright  make haste  quick quick cried he  there he is again  who asked the stranger very quietly  old mr toil said daffydowndilly trembling  there he that is overseeing the carpenters  t is my old schoolmaster as sure as im alive  the stranger cast his eyes where daffydowndilly pointed his finger and he saw an elderly man with a carpenters rule and compasses in his hand this person went to and fro about the unfinished house measuring pieces of timber and marking out the work that was to be done and continually exhorting the other carpenters to be diligent  and wherever he turned his hard and wrinkled visage the men seemed to feel that they had a taskmaster over them and sawed and hammered and planed as if for dear life  o no this is not mr toil the schoolmaster said the stranger  it is another brother of his who follows the trade of carpenter  i am very glad to hear it quoth daffydowndilly but if you please sir i should like to get out of his way as soon as possible  then they went on a little farther and soon heard the sound of a drum and fife  daffydowndilly pricked up his ears at this and besought his companion to hurry forward that they might not miss seeing the soldiers accordingly they made what haste they could and soon met a company of soldiers gayly dressed with beautiful feathers in their caps and bright muskets on their shoulders  in front marched two drummers and two fifers beating on their drums and playing on their fifes with might and main and making such lively music that little daffydowndilly would gladly have followed them to the end of the world and if he was only a soldier then he said to himself old mr toil would never venture to look him in the face  quick step  forward march shouted a gruff voice  little daffydowndilly started in great dismay for this voice which had spoken to the soldiers sounded precisely the same as that which he had heard every day in mr toils schoolroom out of mr toils own mouth and turning his eyes to the captain of the company what should he see but the very image of old mr toil himself with a smart cap and feather on his head a pair of gold epaulets on his shoulders a laced coat on his back a purple sash round his waist and a long sword instead of a birch rod in his hand  and though he held his head so high and strutted like a turkeycock still he looked quite as ugly and disagreeable as when he was hearing lessons in the schoolroom  this is certainly old mr toil said daffydowndilly in a trembling voice  let us run away for fear he should make us enlist in his company  you are mistaken again my little friend replied the stranger very composedly  this is not mr toil the schoolmaster but a brother of his who has served in the army all his life  people say hes a terribly severe fellow but you and i need not be afraid of him  well well said little daffydowndilly but if you please sir i dont want to see the soldiers any more  so the child and the stranger resumed their journey and by and by they came to a house by the roadside where a number of people were making merry  young men and rosychecked girls with smiles on their faces were dancing to the sound of a fiddle  it was the pleasantest sight that daffydowndilly had yet met with and it comforted him for all his disappointments  o let us stop here cried he to his companion for mr toil will never dare to show his face where there is a fiddler and where people are dancing and making merry  we shall be quite safe here  but these last words died away upon daffydowndillys tongue for happening to cast his eyes on the fiddler whom should be behold again but the likeness of mr toil holding a fiddlebow instead of a birch rod and flourishing it with as much ease and dexterity as if he had been a fiddler all his life  he had somewhat the air of a frenchman but still looked exactly like the old schoolmaster and daffydowndilly even fancied that he nodded and winked at him and made signs for him to join in the dance  o dear me  whispered he turning pale  it seems as if there was nobody but mr toil in the world  who could have thought of his playing on a fiddle  this is not your old schoolmaster observed the stranger but another brother of his who was bred in france where he learned the profession of a fiddler  he is ashamed of his family and generally calls himself monsieur le plaisir but his real name is toil and those who have known him best think him still more disagreeable than his brothers  pray let us go a little farther said daffydowndilly  i dont like the looks of this fiddler at all  well thus the stranger and little daffydowndilly went wandering along the highway and in shady lanes and through pleasant villages and whithersoever they went behold  there was the image of old mr toil he stood like a scarecrow in the cornfields  if they entered a house he sat in the parlor if they peeped into the kitchen he was there  he made himself at home in every cottage and stole under one disguise or another into the most splendid mansions  everywhere there was sure to be somebody wearing the likeness of mr toil and who as the stranger affirmed was one of the old schoolmasters innumerable brethren  little daffydowndilly was almost tired to death when he perceived some people reclining lazily in a shady place by the side of the road  the poor child entreated his companion that they might sit down there and take some repose  old mr toil will never come here said he for he hates to see people taking their ease  but even while he spoke daffydowndillys eyes fell upon a person who seemed the laziest and heaviest and most torpid of all those lazy and heavy and torpid people who had lain down to sleep in the shade  who should it be again but the very image of mr toil  there is a large family of these toils remarked the stranger  this is another of the old schoolmasters brothers who was bred in italy where he acquired very idle habits and goes by the name of signor far niente  he pretends to lead an easy life but is really the most miserable fellow in the family  o take me backtake me back cried poor little daffydowndilly bursting into tears  if there is nothing but toil all the world over i may just as well go back to the schoolhouse  yonder it isthere is the schoolhouse said the stranger for though he and little daffydowndilly had taken a great many steps they had travelled in a circle instead of a straight line  come we will go back to school together  there was something in his companions voice that little daffydowndilly now remembered and it is strange that he had not remembered it sooner looking up into his face behold there again was the likeness of old mr toil so that the poor child had been in company with toil all day even while he was doing his best to run away from him  some people to whom i have told little daffydowndillys story are of opinion that old mr toil was a magician and possessed the power of multiplying himself into as many shapes as he saw fit  be this as it may little daffydowndilly had learned a good lesson and from that time forward was diligent at his task because he knew that diligence is not a whit more toilsome than sport or idleness  and when he became better acquainted with mr toil he began to think that his ways were not so very disagreeable and that the old schoolmasters smile of approbation made his face almost as pleasant as even that of daffydowndillys mother
