98724382	the irrational knot  by bernard shaw being  the second novel of his nonage   1905     preface  to the american edition of 1905   this novel was written in the year 1880 only a few years after i had exported myself from dublin to london in a condition of extreme rawness and inexperience concerning the specifically english side of the life with which the book pretends to deal everybody wrote novels then it was my second attempt and it shared the fate of my first that is to say nobody would publish it though i tried all the london publishers and some american ones and i should not greatly blame them if i could feel sure that it was the books faults and not its qualities that repelled them  i have narrated elsewhere how in the course of time the rejected ms became mrs annie besants excuse for lending me her ever helping hand by publishing it as a serial in a little propagandist magazine of hers that was how it got loose beyond all possibility of recapture it is out of my power now to stand between it and the american public all i can do is to rescue it from unauthorized mutilations and make the best of a jejune job  at present of course i am not the author of the irrational knot physiologists inform us that the substance of our bodies and consequently of our souls is shed and renewed at such a rate that no part of us lasts longer than eight years i am therefore not now in any atom of me the person who wrote the irrational knot in 1880 the last of that author perished in 1888 and two of his successors have since joined the majority fourth of his line i cannot be expected to take any very lively interest in the novels of my literary greatgrandfather even my personal recollections of him are becoming vague and overlaid with those most misleading of all traditions the traditions founded on the lies a man tells and at last comes to believe about himself to himself certain things however i remember very well for instance i am significantly clear as to the price of the paper on which i wrote the irrational knot it was cheapa white demy of unpretentious qualityso that sixpennorth lasted a long time my daily allowance of composition was five pages of this demy in quarto and i held my natural laziness sternly to that task day in day out to the end i remember also that bizets carmen being then new in london i used it as a safetyvalve for my romantic impulses when i was tired of the sordid realism of whatshisname i have sent my only copy of the irrational knot to the printers and cannot remember the name of my hero i went to the piano and forgot him in the glamorous society of carmen and her crimson toreador and yellow dragoon not that bizets music could infatuate me as it infatuated nietzsche nursed on greater masters i thought less of him than he deserved but the carmen music wasin placesexquisite of its kind and could enchant a man like me romantic enough to have come to the end of romance before i began to create in art for myself  when i say that i did and felt these things i mean of course that the predecessor whose name i bear did and felt them the i of today is  am cool towards carmen and carmen i regret to say does not take the slightest interest in him  me and now enough of this juggling with past and present shaws the grammatical complications of being a first person and several extinct third persons at the same moment are so frightful that i must return to the ordinary misusage and ask the reader to make the necessary corrections in his or her own mind  this book is not wholly a compound of intuition and ignorance take for example the profession of my hero an irishamerican electrical engineer that was by no means a flight of fancy for you must not suppose because i am a man of letters that i never tried to earn an honest living i began trying to commit that sin against my nature when i was fifteen and persevered from youthful timidity and diffidence until i was twentythree my last attempt was in 1879 when a company was formed in london to exploit an ingenious invention by mr thomas alva edisona much too ingenious invention as it proved being nothing less than a telephone of such stentorian efficiency that it bellowed your most private communications all over the house instead of whispering them with some sort of discretion this was not what the british stockbroker wanted so the company was soon merged in the national telephone company after making a place for itself in the history of literature quite unintentionally by providing me with a job whilst the edison telephone company lasted it crowded the basement of a huge pile of offices in queen victoria street with american artificers these deluded and romantic men gave me a glimpse of the skilled proletariat of the united states they sang obsolete sentimental songs with genuine emotion and their language was frightful even to an irishman they worked with a ferocious energy which was out of all proportion to the actual result achieved indomitably resolved to assert their republican manhood by taking no orders from a tallhatted englishman whose stiff politeness covered his conviction that they were relatively to himself inferior and common persons they insisted on being slavedriven with genuine american oaths by a genuine free and equal american foreman they utterly despised the artfully slow british workman who did as little for his wages as he possibly could never hurried himself and had a deep reverence for anyone whose pocket could be tapped by respectful behavior need i add that they were contemptuously wondered at by this same british workman as a parcel of outlandish adult boys who sweated themselves for their employers benefit instead of looking after their own interests they adored mr edison as the greatest man of all time in every possible department of science art and philosophy and execrated mr graham bell the inventor of the rival telephone as his satanic adversary but each of them had or pretended to have on the brink of completion an improvement on the telephone usually a new transmitter they were freesouled creatures excellent company sensitive cheerful and profane liars braggarts and hustlers with an air of making slow old england hum which never left them even when as often happened they were wrestling with difficulties of their own making or struggling in nothoroughfares from which they had to be retrieved like strayed sheep by englishmen without imagination enough to go wrong  in this environment i remained for some months as i was interested in physics and had read tyndall and helmholtz besides having learnt something in ireland through a fortunate friendship with a cousin of mr graham bell who was also a chemist and physicist i was i believe the only person in the entire establishment who knew the current scientific explanation of telephony and as i soon struck up a friendship with our official lecturer a colchester man whose strong point was prescientific agriculture i often discharged his duties for him in a manner which i am persuaded laid the foundation of mr edisons london reputation my sole reward being my boyish delight in the halfconcealed incredulity of our visitors who were convinced by the hoarsely startling utterances of the telephone that the speaker alleged by me to be twenty miles away was really using a speakingtrumpet in the next room and their obvious uncertainty when the demonstration was over as to whether they ought to tip me or not a question they either decided in the negative or never decided at all for i never got anything  so much for my electrical engineer to get him into contact with fashionable society before he became famous was also a problem easily solved i knew of three english peers who actually preferred physical laboratories to stables and scientific experts to gamekeepers in fact one of the experts was a friend of mine and i knew from personal experience that if science brings men of all ranks into contact art especially music does the same for men and women an electrician who can play an accompaniment can go anywhere and know anybody as far as mere access and acquaintance go there are no class barriers for him my difficulty was not to get my hero into society but to give any sort of plausibility to my picture of society when i got him into it i lacked the touch of the literary dinerout and i had as the reader will probably find to his cost the classical tradition which makes all the persons in a novel except the comically vernacular ones or the speakers of phonetically spelt dialect utter themselves in the formal phrases and studied syntax of eighteenth century rhetoric in short i wrote in the style of scott and dickens and as fashionable society then spoke and behaved as it still does in no style at all my transcriptions of oxford and mayfair may nowadays suggest an unaccountable and ludicrous ignorance of a very superficial and accessible code of manners i was not however so ignorant as might have been inferred at that time from my somewhat desperate financial condition  i had to begin with a sort of backstairs knowledge for in my teens i struggled for life in the office of an irish gentleman who acted as land agent and private banker for many persons of distinction now it is possible for a london author to dine out in the highest circles for twenty years without learning as much about the human frailties of his hosts as the family solicitor or in ireland the family land agent learns in twenty days and some of this knowledge inevitably reaches his clerks especially the clerk who keeps the cash which was my particular department he learns if capable of the lesson that the aristocratic profession has as few geniuses as any other profession so that if you want a peerage of more than say half a dozen members you must fill it up with many common persons and even with some deplorably mean ones for service is no inheritance either in the kitchen or the house of lords and the case presented by mr barrie in his play of the admirable crichton where the butler is the man of quality and his master the earl the man of rank is no fantasy but a quite common occurrence and indeed to some extent an inevitable one because the english are extremely particular in selecting their butlers whilst they do not select their barons at all taking them as the accident of birth sends them the consequences include much ironic comedy for instance we have in england a curious belief in first rate people meaning all the people we do not know and this consoles us for the undeniable secondrateness of the people we do know besides saving the credit of aristocracy as an institution the unmet aristocrat is devoutly believed in but he is always round the corner never at hand that the smart set exists that there is above and beyond that smart set a class so blue of blood and exquisite in nature that it looks down even on the king with haughty condescension that scepticism on these points is one of the stigmata of plebeian baseness all these imaginings are so common here that they constitute the real popular sociology of england as much as an unlimited credulity as to vaccination constitutes the real popular science of england it is of course a timid superstition a british peer or peeress who happens by chance to be genuinely noble is just as isolated at court as goethe would have been among all the other grandsons of publicans if they had formed a distinct class in frankfurt or weimar this i knew very well when i wrote my novels and if as i suspect i failed to create a convincingly verisimilar atmosphere of aristocracy it was not because i had any illusions or ignorances as to the common humanity of the peerage and not because i gave literary style to its conversation but because as i had never had any money i was foolishly indifferent to it and so having blinded myself to its enormous importance necessarily missed the point of view and with it the whole moral basis of the class which rightly values money and plenty of it as the first condition of a bearable life  money is indeed the most important thing in the world and all sound and successful personal and national morality should have this fact for its basis every teacher or twaddler who denies it or suppresses it is an enemy of life money controls morality and what makes the united states of america look so foolish even in foolish europe is that they are always in a state of flurried concern and violent interference with morality whereas they throw their money into the street to be scrambled for and presently find that their cash reserves are not in their own hands but in the pockets of a few millionaires who bewildered by their luck and unspeakably incapable of making any truly economic use of it endeavor to do good with it by letting themselves be fleeced by philanthropic committee men building contractors librarians and professors in the name of education science art and what not so that sensible people exhale relievedly when the pious millionaire dies and his heirs demoralized by being brought up on his outrageous income begin the socially beneficent work of scattering his fortune through the channels of the trades that flourish by riotous living  this as i have said i did not then understand for i knew money only by the want of it ireland is a poor country and my father was a poor man in a poor country by this i do not mean that he was hungry and homeless a hewer of wood and a drawer of water my friend mr james huneker a man of gorgeous imagination and incorrigible romanticism has described me to the american public as a peasant lad who has raised himself as all american presidents are assumed to have raised themselves from the humblest departments of manual labor to the loftiest eminence james flatters me had i been born a peasant i should now be a tramp my notion of my fathers income is even vaguer than his own wasand that is saying a good dealbut he always had an income of at least three figures four if you count in dollars instead of pounds and what made him poor was that he conceived himself as born to a social position which even in ireland could have been maintained in dignified comfort only on twice or thrice what he had and he married on that assumption fortunately for me social opportunity is not always to be measured by income there is an important economic factor first analyzed by an american economist general walker and called rent of ability now this rent when the ability is of the artistic or political sort is often paid in kind for example a london possessor of such ability may with barely enough money to maintain a furnished bedroom and a single presentable suit of clothes see everything worth seeing that a millionaire can see and know everybody worth knowing that he can know long before i reached this point myself a very trifling accomplishment gave me glimpses of the sort of fashionable life a peasant never sees thus i remember one evening during the novelwriting period when nobody would pay a farthing for a stroke of my pen walking along sloane street in that blessed shield of literary shabbiness evening dress a man accosted me with an eloquent appeal for help ending with the assurance that he had not a penny in the world i replied with exact truth neither have i he thanked me civilly and went away apparently not in the least surprised leaving me to ask myself why i did not turn beggar too since i felt sure that a man who did it as well as he must be in comfortable circumstances  another reminiscence a little past midnight in the same costume i was turning from piccadilly into bond street when a lady of the pavement out of luck that evening so far confided to me that the last bus for brompton had passed and that she should be grateful to any gentleman who would give her a lift in a hansom my oldfashioned irish gallantry had not then been worn off by age and england besides as a novelist who could find no publisher i was touched by the similarity of our trades and predicaments i excused myself very politely on the ground that my wife invented for the occasion was waiting for me at home and that i felt sure so attractive a lady would have no difficulty in finding another escort unfortunately this speech made so favorable an impression on her that she immediately took my arm and declared her willingness to go anywhere with me on the flattering ground that i was a perfect gentleman in vain did i try to persuade her that in coming up bond street and deserting piccadilly she was throwing away her last chance of a hansom she attached herself so devotedly to me that i could not without actual violence shake her off at last i made a stand at the end of old bond street i took out my purse opened it and held it upside down her countenance fell poor girl she turned on her heel with a melancholy flirt of her skirt and vanished  now on both these occasions i had been in the company of people who spent at least as much in a week as i did in a year why was i a penniless and unknown young man admitted there simply because though i was an execrable pianist and never improved until the happy invention of the pianola made a paderewski of me i could play a simple accompaniment at sight more congenially to a singer than most amateurs it is true that the musical side of london society with its streak of bohemianism and its necessary toleration of foreign ways and professional manners is far less typically english than the sporting side or the political side or the philistine side so much so indeed that people may and do pass their lives in it without ever discovering what english plutocracy in the mass is really like still if you wander in it nocturnally for a fitful year or so as i did with empty pockets and an utter impossibility of approaching it by daylight owing to the deplorable decay of the morning wardrobe you have something more actual to go on than the hallucinations of a peasant lad setting his foot manfully on the lowest rung of the social ladder i never climbed any ladder i have achieved eminence by sheer gravitation and i hereby warn all peasant lads not to be duped by my pretended example into regarding their present servitude as a practicable first step to a celebrity so dazzling that its subject cannot even suppress his own bad novels  conceive me then at the writing of the irrational knot as a person neither belonging to the world i describe nor wholly ignorant of it and on certain points quite incapable of conceiving it intuitively a whole world of art which did not exist for it lay open to me i was familiar with the greatest in that world mighty poets painters and musicians were my intimates i found the world of artificial greatness founded on convention and money so repugnant and contemptible by comparison that i had no sympathetic understanding of it people are fond of blaming valets because no man is a hero to his valet but it is equally true that no man is a valet to his hero and the hero consequently is apt to blunder very ludicrously about valets through judging them from an irrelevant standard of heroism heroism remember having its faults as well as its qualities i always on the heroic plane imaginatively had two disgusting faults which i did not recognize as faults because i could not help them i was poor and by day shabby i therefore tolerated the gross error that poverty though an inconvenience and a trial is not a sin and a disgrace and i stood for my selfrespect on the things i had probity ability knowledge of art laboriousness and whatever else came cheaply to me because i could walk into hampton court palace and the national gallery on free days and enjoy mantegna and michael angelo whilst millionaires were yawning miserably over inept gluttonies because i could suffer more by hearing a movement of beethovens ninth symphony taken at a wrong tempo than a duchess by losing a diamond necklace i was indifferent to the repulsive fact that if i had fallen in love with the duchess i did not possess a morning suit in which i could reasonably have expected her to touch me with the furthest protended pair of tongs and i did not see that to remedy this i should have been prepared to wade through seas of other peoples blood indeed it is this perception which constitutes an aristocracy nowadays it is the secret of all our governing classes which consist finally of people who though perfectly prepared to be generous humane cultured philanthropic public spirited and personally charming in the second instance are unalterably resolved in the first to have money enough for a handsome and delicate life and will in pursuit of that money batter in the doors of their fellow men sell them up sweat them in fetid dens shoot stab hang imprison sink burn and destroy them in the name of law and order and this shews their fundamental sanity and rightmindedness for a sufficient income is indispensable to the practice of virtue and the man who will let any unselfish consideration stand between him and its attainment is a weakling a dupe and a predestined slave if i could convince our impecunious mobs of this the world would be reformed before the end of the week for the sluggards who are content to be wealthy without working and the dastards who are content to work without being wealthy together with all the pseudomoralists and ethicists and cowardice mongers generally would be exterminated without shrift to the unutterable enlargement of life and ennoblement of humanity we might even make some beginnings of civilization under such happy circumstances  in the days of the irrational knot i had not learnt this lesson consequently i did not understand the british peerage just as i did not understand that glorious and beautiful phenomenon the heartless rich american woman who so thoroughly and admirably understands that conscience is a luxury and should be indulged in only when the vital needs of life have been abundantly satisfied the instinct which has led the british peerage to fortify itself by american alliances is healthy and well inspired thanks to it we shall still have a few people to maintain the tradition of a handsome free proud costly life whilst the craven mass of us are keeping up our starveling pretence that it is more important to be good than to be rich and piously cheating robbing and murdering one another by doing our duty as policemen soldiers bailiffs jurymen turnkeys hangmen tradesmen and curates at the command of those who know that the golden grapes are not sour why good heavens we shall all pretend that this straightforward truth of mine is mere swiftian satire because it would require a little courage to take it seriously and either act on it or make me drink the hemlock for uttering it  there was the less excuse for my blindness because i was at that very moment laying the foundations of my high fortune by the most ruthless disregard of all the quack duties which lead the peasant lad of fiction to the white house and harness the real peasant boy to the plough until he is finally swept as rubbish into the workhouse i was an ablebodied and ableminded young man in the strength of my youth and my family then heavily embarrassed needed my help urgently that i should have chosen to be a burden to them instead was according to all the conventions of peasant lad fiction monstrous well without a blush i embraced the monstrosity i did not throw myself into the struggle for life i threw my mother into it i was not a staff to my fathers old age i hung on to his coat tails his reward was to live just long enough to read a review of one of these silly novels written in an obscure journal by a personal friend of my own now eminent in literature as mr john mackinnon robertson prefiguring me to some extent as a considerable author i think myself that this was a handsome reward far better worth having than a nice pension from a dutiful son struggling slavishly for his parents bread in some sordid trade handsome or not it was the only return he ever had for the little pension he contrived to export from ireland for his family my mother reinforced it by drudging in her elder years at the art of music which she had followed in her prime freely for love i only helped to spend it people wondered at my heartlessness one young and romantic lady had the courage to remonstrate openly and indignantly with me for the which as pepys said of the shipwrights wife who refused his advances i did respect her callous as comus to moral babble i steadily wrote my five pages a day and made a man of myself at my mothers expense instead of a slave and i protest that i will not suffer james huneker or any romanticist to pass me off as a peasant boy qualifying for a chapter in smiless self help or a good son supporting a helpless mother instead of a stupendously selfish artist leaning with the full weight of his hungry body on an energetic and capable woman no james such lies are not only unnecessary but fearfully depressing and fundamentally immoral besides being hardly fair to the supposed peasant lads parents my mother worked for my living instead of preaching that it was my duty to work for hers therefore take off your hat to her and blusha  it is now open to anyone who pleases to read the irrational knot i do not recommend him to but it is possible that the same mysterious force which drove me through the labor of writing it may have had some purpose which will sustain others through the labor of reading it and even reward them with some ghastly enjoyment of it for my own part i cannot stand it it is to me only one of the heaps of spoiled material that all apprenticeship involves i consent to its publication because i remember that british colonel who called on beethoven when the elderly composer was working at his posthumous quartets and offered him a commission for a work in the style of his jejune septet beethoven drove the colonel out of the house with objurgation i think that was uncivil there is a time for the septet and a time for the posthumous quartets it is true that if a man called on me now and asked me to write something like the irrational knot i should have to exercise great selfcontrol but there are people who read man and superman and then tell me actually to my face that i have never done anything so good as cashel byrons profession after this there may be a public for even the irrational knot so let it go   london may 26 1905  footnote a james having read the above in proof now protests he never called me a peasant lad that being a decoration by the subeditor the expression he used was a poor lad this is what james calls tact after all there is something pastoral elemental well aerated about a peasant lad but a mere poor lad really james really  pssince writing the above i have looked through the proofsheets of this book and found with some access of respect for my youth that it is a fiction of the first order by this i do not mean that it is a masterpiece in that order or even a pleasant example of it but simply that such as it is it is one of those fictions in which the morality is original and not readymade now this quality is the true diagnostic of the first order in literature and indeed in all the arts including the art of life it is for example the distinction that sets shakespears hamlet above his other plays and that sets ibsens work as a whole above shakespears work as a whole shakespears morality is a mere reachmedown and because hamlet does not feel comfortable in it and struggles against the misfit he suggests something better futile as his struggle is and incompetent as shakespear shews himself in his effort to think out the revolt of his feeling against readymade morality ibsens morality is original all through he knows well that the men in the street have no use for principles because they can neither understand nor apply them and that what they can understand and apply are arbitrary rules of conduct often frightfully destructive and inhuman but at least definite rules enabling the common stupid man to know where he stands and what he may do and not do without getting into trouble now to all writers of the first order these rules and the need for them produced by the moral and intellectual incompetence of the ordinary human animal are no more invariably beneficial and respectable than the sunlight which ripens the wheat in sussex and leaves the desert deadly in sahara making the cheeks of the ploughmans child rosy in the morning and striking the ploughman brainsick or dead in the afternoon no more inspired and no less than the religion of the andaman islanders as much in need of frequent throwing away and replacement as the communitys boots by writers of the second order the readymade morality is accepted as the basis of all moral judgment and criticism of the characters they portray even when their genius forces them to represent their most attractive heroes and heroines as violating the readymade code in all directions far be it from me to pretend that the first order is more readable than the second shakespear scott dickens dumas père are not to say the least less readable than euripides and ibsen nor is the first order always more constructive for byron oscar wilde and larochefoucauld did not get further in positive philosophy than ruskin and carlyle though they could snuff ruskins seven lamps with their fingers without flinching still the first order remains the first order and the second the second for all that no man who shuts his eyes and opens his mouth when religion and morality are offered to him on a long spoon can share the same parnassian bench with those who make an original contribution to religion and morality were it only a criticism  therefore on coming back to this irrational knot as a stranger after 25 years i am proud to find that its morality is not readymade the drunken prima donna of a bygone type of musical burlesque is not depicted as an immoral person but as a person with a morality of her own no worse in its way than the morality of her highly respectable wine merchant in its way the sociology of the successful inventor is his own sociology too and it is by his originality in this respect that he passes irresistibly through all the readymade prejudices that are set up to bar his promotion and the heroine nice amiable benevolent and anxious to please and behave well but hopelessly secondhand in her morals and nicenesses and consequently without any real moral force now that the threat of hell has lost its terrors for her is left destitute among the failures which are so puzzling to thoughtless people i cannot understand why she is so unlucky she is such a nice woman that is the formula as if people with any force in them ever were altogether nice  and so i claim the first order for this jejune exploit of mine and invite you to note that the final chapter so remote from scott and dickens and so close to ibsen was written years before ibsen came to my knowledge thus proving that the revolt of the life force against readymade morality in the nineteenth century was not the work of a norwegian microbe but would have worked itself into expression in english literature had norway never existed in fact when miss lords translation of a dolls house appeared in the eighteeneighties and so excited some of my socialist friends that they got up a private reading of it in which i was cast for the part of krogstad its novelty as a morally original study of a marriage did not stagger me as it staggered europe i had made a morally original study of a marriage myself and made it too without any melodramatic forgeries spinal diseases and suicides though i had to confess to a study of dipsomania at all events i chattered and ate caramels in the back drawingroom our greenroom whilst eleanor marx as nora brought helmer to book at the other side of the folding doors indeed i concerned myself very little about ibsen until later on william archer translated peer gynt to me viva voce when the magic of the great poet opened my eyes in a flash to the importance of the social philosopher  i seriously suggest that the irrational knot may be regarded as an early attempt on the part of the life force to write a dolls house in english by the instrumentality of a very immature writer aged 24 and though i say it that should not the choice was not such a bad shot for a stupid instinctive force that has to work and become conscious of itself by means of human brains if we could only realize that though the life force supplies us with its own purpose it has no other brains to work with than those it has painfully and imperfectly evolved in our heads the peoples of the earth would learn some pity for their gods and we should have a religion that would not be contradicted at every turn by the thing that is giving the lie to the thing that ought to be  welwyn sunday june 25 1905     book i     the irrational knot     chapter i   at seven oclock on a fine evening in april the gas had just been lighted in a room on the first floor of a house in york road lambeth a man recently washed and brushed stood on the hearthrug before a pier glass arranging a white necktie part of his evening dress he was about thirty well grown and fully developed muscularly there was no cloud of vice or trouble upon him he was concentrated and calm making no tentative movements of any sort even a white tie did not puzzle him into fumbling but acting with a certainty of aim and consequent economy of force dreadful to the irresolute his face was brown but his auburn hair classed him as a fair man  the apartment a drawingroom with two windows was dusty and untidy the paint and wall paper had not been renewed for years nor did the pianette which stood near the fireplace seem to have been closed during that time for the interior was dusty and the inner end of every key begrimed on a table between the windows were some tea things with a heap of milliners materials and a brass candlestick which had been pushed back to make room for a partially unfolded cloth there was a second table near the door crowded with coils batteries a galvanometer and other electrical apparatus the mantelpiece was littered with dusty letters and two trays of doulton ware which ornamented it were filled with accounts scraps of twine buttons and rusty keys  a shifting rustling sound as of somebody dressing which had been audible for some minutes through the folding doors now ceased and a handsome young woman entered she had thick black hair fine dark eyes an oval face a clear olive complexion and an elastic figure she was incompletely attired in a petticoat that did not hide her ankles and stays of bright red silk with white laces and seams quite unconcerned at the presence of the man she poured out a cup of tea carried it to the mantelpiece and began to arrange her hair before the glass he without looking round completed the arrangement of his tie looked at it earnestly for a moment and said have you got a pin about you  there is one in the pincushion on my table she said but i think its a black one i dont know where the deuce all the pins go to then casting off the subject she whistled a long and florid cadenza and added by way of instrumental interlude a remarkably close imitation of a violoncello meanwhile the man went into her room for the pin on his return she suddenly became curious and said where are you going tonight if one may ask  i am going out  she looked at him for a moment and turned contemptuously to the mirror saying thank you sorry to be inquisitive  i am going to sing for the countess of carbury at a concert at wandsworth  sing you the countess of barbury does she live at wandsworth  no she lives in park lane  oh i beg her pardon the man made no comment on this and she after looking doubtfully at him to assure herself that he was in earnest continued how does the countess of whatshername come to know you pray  why not  a long pause ensued then she said stuff but without conviction her exclamation had no apparent effect on him until he had buttoned his waistcoat and arranged his watchchain then he glanced at a sheet of pink paper which lay on the mantelpiece she snatched it at once opened it stared incredulously at it and said pink paper and scalloped edges how filthily vulgar i thought she was not much of a countess ahem music for

putting on his overcoat picked the program deftly from his sisters fingers and left the room she after damning him very heartily returned to the glass and continued dressing taking her tea at intervals until she was ready to go out when she sent for a cab and bade the driver convey her to the bijou theatre soho  conolly on arriving at the wandsworth town hall was directed to a committee room which served as greenroom on this occasion he was greeted by a clean shaven young clergyman who protested that he was glad to see him there but did not offer his hand conolly thanked him briefly and went without further ceremony to the table and was about to place his hat and overcoat on a heap of similar garments when observing that there were some hooks along the wall he immediately crossed over and hung up his things on them thereby producing an underbred effect of being more prudent and observant than the rest then he looked at his program and calculated how soon his turn to sing would come then he unrolled his music and placed two copies of le vallon ready to his hand upon the table having made these arrangements with a selfpossession that quite disconcerted the clergyman he turned to examine the rest of the company  his first glance was arrested by the beauty of a young lady with light brown hair and gentle grey eyes who sat near the fire beside her on a lower chair was a small lean and very restless young woman with keen dark eyes staring defiantly from a worn face these two were attended by a jovial young gentleman with curly auburn hair who was twanging a banjo and occasionally provoking an exclamation of annoyance from the restless girl by requesting her opinion of his progress in tuning the instrument near them stood a tall man dark and handsome he seemed unused to his present circumstances and contemptuous not of the company nor the object for which they were assembled but in the abstract as if habitual contempt were part of his nature  the clergyman who had just conducted to the platform an elderly professor in a shabby frock coat followed by three wellwashed children each of whom carried a concertina now returned and sat down beside a middleaged lady who made herself conspicuous by using a gold framed eyeglass so as to convey an impression that she was an exceedingly keen observer  it is fortunate that the evening is so fine said the clergyman to her  yes is it not mr lind  my throat is always affected by bad weather mrs leith fairfax i shall be so handicapped by the inevitable comparison of my elocution with yours that i am glad the weather is favorable to me though the comparison is not  no said mrs fairfax with decision i am not in the least an orator i can repeat a poem that is all oh i hope i have not broken my glasses they had slipped from her nose to the floor conolly picked them up and straightened them with one turn of his fingers  no harm done madam said he with a certain elocutionary correctness and rather in the strong voice of the workshop than the subdued one of the drawingroom handing the glasses to her ceremoniously as he spoke  thank you you are very kind very kind indeed  conolly bowed and turned again toward the other group  who is that whispered mrs fairfax to the clergyman  some young man who attracted the attention of the countess by his singing he is only a workman  indeed where did she hear him sing  in her sons laboratory i believe he came there to put up some electrical machinery and sang into a telephone for their amusement you know how fond lord jasper is of mechanics jasper declares that he is a genius as an electrician indeed it was he rather than the countess who thought of getting him to sing for us  how very interesting i saw that he was clever when he spoke to me there is so much in triflesin byplay mr lind now his manner of picking up my glass had his entire history in it you will also see it in the solid development of his head that young man deserves to be encouraged  you are very generous mrs leith fairfax it would not be well to encourage him too much however you must recollect that he is not used to society injudicious encouragement might perhaps lead him to forget his real place in it  i do not agree with you mr lind you do not read human nature as i do you know that i am an expert i see men as he sees a telegraph instrument quite uninfluenced by personal feeling  true mrs leith fairfax but the heart is deceitful above all things and desat least i should sayer that is you will admit that the finest perception may err in its estimate of the inscrutable work of the almighty  doubtless but really mr lind human beings are so shallow i assure you there is nothing at all inscrutable about them to a trained analyst of character it may be a gift perhaps but peoples minds are to me only little machines made up of superficial motives  i say said the young gentleman with the banjo interrupting them have you got a copy of rose softly blooming there  i said mrs fairfax no certainly not  then its all up with the concert we have forgotten marians music and there is nothing for nellyi beg pardon i mean miss mcquinchto play from she is above playing by ear  i cannot play by ear said the restless young lady angrily  if you will sing coal black rose instead marian i can accompany you on the banjo and back you up in the chorus the wandsworthersif they survive the concertinaswill applaud the change as one man  it is so unkind to joke about it said the beautiful young lady what shall i do if somebody will vamp an accompaniment i can get on very well without any music but if i try to play for myself i shall break down  conolly here stepped aside and beckoned to the clergyman  that young man wants to speak to you whispered mrs fairfax  oh indeed thank you said the rev mr lind stiffly i suppose i had better see what he requires  i suppose you had said mrs fairfax with some impatience  i dont wish to intrude where i have no business said conolly quietly to the clergyman but i can play that ladys accompaniment if she will allow me  the clergyman was too much afraid of conolly by this timehe did not know whyto demur i am sure she will not object he said pretending to be relieved by the offer your services will be most acceptable excuse me for one moment whilst i inform miss lind  he crossed the room to the lady and said in a lower tone i think i have succeeded in arranging the matter marian that man says he will play for you  i hope he can play said marian doubtfully who is he  it is conolly jaspers man  miss linds eyes lighted is that he she whispered glancing curiously across the room at him bring him and introduce him to us  is that necessary said the tall man without lowering his voice sufficiently to prevent conolly from hearing him the clergyman hesitated  it is quite necessary i do not know what he must think of us already said marian ashamed and looking apprehensively at conolly he was staring with a policemanlike expression at the tall man who after a vain attempt to ignore him had eventually to turn away the rev mr lind then led the electrician forward and avoided a formal presentation by saying with a simper here is mr conolly who will extricate us from all our difficulties  miss mcquinch nodded miss lind bowed marmaduke shook hands goodnaturedly and retired somewhat abashed thrumming his banjo just then a faint sound of clapping was followed by the return of the quartet party upon which miss lind rose and moved hesitatingly toward the platform the tall man offered his hand  nonsense sholto said she laughing they will expect you to do something if you appear with me  allow me marian said the clergyman as the tall man offended bowed and stood aside she pretending not to notice her brother turned toward conolly who at once passed the rev george and led her to the platform  the original key he enquired as they mounted the steps  i dont know she said alarmed  for a moment he was taken aback then he said what is the highest note you can sing  i can sing a sometimesonly when i am alone i dare not attempt it before people  conolly sat down knowing now that miss lind was a commonplace amateur he had been contrasting her with his sister greatly to the disparagement of his home life and he was disappointed to find the lady break down where the actress would have succeeded so well consoling himself with the reflexion that if miss lind could not rap out a b flat like susanna neither could she rap out an oath he played the accompaniment much better than marian sang the song meanwhile miss mcquinch listening jealously in the greenroom hated herself for her inferior skill  cool and reserved is the modern benjamin franklin observed marmaduke to her  better a reserved man who can do something than a sulky one who can do nothing she said glancing at the tall man with whom the clergyman was nervously striving to converse  exquisite melody is it not mr douglas said mrs fairfax coming to the clergymans rescue  i do not care for music said douglas i lack the maudlin disposition in which the taste usually thrives  miss mcquinch gave an expressive snap but said nothing and the conversation dropped until miss lind had sung her song and received a round of respectful but not enthusiastic applause  thank you mr conolly she said as she left the platform i am afraid that spohrs music is too good for the people here dont you think so  not a bit of it replied conolly there is nothing so very particular in spohr but he requires very good singingbetter than he is worth  miss lind colored and returned in silence to her seat beside miss mcquinch feeling that she had exposed herself to a remark that no gentleman would have made  now then nelly said marmaduke the parson is going to call time keep up your courage come get up get up  do not be so boisterous duke said marian it is bad enough to have to face an audience without being ridiculed beforehand  marian said marmaduke if you think nelly will hammer a love of music into the british workman you err lots of them get their living by hammering and they will most likely resent feminine competition bang there she goes pity the sorrows of a poor old piano and let us hope its trembling limbs wont come through the floor  really marmaduke said marian impatiently you are excessively foolish you are like a boy fresh from school  marmaduke taken aback by her sharp tone gave a long whispered whistle and pretended to hide under the table he had a certain gift of drollery which made it difficult not to laugh even at his most foolish antics and marian was giving way in spite of herself when she found douglas bending over her and saying in a low voice  you are tired of this place the room is very draughty i fear it will give you cold let me drive you home now an apology can be made for whatever else you are supposed to do for these people let me get your cloak and call a cab  marian laughed thank you sholto she said but i assure you i am quite happy pray do not look offended because i am not so uncomfortable as you think i ought to be  i am glad you are happy said douglas in his former cold tone perhaps my presence is rather a drawback to your enjoyment than otherwise  i told you not to come sholto but you would why not adapt yourself to the circumstances and be agreeable  i am not conscious of being disagreeable  i did not mean that only i do not like to see you making an enemy of every one in the room and forcing me to say things that i know must hurt you  to the enmity of your new associates i am supremely indifferent marian to that of your old friends i am accustomed i am not in the mood to be lectured on my behavior at present besides the subject is hardly worth pursuing may i gather from your remarks that i shall gratify you by withdrawing  yes said marian flushing slightly and looking steadily at him then controlling her voice with an effort she added do not try again to browbeat me into telling you a falsehood sholto  douglas looked at her in surprise before he could answer miss mcquinch reappeared  well nelly said marmaduke is there any piano left  not much she replied with a sullen laugh i never played worse in my life  wrong notes or deficiency in the sacred fire  both  i believe your song comes next said the clergyman to conolly who had been standing apart listening to miss mcquinchs performance  who is to accompany me sir  ohahmiss mcquinch will i am sure replied the rev mr lind smiling nervously conolly looked grave the young lady referred to closed her lips frowned said nothing marmaduke chuckled  perhaps you would rather play your own accompaniment said the clergyman weakly  conolly shook his head decisively and said i can do only one thing at a time sir  oh they are not very critical they are only workmen said the clergyman and then reddened deeply as marmaduke gave him a very perceptible nudge  ill not take advantage of that as i am only a workman myself said conolly i had rather leave the song out than accompany myself  pray dont suppose that i wish to be disagreeable mr lind said miss mcquinch as the company looked doubtfully at her but i have disgraced myself too completely to trust my fingers again i should spoil the song if i played the accompaniment  i think you might try nell said marmaduke reproachfully  i might retorted miss mcquinch but i wont  if somebody doesnt go out and do something there will be a shindy said marmaduke  marian hesitated a moment and then rose i am a very indifferent player she said but since no better is to be had i will ventureif mr conolly will trust me  conolly bowed  if you would rather not said miss mcquinch shamed into remorse i will try the accompaniment but i am sure to play it all wrong  i think miss mcquinch had better play said douglas  conolly looked at marian received a reassuring glance and went to the platform with her without further ado she was not a sympathetic accompanist but not knowing this she was not at all put out by it she felt too that she was as became a lady giving the workman a lesson in courtesy which might stand him in stead when he next accompanied rose softly blooming she was a little taken aback on finding that he not only had a rich baritone voice but was as far as she could judge an accomplished singer  really she said as they left the platform you sing most beautifully  one would hardly have expected it he said with a smile  marian annoyed at having this side of her compliment exposed did not return the smile and went to her chair in the greenroom without taking any further notice of him  i congratulate you said mrs leith fairfax to conolly looking at him like all the rest except douglas with a marked access of interest ah what wonderful depth there is in gounods music  he assented politely with a movement of his head  i know nothing at all about music said mrs fairfax  very few people do  i mean technically of course she said not quite pleased  of course  a tremendous burst of applause here followed the conclusion of the first verse of uncle ned  do come and listen nelly said marian returning to the door mrs fairfax and conolly presently went to the door too  would you not like to help in the chorus nelly said marian in a low voice as the audience began to join uproariously in the refrain  not particularly said miss mcquinch  sholto said marian come and share our vulgar joy we want you to join in the chorus  thank you said douglas i fear i am too indifferent a vocalist to do justice to the occasion  sing with mr conolly and you cannot go wrong said miss mcquinch  hush said marian interposing quickly lest douglas should retort there is the chorus shall we really join  conolly struck up the refrain without further hesitation marian sang with him mrs fairfax and the clergyman looked furtively at one another but forbore to swell the chorus miss mcquinch sang a few words in a piercing contralto voice and then stopped with a gesture of impatience feeling that she was out of tune marian with only conolly to keep her in countenance felt relieved when marmaduke thrice encored entered the room in triumph whilst he was being congratulated douglas turned to miss mcquinch who was pretending to ignore marmadukes success  i hope miss mcquinch he said in a low tone that you will be able to relieve marian at the piano next time you know how she dislikes having to play accompaniments for strangers  how mean it is of you to be jealous of a plumber said miss mcquinch with a quick glance at him which she did not dare to sustain so fiercely did he return it  when she looked again he seemed unconscious of her presence and was buttoning his overcoat  really going at last sholto said marian douglas bowed  i told you you wouldnt be able to stand it old man said marmaduke mrs bluestockings wont be pleased with you for not staying to hear her recite this referred to mrs fairfax who had just gone upon the platform  good night said miss mcquinch shortly anxious to test how far he was offended but unwilling to appear solicitous for a reconciliation  until tomorrow farewell he said approaching marian who gave him her hand with a smile conolly looking thoughtfully at him meanwhile he left the room and so mrs fairfax having gone to the platform to recite quiet prevailed for a few minutes  shall i have the pleasure of playing the accompaniment to your next song said conolly sitting down near marian  thank you said marian shrinking a little i think miss mcquinch knows it by heart then still anxious to be affable to the workman she added lord jasper says you are a great musician  no i am an electrician music is not my business it is my amusement  you have invented something very wonderful have you not  i have discovered something and i am trying to invent a means of turning it to account it will be only a cheap electromotor if it comes to anything  you must explain that to me some day mr conolly im afraid i dont know what an electromotor means  i ought not to have mentioned it said conolly it is so constantly in my mind that i am easily led to talk about it i try to prevent myself but the very effort makes me think of it more than ever  but i like to hear you talk about it said marian i always try to make people talk shop to me and of course they always repay me by trying to keep on indifferent topics of which i know as muchor as littleas they  well then said conolly an electromotor is only an engine for driving machinery just like a steam engine except that it is worked by electricity instead of steam electric engines are so imperfect now that steam ones come cheaper the man who finds out how to make the electric engine do what the steam engine now does and do it cheaper will make his fortune if he has his wits about him thats what i am driving at  miss lind in spite of her sensible views as to talking shop was not interested in the least indeed she said how interesting that must be but how did you find time to become so perfect a musician and to sing so exquisitely  i picked most of it up when i was a boy my grandfather was an irish sailor with such a tremendous voice that a neapolitan music master brought him out in opera as a buffo when he had roared his voice away he went into the chorus my father was reared in italy and looked more italian than most genuine natives he had no voice so he became first accompanist then chorus master and finally trainer for the operatic stage he speculated in an american tour married out there lost all his money and came over to england when i was only twelve to resume his business at covent garden i stayed in america and was apprenticed to an electrical engineer i worked at the bench there for six years  i suppose your father taught you to sing  no he never gave me a lesson the fact is miss lind he was a capital man to teach stage tricks and traditional renderings of old operas but only the exceptionally powerful voices survived his method of teaching he would have finished my career as a singer in two months if he had troubled himself to teach me never go to italy to learn singing  i fear you are a cynic you ought either to believe in your father or else be silent about him  why  why surely we should hide the failings of those we love i can understand now how your musical and electrical tastes became mixed up but you should not confuse your duties but please excuse me conollys eyes had opened a little wider i am lecturing you without the least right to it is a failing of mine which you must not mind  not at all youve a right to your opinion but the world would never get on if every practical man were to stand by his fathers mistakes however i brought it on myself by telling you a long story this is the first opportunity i ever had of talking about myself to a lady and i suppose i have abused it  marian laughed we had better stop apologizing to one another she said what about the accompaniments to our next songs  meanwhile marmaduke and miss mcquinch were becoming curious about marian and conolly  i say nelly he whispered marian and that young man seem to be getting on uncommonly well together she looks sentimentally happy and he seems pleased with himself dont you feel jealous  jealous why should i be  out of pure cussedness not that you care for the electric man but because you hate any one to fall in love with any one else when you are by  i wish you would go away  why dont you like me  i loathe you now perhaps you understand me  thats a nice sort of thing to say to a fellow said marmaduke roused i have a great mind to bring you to your senses as douglas does by not speaking to you for a week  i wish you would let me come to my senses by not speaking to me at all  oh well i am off but mind nelly i am offended we are no longer on speaking terms look as contemptuous as you please you will be sorry when you think over this remember you said you loathed me  so i do said elinor stubbornly  very good said marmaduke turning his back on her just then the concertinists returned from the platform and a waiter appeared with refreshments which the clergyman invited marmaduke to assist him in dispensing conolly considering the uncorking of bottles of soda water a sufficiently skilled labor to be more interesting than making small talk went to the table and busied himself with the corkscrew  well nelly said marian drawing her chair close to miss mcquinch and speaking in a low voice what do you think of jaspers workman  not much replied elinor shrugging her shoulders he is very conceited and very coarse  do you really think so i expected to find you delighted with his unconventionality i thought him rather amusing  i thought him extremely aggravating i hate to have to speak to people of that sort  then you consider him vulgar said marian disappointed  nno not vulgarer than anybody else he couldnt be that  sherry and soda marian said marmaduke approaching  no thank you marmaduke get nelly something  as miss mcquinch and i are no longer on speaking terms i leave her to the care of yonder scientific amateur who has just refused on teetotal grounds to pledge the rev george in a glass of eighteen shilling sherry  dont be silly marmaduke bring nelly some soda water  do nothing of the sort said miss mcquinch  marmaduke bowed and retired  what is the matter between you and duke now said marian  nothing i told him i loathed him  oh i dont wonder at his being a little huffed how can you say things you dont mean  i do mean them what with his folly sholtos mean conceit georges hypocrisy that mans vulgarity mrs fairfaxs affectation your insufferable amiability and the dreariness of those concertina people i feel so wretched that i could find it in my heart to loathe anybody and everybody  nonsense nelly you are only in the blues  only in the blues said miss mcquinch sarcastically yes that is all  take some sherry it will brighten you up  dutch courage thank you i prefer my present moroseness  but you are not morose nelly  oh stuff marian dont throw away your amiability on me here comes your new friend with refreshments i wonder was he ever a waiter he looks exactly like one  after this the conversation flagged mrs fairfax grew loquacious under the influence of sherry but presently a reaction set in and she began to yawn miss mcquinch when her turn came played worse than before and the audience longing for another negro melody paid little attention to her marian sang a religious song which was received with the respect usually accorded to a dull sermon the clergyman read a comic essay of his own composition and mrs fairfax recited an ode to mazzini the concertinists played an arrangement of a quartet by onslow the working men and women of wandsworth gaped and those who sat near the door began to slip out even miss mcquinch pitied them  the idea of expecting them to be grateful for an infliction like that she said what do people of their class care about onslows quartets  do you think that people of any class high or low would be gratified by such an entertainment said conolly with some warmth no one had sufficient spirit left to reply  at last the concertinists went home and the reading drew to a close conolly again accompanied by marian sang tom bowling the audience awoke cheered the singer heartily and made him sing again on his return to the greenroom miss mcquinch much affected at the fate of bowling and indignant with herself for being so stared defiantly at conolly through a film of tears when marmaduke went out the people also were so moved that they were ripe for laughter and with roars of merriment forced him to sing three songs in the choruses of which they joined eventually the clergyman had to bid them go home as mr lind had given them all the songs he knew  i suppose you will not come with us duke said marian when all was over and they were preparing to leave we can drop you at your chambers if you like but you will have to sit on the box mrs leith fairfax george nelly and i will be a carriageful  marmaduke looked at his watch by jove he cried it is only ten i forgot how early we began tonight no thank you marian i am not going your way but you may take the banjo and keep it until i call ta ta  they all went out together and the ladies followed by the clergyman entered their carriage and drove away leaving marmaduke and conolly standing on the pavement having shared the success of the concert each felt well disposed to the other  what direction are you going in said marmaduke  westminster bridge or thereabouts replied conolly this place is rather out of the way  have you anything particular to do before you turn in for the night  nothing at all  then ill tell you what it is old man lets take a hansom and drive off to the bijou we shall just be in time to see lalage virtue in the burlesque andlook here ill introduce you to her youre just the sort of chap she would like to know eh  conolly looked at him nodded and burst out laughing marmaduke who had set him down as a cool undemonstrative man was surprised at his hilarity for a moment but presently joined in it whilst they were both laughing a hansom appeared and conolly recovering himself hailed the driver  we shall get on together i see said marmaduke jumping into the cab hallo the bijou theatre soho and drive as fast as you can afford to for half a sovereign  right you are sir replied the driver whipping his horse  the rattling of the cab silenced conolly but his companion persisted for some time in describing the burlesque to which they were going and particularly the attractions of mademoiselle lalage virtue who enacted a principal character therein and with whom he seemed to be in love when they alighted at the theatre marmaduke payed the cabman and conolly took advantage of this to enter the theatre and purchase two stall tickets an arrangement which lind suddenly recollecting his new friends position disapproved of but found it useless to protest against he forgot it on hearing the voice of lalage virtue who was at that moment singing within and he went to his stall with his eyes turned to the stage treading on toes and stumbling as children commonly do when they walk in one direction and look in another an attendant who seemed to know him proffered a glass for hire he took it and leveled it at mademoiselle lalage who was singing some trivial couplets much better than they deserved catching sight of him presently she greeted him with a flash of her dark eye that made him writhe as though his heart had received a fillip from a ponderable missile she did not spare these roguish glances they darted everywhere and conolly looking about him to note their effect saw rows of callow young faces with parted lips and an expression which seemed to have been caught and fixed at the climax of a blissful chuckle there were few women in the stalls and the silly young faces were relieved only by stupid old ones  the couplets ended amidst great applause marmaduke placed his glass on his knees and clapping his hands vigorously turned to his companion with a triumphant smile mutely inviting him to clamor for a repetition of the air but conolly sat motionless with his arms folded his cheek flushed and his brow lowered  you dont seem used to this sort of thing said lind somewhat disgusted  it was well sung replied conolly better than most of these blackguards know  then why dont you clap  because she is not giving herself any trouble that sort of thing from a woman of her talent is too cheap to say thank you for  marmaduke looked at him and began to think that he was a priggish fellow after all but as the burlesque went on mademoiselle lalage charmed away this disagreeable impression she warbled in an amorous duet and then sang the pleasures of champagne tossing her head waving a gilt goblet and without the least appearance of effort working hard to captivate those who were to be won by bold smiles and arch glances she displayed her person less freely than her colleagues being not more modest but more skilful in the art of seduction the slang that served for dialogue in her part was delivered in all sorts of intonations now demure and mischievous anon strident and mock tragic marmaduke was delighted  what i like about her is that she is such a genuine little lady he said as her exit released his attention with all her go she is never a bit vulgar off the stage she is just the same not a spark of affectation about her it is all natural  you know her then said conolly  i should think i do replied marmaduke energetically you have no idea what a rattling sort she is  to you who only see her occasionally no doubt she givesas a rattling sorta heightened charm to the order the refinement thethe beauty of the home life which you can enjoy excuse my introducing such a subject mr lind but would you bring your cousinthe lady who sang tonight at the concertto see this performance  i would if she asked me to said marmaduke somewhat taken aback  no doubt but should you be surprised if she asked you  not a bit fine ladies are neither such fools nor such angels as youas some fellows think miss linds notion is to see everything and yet she is a thoroughly nice woman too it is the same with lalage there she is not squeamish and she is full of fun but she knows as well as anybody how to pull up a man who doesnt behave himself  and you actually think that this lalage virtue is as respectable a woman as your cousin  oh i dont bother myself about it i shouldnt have thought of comparing them if you hadnt started the idea marians way is not the other ones way and each of them is all right in her own way look here ill introduce you to lalage we can pick up somebody else to make a party for you and finish with a supper at jellicoes  are you privileged to introduce whom you like to miss lalage  well as to that she doesnt stand much on ceremony but then you see that cuts two ways the mere introducing is no difficulty but it depends on the man himself whether he gets snubbed afterward or not by the bye you must understand if you dont know it already that lalage is as correct in her morals as a bishops wife i just tell you because some fellows seem to think that a woman who goes on the stage leaves her propriety behind as a matter of course in fact i rather thought so myself once not that you wont find loose women there as well as anywhere else if you want to but dont take it for granted thats all  well said conolly you may introduce me and we can consider the supper afterwards would it be indiscreet to ask how you obtained your own introduction you dont i suppose move in the same circle as she and if she is as particular as your own people she can hardly form promiscuous acquaintanceships  a man at the point of death does not stop to think about etiquet she saved my life  saved your life that sounds romantic  there was precious little romance about it though i owe my being alive now to her presence of mind it happened in the rummest way i was brought behind the scenes one night by a cambridge chum we were painting the town a bit red we were not exactly drunk but we were not particularly sober either and i was very green at that time and made a fool of myself about lalage staring clapping like a madman in the middle of her songs getting into the way of everybody and everything and so on then a couple of fellows we knew turned up and we got chatting at the wing with some girls at last a fellow came in with a bag of cherries and we began trying that old trickyou knowtaking the end of a stalk between your lips and drawing the cherry into the mouth without touching it with your hand you know i tried it and i was just getting the cherry into my mouth when some idiot gave me a drive in the waistcoat i made a gulp and the cherry stuck fast in my throat i began to choke nobody knew what to do and while they were pushing me about some thinking i was only pretending the girls beginning to get frightened and the rest shouting at me to swallow the confounded thing i was getting black in the face and my head was bursting i could see nothing but red spots it was a near thing i tell you suddenly i got a shake and then a little fist gave me a stunning thump on the back that made the cherry bounce out against my palate i gasped and coughed like a grampus the stalk was down my throat still then the little hand grabbed my throat and made me open my mouth wide and the cherry was pulled out stalk and all it was lalage who did this while the rest were gaping helplessly i dont remember what followed i thought i had fainted but it appears that i nearly cried and talked the most awful nonsense to her i suppose the choking made me hysterical however i distinctly recollect the stage manager bullying the girls and turning us all out i was very angry with myself for being childish as they told me i had been and when i got back to cambridge i actually took to reading a few months afterward i made another trip to town and went behind the scenes again she recognized me and chaffed me about the cherry i jumped at my chance i improved the acquaintance and now i know her pretty well  you doubt whether any of the ladies that were with us at the concert would have been equally useful in such an emergency  i should think i do doubt it my boy hush now that the ballet is over we are annoying people by talking  you are right replied conolly aha here is miss lalage again  marmaduke raised his operaglass to his eyes eager for another smile from the actress he seemed about to be gratified for her glance was travelling toward him along the row of stalls but it was arrested by conolly on whom she looked with perceptible surprise and dismay lind puzzled turned toward his companion and found him smiling maliciously at mademoiselle lalage who recovered her vivacity with an effort and continued her part with more nervousness than he had ever seen her display before  shortly before the curtain fell they left the theatre and reentered it by the stage door  queer place isnt it said lind  conolly nodded but went forward like one well accustomed to the dingy labyrinth of oldfashioned stages presently they came upon lalage she was much heated by her exertions thickly painted and very angry  well she said quarrelsomely  marmaduke perceiving that her challenge was not addressed to him but to conolly looked from one to the other mystified  i have come to see you act at last said conolly  you might have told me you were coming i could have got you a stall although i suppose you would have preferred to throw away your money like a fool  i must admit my dear said conolly that i could have spent it to much greater advantage  indeed and you she said turning to lind whose deepening color betrayed his growing mortification what is the matter with you  i have played a trick on your friend said conolly he suggested this visit and i did not tell him of the relation between us finding us on terms of familiarity if not of affection he is naturally surprised  as i have never tried to meddle with your private affairs said marmaduke to lalage i need not apologize for not knowing your husband but i regret  the actress laughed in spite of her vexation why you silly old thing she exclaimed he is no more my husband than you are  oh said marmaduke indeed  i am her brother said conolly considerately stifling a smile  why said mademoiselle lalage fiercely raising her voice what else did you think  hush said conolly we are talking too much in this crowd you had better change your dress susanna and then we can settle what to do next  you can settle what you please she replied i am going home  mr lind has suggested our supping together said conolly observing her curiously  susanna looked quickly at them  who is mr lind she said  your friend of course said conolly with an answering flash of intelligence that brought out the resemblance between them startlingly mr marmaduke lind  marmaduke became very red as they both waited for him to explain  i thought that you would perhaps join us at supper he said to susanna  did you she said threateningly then she turned her back on him and went to her dressingroom  well mr lind said conolly what do you think of mademoiselle lalage now  i think her annoyance is very natural said marmaduke gloomily no doubt you are right to take care of your sister but you are very much mistaken if you think i meant to act badly toward her  it is no part of my duty to take care of her said conolly seriously she is her own guardian and she has never been encouraged to suppose that her responsibility lies with any one but herself  it doesnt matter now said marmaduke for i intend never to speak to her again  conolly laughed however that may turn out he said we are evidently not in the mood for further conviviality so let us postpone the supper to some other occasion may i advise you not to wait until susanna returns there is no chance of a reconciliation tonight  i dont want any reconciliation  of course not i had forgotten replied conolly placably then i suppose you will go before she has finished dressing  i shall go now said marmaduke buttoning his overcoat and turning away  goodnight said conolly  goodnight muttered marmaduke petulantly and disappeared  conolly waited a moment so that he might not overtake lind he then went for a cab and waited at the stage door until his sister came down frowning she got into the hansom without a word  why dont you have a brougham instead of going about in cabs he said as they drove away  because i like a hansom better than a brougham and i had rather pay four shillings a night and travel comfortably than thirteen and be half suffocated  i thought the appearance of  there is no use in your talking to me i cant hear a word you say going over these stones  when they were alone together in their drawingroom in lambeth he after walking up and down the room a few times and laughing softly to himself began to sing the couplets from the burlesque  are you aware she inquired that it is half past twelve and that the people of the house are trying to sleep  true said he desisting by the bye i too have had my triumphs this evening i shared the honors of the concert with master lind who was so delighted that he insisted on bringing me off to the bijou he loves you to distraction poor devil  yes you made a nice piece of mischief there where is he  gone away in a rage swearing never to speak to you again  hm and so his name is lind is it  didnt you know  no or i should have told you when i read the program this evening the young villain pretended that his name was marmaduke sharp  ah the name reminds me of one of his cousins a little spitfire that snaps at every one who presumes to talk to her  his cousins oh of course you met them at the concert what are they like are they swells  yes they seem to be there were only two cousins miss mcquinch and a young woman named marian blonde and rather good looking there was a brother of hers there but he is only a parson and a tall fellow named douglas who made rather a fool of himself i could not make him out exactly  did they snub you  i dont know probably they tried are you intimate with many of our young nobility under assumed names  steal a few more marches to the bijou and perhaps you will find out  goodnight pardon my abrupt departure but you are not the very sweetest of susannas tonight  oh goodnight  by the bye said conolly returning this must be the mr duke lind who is going to marry lady constance carbury my noble pupils sister  i am sure it matters very little whom he marries  if he will pay us a visit here and witness the working of perfect frankness without affection and perfect liberty without refinement he may find reason to conclude that it matters a good deal goodnight     chapter ii   marian lind lived at westbourne terrace paddington with her father the fourth son of a younger brother of the earl of carbury mr reginald harrington lind at the outset of his career had no object in life except that of getting through it as easily as possible and this he understood so little how to achieve that he suffered himself to be married at the age of nineteen to a lancashire cotton spinners heiress she bore him three children and then eloped with a professor of spiritualism who deserted her on the eve of her fourth confinement in the course of which she caught scarlet fever and died her child survived but was sent to a baby farm and starved to death in the usual manner her husband disgusted by her behavior for she had been introduced by him to many noblemen and gentlemen his personal friends some one at least of whom on the slightest encouragement would he felt sure have taken the place of the foreign charlatan she had disgraced him by preferring consoled himself for her bad taste by entering into her possessions which comprised a quantity of new jewellery new lace and feminine apparel and an income of nearly seven thousand pounds a year after this he became so welcome in society that he could have boasted with truth at the end of any july that there were few marriageable gentlewomen of twentysix and upward in london who had not been submitted to his inspection with a view to matrimony but finding it easy to delegate the care of his children to school principals and hospitable friends he concluded that he had nothing to gain and much comfort to lose by adding a stepmother to his establishment and after some time it became the custom to say of mr lind that the memory of his first wife kept him single thus whilst his sons were drifting to manhood through harrow and cambridge and his daughter passing from one relatives house to anothers on a continual round of visits sharing such private tuition as the cousins with whom she happened to be staying happened to be receiving just then he lived at his club and pursued the usual routine of a gentlemanbachelor in london  in the course of time reginald lind the eldest child entered the army and went to india with his regiment his brother george less stolid weaker and more studious preferred the church marian the youngest from being constantly in the position of a guest had early acquired habits of selfcontrol and consideration for others and escaped the effects good and evil of the subjection in which children are held by the direct authority of their parents  of the numerous domestic circles of her fathers kin that with which she was the least familiar because it was the poorest had sprung from the marriage of one of her fathers sisters with a wiltshire gentleman named hardy mcquinch who had a small patrimony a habit of farming and a love of hunting in the estimation of the peasantry who would not associate lands horses and a carriage with want of money he was a rich man but mrs mcquinch found it hard to live like a lady on their income and had worn many lines into her face by constantly and vainly wishing that she could afford to give a ball every season to get a new carriage and to appear at church with her daughters in new dresses oftener than twice a year her two eldest girls were plump and pleasant good riders and hearty eaters and she had reasonable hopes of marrying them to prosperous country gentlemen  elinor her third and only other child was one of her troubles at an early age it was her practice once a week or thereabouts to disappear in the forenoon be searched anxiously for all day and return with a torn frock and dirty face at about six oclock in the afternoon she was stubborn rebellious and passionate under reproof or chastisement governesses had left the house because of her and from one school she had run away from another eloped with a choir boy who wrote verses him she deserted in a fit of jealousy quarter of an hour after her escape from school the only one of her tastes that conduced to the peace of the house was for reading and even this made her mother uneasy for the books she liked best were fit in mrs mcquinchs opinion for the bookcase only elinor read openly what she could obtain by asking such as lambs tales from shakespear and the pilgrims progress the arabian nights entertainments were sternly refused her so she read them by stealth and from that day there was always a collection of books borrowed from friends or filched from the upper shelf in the library beneath her mattress nobody thought of looking there for them and even if they had they might have paused to reflect on the consequences of betraying her her eldest sister having given her a small workbox on her eleventh birthday had the present thrown at her head two days later for reporting to her parents that nellys fondness for sitting in a certain secluded summerhouse was due to her desire to read lord byrons poetry unobserved miss lydias forehead was severely cut and elinor though bitterly remorseful not only refused to beg pardon for her fault but shattered every brittle article in the room to which she was confined for her contumacy the vicar on being consulted recommended that she should be well whipped this counsel was repugnant to hardy mcquinch but he gave his wife leave to use her discretion in the matter the mother thought that the child ought to be beaten into submission but she was afraid to undertake the task and only uttered a threat which was received with stubborn defiance this was forgotten next day when elinor exhausted by a week of remorse terror rage and suspense became dangerously ill when she recovered her parents were more indulgent to her and were gratified by finding her former passionate resistance replaced by sulky obedience five years elapsed and elinor began to write fiction the beginning of a novel and many incoherent verses imitated from lara were discovered by her mother and burnt by her father this outrage she never forgave she was unable to make her resentment felt for she no longer cared to break glass and china she feared even to remonstrate lest she should humiliate herself by bursting into tears as since her illness she had been prone to do in the least agitation so she kept silence and ceased to speak to either of her parents except when they addressed questions to her her father would neither complain of this nor confess the regret he felt for his hasty destruction of her manuscripts but whilst he proclaimed that he would burn every scrap of her nonsense that might come into his hands he took care to be blind when he surprised her with suspicious bundles of foolscap and snubbed his wife for hinting that elinor was secretly disobeying him meanwhile her silent resentment never softened and the life of the family was embittered by their consciousness of it it never occurred to mrs mcquinch an excellent mother to her two eldest daughters that she was no more fit to have charge of the youngest than a turtle is to rear a young eagle the discomfort of their relations never shook her faith in their naturalness like her husband and the vicar she believed that when god sent children he made their parents fit to rule them and elinor resented her parents tyranny as she felt it to be without dreaming of making any allowances for their being in a false position towards her  one morning a letter from london announced that mr lind had taken a house in westbourne terrace and intended to live there permanently with his daughter elinor had not come down to breakfast when the post came  yes said mrs mcquinch when she had communicated the news i knew there was something the matter when i saw reginalds handwriting it must be fully eighteen months since i heard from him last i am very glad he has settled marian in a proper home instead of living like a bachelor and leaving her to wander about from one house to another i wish we could have afforded to ask her down here oftener  here is a note from marian addressed to nelly said lydia who had been examining the envelope  to nelly said mrs mcquinch vexed i think she should have invited one of you first  perhaps it is not an invitation said jane  what else is it likely to be child said mrs mcquinch then as she thought how much pleasanter her home would be without elinor she added after all it will do nelly good to get away from here she needs change i think i wish she would come down it is too bad of her to be always late like this  elinor came in presently wearing a neglected black gown her face pale her eyes surrounded by dark circles her black hair straggling in wisps over her forehead her sisters dressed twinlike in white muslin and gold lockets emphasized her by contrast being blond and gregarious they enjoyed the reputation of being pretty and affectionate they had thriven in the soil that had starved elinor  theres a letter for you from marian said mrs mcquinch  thanks said elinor indifferently putting the note into her pocket she liked marians letters and kept them to read in her hours of solitude  what does she say said mrs mcquinch  i have not looked replied elinor  well said mrs mcquinch plaintively i wish you would look i want to know whether she says anything about this letter from your uncle reginald  elinor plucked the note from her pocket tore it open and read it suddenly she set her face to hide some emotion from her family  marian wants me to go and stay with her she said they have taken a house  poor marian said jane and will you go  i will said elinor have you any objection  oh dear no said jane smoothly  i suppose you will be glad to get away from your home said mrs mcquinch incontinently  very glad said elinor mr mcquinch hurt looked at her over his newspaper mrs mcquinch was huffed  i dont know what you are to do for clothes she said unless lydia and jane are content to wear their last winters dresses again this year  the faces of the young ladies elongated thats nonsense mamma said lydia we cant wear those brown reps again women wore reps in those days  you need not be alarmed said elinor i dont want any clothes i can go as i am  you dont know what you are talking about child said mrs mcquinch  a nice figure you would make in uncle reginalds drawingroom with that dress on said lydia  and your hair in that state added jane  you should remember that there are others to be considered besides yourself said lydia how would you like your guests to look like scarecrows  how could you expect marian to go about with you or into the park i suppose  here here said mr mcquinch putting down his paper let us have no more of this what else do you need in the park than a riding habit you have that already whatever clothes you want you had better get in london where you will get the proper things for your money  indeed hardy she is not going to pay a london milliner four prices for things she can get quite as good down here  i tell you i dont want anything said elinor impatiently it will be time enough to begrudge me some decent clothes when i ask for them  i dont begrudge  mrs mcquinchs husband interrupted her thats enough now everybody its settled that she is to go as she wants to i will get her what is necessary give me another egg and talk about something else  accordingly elinor went to live at westbourne terrace marian had spent a month of her childhood in wiltshire and had made of elinor an exacting friend always ready to take offence and to remain jealous and sulky for days if one of her sisters or any other little girl engaged her cousins attention long on the other hand elinors attachment was idolatrous in its intensity and as marian was sweettempered and more apt to fear that she had disregarded elinors feelings than to take offence at her waywardness their friendship endured after they were parted their promises of correspondence were redeemed by elinor with very long letters at uncertain intervals and by marian with shorter epistles notifying all her important movements marian often called upon to defend her cousin from the charge of being a little shrew was led to dwell upon her better qualities elinor found in marian what she had never found at her own home a friend and in her uncles house a refuge from that of her father which she hated she had been marians companion for four years when the concert took place at wandsworth  next day they were together in the drawingroom at westbourne terrace marian writing elinor at the pianoforte working at some technical studies to which she had been incited by the shortcoming of her performance on the previous night she stopped on hearing a bell ring  what oclock is it she said after listening a moment surely it is too early for a visit  it is only half past two replied marian i hope it is not anybody i have not half finished my correspondence  if you please miss said a maid entering mr douglas wants to see you and he wont come up  i suppose he expects you to go down and talk to him in the hall said elinor  he is in the diningroom and wishes to see you most particular said the maid  tell him i will come down said marian  he heard me practising said elinor that is why he would not come up i am in disgrace i suppose  nonsense nelly but indeed i have no doubt he has come to complain of our conduct since he insists on seeing me alone  miss mcquinch looked sceptically at marians guileless eyes but resumed her technical studies without saying anything marian went to the diningroom where she found douglas standing near the window tall and handsome frock coated and groomed to a spotless glossiness that established a sort of relationship between him and the sideboard the condition of which did credit to marians influence over her housemaids he looked intently at her as she bade him good morning  i am afraid i am rather early he said half stiffly half apologetically  not at all said marian  i have come to say something which i do not care to keep unsaid longer than i can help so i thought it better to come when i could hope to find you alone i hope i have not disturbed you i have something rather important to say  you are the same as one of ourselves of course sholto but i believe you delight in stiffness and ceremony will you not come upstairs  i wish to speak to you privately first i have to apologize to you for what passed last night  pray dont sholto it doesnt matter i am afraid we were rude to you  pardon me it is i who am in fault i never before made an apology to any human being and i should not do so now without a painful conviction that i forgot what i owed to myself  then you ought to be ashamed of yourselfi mean for never having apologized before i am quite sure you have not got through life without having done at least one or two things that required an apology  i am sorry you hold that opinion of me  how is brutuss paw  brutus  yes that abrupt way of changing the subject is what mrs fairfax calls a display of tact i know it is very annoying so you may talk about anything you please but i really want to hear how the poor dog is  his paw is nearly healed  im so gladpoor old dear  you are aware that i did not come here to speak of my mothers dog marian  i supposed not said marian with a smile but now that you have made your apology wont you come upstairs nelly is there  i have something else to sayto you alone marian i entreat you to listen to it seriously marian looked as grave as she could i confess that in some respects i do not understand you and before you enter upon another london season through which i cannot be at your side i would obtain from you some assurance of the nature of your regard for me i do not wish to harass you with jealous importunity you have given me the most unequivocal tokens of a feeling different from that which inspires the ordinary intercourse of a lady and gentleman in society but of late it has seemed to me that you maintain as little reserve toward other men as toward me i am not thinking of marmaduke he is your cousin but i observed that even the working man who sang at the concert last night was receivedi do not say intentionallywith a cordiality which might have tempted a more humbly disposed person than he seemed to be to forget here douglas seeing marians bearing change suddenly hesitated her beautiful gray eyes always pleading for peace like those of a good angel were now full of reproach and her mouth but for those eyes would have suggested that she was at heart an obstinate woman  sholto she said i dont know what to say to you if this is jealousy it may be very flattering but it is ridiculous if it is a lecture seriously intended it isit is really most insulting what do you mean by my having given you unequivocal signs of regard of course i think of you very differently from the chance acquaintances i make in society it would be strange if i did not having known you so long and been your mothers guest so often but you talk almost as if i had been making love to you  no said douglas forgetting his ceremonious manner and speaking angrily and naturally but you talk as though i had not been making love to you  if you have i never knew it i never dreamt it  then since you are not the stupidest lady of my acquaintance you must be the most innocent  tell me of one single occasion on which anything has passed between us that justifies your speaking to me as you are doing now  innumerable occasions but since i cannot compel you to acknowledge them it would be useless to cite them  all i can say is that we have utterly misunderstood one another she said after a pause  he said nothing but took up his hat and looked down at it with angry determination marian too uneasy to endure silence added  but i shall know better in future  true said douglas hastily putting down his hat and advancing a step you cannot plead misunderstanding now can you give me the assurance i seek  what assurance  douglas shook his shoulders impatiently  you expect me to know everything by intuition she said  well my declaration shall be definite enough even for you do you love me  no i dont think i do in fact i am quite sure i do notin the way you mean i wish you would not talk like this sholto we have all got on so pleasantly together you and i and nelly and marmaduke and my father and now you begin making love and stuff of that kind pray let us agree to forget all about it and remain friends as before  you need not be anxious about our future relations i shall not embarrass you with my society again i hoped to find you a woman capable of appreciating a mans passion even if you should be unable to respond to it but i perceive that you are only a girl not yet aware of the deeper life that underlies the ice of conventionality  that is a very good metaphor for your own case said marian interrupting him your ordinary manner is all ice hard and chilling one may suspect that there are depths beneath but that is only an additional inducement to keep on the surface  then even your amiability is a delusion or is it that you are amiable to the rest of the world and reserve taunts of coldness and treachery for me  no no she said angelic again you have taken me up wrongly i did not mean to taunt you  you conceal your meaning as skilfully asaccording to youi have concealed mine goodmorning  are you going already  do you care one bit for me marian  i do indeed believe me you are one of my special friends  i do not want to be one of your friends will you be my wife  sholto  will you be my wife  no i  pardon me that is quite sufficient goodmorning  the moment he interrupted her a change in her face shewed she had a temper she did not move a muscle until she heard the house door close behind him then she ran upstairs to the drawingroom where miss mcquinch was still practising  oh nelly she cried throwing herself into an easy chair and covering her face with her hands oh oh oh oh oh she opened her fingers and looked whimsically at her cousin who despising this stage business said impatiently  well  do you know what sholto came for  to propose to you  stop nelly you do not know what horrible things one may say in jest he has proposed  when will the wedding be  dont joke about it please i scarcely know how i have behaved or what the meaning of the whole scene is yet listen did you ever suspect that he waswhat shall i saycourting me  i saw that he was trying to be tender in his own conceited way i fully expected he would propose some day if he could once reconcile himself to a wife who was not afraid of him  and you never told me  i thought you saw it for yourself particularly as you encouraged him  there the very thing he has been accusing me of he said i had given him unequivocal tokensyes unequivocal tokensthat i was madly in love with him  what did you sayif i may ask  i tried to explain things to him but he persisted in asking me would i be his wife and when i refused he would not listen to anything else and went off in a rage  yes i can imagine sholtos feelings on discovering that he had humbled himself in vain why did you refuse him  why fancy being sholtos wife i would as soon think of marrying marmaduke but i cannot forget what he said about my flirting with him nelly will you promise to tell me whenever you think i am behaving in a way that might lead anybody on tolike sholto you know  nonsense if men choose to make fools of themselves you cannot prevent them hush i hear someone coming upstairs it is marmaduke i think  marmaduke would never come up so slowly he generally comes up three steps at a time  sulky after last night no doubt i suppose he wont speak to me  marmaduke entered listlessly good morning marian he said sitting down on an uncomfortable chair good morrow nell  elinor surprised at the courtesy looked up and saluted him snappishly  is there anything the matter duke said marian are you ill  no im all right rather busy thats all  busy said elinor there must be something even more unusual than that when you are too low spirited to keep up a quarrel with me why dont you sit on the easy chair or sprawl on the ottoman after your manner  anything for a quiet life he replied moving to the ottoman  you must be hungry said marian puzzled by his obedience let me get you something  no thank you said marmaduke i couldnt eat just had lunch ive come to pack up a few things of mine that you have here  we have your banjo  oh i dont want that you may keep it or put it in the fire for all i care i want some clothes i left behind me when we had the theatricals  are you leaving london  yes i am getting tired of loafing about here i think i ought to go home for a while my mother wants me to  miss mcquinch by a subdued but expressive snort conveyed the most entire scepticism as to his solicitude about his mother she then turned to the piano calmly observing you have probably eaten something that disagrees with you  what a shame said marian come duke i have plenty of good news for you nelly and i are invited to carbury park for the autumn and there will be no visitors but us three we shall have the whole place to ourselves  time enough to think of the autumn yet awhile said marmaduke gloomily  well said miss mcquinch here is some better news for you constancelady constancewill be in town next week  marmaduke muttered something  i beg your pardon said elinor quickly  i didnt say anything  i may be wrong but i thought i heard you say hang lady constance  oh marmaduke cried marian affectedly how dare you speak so of your betrothed sir  who says she is my betrothed he said turning on her angrily  why everybody even constance admits it  she ought to have the manners to wait until i ask her he said subsiding im not betrothed to her and i dont intend to become so in a hurry if i can help it but you neednt tell your father i said so it might get round to my governor and then there would be a row  you must marry her some day you know said elinor maliciously  must i i shant marry at all ive had enough of women  indeed perhaps they have had enough of you marmaduke reddened you seem to have exhausted the joys of this world since the concert last night are you jealous of mr conollys success  your byplay when you found how early it was at the end of the concert was not lost on us said marian demurely you were going somewhere were you not  since you are so jolly curious said marmaduke unreasonably annoyed i went to the theatre with connolly and my byplay as you call it simply meant my delight at finding that we could get rid of you in time to enjoy the evening  with conolly said marian interested what kind of man is he  he is nothing particular you saw him yourself  yes but is he well educated andand so forth  dont know im sure we didnt talk about mathematics and classics  well butdo you like him  i tell you i dont care a damn about him one way or the other said marmaduke rising and walking away to the window his cousins astonished exchanged looks  very well marmaduke said marian softly after a pause i wont tease you any more dont be angry  you havnt teased me said he coming back somewhat shamefacedly from the window i feel savage today though there is no reason why i should not be as jolly as a shrimp perhaps nelly will play some chopin just to soothe me i should like to hear that polonaise again  i should enjoy nothing better than taking you at your word said elinor but i heard mr lind come in a moment ago and he is not so fond of chopin as you and i  mr lind entered whilst she was speaking he was a dignified gentleman with delicately chiselled features and portly figure his silky light brown hair curled naturally about his brow and set it off imposingly his hands were white and small with tapering fingers and small thumbs  how do you do sir said marmaduke blushing  thank you i am better than i have been  marmaduke murmured congratulations and looked at his watch as if pressed for time i must be off now he said rising i was just going when you came in  so soon well i must not detain you marmaduke i heard from your father this morning he is very anxious to see you settled in life  i suppose i shall shake down some day sir  you have very good opportunitiesvery exceptional opportunities has marian told you that constance is expected to arrive in town next week  yes we told him said marian  he thought it too good to be true and would hardly believe us added elinor  mr lind smiled at his nephew happily forgetful worldly wise as he was of the inevitable conspiracy of youth against age they smiled too except marmaduke who being under observation kept his countenance like the man in the iron mask it is quite true my boy said the uncle kindly but before she arrives i should like to have a talk with you when can you come to breakfast with me  any day you choose to name sir i shall be very glad  let us say tomorrow morning will that be too soon  not at all it will suit me quite well good evening sir  good evening to you  when marmaduke was in the street he stood for a while considering which way to go before the arrival of his uncle he had intended to spend the afternoon with his cousins he was now at a loss for a means of killing time on one point he was determined there was a rehearsal that day at the bijou theatre and thither at least he would not go he drove to charing cross and drifted back to leicester square he turned away from the theatre and wandered down piccadilly then he thought he would return as far as the criterion and drink finally he arrived at the stage door of the bijou theatre and inquired whether the rehearsal was over  theyve bin at it since eleven this mornin and will be pretty nigh til the stage is wanted for tonight said the janitor id as lief youd wait here as go up if you dont mind sir the guvnor is above and he aint in the best o tempers ill send word up  marmaduke looked round irresolutely a great noise of tramping and singing began  thats the new procession continued the doorkeeper sixteen hextras took on for it its miss virtues chance for lunch sir you wont have long to wait now  here there was a rapid pattering of feet down the staircase marmaduke started and stood biting his lips as mademoiselle lalage busy hungry and in haste hurried towards the door  come come on she said impatiently to him as she went out go and get a cab will you i must have something to eat and i have to get back sharp do be quthere goes a hansom hi she whistled shrilly and waved her umbrella the cab came and was directed by marmaduke to a restaurant in regent street  i am absolutely starving she said as they drove off i have been in since eleven this morning and of course they only called the band for halfpast they are such damned fools they drive me mad  why dont you walk out of the theatre and make them arrange it properly for next day  oh yes and throw the whole day after the half and lose my rehearsal it is bad enough to lose my temper i swore i can tell you  i have no doubt you did  this horse thinks hes at a funeral what oclock is it  its only eight minutes past four there is plenty of time  when they alighted lalage hurried into the restaurant scrutinized the tables and selected the best lighted one the waiter a decorous elderly man approached with some severity of manner and handed a bill of fare to marmaduke she snatched it from him and addressed the waiter sharply  bring me some thin soup and get me a steak to follow let it be a thick juicy one if its purple and raw i wont have it and if its done to a cinder i wont have it it must be red and get me some spring cabbage and potatoes and a pint of dry champagnethe decentest you have and be quick  and what for you sir said the waiter turning to marmaduke  never mind him interrupted susanna go and attend to me  the waiter bowed and retired  old stickinthemud muttered miss lalage is it halfpast four yet  no its only quarter past theres lots of time  mademoiselle lalage ate until the soup a good deal of bread the steak the vegetables and the pint of champagneless a glassful taken by her companionhad disappeared marmaduke watched her meanwhile and consumed two ices  have an ice to finish up with he said  no i cant work on sweets she replied but i am beginning to feel alive again and comfortable whats the time  confound the time said marmaduke its twenty minutes to five  well ill drive back to the theatre i neednt start for quarter of an hour yet  thank heaven said marmaduke i was afraid i should not be able to get a word with you  that reminds me of a crow i have to pluck with you mr marmaduke lind what did you mean by telling me your name was sharp  its the name of a cousin of mine said marmaduke attempting to dismiss the subject with a laugh  it may be your cousins name but its not yours by the bye is that the cousin youre engaged to  what cousin im not engaged to anybody  thats a lie like your denial of your name come come master marmaduke you cant humbug me youre too young hallo what do you want  it was the waiter removing some plates and placing a bill on the table marmaduke put his hand into his pocket  just wait a minute please said susanna the waiter retired  now then she resumed placing her elbows on the table let us have no more nonsense what is your little game are you going to pay that bill or am i  i am of course  there is no of course in itnot yet anyhow what are you hanging about the theatre after me for tell me that dont stop to think  marmaduke looked foolish and then sulky finally he brightened and said look here youre angry with me for bringing your brother last night but upon my soul i had no idea  thats not what i mean at all you are dodging a plain question when you came to the theatre i thought you were a nice fellow and i made friends with you now i find you have been telling me lies about yourself and trying to play fast and loose you must either give that up or give me up i wont have you pass that stage door again if you only want to amuse yourself like other lounging cads about town  what do you mean by playing fast and loose and being a cad about town said marmaduke angrily  i hope youre not going to make a row here in public  no but i have you where you cant make a row and i intend to have it out with you once and for all if you quarrel now so help me heaven ill never speak to you again  it is you who are quarrelling  very well said susanna opening her purse as though the matter were decided waiter  i am going to pay  so you canfor what you had yourself i dont take dinners from strange men nor pay for their ices  marmaduke did not reply he took out his purse determinedly glanced angrily at her and muttered i never thought you were that sort of woman  what sort of woman demanded susanna in a tone that made the other occupants of the room turn and stare  never mind said marmaduke she was about to retort when she saw him looking into his purse with an expression of dismay the waiter came susanna instead of attempting to be beforehand in proffering the money changed her mind and waited marmaduke searched his pockets finding nothing he muttered an imprecation and fingering his watch chain glanced doubtfully at the waiter who looked stolidly at the tablecloth  there said susanna putting down a sovereign  marmaduke looked on helplessly whilst the waiter changed the coin and thanked susanna for her gratuity then he said you must let me settle with you for this tonight ive left nearly all my cash in the pocket of another waistcoat  you will not have the chance of settling with me either tonight or any other night i am done with you and she rose and left the restaurant marmaduke sat doggedly for quarter of a minute then he went out and ran along regent street anxiously looking from face to face in search of her at last he saw her walking at a great pace a little distance ahead of him he made a dash and overtook her  look here lalage he said keeping up with her as she walked this is all rot i didnt mean to offend you i dont know what you mean or what you want me to do dont be so unreasonable  no answer  i can stand a good deal from you but its too much to be kept at your heels as if i were a beggar or a troublesome dog lalage she took no notice of him and he stopped trying to compose his features which were distorted by rage she walked on turning into glasshouse street when she had gone twenty yards she heard him striding behind her  if you wont stop and talk to me he said ill make you if anybody interferes with me ill smash him into jelly it would serve you right if i did the same to you  he put his hand on her arm and she instantly turned and struck him across the face knocking off his hat he who a moment before had been excited red and almost in tears was appalled there was a crowd in a moment and a cabman drew up close to the kerb with a calm conviction that his hansom would be wanted presently  how dare you put your hand on me you coward she exclaimed with remarkable crispness of utterance and energy of style who are you i dont know you where are the police she paused for a reply and a bracelet broken by the blow she had given him dropped on the pavement and was officiously picked up and handed to her by a battered old woman who shewed in every wrinkle her burning sympathy with woman turning at bay against man susanna looked at the broken bracelet and tears of vexation sprang to her eyes look at what youve done she cried holding out the bracelet in her left hand and shewing a scrape which had drawn blood on her right wrist for two pins id knock your head off  marmaduke quite out of countenance and yet sullenly very angry vacillated for a moment between his conflicting impulses to knock her down and to fly to the utmost ends of the earth if he had been ten years older he would probably have knocked her down as it was he signed to the cabman who gathered up the reins and held them clear of his fares damaged hat with the gratification of a man whose judgment in a delicate matter had just been signally confirmed by events  as they started susanna made a dash at the cab which was pulled up amid a shout from the crowd just in time to prevent an accident then holding on to the rail and standing on the step she addressed herself to the cabman and sacrificing all propriety of language to intensity of vituperation demanded whether he wanted to run his cab over her body and kill her he with undisturbed foresight answered not a word but again shifted the reins so as to make way for her bonnet acknowledging the attention with one more epithet she seated herself in the cab from which marmaduke at once indignantly rose to escape but the hardiest grasmere wrestler stooping under the hood of a hansom could not resist a vigorous pull at his coat tails and marmaduke was presently back in his seat again with susanna clinging to him and half sobbing  oh bob youve killed me how could you then with a suspiciously sudden recovery of energy she screamed bijou theatre drive on will you up at the cabman who was looking down through the trapdoor the horse plunged forward and with the jolt she was fawning on marmadukes arm again saying dont be brutal to me any more bob i cant bear it i have enough trouble without your turning on me  he was young and green and too much confused by this time to feel sure that he had not been the aggressor but he did on the whole the wisest thingfolded his arms and sat silent with his cheeks burning  say something to me she said shaking his arm i have nothing to say he replied i shall leave town for home tonight i cant shew my face again after this  home she said in her former contemptuous tone flinging his arm away that means your cousin constance  who told you about her  never mind you are engaged to her  you lie  susanna was shaken she looked hard at him wondering whether he was deceiving her or not look me in the face bob she said if he had complied she would not have believed him but he treated the challenge with supreme disdain and stared straight ahead obeying his male instinct which taught him that the woman with all the advantages on her side would nevertheless let him win if he held on at last she came caressingly to his shoulder again and said  why didnt you tell me about her yourself  damn it all he exclaimed violently there is nothing to tell i am not engaged to her on my oath i am not my people at home talk about a match between us as if it were a settled thing though they know i dont care for her but if you want to have the truth i cant afford to say that i wont marry her because i am too hard up to quarrel with the governor who has set his heart on it you see the way i am circumstanced  oh bother your circumstances look here bob i dont want you to introduce me to your swell relations it is not worth my while to waste time on people who cant earn their own living and never mind your governor we can get on without him if you are hard up for money and he is stingy you had better get it from me than from the jews  i couldnt do that said marmaduke touched in fact i am well enough off by the bye i must not forget to pay you for that lunch but if i ever am hard up i will come to you will that do  of course that is what i meant confound it here we are already you mustnt come in you would only be in the way come tonight after the burlesque if you like youre not angry with me are you  her breast touched his arm just then and as if she had released some spring all his love for her suddenly surged up within him and got the better of him waitlisten he said in a voice half choked with tenderness look here lalage the honest truth is that i shall be ruined if i marry you openly let us be married quietly and keep it dark until i am more independent  married catch me at itif you can no dear boy i am very fond of you and you are one of the right sort to make me the offer but i wont let you put a collar round my neck matrimony is all very fine for women who have no better way of supporting themselves but it wouldnt suit me dont look so dazed what difference does it make to you  but he stopped bewildered gazing at her  get out you great goose she said and suddenly sprang out of the hansom and darted into the theatre  he sat gaping after her horrifiedgenuinely horrified     chapter iii   the earl of carbury was a youngish man with no sort of turn for being a nobleman he could not bring himself to behave as if he was anybody in particular and though this passed for perfect breeding whenever he by chance appeared in his place in society on the magisterial bench or in the house of lords it prevented him from making the most of the earldom and was a standing grievance with his relatives many of whom were the most impudent and uppish people on the face of the earth he was if he had only known it a born republican with no natural belief in earls at all but as he was rather too modest to indulge his consciousness with broad generalizations of this kind all he knew about the matter was that he was sensible of being a bad hand at his hereditary trade of territorial aristocrat at a very early age he had disgraced himself by asking his mother whether he might be a watchmaker when he grew up and his feeble sense on that occasion of the impropriety of an earl being anything whatsoever except an earl had given his mother an imperious contempt for him which afterward got curiously mixed with a salutary dread of his moral superiority to her which was considerable his aspiration to become a watchmaker was an early symptom of his extraordinary turn for mechanics an apprenticeship of six years at the bench would have made an educated workman of him as it was he pottered at every mechanical pursuit as a gentleman amateur in a laboratory and workshop which he had got built for himself in his park in this magazine of toysfor such it virtually was at firsthe satisfied his itchings to play with tools and machines he was no sportsman but if he saw in a shop window the most trumpery patent improvement in a breechloader he would go in and buy it and as to a new repeating rifle or liquefied gas gun he would travel to st petersburg to see it he wrote very little but he had sixteen different typewriters each guaranteed perfect by an american agent who had also pledged himself that the other fifteen were miserable impostures a really ingenious bicycle or tricycle always found in him a ready purchaser and he had patented a roller skate and a railway brake when the electric chair for dental operations was invented he sacrificed a tooth to satisfy his curiosity as to its operation he could not play brass instruments to any musical purpose but his collection of double slide trombones bombardons with patent compensating pistons comma trumpets and the like would have equipped a small military band whilst his newly tempered harmonium with fiftythree notes to each octave and his pianos with simplified keyboards that nobody could play on were the despair of all musical amateurs who came to stay at towers cottage as his place was called he would buy the most expensive and elaborate lathe and spend a month trying to make a true billiard ball at it at the end of that time he would have to send for a professional hand who would cornet the ball with apparently miraculous skill in a few seconds he got on better with chemistry and photography but at last he settled down to electrical engineering and giving up the idea of doing everything with his own halftrained hand kept a skilled man always in his laboratory to help him out  all along there had been a certain love of the marvelous at the bottom of his fancy for inventions therefore though he did not in the least believe in ghosts he would investigate spiritualism and part with innumerable guineas to mediums slatewriters clairvoyants and even of turbaned rascals from the east who would boldly offer at midnight to bring him out into the back yard and there and then raise the devil for him and just as his tendency was to magnify the success and utility of his patent purchases so he would lend himself more or less to gross impostures simply because they interested him this confirmed his reputation for being a bit of a crank and as he had in addition all the restlessness and eccentricity of the active spirits of his class arising from the fact that no matter what he busied himself with it never really mattered whether he accomplished it or not he remained an unsatisfied and considering the money he cost unsatisfactory specimen of a true man in a false position  towers cottage was supposed to be a mere appendage to carbury towers which had been burnt down to the great relief of its noble owners in the reign of william iv the cottage a handsome onestoried tudor mansion with tall chimneys gabled roofs and transom windows had since served the family as a very sufficient residence needing a much smaller staff of servants than the towers and accommodating fewer visitors at first it had been assumed on all hands that the stay at the cottage was but a temporary one pending the reerection of the towers on a scale of baronial magnificence but this tradition having passed through its primal stage of being a standing excuse with the elders into that of being a standing joke with the children had naturally lapsed as the children grew up indeed the cottage was now too large for the family for the earl was still unmarried and all his sisters had contracted splendid alliances except the youngest lady constance carbury a maiden of twentytwo with a thin face and slight angular figure who was still on her mothers hands the illustrious matches made by her sisters had in fact been secured by extravagant dowering which had left nothing for poor lady constance except a miserable three hundred pounds a year at which paltry figure no man had as yet offered to take her the countess dowager habitually assumed that marmaduke lind ardently desired the hand of his cousin and constance herself supported tacitly this view but the earl was apt to become restive when it was put forward though he altogether declined to improve his sisters pecuniary position having already speculated quite heavily enough in brothersinlaw  in the august following the wandsworth concert lord carbury began to take his electrical laboratory with such intensified seriousness that he flatly refused to entertain any visitors until the 12th and held fast to his determination in spite of his mothers threat to leave the house alleging with a laugh that he had got hold of a discovery with money in it at last but he felt at such a disadvantage after this incredible statement that he hastened to explain that his objection to visitors did not apply to relatives who would be sufficiently at home at towers cottage to require no attention from him under the terms of this capitulation marian as universal favorite was invited and since there was no getting marian down without elinor she was invited too in spite of the countesss strong dislike for her a sentiment which she requited with a pungent mixture of detestation and contempt marians brother the reverend george lind promised to come down in a day or two and marmaduke who was also invited did not reply  the morning after her arrival marian was awakened at six oclock by a wagon rumbling past the window of her room with a sound quite different from that made by the dustcart in westbourne terrace she peeped out at it and saw that is was laden with packages of irregular shape which judging by some strangelooking metal rods that projected through the covering she took to be apparatus for lord jaspers laboratory from the wagon with its patiently trudging horse and dull driver she lifted her eyes to the lawn where the patches of wet shadow beneath the cedars refreshed the sunlit grass around them it looked too fine a morning to spend in bed had marian been able to taste and smell the fragrant country air she would not have hesitated a moment but she had been accustomed to believe that fresh air was unhealthy at night and though nothing would have induced her to wash in dirty water she thought nothing of breathing dirty air and so the window was shut and the room close still the window did not exclude the loud singing of the birds or the sunlight she ventured to open it a little not without a sense of imprudence twenty minutes later she was dressed  she first looked into the drawingroom but it was stale and dreary the diningroom which she tried next made her hungry the arrival of a servant with a broom suggested to her that she had better get out of the way of the household work she felt half sorry for getting up and went out on the lawn to recover her spirits there she heard a mans voice trolling a stave somewhere in the direction of the laboratory thinking that it might be lord carbury and that if so he would probably not wait until half past nine to break his fast she ran gaily off round the southwest corner of the cottage to a terrace from which there was access through a great double window now wide open to a lofty apartment roofed with glass  at a large table in the middle of the room sat a man with his back to the window he had taken off his coat and was bending over a small round block with little holes sunk into it each hole was furnished with a neat brass peg topped with ebony and the man was lifting and replacing one of these pegs whilst he gravely watched the dial of an instrument that resembled a small clock a large straw hat concealed his head and protected it from the rays that were streaming through the glass roof and open window the apparent triviality of his occupation and his intentness upon it amused marian she stole into the laboratory came close behind him and said  since you have nothing better to do than play cribbage with yourself i  she had gently lifted up his straw hat and found beneath a head that was not lord carburys the man who had cowered with surprise at her touch and voice but had waited even then to finish an observation of his galvanometer before turning now turned and stared at her  i beg your pardon said marian blushing vigorously i thought it was lord carbury i have disturbed you very rudely i  not at all said the man i quite understand i was not playing cribbage but i was doing nothing very important however as you certainly did take me by surprise perhaps you will excuse my coat  oh pray dont mind me i must not interrupt your work she looked at his face again but only for an instant as he was watching her then with another blush she put out her hand and said how do you do mr conolly i did not recognize you at first  he shook hands but did not offer any further conversation what a wonderful place she said looking round with a view to making herself agreeable by taking an interest in everything wont you explain it all to me to begin with what is electricity  conolly stared rather at this question and then shook his head i dont know anything about that he said i am only a workman perhaps lord carbury can tell you he has read a good deal about it  marian looked incredulously at him i am sure you are joking she said lord carbury says you know ever so much more than he does i suppose i asked a stupid question what are those reels of green silk for  ah said conolly relaxing come now i can tell you that easily enough i dont know what it is but i know what it does and i can lay traps to catch it here now for instance  and he went on to deliver a sort of chatty royal institution childrens lecture on electricity which produced a great impression on marian who was accustomed to nothing better than small talk she longed to interest him by her comments and questions but she found that they had a most discouraging effect on him redoubling her efforts she at last reduced him to silence of which she availed herself to remark with great earnestness that science was a very wonderful thing  how do you know he said a little bluntly  i am sure it must be she replied brightening for she thought he had now made a rather foolish remark is lord carbury a very clever scientist  conolly looked just grave enough to suggest that the question was not altogether a discreet one then brushing off that consideration he replied  he has seen a great deal and read a great deal you see he has great means at his disposal his property is as good as a jointstock company at his back practically he is very good considering his method of working not so good considering the means at his disposal  what would you do if you had his means  conolly made a gesture which plainly signified that he thought he could do a great many things  and is science then so expensive i thought it was beyond the reach of money  oh yes science may be but i am not a scientific man im an inventor the two things are quite different invention is the most expensive thing in the world it takes no end of time and no end of money time is money so it costs both ways  then why dont you discover something and make your fortune  i have already discovered something  oh what is it  that it costs a fortune to make experiments enough to lead to an invention  you are exaggerating are you not what do you mean by a fortune  in my case at least four or five hundred pounds  is that all surely you would have no difficulty in getting five hundred pounds  conolly laughed to be sure said he what is five hundred pounds  a mere nothingconsidering the importance of the object you really ought not to allow such a consideration as that to delay your career i have known people spend as much in one day on the most worthless things  there is something in that miss lind how would you recommend me to begin  first said marian with determination make up your mind to spend the money banish all scruples about the largeness of the sum resolve not to grudge even twice as much to science  that is done already i have quite made up my mind to spend the money what next  well i suppose the next thing is to spend it  excuse me the next thing is to get it it is a mere detail i know but i should like to settle it before we go any further  but how can i tell you that you forget that i am quite unacquainted with your affairs you are a man and understand business which of course i dont  if you wanted five hundred pounds miss lind how would you set about getting itif i may ask  what i but as i say i am only a woman i should ask my father for it or sign a receipt for my trustees or something of that sort  that is a very simple plan but unfortunately i have no father and no trustees worse than that i have no money you must suggest some other way  do what everybody else does in your circumstances borrow it i am sure lord carbury would lend it to you  conolly shook his head it doesnt do for a man in my position to start borrowing the moment he makes the acquaintance of a man in lord carburys he said we are working a little together already on one of my ideas and that is as far as i care to ask him to go i am afraid i must ask you for another suggestion  save up all your money until you have enough  that would take some time let me see as i am an exceptionally fortunate and specially skilled workman i can now calculate on making from seventy shillings to six pounds a week say four pounds on the average  ah said marian despondingly you would have to wait more than two years to save five hundred pounds  and to dispense with food clothes and lodging in the meantime  true said marian of course i see that it is impossible for you to save anything and yet it seems absurd to be stopped by the want of such a sum i have a cousin who has no money at all and no experiments to make and he paid a thousand pounds for a racehorse last spring  conolly nodded to intimate that he knew that such things happened  marian could think of no further expedient she stood still thinking whilst conolly took up a bit of waste and polished a brass cylinder  mr conolly she said at last i cannot absolutely promise you but i think i can get you five hundred pounds conolly stopped polishing the cylinder and stared at her if i have not enough i am sure we could make the rest by a bazaar or something i should like to begin to invest my money and if you make some great invention like the telegraph or steam engine you will be able to pay it back to me and to lend me money when i want it  conolly blushed thank you miss lind said he thank you very much indeed iit would be ungrateful of me to refuse but i am not so ready to begin my experiments as my talking might lead you to suppose my estimate of their cost was a mere guess i am not satisfied that it is not want of time and perseverance more than of money that is the real obstacle however i willi willahave you any idea of the value of money miss lind have you ever had the handling of it  of course said marian secretly thinking that the satisfaction of shaking his selfpossession was cheap at five hundred pounds i keep house at home and do all sorts of business things  conolly glanced about him vaguely picked up the piece of waste again as if he had been looking for that recollected himself and looked unintelligibly at her her uncertainty as to what he would do next was a delightful sensation why she did not know nor care to her intense disappointment lord carbury entered just then and roused her from what was unaccountably like a happy dream  nothing more of any importance happened that day except the arrival of a letter from paris addressed to lady constance in marmadukes handwriting miss mcquinch first heard of it in the fruit garden where she found constance sitting with her arm around marians waist in a summerhouse she sat down opposite them at a rough oak table  a letter nelly said marian a letter a letter from marmaduke i have extorted leave for you to read it here it is handle it carefully pray  has he proposed said elinor taking it  constance changed color elinor opened the letter in silence and read    my dear constance    i hope you are quite well i am having an awfully jolly time of it   here what a pity it is you dont come over i was wishing for you   yesterday in the louvre where we spent a pleasant day looking at   the pictures i send you the silk you wanted and had great trouble   hunting through halfadozen shops for it not that i mind the   trouble but just to let you see my devotion to you i have no more   to say at present as it is nearly post hour remember me to the   clan                                                 yours ever                                                          duke    pshow do nelly and your mother get along together  whilst elinor was reading the gardener passed the summerhouse and constance went out and spoke to him elinor looked significantly at marian  nelly returned marian in hushed tones of reproach you have stabbed poor constance to the heart by telling her that marmaduke never proposed to her that is why she has gone out  yes said elinor it was brutal but i thought as you made such a fuss about the letter that it must have been a proposal at least it cant be helped now it is one more enemy for me that is all  what do you think of the letter was it not kind of him to writeconsidering how careless he is usually  hm did he match the silk properly  to perfection he must really have taken some trouble you know how he botched getting the ribbon for his fancy dress at the ball last year  that is just what i was thinking about do you remember also how he ridiculed the louvre after his first trip to paris and swore that nothing would ever induce him to enter it again  he has got more sense now he says in the letter that he spent yesterday there  not exactly he says we spent a pleasant day looking at the pictures who is we  some companion of his i suppose why  i was just thinking could it be the person who has matched the silk so well the same woman i mean  oh nelly  oh marian do you suppose marmaduke would spend an afternoon at the louvre with a man who could just as well go by himself do men match silks  of course they do any flyfisher can do it better than a woman really nell you have an odious imagination  yeswhen my imagination is started on an odious track nothing will persuade me that marmaduke cares a straw for constance he does not want to marry her though he is too great a coward to own it  why do you say so i grant you he is unceremonious and careless but he is the same to everybody  yes to everybody we know what is the use of straining after an amiable view of things marian when a cynical view is most likely to be the true one  there is no harm in giving people credit for being good  yes there is when people are not good which is most often the case it sets us wrong practically and holds virtue cheap if marmaduke is a noble and warmhearted man and constance a lovable innocent girl all i can say is that it is not worth while to be noble or lovable if amiability consists in maintaining that black is white it is a quality anyone may acquire by telling a lie and sticking to it  but i dont maintain that black is white only it seems to me that as regards white you are color blind where i see white you see black andhush here is constance  yes whispered elinor she comes back quickly enough when it occurs to her that we are talking about her  instead of simply asking why constance should not behave in this very natural manner if she chose to marian was about to defend constance warmly by denying all motive to her return when that event took place and stopped the discussion marian and nelly spent a considerable part of their lives in bandying their likes and dislikes under the impression that they were arguing important points of character and conduct  they knew that constance wanted to answer marmadukes letter so they alleged correspondence of their own and left her to herself  lady constance went to her brothers study where there was a comfortable writingtable she began to write without hesitation and her pen gabbled rapidly until she had covered two sheets of paper when instead of taking a fresh sheet she wrote across the lines already written after signing the letter she read it through and added two postscripts then she remembered something she had forgotten to say but there was no more room on her two sheets and she was reluctant to use a third which might in a letter to france involve extra postage whilst she was hesitating her brother entered  am i in your way she said i shall have done in a moment  no i am not going to write bythebye they tell me you had a letter from marmaduke this morning has he anything particular to say  nothing very particular he is in paris  indeed are you writing to him  yes said constance irritated by his disparaging tone why not  do as you please of course i am afraid he is a scamp  are you you know a great deal about him i dare say  i am not much reassured by those who do know about him  and who may they be the only person you know who has seen much of him is marian and she doesnt speak ill of people behind their backs  marian takes rather a rosecolored view of everybody marmaduke included you should talk to nelly about him  i knew it i knew the minute you began to talk who had set you on  i am afraid nellys opinion is worth more than marians  her opinion everybody knows what her opinion is she is bursting with jealousy of me  jealousy  what else marmaduke has never taken the least notice of her and she is madly in love with him  this is quite a new light upon the affair constance are you sure you are not romancing  romancing why she cannot conceal her venom she taunted me this morning in the summerhouse because marmaduke has never made me a formal proposal it was the letter that made her do it ask marian  i can hardly believe it i should not have supposed from what i have observed that she cared about him  you should not have supposed it from what she said is that what you mean i dont care whether you believe it or not  well if you are so confident there is no occasion to be acrimonious about elinor she is more to be pitied than blamed  yes everybody is to pity elinor because she cant have her wish and make me wretched said constance beginning to cry whereupon lord carbury immediately left the room     chapter iv   long before the harvest was home preparations were made at towers cottage to receive another visitor the rev george lind was coming lord carbury drove in the wagonet to the railway station and met him on the platform  how are you my dear fellow cried the clergyman shaking the earls hand why did you trouble to meet me i could have taken a fly most kind of you i am sure how is your dear mother and constance how is she  all quite well thank you just show my fellow your traps he will see to them  oh there is no need to trouble him i myself or a porteroh thank you i am sure the brown one with gl on itand that small green metal box too if you will be so good thank you very much and how are you jasper if i may call you so studious still eh i hope he will be careful of the box no not a word to him i beg it does not matter at all what a charming little trap what air happy man jasper these fields are better than the close alleys and garrets to which my profession leads me  jump in  thank you and how is marian  quite well thank you everybody is quite well the girls are at a tennis party or they would have come to meet you constance desired me particularly to apologize  oh needless most needless why should they not enjoy themselves what a landscape the smiling beauty of nature in the country is like alike a message to us this is indeed a delightful drive  yes she is a capital trotter this mare of mine what do you think of her  a noble animal jasper although i never studied horseflesh much even in my university days i can admire a spirited nag on occasion but i have to content myself with humbler means of locomotion in my own calling a poor parson cannot entertain his friends as a magnate like you can have you any one at the hall now besides the girls  no the place will be rather dull for you i am afraid  not at all my dear fellow not at all i shall be satisfied and thankful under all circumstances  we have led a humdrum life for the past month marian and elinor have begun to potter about in my laboratory they come there every day for an hour to work and study as they call it  indeed i have no doubt marian will find the study of nature most improving it is very generous of you to allow her to trespass on you  i occupy myself chiefly with nelly mcquinch marian is my assistants pupil and he has made a very expert workwoman of her already with a little direction she can put a machine together as well as i can  i am delighted to hear it and dear nelly  oh dear nelly treats the subject in her usual way but she is very amusing  ah jasper ah an unstable nature there an unstable nature elinor has not been firmly trained she needs to be tried by adversity  no doubt she will be most of us are  and dear constance does she study  no  ahem ahave you that is st mildreds yonder is it not  it is they have put a new clock in the tower worth about sixty pounds i believe they collected a hundred and fifty for the purpose but you were going to say something else  no at least i intended to ask you about marmaduke he is coming down i understand  i dont know what he is doing last week he wrote to us that he had just returned from paris but i happened to know that he had then been back for some time he has arranged to come twice but on each occasion at the last moment he has made excuses he can do as he likes now i wish he would say definitely that he doesnt intend to come instead of shillyshallying from week to week hallo prentice have the ladies returned yet this was addressed to the keeper of the gatelodge at which they had now arrived he replied that the ladies were still absent  then said lord carbury we had better get down and stroll across the lawn perhaps you are tired though  not at all i should prefer it what a lovely avenue what greenery how  we were talking about marmaduke do you know what he is doing at present he talks of being busy and of not having a moment to spare i can understand a fellow not having a moment to spare in june or july but what marmaduke has to do in london in september is more than i can imagine  i do not care to enquire into these things too closely i had intended to speak to you on the subject marmaduke as i suppose you know has taken a house at west kensington  a house at west kensington no i did not know it what has he done that for  i fear he has been somewhat disingenuous with me on the subject i think he tried to prevent the matter coming to my ears and when i asked him about it he certainly impliedin fact i grieve to say he left me under the impression that he had taken the house with a view to marrying dear constance and settling down i expressed some surprise at his going so far out of town but he did not volunteer any further explanation and so the matter dropped the rev george paused and then continued in a lower tone not long afterward i met him at a very late hour he had perhaps exceeded a little in his cups for he spoke to me with the most shocking cynicism inviting me to supper at this house of his and actually accusing me of knowing perfectly well the terrible truth about his occupation of it he assured me that shemeaning i presume the unhappy person with whom he lives therewas exceptionally attractive and i have since discovered that she is connected with the theatre and of great notoriety i need not tell you how dreadful all this is to me jasper but to the best of my judgment which i have fortified by earnest prayers for guidance it is my imperative duty to tell you of it  the vagabond it is exactly as i have always said constance is too tame for him he does not care a d  jasper my dear fellow gently said the clergyman pressing his arm  pshaw said the earl i dont care i think constance is well out of it let us drop the subject for the present i hear the carriage  yes here it is dear lady carbury has recognized me and is waving her hand the rev george stood on tiptoe as he spoke and flourished his lowcrowned soft felt hat  during the ensuing greetings carbury stood silent looking at the horses with an expression that made the coachman uneasy at dinner he ate sedulously and left the task of entertaining the visitor to his mother and the girls the clergyman was at no loss for conversation he was delighted with the dinner delighted with the house delighted to see the countess looking so well and delighted to hear that the tennis party that day had been a pleasant one the earl listened with impatience and was glad when his mother rose before she quitted the diningroom he made a sign to her and she soon returned leaving marian constance and elinor in the drawingroom  you will not mind my staying i hope george she said as she resumed her seat  a delightful precedent and from a distinguished source said the rev george allow me to pass the bottle ha ha  thank you no said the countess i never take wine her tone was inconclusive as if she intended to take something else  will you take brandyandsoda said her son rather brusquely  lady carbury lowered her eyelids in protest then she said a very little if you please jasper i dare not touch wine she continued to the clergyman i am the slave of my medical man in all matters relating to my unfortunate digestion  mother said jasper george has brought us a nice piece of news concerning your pet marmaduke  the clergyman became solemn and looked steadily at his glass  i do not know that it is fair to describe him as my pet exactly said the countess a little troubled i trust there is nothing unpleasant the matter  oh nothing he has settled down domestically in a mansion at west kensington that is all  what married  unhappily said the rev george no not married  oh said the countess slowly as an expression of relief it is very shocking of course very wrong indeed young men will do these things it is especially foolish in marmadukes case for he really cannot afford to make any settlement such as this kind of complication usually involves when the time comes for getting rid of it pray do not let it come to constances ears it is not a proper subject for a girl  quite as proper a subject as marriage with a fellow like marmaduke said jasper rising coolly and lighting a cigaret however it will be time enough to trouble about that when there is any sign of his having the slightest serious intentions toward constance for my part i dont believe and i never did believe that there was anything real in the business this last move of his proves itto my satisfaction at any rate  lady carbury with a slight but impressive bridling and yet with an evident sense of discomfiture proceeded to assert herself before the clergyman i beg you will control yourself jasper she said i do not like to be spoken to in that tone in discharging the very great responsibility which rests with a mother i am compelled to take the world as i find it and to acknowledge that certain very deplorable tendencies must be allowed for in society you in the solitude of your laboratory contemplate an ideal state of things that we all i am sure long for but which unhappily does not exist i have never enquired into marmadukes private life and i think you ought not to have done so i could not disguise from myself the possibility of his having entered into some such relations as those you have alluded to  jasper without the slightest appearance of having heard this speech strolled casually out of the room the countess baffled turned to her sympathetic guest  i am sure that you george must feel that it is absolutely necessary for us to keep this matter to ourselves  the rev george said gravely i do not indeed see what blessing can rest on our interference in such an inexpressibly shocking business it is for marmaduke to wrestle with his own conscience  quite so said the countess shrugging her shoulders as if to invite her absent sons attention to this confirmation of her judgment is it not absurd of jasper to snatch at such an excuse for breaking off the match  i can sympathize with jaspers feeling i trust it is natural for a candid nature to recoil from duplicity but all our actions need charitable construction and remembering that we should take heed to prevent our forebearance toward others from wavering who knows that the alliance with your pure and lovely daughter may not be the means specially ordained to rescue him from his present condition  i think it very possible drawled the countess looking at him nevertheless with a certain contempt for what she privately considered his priggish underbred cant besides such things are recognized though of course they are not spoken of no lady could with common decency pretend to know that such connexions are possible much less assign one of them as a reason for breaking off an engagement  pardon me said the rev george but can these worldly considerations add anything to the approval of our consciences i think not we will keep our own counsel in this matter in the sight of heaven then whatever the world may think all will surely come right in the end  oh it is sure to come right in the end these wretched businesses always do i cannot imagine men having such low tastesas if there were anything in these women more than in anybody else come into the drawingroom george  they went into the drawingroom and found it deserted the ladies were in the veranda the countess took up the paper and composed herself for a nap george went into the porch where the girls having seen the sun go down were now watching the deepening gloom among the trees that skirted the lawn marian proposed that they should walk through the plantation whilst there was still a little light left and the clergyman readily assented he rather repented of this when they got into the deep gloom under the trees and elinor began to tell stories about adders wild cats poachers and anything else that could possibly make a nervous man uncomfortable under such circumstances he was quite relieved when they saw the spark of a cigaret ahead of them and heard the voices of jasper and conolly coming toward them through the darkness  oh i believe i have had the pleasure of meeting mr conolly said the rev george formally when they met i am glad to see you  thank you said conolly if you ladies have thin shoes on as usual we had better come out of this  as we ladies happen to have our boots on said marian we shall stay as long as we like  nevertheless they soon turned homeward and as the path was narrow they walked in pairs the clergyman with constance led the way lord jasper followed with elinor conolly and marian came last  does that young manmr conollylive at the hall was the rev georges first remark to constance  no he has rooms in rose cottage that little place on quilters farm  ha then he is very well off here  a great deal too well off jasper allows him to speak to him as though he were an equal however i suppose jasper knows his own business best  i have observed that he is rather disposed to presume upon any encouragement he receives it is a bad sign in a young man and one i fear that will greatly interfere with his prospects  he is an american and i suppose thinks it a fine thing to be republican but it is jaspers fault he spoils him he once wanted to have him in the drawingroom in the evenings to play accompaniments but mamma positively refused to allow it jasper is excessively obstinate and though he did not make a fuss he got quite a habit of going over to rose cottage and spending his evenings there singing and playing everybody about the place used to notice it mamma was greatly disgusted  do you find him unpleasantpersonally i mean  i oh dear no i should never dream of speaking to him his presence is unpleasant because he exercises a bad influence on jasper so i wish on that account alone that he would go  i trust marian is careful to limit her intercourse with him as much as possible  well marian learns electricity from him and of course that makes a difference i do not care about such things and i never go into the laboratory when he is there so i do not know whether marian lets him be familiar with her or not she is rather easygoing and he is insufferably conceited however if she wants to learn electricity i suppose she must put up with him he is no worse after all than the rest of the people one has to learn things from they are all impossible  it is a strange fancy of the girls to study science  i am sure i dont know why they do it it is great nonsense for jasper to do it either he will never keep up his position properly until he shuts up that stupid workshop he ought to hunt and shoot and entertain a great deal more than he does it is very hard on us for we are altogether in jaspers hands for such matters i think he is very foolish  not foolish dont say that excuse my giving you a little lecture but it is not right to speak even without thought of your brother as a fool no doubt he is a little injudicious but all men are not called to the same pursuits  if people have a certain position they ought to make up their minds to the duties of their position whether they are called to them or not  the rev george missing the deference with which ladies not related to him usually received his admonitions changed the subject  meanwhile conolly and marian walking more slowly than the rest had fallen far behind they had been silent at first she seemed to be in trouble at last after some wistful glances at him she said  have you resolved to go to london tomorrow or will you wait until friday  tomorrow miss lind can i do anything for you in town  marian hesitated painfully  do not mind giving me plenty of bother he said i am so accustomed to superintend the transit of machines as cumbersome as trunks and as fragile as bonnet boxes that the care of a houseful of ordinary luggage would be a mere amusement for me  thank you but it is not that i was only thinkingare you likely to see my cousin mr marmaduke lind whilst you are in london  nno unless i call upon him which i have no excuse for doing  oh i thought you knew him  i met him at that concert  but i thought you were in the habit of going about with him at least i understood him one day to say that you had been to the theatre together  so we were but only once we went there after the concert and i have never seen him since  oh indeed i quite mistook  if you have any particular reason for wishing me to see him i will it will be all right if i have a message from you shall i call on him it will be no trouble to me  no oh no i wantedit was something that could only be told to him indirectly by an intimate friendby some one with influence over him more a hint than anything else but it does not matter at least it cannot be helped  conolly did not speak until they had gone some thirty yards or so in silence then he said if the matter is of serious importance to you miss lind i think i can manage to have a message conveyed to him by a person who has influence over him i am not absolutely certain that i can but probably i shall succeed without any great difficulty  marian looked at him in some surprise i hardly know what i ought to do she said doubtfully  then do nothing said conolly bluntly or if you want anything said to this gentleman write to him yourself  but i dont know his address and my brother says i ought not to write to him i dont think i ought either but i want him to be told something that may prevent a great deal of unhappiness it seems so unfeeling to sit down quietly and say it is not my business to interfere when the mischief might so easily be prevented  i advise you to be very cautious miss lind taking care of other peoples happiness is thankless and dangerous you dont know your cousins address you say  no i thought you did  conolly shook his head who does know it he said  my brother george does but he refused to tell me i shall not ask him again  of course not i can find it out for you but of what use will that be since you think you ought not to write to him  i assure you mr conolly that if it only concerned myself i would not hesitate to tell you the whole story and ask your advice i feel sure you would shew me what was right but this is a matter which concerns other people only  then you have my advice without telling me dont meddle in it  but  but what  after all what i wish to do could not possibly bring about mischief if marmaduke could be given a hint to come down here at oncehe has been invited and is putting off his visit from week to weekit would be sufficient he will get into trouble if he makes any more excuses and he can set everything right by coming down now  are you sure you dont mean only that he can smooth matters over for the present  no you mistake it is not so much to smooth matters over as to rescue him from a bad influence that is ruining him there is a person in london from whom he must he got away at all hazards if you only knewi wish you knew  perhaps i know more than you suppose come miss lind let us understand one another your family want your cousin to marry lady constance i know that she does not object i know that too he does  oh exclaimed marian you are wrong he does not  anyhow continued conolly he acts with a certain degree of indifference toward herkeeps away at present for instance i infer that the bad influence you have mentioned is the cause of his remissness  yes you are right only looking at it all from without as you do you are mistaken as to marmadukes character he is easily led away and very careless about the little attentions that weigh so much with women but he is thoroughly honorable and incapable of trifling with lady constance unfortunately he is easily imposed on and impatient of company in which he cannot be a little uproarious i fear that somebody has taken advantage of this part of his character to establish a great ascendency over him ihere marian became nervous and controlled her voice with difficultyi saw this person once in a theatre and i can imagine how she would fascinate marmaduke she was so clever so handsome andand so utterly abominable i was angry with duke for bringing us to the place and i remember now that he was angry with me because i said she made me shudder  utterly abominable is a strong thing for one woman to say of another said conolly with a certain sternness however i can understand your having that feeling about her i know her and it is through her that i hope to find out his address for you  but her address is his address now mr conolly i think it is somewhere in west kensington  conolly stopped and turned upon her so suddenly that she recoiled a step frightened  since when pray  very lately i think i do not know  they neither moved nor spoke for some moments she earnestly regretting that she had lingered so far behind her companions in the terrible darkness he walked on at last faster than before no more words passed between them until they came out into the moonlight close to the veranda then he stopped again and took off his hat  permit me to leave you now he said with an artificial politeness worthy of douglas himself goodnight  goodnight faltered marian  he walked gravely away marian hurried into the veranda where she found jasper and elinor the other couple had gone into the drawingroom  hallo said jasper where is conolly i want to say a word to him before he goes  he has just gone said marian pointing across the lawn jasper immediately ran out in the direction indicated and left the two cousins alone together  well marian said elinor do you know that you have taken more than quarter of an hour longer to come from the plantation than we did and that you look quite scared our sweet constance as the parson calls her has been making some kind remarks about it  do i look disturbed i hope auntie wont notice it i wish i could go straight to bed without seeing anybody  why what is the matter  i will tell you tonight when you come in to me i am disgusted with myself and i think conolly is mad  mad  on my word i think conolly has gone mad said lord jasper returning at this moment out of breath and laughing  elinor startled glanced at marian  he was walking quite soberly toward the fence of the yellow field when i caught sight of him just as i was about to hail him he started off and cleared the fence at a running jump he walked away at a furious rate swinging his arms about and laughing as if he was enjoying some uncommonly good joke i am not sure that i did not see him dance a hornpipe but as it is so dark i wont swear to that  you had better not said elinor sceptically let us go in and pray do not encourage george to talk i have a headache and want to go to bed  you have been in very good spirits considering your headache he replied in the same incredulous tone it has come on rather suddenly has it not  when they went into the drawingroom they found that constance had awakened her mother and had already given her an account of their walk jasper added a description of what he had just witnessed i have not laughed so much for a long time he said in conclusion he is usually such a steady sort of fellow  i see nothing very amusing in the antics of a drunken workman said the countess how you could have left marian in his care even for a moment i am at a loss to conceive  he was not drunk indeed said marian  certainly not said jasper rather indignantly i was walking with him for some time before we met the girls you are very pale marian have you also a headache  i have been playing tennis all day and i am quite tired out  soon afterward when marian was in bed and miss mcquinch according to a nightly custom of theirs was seated on the coverlet with her knees doubled up to her chin inside her bedgown they discussed the adventure very earnestly  dont understand him at all i confess said elinor when marian had related what had passed in the plantation wasnt it rather rash to make a confidant of him in such a delicate matter  that is what makes me feel so utterly ashamed he might have known that i only wanted to do good i thought he was so entirely above false delicacy  i dont mean that how do you know that the story is true you only have it from mrs leith fairfaxs letter and she is perhaps the greatest liar in the world  oh nelly you ought not to talk so strongly about people she would never venture to tell me a madeup tale about marmaduke  in my opinion she would tell anybody anything for the sake of using her tongue or pen  it is so hard to know what to do there was nobody whom i could trust was there jasper has always been against marmaduke and constance of course was out of the question there was auntie but i did not like to tell her  because she is an evilminded old jezebel whom no nice woman would talk to on such a subject said elinor giving the bed a kick with her heel  hush nelly i am always in terror lest you should say something like that before other people out of sheer habit  never fear well you have done the best you could no use regretting what cannot be recalled you cannot have the security of conventionality along with the selfrespect of sincerity by the bye do you remember that jasper and his fond mamma and george had a family council after dinner you may be sure that george has told them everything  what then my wretched attempt to have marmaduke warned was useless oh nelly this is too bad do you really think so when i told him before dinner what mrs leith fairfax wrote he only said he feared it was true and refused to give me the address  and so threw you back on conolly i am glad the responsibility rests with george he knew very well that it was true for he had only just been telling jasper jasper told me as much in the plantation master georgy has no right to be your brother he is worse than a dissenter dissenters try to be gentlemen but george has no misgivings about himself on that score so he gives his undivided energy to his efforts to be parsonic he is an arrant hypocrite  i dont think he is a hypocrite i think he sincerely believes that his duty to the church requires him to behave as he does  then he is a donkey which is worse  i wish he were more natural in his manner  he is natural enough it is always the same with parsons it is their nature to goodnight men are all the same my dear all the same  how do you mean  never mind goodnight     chapter v   a little removed from a pretty road in west kensington and communicating with it by a shrubbery and an iron gate there stood at this time a detached villa called laurel grove on the opposite side were pairs of recently built houses many of them still unlet these without depriving the neighbourhood of its suburban quietude forbade any feeling of rustic seclusion and so made it agreeable to susanna conolly who lived at laurel grove with marmaduke lind  one morning in september they were at breakfast together beside each was a pile of letters marmaduke deferred opening his until his hunger was satisfied but susanna after pouring out tea for him seized the uppermost envelope thrust her little finger under the flap and burst it open  hm she said first rehearsal next monday here he is at me again to make the engagement renewable after christmas what an old fool he must be not to guess why i dont want to be engaged next spring just look at the times bob and see if the piece is advertized yet  i should think so by jupiter said marmaduke patiently interrupting his meal to open the newspaper  here is a separate advertisement for everybody the latest parisian success la petite maison du roi music by m de jongleur mr faulkner has the honor to announce that an adaptation by mr cribbs of m de jongleurs opera bouffe la petite maison du roi entitled king lewis on the lewiswhat the deuce does that mean  on the loose of course  but it is spelt lewoh its a pun what an infernal piece of idiocy then it goes on as usual except that each name in the cast has a separate line of large print here you are lalage virtue as madame dubarry  is that at the top  yes  before rose stella  yes whyi didnt notice it beforeyou are down fifteen times every alternate space has your name over again lalage virtue as madame dubarry fred smith as louis xv lalage virtue as the dubarry felix sumner as the due de richelieu lalage virtue as la belle jeanneton by the way that is all rot cardinal richelieu died four or five hundred years before madame dubarry was born  let me see the paper i see they have given rose stella the last line with a big and before it no matter she is down only once and i am down fifteen times  i wonder what all these letters of mine are about this is a bill of course the west kensington wine company whew we are getting through the champagne at the rate of about thirty pounds a month not counting what we pay for when we dine in town  well what matter champagne does nobody any harm and i get awfully low without it  all right my dear so long as you please yourself and dont injure your health i dont care heres a letter of yours put among mine by mistake it has been forwarded from your old diggings at lambeth  its from ned said susanna turning pale he must be coming home or he would not write yes he is what shall i do  what does he say said marmaduke taking the letter from her back at 6 on wednesday evening have high tea nc short and sweet well he will not turn up til tomorrow at all events even if he knows the address which of course he doesnt  he knows nothing his note shews that what will he do when he finds me gone he may get the address at the postoffice where i told them to send on my letters the landlady has most likely found out for her own information there is no mistake about it said susanna rising and walking to the window i am in a regular funk about him i have half a mind to go back to lambeth and meet him i could let the murder out gradually or perhaps get him off to the country again before he discovers anything  go back oh no nonsense the worst he can do is to cut youand a good job too  i wish he would it would be a relief to me at present to know for certain that he would  he cant be so very thinskinned as you fancy considering the time you have been on the stage  theres nothing wrong in being on the stage theres nothing wrong in being here either in spite of society after all what do i care about ned or anybody else he always went his own way when it suited him and he has no right to complain if i go mine let him come if he likes he will not get much satisfaction from me susanna sat down again and drank some tea partly defiant partly disconsolate  dont think any more about it said marmaduke he wont come  oh let him if he likes said susanna impatiently marmaduke did not quite sympathize with her sudden recklessness he hoped that conolly would have the good sense to keep away  look here bob said she when they had finished breakfast let us go somewhere today i feel awfully low let us have a turn up the river  all right said marmaduke with alacrity whatever you please how shall we go  anyhow let us go to hampton by train when we get there we can settle what to do afterward can you come now  yes whenever you are ready  then i will run upstairs and dress go out and amuse yourself with that blessed old lawnmower until i come  yes i think i will said marmaduke seriously that plot near the gate wants a trimming badly  what a silly old chap you are bob she said stopping to kiss him on each cheek as she left the room  marmaduke had become attached to the pursuit of gardening since his domestication he put on his hat went out and set to work on the plot near the gate the sun was shining brightly and when he had taken a few turns with the machine he stopped raising his face to the breeze and saw conolly standing so close to him that he started backward and made a vague movement as if to ward off a blow conolly who seemed amused by the mowing said quietly that machine wants oiling the clatter prevented you from hearing me come i have just returned from carbury towers miss lind is staying there and she has asked me to give you a message  this speech perplexed marmaduke he inferred from it that conolly was ignorant of susannas proceedings but he had not sufficient effrontery to welcome him unconcernedly at once so he stood still and stared at him  i am afraid i have startled you conolly went on politely i found the gate unlocked and thought it would be an unnecessary waste of time to ring the bell you have a charming little place here  yes its a pretty little place isnt it said marmaduke awont you come in and have aexcuse my bringing you round this way will you my snuggery is at the back of the house  thank you but i had rather not go in i have a great deal of business to do in town today so i shall just discharge my commission and go  at any rate come into the shade said marmaduke glancing uneasily toward the windows of the house this open place is enough to give us sunstroke  conolly followed him to a secluded part of the shrubbery where they sat down on a bench  is there anything up said marmaduke much oppressed  will you excuse my speaking without ceremony  oh certainly fire away  thank you i must then tell you that the relations between you and lady constance are a source of anxiety to her brother you know the way men feel bound to look after their sisters you have i believe sisters of your own  marmaduke nodded and stole a doubtful glance at conollys face  it appears that lord carbury has all along considered your courtship too cool to be genuine in this view he was quite unsupported the countess being strongly in your favor and the young lady devoted to you  well i knew all that at least i suspected it what is up now  this the fact of your having taken a villa here has reached the ears of the family at carbury they are not unnaturally curious to know what use a bachelor can have for such an establishment  but i have my rooms in clarges street still this is not my house it was taken for another person  precisely what they seem to think but to be brief with you miss lind thinks that unless you wish to break with the earl and quarrel with your family you should go down to towers cottage at once  but i cant go away just now there are reasons  miss lind is fully acquainted with your reasons they are her reasons for wishing you to leave london immediately and now having executed my commission i must ask you to excuse me my time is much occupied  well i am greatly obliged to you for coming all this way out of town to give me the straight tip said marmaduke relieved at the prospect of getting rid of his visitor without alluding to susanna it is very good of you and i am very glad to see you jolly place carbury park is isnt it how will the shooting be  first rate i am told i do not know much about it myself they had risen and were strolling along the path leading to the gate  shall i see you down thereif i go  possibly i shall have to go down for a day at least to get my luggage in case i decide not to renew my engagement with lord jasper  i hope so said marmaduke then as they reached the gate he proffered his hand in spite of an inward shrinking and said heartily goodbye old fellow youre looking as well as possible  conolly took his hand and retained it whilst he said goodbye mr lind i am quite well thank you if i may askhow is susanna  marmaduke was prevented by a spasm of the throat from replying before he recovered susanna herself attired for her proposed trip to hampton emerged from the shrubbery and stood before them confounded conolly still wearing the cordial expression with which he had shaken marmadukes hand looked at her then at her protector and then at her again  i have been admiring the villa susanna said he after an emphatic silence it is better than our place at lambeth you wont mind my hurrying away i have a great deal to do in town goodbye goodbye mr lind  susanna murmured something marmaduke after making an effort to bid his guest goodbye genially opened the gate and stood for a minute watching him as he strode away  what does he care what becomes of me the selfish brute cried susanna passionately  he didnt complain he has nothing to complain of said marmaduke anyhow why didnt he stay at home and look after you by george susanna he is the coolest card i ever came across  what brought him here she demanded vehemently  that reminds me i am afraid i must go down to carbury for a few days  and what am i to do here alone are you going to leave me too  well i cannot be in two places at the same time i suppose you can manage to get on without me for a few days  i will go home i can get on without you altogether i will go home  come susanna what is the use of kicking up a row i cant afford to quarrel with all my people because you choose to be unreasonable  what do i care about your people or about you either  very well then said marmaduke offended you can go home if you like perhaps your brother appreciates this sort of thing i dont  ah you coward you taunt me because you think i have no home do you flatter yourself that i am dependent on you  hold your tongue said marmaduke fiercely dont you turn on me in that fashion keep your temper if you want me to keep mine  you have ruined me said susanna sitting down on the grass and beginning to cry  oh upon my soul this is too much said marmaduke with disgust get up out of that and dont make a fool of yourself ruined indeed will you get up  no screamed susanna  then stay where you are and be damned retorted marmaduke turning on his heel and walking toward the house in the hall he met a maid carrying an empty champagne bottle and goblet  missis is looking for you sir said the maid  all right said marmaduke i have seen her listen to me i am going to the country my man mason will come here today to pack up my traps and bring them after me you had better take a note of my address from the card in the strap of my valise  yes sir said the maid any message for missis  no said marmaduke he then changed his coat and hat and went out again as he approached the gate he met susanna who had risen and was walking toward the house  i am going to carbury he said i dont know when i shall be back  she passed on disdainfully as if she had not heard him     chapter vi   three days later lord carbury came to luncheon with a letter in his hand marian had not yet come in and the rev george was absent his place being filled by marmaduke  good news for you and constance mother  indeed said the countess smiling  yes conolly is coming down this afternoon to collect his traps and leave you forever  really jasper you exaggerate mr conollys importance intelligence of his movements can hardly be newsgood or badeither to me or to constance  i am glad he is going said constance for jaspers sake  thank you replied jasper i thought you would be he will be a great loss to me  nonsense said the countess if another workman is needed another can easily be had  if i can be of any assistance to you old man said marmaduke make what use of me you like i picked up something about the business yesterday  yes said elinor while you were away jasper he went to the laboratory with constance and fired off a brass cannon with your new pile until he had used up all the gunpowder and spoiled the panels of the door that is what he calls picking up something about the business  nothing like experiment for convincing you of the power of electricity said marmaduke is there conny  its very wonderful but i hate shots  where is marian said lady carbury  i left her in the summerhouse in the fruit garden said elinor she was reading  she must have forgotten the hour said the countess she has been moping i think for the last few days i hope she is not unwell but she would never stay away from luncheon intentionally i shall send for her  ill go said marmaduke eagerly  no no duke you must not leave the table i will send a servant  i will fetch her here in half the time that any servant will poor marian why shouldnt she have her lunch i shall be back in a jiffy  what a restless extraordinary creature he is said lady carbury displeased as marmaduke hastily left the room the idea of a man leaving the table in that way  i suspect he has his reasons said elinor  i think it is a perfectly natural thing for him to do said constance pettishly i see nothing extraordinary in it  marmaduke found marian reading in the summerhouse in the fruit garden she looked at him in lazy surprise as he seated himself opposite to her at the table  this is the first chance ive had of talking to you privately since i came down he said i believe you have been keeping out of my way on purpose  well i concluded that you wanted as many chances as possible of talking to some one else in private so i gave you as many as i could  yes you and the rest have been uncommonly considerate in that respect thank you all awfully but i mean to have it out with you miss marian now that i have caught you alone  with me oh dear what have i done  what have you done ill tell you what youve done why did you send conolly of all men in the world to tell me that i was in disgrace here  there was no one else marmaduke  well suppose there wasnt suppose there had been no one else alive on the earth except you and i and he and constance and suand constance how could you have offered him such a job  why not was there any special reason  any special reason didnt your common sense tell you that a meeting between him and me must be particularly awkward for both of us  no at least i marmaduke i think you must fancy that i told him more than i did i did not know where you were and as he was going to london and i thought you knew him well and i had no other means of warning you i had to make use of him jasper will tell you how thoroughly trustworthy he is but all i saidand i really could not say lesswas that i was afraid you were in bad company or under bad influence or something like that and that i only wanted you to come down here at once  oh indeed that was all was it merely that i was in bad company  i think i said under bad influence i was told so and i believed it at the time i hope its not true marmaduke if it is not i beg your pardon with all my heart  marmaduke stared very hard at her for a while and then said with the emphasis of a man baffled by utter unreason well i am damned at which breach of good manners she winced hang me if i understand you marian he continued more mildly of course its not true bad influence is all bosh but it was a queer thing to say to his face he knew very well you meant his sister hallo whats the matter are you going to faint  no inever mind me  never mind you said marmaduke what are you looking like that for  becauseit is nothing i only blushed dont be stupid duke  blushed why dont you blush red like other people and not green shall i get you something  no no oh duke why did you not tell me how could you be so heartless as to leave us all in the dark when we were talking about you before him every day oh are you in earnest duke pray dont jest about it what do you mean by his sister i never knew he had one who is she what happened i mean when you saw him  nothing happened i was mowing in the garden he just walked in bade me good morning admired the place and told me he came with a message from you that things were getting hot here then he went off as cool as you please he didnt seem to mind  and he warned you in spite of all  more for your sake than for mine i suspect hes rather sweet on you isnt he  oh duke duke are you not ashamed of yourself  deuce a bit but im in trouble and i want you to stand by me look here marian you have no nonsense about you i know i may tell you frankly how i am situated maynt i  marian looked at him apprehensively and said nothing  you see you will only mix up matters worse than before unless you know the truth besides i offered to marry her upon my soul i did but she refused her real name is susanna conolly his sister worse luck  dont tell me any more of this duke it is not right  i suppose its not right as you say but what am i to do i must tell you or you will go on making mischief with constance  as if i would tell her i promise that she shall never know from me is that enough  no its too much the plain truth is that i dont care whether she finds me out or not i want her to understand thoroughly once and for ever that i wont marry her  marmaduke  not if i were fifty marmadukes  then you will break her heart  never fear her heart is pretty tough if she has one whether or no i am not going to have her forced on me by the countess or any one else the truth is marian they have all tried to bully me into this match constance cant complain  no not aloud  neither aloud or alow i never proposed to her  very well marmaduke there is no use now in blaming auntie or excusing yourself if you have made up your mind there is an end  but you cant make out that i am acting meanly marian why i have everything to lose by giving her up there is her money and i suppose i must prepare for a row with the family unless the match could be dropped quietly eh  and is that what you want me to manage for you  well come marian dont be savage i have been badly used in this affair they forced it on me i did all i could to keep out of it she was thrown at my head besides i once really used to think i could settle down with her comfortably some day i only found out what an insipid little fool she was when i had a woman of sense to compare her with  dont say hard things about her i think you might have a little forbearance towards her under the circumstances  hm i dont feel very forbearing she has been sticking to me for the last few days like a barnacle our respectable young ladies think a lot of themselves butexcept you and nellyi dont know a woman in society who has as much brains in her whole body as susanna conolly has in her little finger nail i cant imagine how the deuce you all have the cheek to expect men to talk to you much less marry you  perhaps there is something that honest men value more than brains  i should like to know what it is if it is something that ladies have and susanna hasnt it is not either good looks or good sense if its respectability that depends on what you consider respectable if connys respectable and susanna isnt then i prefer disrepu  hush duke you know you have no right to speak to me like this let us think of poor constance how is she to be told the truth  let her find it out i shall go back to london as soon as i can and the affair will drop somehow or another she will forget all about me  happygolucky marmaduke i think if neglect and absence could make her forget you you would have been forgotten before this  yes you see you must admit that i gave her no reason to suppose i meant anything  i am afraid you have consulted your own humor both in your neglect and your attentions duke the more you try to excuse yourself the more inexcusable your conduct appears i do not know how to advise you if constance is told you may some day forget all about your present infatuation and then a mass of mischief and misery will have been made for nothing if she is not told you will be keeping up a cruel deception and wasting her chances ofbut she will never care for anybody else  better do as i say leave matters alone for the present but mind no speculating on my changing my intentions i wont marry her  i wish you hadnt told me about it  well marian i couldnt help it i know of course that you only wanted to make us all happy but you nursed this match and kept it in constances mind as much as you could besidesthough it was not your faultthat mistake about conolly was too serious not to explain dont be downcast i am not blaming you a bit  it seems to me that the worst view of things is always the true one in this world nelly and jasper were right about you  aha so they saw what i felt you cant say i did not make my intentions plain enough to every unbiassed person the countess was determined to get constance off her hands constance was determined to have me and you were determined to stick up for your own notions of love and honeysuckles  i was determined to stick up for you marmaduke  dont be indignant i knew you would stick up for me in your own way but what i want to shew is that only three people believed that i was in earnest and those three were prejudiced  i wish you had enlightened constance and deceived all the rest of the world instead no doubt i was wrong very wrong i am very sorry  pshaw it doesnt matter it will all blow over some day hush i hear the garden gate opening it is constance come to spy what i am doing here with you she is as jealous as a crocodilevery nearly made a scene yesterday because i played with nelly against her at tennis i have to drive her to bushy copse this afternoon confound it  and will you after what you have just confessed  i must besides jasper says that conolly is coming this evening to pack up his traps and go and i want to be out of the way when he is about  this evening  yes between ourselves marian susanna and i were so put out by the cool way he carried on when he called that we had a regular quarrel after he went and we havent made it up yet  pray dont talk about it to me duke here is constance  so you are here said constance gaily but with a quick glance at them that is a pretty way to bring your cousin in to luncheon sir  we got chatting about you my ownest said marmaduke and the subject was so sweet and the moments were so fleet that we talked for quite an hour on the strict qt eh marian  as a punishment you shall have no lunch mamma is very angry with you both  always ready to make allowances for her provided she sends you to lecture me conny why dont you wear your hat properly he arranged her hat as he spoke constance laughed and blushed marian shuddered now youre all that fancy painted you youre lovely youre divine are you ready for bushy copse  constance replied by singing    oh yes if you please kind sir she said sir she said sir she said   oh yes if you pleease kind sir she said  then come along after your ladyship he said taking her elbows as if they were the handles of a wheelbarrow and pushing her out before him through the narrow entrance to the summerhouse on the threshold he turned for a moment met marians reproachful eyes with a wink grinned and disappeared  for half an hour afterward marian sat alone in the summerhouse thinking of the mistake she had made then she returned to the cottage where she found miss mcquinch writing in the library and related to her all that had passed in the summerhouse elinor listened seated in a rockingchair restlessly clapping her protended ankles together when she heard of conollys relationship to susanna she kept still for a few moments looking with widely opened eyes at marian then with a sharp laugh she said  well i beg his pardon i thought he was another of that womans retainers i never dreamt of his being her brother  marian was horror stricken you thought oh nelly what puts such things into your head  so would you have thought it if you had the least gumption about people however i was wrong and im glad of it however i was right about marmaduke i told you so over and over and over again  i know you did but i didnt think you were in earnest  no you never can conceive my being in earnest when i differ from you until the event proves me to be right  i am afraid it will kill constance  dont marian cried elinor giving her chair a violent swing  i am quite serious you know how delicate she is  well if she dies of any sentiment it will be wounded vanity serve her right for allowing a man to be forced into marrying her i believe she knows in her soul that he does not care about her why else should she be jealous of me of you and of everybody  it seems to me that instead of sympathizing with the unfortunate girl both you and marmaduke exult in her disappointment  i pity her poor little wretch but i dont sympathize with her i dont pity marmaduke one bit if the whole family cuts him he will deserve it richly but i do sympathize with him can you wonder at his preference when we went to see that woman last june i envied her there she was clever independent successful holding her own in the world earning her living fascinating a crowd of people whilst we poor respectable nonentities sat pretending to despise heras if we were not waiting until some man in want of a female slave should offer us our board and lodging and the privilege of his lordly name with missis before it for our lifelong services you may make up as many little breadandbutter romances as you please marian but i defy you to give me any sensible reason why marmaduke should chain himself for ever to a little inane thing like constance when he can enjoy the society of a capable woman like that without binding himself at all  nonsense nelly really you oughtnt to say such things  no i ought to keep both eyes tight shut so that i may be contented in that station to which it has pleased god to call me  imagine his proposing to marry her nell i am just as wicked as you for i am very glad she refused though i cant conceive why she did it  perhaps said miss mcquinch becoming excited she refused because she had too much good sense aye and too much common decency to accept it is all very well for us fortunate goodfornothings to resort to prostitution  oh nelly  i say to prostitution to secure ourselves a home and an income somebody said openly in parliament the other day that marriage was the true profession of women so it is a profession and except that it is a harder bargain for both parties and that society countenances it i dont see how it differs from what webless our virtuous indignationstigmatize as prostitution i dont mean ever to be married i can tell you marian i would rather die than sell myself forever to a man and stand in a church before a lot of people whilst george or somebody read out that cynically plainspoken marriage service over me  stop nelly pray stop if you thought for a moment you would never say such awful things  i thought we had agreed long ago that marriage is a mistake  yes but that is very different to what you are saying now  i cannot see  pray stop nelly dont go on in that strain it does no good and it makes me very uncomfortable  ill take it out in work said nelly calmly returning to her manuscript i can see that as you say talking does no good all the more reason why i should have another try at earning my own living when i become a great novelist i shall say what i like and do what i please for the present i am your obedient humble servant  at any other time marian would have protested and explained and soothed now she was too heavily preoccupied by her guilty conscience she strolled disconsolately to the window and presently seeing that miss mcquinch was at work in earnest and had better not be disturbed went off for a lonely walk it was a glorious afternoon and nature heaped its peculiar consolations on her so that she never thought of returning until the sun was close to the horizon as she came tired through the plantation with the evening glow and the light wind in which the branches were rustling and the leaves dropping lulling her luxuriously she heard some one striding swiftly along the path behind she looked back but there was a curve in the way and she could not see who was coming then it occurred to her that it might be conolly dreading to face him after what had happened she stole aside among the trees a little way and sat down on a stone hoping that he might pass by without seeing her the next moment he came round the curve looking so resolute and vigorous that her heart became fainter as she watched him just opposite where she sat he stopped having a clear view of the path ahead for some distance and appeared puzzled marian held her breath he looked to the left through the trees then to the right where she was  goodevening miss lind he said respectfully raising his hat  goodevening said she trembling  you are not looking quite well  i have walked too much and i feel a little tired that is why i had to sit down i shall be rested presently  conolly sat down on a felled trunk opposite marian this is my last visit to carbury towers he said no doubt you know that i am going for good  yes said marian ii am greatly obliged to you for all the pains you have taken with me in the laboratory you have been very patient i suppose i have often wasted your time unreasonably  no said conolly unceremoniously you have not wasted my time i never let anybody do that my time belonged to lord carbury not to myself however that is neither here nor there i enjoyed giving you lessons unless you enjoyed taking them the whole obligation rests on me  they were very pleasant  he shifted himself into an easier position looking well pleased then he said carelessly has mr marmaduke lind come down  marian reddened and felt giddy  i want to avoid meeting him continued conolly and i thought perhaps you might know enough of his movements this evening to help me to do so it does not matter much but i have a reason  marian felt the hysteric globe at her throat as she tried to speak but she repressed it and said  mr conolly i know the reason i did not know before i am sure you did not think i did i made a dreadful mistake  why said conolly with some indignation who has told you since  marmaduke said marian roused to reply quickly by the energy of the questioner he did not mean to be indiscreet he thought i knew  thought he never thought in his life miss lind however he was right enough to tell you and i am glad you know the truth because it explains my behavior the last time we met it took me aback a bit for the moment  you were very forbearing i hope you will not think me intrusive if i tell you how sincerely sorry i am for the misfortune which has come to you  what misfortune  marian lost confidence again and looked at him in silent distress  to be sure he interposed quickly i know but you had put it all out of my head i am much obliged to you not that i am much concerned about it you will perhaps think it an instance of the depravity of my order miss lind but i am not one of those people who think it pious to consider their near relatives as if they were outside the natural course of things i never was a good son or a good brother or a good patriot in the sense of thinking that my mother and my sister and my native country were better than other peoples because i happened to belong to them i knew what would happen some day though as usual my foreknowledge did not save me from a little emotion when the event came to pass besides to tell you the truth i dont feel it as a misfortune you know what my sisters profession is you told me how you felt when you saw her act now tell me fairly and without stopping to think of whether your answer will hurt me would you consent to know her in private even if you had heard nothing to her disadvantage would you invite her to your house or go to a party at which all the other women were like her would you introduce young ladies to her as you would introduce them to miss mcquinch dont stop to imagine exceptional circumstances which might justify you in doing these things but tell me yes or no would you  you see mr conolly i should really never have an opportunity of doing them  by your leave miss lind that means no honestly then what has susanna to lose by disregarding your rules of behavior even if by marrying she conciliated the notions of your class she would only give some man the right to illtreat her and spend her earnings without getting anything in returnand remember there is a special danger of that on the stage for several reasons she would not really conciliate you by marrying for you wouldnt associate with her a bit the more because of her marriage certificate of course i am putting her selfrespect out of the question that being a matter between herself and her conscience with which we have no concern believe me neither actresses nor any other class will trouble themselves about the opinion of a society in which they are allowed to have neither part nor lot perhaps i am wrong to talk about such matters to you but you are trained to feel all the worst that can be felt for my sister and i feel bound to let you know that there is something to be said in her defence i have no right to blame her as she has done me no harm the only way in which her conduct can influence my prospects will be through her being an undesirable sisterinlaw in case i should want to marry  if the person you choose hesitate on that account you can let her go without regret said marian she will not be worthy of your regard  i am not so sure of that said conolly laughing you see miss lind if that invention of mine succeeds i may become a noted man and it is fashionable nowadays for society to patronize geniuses who hit on a new illustration of what people call the marvels of science i am ambitious as a celebrity i might win the affections of a duchess who knows  i should not advise you to marry a duchess i do not know many of them as i am a comparatively humble person but i am sure you would not like them  aye and possibly a lady of gentle nurture would not like me  on the contrary clever people are so rare in society that i think you would have a better chance than most men  do you think my manners would pass i learnt to dance and bow before i was twelve years old from the most experienced master in europe and i used to mix with all the counts dukes and queens in my fathers opera company not to mention the fashionable people i have read about in novels  you are jesting mr conolly i do not believe that your manners give you the least real concern  and you think that i may aspire in timeif i am successful in publicto the hand of a lady  surely you know as much of the world as i why should you not marry a lady if you wish to  i am afraid class prejudice would be too strong for me after all  i dont think so what hour is it now mr conolly  it wants ten minutes of seven  oh cried marian rising miss mcquinch is probably wondering whether i am drowned or lost i must get back to the hall as fast as i can they have returned from bushy copse before this and i am sure they are asking about me  conolly rose silently and walked with her as far as the path from the cottage to the laboratory  this is my way miss lind said he i am going to the laboratory will you be so kind as to give my respects to miss mcquinch i shall not see her again as i must return to town by the last train tonight  and are you not coming backnot at all i mean  not at all  oh said marian slowly  good bye miss lind  he was about to raise his hat as usual but marian with a smile put out her hand he took it for the first time looked at her for a moment gravely and left her  lest they should surprise one another in the act neither of them looked back at the other as they went their several ways     book ii     chapter vii   in the spring eighteen months after his daughters visit to carbury towers mr reginald harrington lind called at a house in manchester square and found mrs douglas at home sholtos mother was a widow lady older than mr lind with a rather glassy eye and shaky hand who would have looked weak and shiftless in an almshouse but who with plenty of money unlimited domestic service and unhesitating deference from attendants who were all trained artists in their occupation made a fair shew of being a dignified and interesting old lady when he was seated her first action was to take a new photograph from a little table at her side and hand it to him without a word awaiting his recognition of it with a shew of natural pride and affection which was amateurish in comparison to the more polished and skilful comedy with which her visitor took it and pretended to admire it  capital capital said mr lind he must give us one  you dont think that the beard has spoiled him do you said mrs douglas  certainly not it is an improvement said mr lind decisively you are glad to have him back again with you i dare say ah yes yes mrs douglass eyes had answered for her did he tell you that he met me i saw him on wednesday last for the first time since his return to london how long was he away  two years she replied with slow emphasis as if such an absence were hardly credible two long years he has been staying in paris in venice in florence a month here a week there dissatisfied everywhere he would have been almost as happy with me at home and how is marian  well said mr lind smiling i believe she is still disengaged and she professes to be fancy free she is fond of saying generally that she will never marry and so forth that is the new fashion with young womenif saying what they dont mean can be called a new fashion  marian is sure to get married said mrs douglas she must have had offers already there are few parents who have not cause to envy you  we have both been happy in that respect mrs douglas sholto is a highly distinguished young man i wish i had started in life with half his advantages i thought at one time he was perhaps becoming attached to marian  you are quite sure mr lind that you could forgive his being a plain gentleman a little bird whispered to me that you desired a title for marian  my dear mrs douglas we who are familiar with titles understand their true value i should be very sorry to see marian lose by an unsuitable alliance the social position i have been able to give her i should set my face resolutely against such an alliance but few english titles can boast a pedigree comparable with sholtos the name of douglas is historicfar more so than that of lind which is not even english except by naturalization besides sholtos talents are very remarkable he will certainly adopt a political career and with his opportunities and abilities a peerage is anything but a remote contingency  sholto you know is perfectly unembarrassed there is not a charge on his property i think that even marian good as she is and lovely as she is will not easily find a better match but i am well known to be a little crazy about my dear boy that is because i know him so much better than anyone else does now let us talk about other matters let me see oh yes i got a prospectus of some company from the city the other day and whose name should there be upon the list of directors but reginald harrington linds and lord carburys too pray is the entire family going into business  well i believe the undertaking to be a commercially sound one and  fancy you talking about commercial soundness  true it must sound strange to you but it is no longer unusual for men in my position to take an active part in the direction of commerce we have duties as well as privileges i gave my name and took a few shares chiefly on the recommendation of jasper and of my own stockbroker i think there can be no doubt that jasper and mr conolly have made a very remarkable discovery and one which must prove highly remunerative and beneficial  what is the discovery i did not quite understand the prospectus  well it is called the conolly electromotor  yes i know that  and itit turns all sorts of machinery i cannot explain it scientifically to you you would not understand me but it is in short a method of driving machinery by electricity at a less cost than by steam it is connected in principle with the conservation of energy and other technical matters you must come and see the machinery at work some day  i must indeed and is it true that mr conolly was a common working man  yes a practical man undoubtedly but highly educated he speaks french and italian fluently and is a remarkable musician altogether a man of very superior attainments and by no means deficient in culture  dear me jasper told me something of that sort about him but lady carbury gave him a very different character she assured me that he was sprung from the dregs of the people and that she had a great deal of trouble to teach him his proper place still we know that she is not very particular as to what she says when she dislikes people yet she ought to know for he was jaspers laboratory servantat least so she said  oh surely not a servant jasper never regarded him in that light the countess disapproves of jaspers scientific pursuits and sets her face against all who encourage him in them however i really know nothing about mr conollys antecedents his manner when he appears at our board meetings is quiet and not unpleasant marian it appears met him at towers cottage the year before last and had some scientific lessons from him he was quite unknown then it was rather a curious coincidence i did not know of it until about a month ago when he read a paper at the society of arts on his invention i attended the meeting with marian and when it was over i introduced him to her and was surprised to learn that they knew one another already he told me afterward that marian had shewn an unusual degree of cleverness in studying electricity and that she greatly interested him at the time  no doubt marian interests everybody and even great discoverers when they are young are only human  ah perhaps so but she must have shewn some ability or she would never have elicited a remark from him he is full of his business  and what is the latest news of the family scamp  do you mean my reginald  dear me no what a shame to call poor reggy a scamp i mean young marmaduke of course is it true that he has a daughter now  oh yes perfectly true  the reprobate and he was always such a pleasant fellow  yes but he is annoyingly inconsiderate about a fortnight ago marian and elinor went to putney to a private view at mr scotts studio on their way back they saw marmaduke on the river and rather unnecessarily i think entered into conversation with him he begged them to come to hammersmith in his boat saying that he had something there to shew them elinor it appears had the sense to ask whether it was anything they ought not to see but he replied on his honor that it was something perfectly innocent and promised that they should be delighted with it so they foolishly consented and went with him to hammersmith where they left the river and walked some distance with him he left them in a road somewhere in west kensington and came back after about fifteen minutes with a little girl he actually presented her to marian and elinor as a member of the family whom they as a matter of course would like to know  well such a thing to do and what happened  marian seems to have thought of nothing but the prettiness of the unhappy child she gravely informed me that she forgave marmaduke everything when she saw how he doted on it elinor has always shewn a disposition to defend him  she is full of perversity and always was  and this incident did not damage his credit with her however after the little waif had been sufficiently petted and praised to gratify master marmadukes paternal feelings they came home and instead of holding their tongues began to tell all our people what a dear little child marmaduke had and how they considered that it ought not to be made to suffer for his follies in fact i think they would have adopted it if i had allowed them  that is marian all over some of her ideas will serve her very well when she goes to heaven but they will get her into scrapes in this wicked world if you do not take care of her  i fear so for that reason i tolerate a degree of cynicism in elinors character which would otherwise be most disagreeable to me it is often useful in correcting marians extravagances unfortunately the incident at hammersmith did not pass off without making mischief it happens that my sister julia is interested in a home for foundling girlsa semiprivate place where a dozen children are trained as domestic servants  yes i have been through it it is very neat and pretty but they really treat the poor girls as if they ought to be thankful for permission to exist their dresses are so ugly  possibly i assure you that presentations are much sought after and are very difficult to get julia is a patroness marian told her about this child of marmadukes and it happened that a vacancy had just occurred at the home in consequence of one of the girls dying of melancholia and spinal affection julia who has perhaps more piety than tact wrote to marmaduke offering to present his daughter and expatiating on the advantages of the home to the poor little lost one in her desire to reclaim marmaduke also she entrusted the letter to george who undertook to deliver it and further julias project by personal persuasion george described the interview to me and shewed me i am sorry to say how much downright ferocity may exist beneath an apparently frank jovial reckless exterior like marmadukes  well i hardly wonder at his refusing of course he might have known that the motive of the offer was a kind one  refused a gentleman can always refuse an offer with dignity marmaduke was outrageous georgea clergymanowed his escape from actual violence to the interference of the woman and to a timely representation that he had undertaken to bear the message in order to soften any angry feelings that it might give rise to marmaduke repeatedly applied foul language to his aunt and to her offer and george with great difficulty dissuaded him from writing a most offensive letter to her julia was so hurt by this that she complained to doramarmadukes motherwho had up to that time been kept in ignorance of his doings and now it is hard to say where the mischief will end dora is overwhelmed by the revelation of the life her son is leading marmaduke has consequently forfeited his fathers countenance which had to be extended to him so far as to allow of his occasional appearance at home in order to keep dora in the dark now that she is enlightened of course there is an end of all that and he is forbidden the house  what a lot of mischief dear me  so i said to marian had she refused to go up the river with marmaduke as she should have done all this would not have occurred she will not see it in that light but lays all the blame on her aunt julia whose offer fell somewhat short of her own notions of providing for the childs future  how does marmaduke stand with respect to money i suppose his father has stopped his allowance  no he threatened to do it and went so far as to make his solicitor write to that effect to marmaduke who had the consummate impudence to reply that he should in that case be compelled to provide for himself by contracting a marriage of which he could not expect his family to approve still he added if the family chose to sever their connexion with him they could not expect him to consult their feelings in his future disposal of himself in plain english he threatened to marry this woman if his income was cut off he carried his point too for no alteration has been made in his allowance indeed as he has money of his own and as part of the property is entailed it would be easier to irritate him uselessly than to subject him to any material deprivation  the young scamp i wonder he was clever enough to take advantage like that  he has shewn no lack of acuteness of late i suspect he is under shrewd guidance  have you ever seen thethe guidance  not in person i seldom enter a theatre now but i am of course familiar with her appearance from the photographic portraits of her they are in all the shop windows  yes i think i have noticed them  and now mrs douglas i fear i have paid you a very long visit  why dont you come oftener  i wish i could find time i have not so much leisure for enjoyment as i used  i am not so sure of that but we are always glad to have a chat with one another i know we are agreed about the dear children i think  cordially cordially goodbye  goodbye     chapter viii   on the morning of the first friday in may marian received this letter                                    uxbridge road holland park w    dear miss lind i must begin by explaining why i make this   communication to you by letter instead of orally it is because i   am about to ask you to do me a favor if you asked me to do   anything for you then no matter how much my judgment might   protest against my compliance i could not without pain to myself   refuse you face to face i have no right to assume that your heart   would plead on my behalf against your head in this fashion but on   the other handthe wish is father to the thought herei have no   right to assume that it would not therefore to spare you all   influences except the fair ones of your own interest and   inclination i make my proposal in writing you will please put the   usual construction on the word proposal what i desire is your   consent to marry me if your first impulse now is to refuse i beg   you to do so in plain terms at once and destroy this letter   without reading further if you think on the contrary that we   could achieve a future as pleasant as our past association has   beento me at least here is what as i think you have to   consider    you are a lady rich wellborn beautiful loved by many persons   besides myself too happily circumstanced to have any pressing   inducement to change your condition and too fortunately endowed in   every way to have reason to anticipate the least difficulty in   changing it to the greatest worldly advantage when you please    what i am and have been you know i may estrange from you some of   the society which you enjoy and i can introduce you to none that   would compensate you for the loss i am what you call poor my   income at present does not amount to much more than fifteen   hundred pounds and i should not ask you to marry me if it were not   that your own inheritance is sufficient as i have ascertained to   provide for you in case of my early death you know how my sister   is situated how your family are likely to feel toward me on her   account and my own and how impatient i am of devoting much time to   what is fashionably supposed to be pleasure on the other hand as   i am bidding for a consent and not for a refusal i hope you will   not take my disadvantages for more or my advantages for less than   they are honestly worth at carbury park you often said that you   would never marry and i have said the same myself so as we   neither of us overrate the possibilities of happiness in marriage   perhaps we might if you would be a little forbearing with me   succeed in proving that we have greatly underrated them as for the   prudence of the step i have seen and practised too much prudence   to believe that it is worth much as a rule of conduct in a world of   accidents if there were a science of life as there is one of   mechanics we could plan our lives scientifically and run no risks   but as it is we musttogether or aparttake our chance   cautiousness and recklessness divide the great stock of regrets   pretty equally    perhaps you will wonder at my selfishness in wanting you for my   own good to forfeit your present happy independence among your   friends and involve your fortunes with those of a man whom you   have only seen on occasions when ceremony compelled him to observe   his best behavior i can only excuse myself by reminding you that   no matter whom you marry you must do so at the same disadvantages   except as to the approval of your friends of which the value is   for you to consider that being so why should i not profit by your   hazard as well as another besides there are many other feelings   impelling me i should like to describe them to you and would if i   understood them well enough to do it accurately    however nothing is further from my intention than to indite a   love letter so i will return to graver questions one in   particular must be clearly understood between us you are too   earnest to consider an allusion to religious matters out of place   here i do not know exactly what you believe but i have gathered   from stray remarks of yours that you belong to what is called the   broad church if so we must to some extent agree to differ i   should never interfere in any way with your liberty as far as your   actions concerned yourself only but frankly i should not permit   my wife to teach my children to know christianity in any other way   than that in which an educated englishman knows buddhism i will   not go through any ceremony whatever in a church or enter one   except to play the organ i am prejudiced against religions of all   sorts the church has made itself the natural enemy of the theatre   and i was brought up in the theatre until i became a poor workman   earning wages when i found the church always taking part against   me and my comrades with the rich who did no work if the church had   never set itself against me perhaps i should never have set myself   against the church but what is done is done you will find me   irreligious but not i hope unreasonable    i will be at the academy tomorrow at about four oclock as i do   not care to remain longer in suspense than is absolutely necessary   but if you are not prepared to meet me then i shall faithfully   help you in any effort i may perceive you make to avoid me    i am dear miss lind              yours sincerely                   edward conolly  this letter conveyed to marian hardly one of the considerations set forth in it she thought it a frank strong admirable letter just what she should have hoped from her highest estimate of him in the quaint earnestness about religion and the exaggerated estimate as she thought of the advantages which she might forfeit by marrying him there was just enough of the workman to make them characteristic she wished that she could make some real sacrifice for his sake she was afraid to realize her situation at first and to keep it off occupied herself during the forenoon with her household duties with some pianoforte practice and such other triflings as she could persuade herself were necessary at last she quite suddenly became impatient of further delay she sat down in a nook behind the window curtain and reread the letter resolutely it disappointed her a little so she read it again the third time she liked it better than the first and she would have gone through it yet again but for the arrival of mrs leith fairfax with whom they had arranged to go to burlington house  it is really a tax on me this first day at the academy said mrs fairfax when they were at luncheon i have been there at the press view besides seeing all the pictures long ago in the studios but of course i am expected to be there  if i were in your place said elinor i  last night continued mrs fairfax deliberately ignoring her i was not in bed until halfpast two oclock on the night before i was up until five on tuesday i did not go to bed at all  why do you do such things said marian  my dear i must john metcalf the publisher came to me on tuesday at three oclock and said he must have an article on the mango experiments at kew ready for the printer before ten next morning for his paper the fortnightly naturalist you know my dear john metcalf i said i dont know what a mango is no more do i mrs leith fairfax said he i think its something that blooms only once in a hundred years no matter what it is you must let me have the article nobody else can do it i told him it was impossible my london letter for the hari kari was not even begun and the last post to catch the mail to japan was at a quarterpast six in the morning i had an article to write for your father too and as the sun had been shining all day i was almost distracted with hay fever if you were to go down on your knees i said i could not find time to read up the flora of the west indies and finish an article before morning he went down on his knees now mrs leith fairfax said he i am going to stay here until you promise what could i do but promise and get rid of him i did it too how i dont know but i did it john metcalf told me yesterday that sir james hooker the president of the society for naturalizing the bread fruit tree in britain and the greatest living authority on the subject has got the credit of having written my article  how flattered he must feel said elinor  what article had you to write for papa said marian  on the electromotorthe conolly electromotor i went down to the city on wednesday and saw it working it is most wonderful and very interesting mr conolly explained it to me himself i was able to follow every step that his mind has made in inventing it i remember him as a common workman he fitted the electric bell in my study four years ago with his own hands you may remember that we met him at a concert once he is a thorough man of business the company is making upward of fifty pounds an hour by the motor at present and they expect their receipts to be a thousand a day next year my article will be in the dynamic statistician next week have you seen sholto douglas since he came back from the continent  no  i want to see him when you meet him next tell him to call on me why has he not been here surely you are not keeping up your old quarrel  what old quarrel  i always understood that he went abroad on your account  i never quarreled with him perhaps he did with me as he has not come to see us since his return it used to be so easy to offend him that his retirement in good temper after a visit was quite exceptional  come come my dear child that is all nonsense you must be kind to the poor fellow perhaps he will be at the academy  i hope not said marian quickly  why  i mean if he cherishes any grudge against me for he will be very disagreeable  a grudge against you ah marian how little you understand him what perverse creatures all you young people are i must bring about an éclaircissement  i advise you not to said elinor if you succeed no one will admit that you have done anything and if you fail everybody will blame you  but there is nothing to be éclairci said marian we are talking nonsense which is silly  and french which is vulgar interposed miss mcquinch delivering the remark like a pistol shot at mrs fairfax who had been trying to convey by facial expression that she pitied the folly of elinors advice and was scandalized by her presumption in offering it it is time to start for the academy  when they arrived at burlington house mrs fairfax put on her gold rimmed spectacles and led the way up the stairs like one having important business in a place to which others came for pleasure when they had passed the turnstiles elinor halted and said  there is no sort of reason for our pushing through this crowd in a gang of three besides i want to look at the pictures and not after you to see which way you go i shall meet you here at six oclock sharp goodbye  what an extraordinary girl said mrs fairfax as elinor opened her catalogue at the end and suddenly disappeared to the right amongst the crowd  she always does so said marian and i think she is quite right two people cannot make their way about as easily as one and they never want to see the same pictures  but my dear consider the impropriety of a young girl walking about by herself  surely there is no impropriety in it lots of peopleall sensible women do it who can tell in this crowd whether you are by yourself or not and what does it matter if  here mrs fairfaxs attention was diverted by the approach of one of her numerous acquaintances marian after a moments indecision slipped away and began her tour of the rooms alone passing quickly through the first in order to escape pursuit in the second she tried to look at the pictures but as she now for the first time realized that she might meet conolly at any moment doubt as to what answer she should give him seized her and she felt a strong impulse to fly the pictures were unintelligible to her she kept her face turned to the inharmonious shew of paint and gilding only because she shrank from looking at the people about whenever she stood still and any man approached and remained near her she contemplated the wall fixedly and did not dare to look round or even to stir until he moved away lest he should be conolly when she passed from the second room to the large one she felt as though she were making a tremendous plunge and indeed the catastrophe occurred before she had accomplished the movement for she came suddenly face to face with him in the doorway he did not flinch he raised his hat and prepared to pass on she involuntarily put out her hand in remonstrance he took it as a gift at once and she confused said anxiously we must not stand in the doorway the people cannot pass us as if her action had meant nothing more than an attempt to draw him out of the way then perceiving the absurdity of this pretence she was quite lost for a moment when she recovered her selfpossession they were standing together in the less thronged space near a bust of the queen and conolly was saying  i have been here half an hour and i have not seen a single picture  nor i she said timidly looking down at her catalogue shall we try to see some now  he opened his catalogue and they turned together toward the pictures and were soon discussing them sedulously as if they wished to shut out the subject of the very recent crisis in their affairs which was nevertheless constantly present in their minds marian was saluted by many acquaintances at each encounter she made an effort to appear unconcerned and suffered immediately afterward from a suspicion that the effort had defeated its own object as such efforts often do conolly had something to say about most of the pictures generally an unanswerable objection to some historical or technical inaccuracy which sometimes convinced her and always impressed her with a confiding sense of ignorance in herself and infallible judgment in him  i think we have done enough for one day she said at last the watercolors and the sculpture must wait until next time  we had better watch for a vacant seat you must be tired  i am a little i think i should like to sit in some other room mrs leith fairfax is over there with mr douglasa gentleman whom i know and would rather not meet just now you saw him at wandsworth  yes that tall man he has let his beard grow since  that is he let us go to the room where the drawings are we shall have a better chance of a seat there i have not seen sholto for two years and our last meeting was rather a stormy one  what happened  marian was a little hurt by being questioned she missed the reticence of a gentleman then she reproached herself for not understanding that his frank curiosity was a delicate appeal to her confidence in him and answered he proposed to me  conolly immediately dropped the subject and went in search of a vacant seat they found one in the little room where the architects drawings languish they were silent for some time  then he began seriously is it too soon to call you by your own name miss lind is distant but marian might shock you if it came too confidently without preparation  whichever you please  whichever i please  that is the worst of being a woman little speeches that are sheer coquetry when you analyze them come to our lips and escape even when we are most anxious to be straightforward  in the same way said conolly the most enlightened men often express themselves in a purely conventional manner on subjects on which they have the deepest convictions this sententious utterance had the effect of extinguishing the conversation for some moments marian being unable to think of a worthy rejoinder at last she said  what is your name  edward or familiarly ned commonly ted in america ed with of course the diminutives neddy teddy and eddy  i think i should prefer ned  i prefer ned myself  have you any other name  yes but it is a secret why people should be plagued with two christian names i do not know no one would have believed in the motor if they had known that my name was sebastian  sebastian  hush i was actually christened edoardo sebastiano conolly my father used to spell his name conollj whilst he was out of italy i have frustrated the bounty of my godfathers by suppressing all but the sensible edward conolly  there was a pause then marian spoke  do you intend to make ourour engagement known at once  i have considered the point and as you are the person likely to be inconvenienced by its publication i am bound to let you conceal it for the present if you wish to it must transpire sometime the sooner the better you will feel uncomfortably deceitful with such a secret and as for me every time your father greets me cordially in the city i shall feel mean however you can watch for your opportunity let me know at once when the cat comes out of the bag  i will i think as you say the right course is to tell at once  undoubtedly but from the moment you do so until we are married you will be worried by remonstrances entreaties threats and what not so that we cannot possibly make that interval too short  we must take nelly into our confidence you will not object to that  certainly not i like miss mcquinch  you really do oh i am so glad well we are accustomed to go about together especially to picture galleries we can come to the academy as often as we like and you can come as often as you like can you not  opening day for instance  yes if you wish  let us say between halfpast four and five then i would willingly be here when the doors open in the morning but my business will not do itself while i am philandering and making you tired of me before your time the consciousness of having done a days work is necessary to my complete happiness  i too have my days work to do silly as it is i have to housekeep to receive visitors to write notes about nothing and to think of the future we can say halfpast four or any later hour that may suit you  agreed and now marian  dont let me disturb you said miss mcquinch at his elbow to marian but mrs leith fairfax will be here with sholto douglas presently and i thought you might like to have an opportunity of avoiding him how do you do mr conolly  i must see him sooner or later said marian rising better face him at once and get it over i will go back by myself and meet them then with a smile at conolly she went out through the door leading to the watercolor gallery  marian does not stand on much ceremony with you mr conolly said miss mcquinch glancing at him  no said conolly do you think you could face the academy again on monday at halfpast four  why  miss lind is coming to meet me here at that hour  marian  precisely marian she has promised to marry me at present it is a secret but it was to be mentioned to you  it will not be a secret very long if you allow people to overhear you calling her by her christian name in the middle of the academy as you did me just now said elinor privately much taken aback but resolute not to appear so  did you overhear us i should have been more careful you do not seem surprised  just a little at your audacity not in the least at marians consenting  thank you  i did not mean it in that way at all said elinor resentfully i think you have been very fortunate as i suppose you would have married somebody in any case i believe you are able to appreciate her thats a compliment  yes i hope i deserve it do you think you will ever forgive me for supplanting the hero marian deserves  if you had let your chance of her slip i should have despised you i think at least i should if you had missed it with your eyes open i am so far prejudiced in your favor that i think marian would not like you unless you were good i have known her to pity people who deserved to be strangled but i never knew her to be attracted by any unworthy person except myself and even i have my good points you need not trouble yourself to agree with me you could not do less in common politeness as i am rather tired i shall go and sit in the vestibule until the others are ready to go home in the meantime you can tell me all the particulars you care to trust me with marian will tell me the rest when we go home  that is an undeserved stab said conolly  never mind i am always stabbing people i suppose i like it she added as they went together to the vestibule  meanwhile mrs leith fairfax had not been wasting her time she had come upon douglas in the large room and had recognized him by his stature and proud bearing in spite of the handsome assyrian beard he had allowed to grow during his stay abroad  i have been very anxious to see you said she forcing a conversation upon him though he had saluted her formally and had evidently intended to pass on without speaking if your time were not too valuable to be devoted to a poor hardworking woman i should have asked you to call on me dont deprecate my forbearance you are somebody in the literary world now  indeed i was not aware that i had done anything to raise me from obscurity  i assure you you are very much mistaken or else very modest has no one told you about the effect your book produced here  i know nothing of it mrs leith fairfax i never enquire after the effect of my work i have lived in comparative seclusion and i scarcely know what collection of fugitive notes of mine you honor by describing as a book  i mean your note on three pictures in last years salon with the sonnets and the fragment from your unfinished drama is it finished may i ask  it is not finished i shall never finish it now  i will tell youbetween ourselvesthat i heard one of the foremost critics of the age say in the presence of a great poet whom we both know that it was such another fragment as the venus of milo whose lost arms said he we should fear to see lest they should be unworthy of her you are right said the poet i for one should shudder to see the fragment completed that is a positive fact but look at some of the sonnets burgraves says that his collection of english sonnets is incomplete because it does not contain your clytemnestra which he had not seen when his book went to press you stand in the very forefront of literaturefar higher than i who amdont tell anybodyfive years older than you  you are very good i do not value any distinction of the sort i write sometimes because i suppose the things that are in me must come out whether i will or not let us talk of something else you are quite well i hope  very far from it i am never well but since i never have a moments rest from work i must bear with it people expect me to think when i have hardly time to eat  if you have no time to think i envy you but i am truly sorry that your health remains so bad  thank you but what is the cause of all this gloomy cynicism mr douglas why should you who are young distinguished gifted and already famous envy me for having no leisure to think  you exaggerate the sadness of my unfortunate insensibility to the admiration of the crowd said douglas coldly i am nevertheless flattered by the interest you take in my affairs  you need not be mr douglas said mrs fairfax earnestly fearing that he would presently succeed in rebuffing her i think you are much better off than you deserve you may despise your reputation as much as you like that only affects yourself but when a beautiful girl pays you the compliment of almost dying of love for you i think you ought to buy a weddingring and jump for joy instead of sulking in remote corners of the continent  and pray mrs leith fairfax what lady has so honored me  you must know unless you are blind  pardon me i do not habitually imply what is not the case i beg you to believe that i do not know  not know what moles men are poor marian  oblige me by taking this seat said douglas sternly pointing to one just vacated i shall not detain you many minutes he added sitting down beside her may i understand that miss lind is the lady of whom you spoke just now  yes remember that i am speaking to you as a friend and that i trust to you not to mention the effort i am making to clear up the misunderstanding which causes her so much unhappiness  are you then in miss linds confidence did she ask you to tell me this  what do you mean mr douglas  i am quite innocent of any desire to shock or offend you mrs leith fairfax does your question imply a negative  most certainly marian ask me to tell you must be dreaming do you think even if marian were capable of making an advance that i would consent to act as a gobetween really mr douglas  i confess i do not understand these matters and you must bear with my ineptitude if miss lind entertains any sentiment for me but one of mistrust and aversion her behavior is singularly misleading  mistrust aversion i tell you she is in love with you  but you have not you admit her authority for saying so whereas i have her authority for the contrary  you do not understand girls you are mistaken  possibly but you must pardon me if i hesitate to set aside my own judgment in deference to your low estimate of it  very well said mrs fairfax her patience yielding a little to his persistent stiffness be it so many men would be glad to beg what you will not be bribed to accept  no doubt i trust that when they so humble themselves they may not encounter a flippant repulse  if they do it will spring from her unmerited regard for you  he bowed slightly and turned away arranging his gloves as if about to rise  pray what is that large picture which is skied over there to the right said mrs fairfax after a pause during which she had feigned to examine her catalogue i cannot see the number at this distance  do you defend her conduct on the ground of that senseless and cruel caprice which your sex seem to consider becoming to them or has she changed her mind in my absence  oh you are talking of marian i do not know what you have to complain of in her conduct mind she has never breathed a word to me on the subject i am quite ignorant of the details of your difference with her but she has confessed to me that she is very sorry for what passedi am abusing her confidence by telling you soand i am a woman with eyes and brains and know what the poor girl feels well enough i will tell you nothing more i have no right to and marian would be indignant if she knew how much i have said already but i know what i should do were i in your place  expose myself to another refusal perhaps  mrs fairfax learning now for the first time that he had actually proposed to marian looked at him for some moments in silence with a smile which was assumed to cover her surprise he thought it expressed incredulity at the idea of his being refused again  are you sure he began speaking courteously to her for the first time may i rely upon the accuracy of your impressions on this subject i know you are incapable of trifling in a matter which might expose me to humiliation but can you give me any guaranteeany  certainly not mr douglas i am really sorry that i cannot give you a written undertaking that your suit shall succeed perhaps that might encourage you to brave the scorn of a poor child who adores you but if you need so much encouragement i fear you do not greatly relish the prospect of success doubtless it has already struck her that since you found absence from her very bearable for two years and have avoided meeting her on your return her society cannot be very important to your happiness  but it was her own fault if she accuses me of having gone away to enjoy myself her thoughts are a bitter sarcasm on the truth  granted that it was her own fault if you please but surely you have punished her enough by your long seclusion and can afford to shew a tardy magnanimity by this time there she is i think just come in at the door on the left my sight is so wretched is it not she  yes  then let us get up and speak to her come  you must excuse me mrs leith fairfax i have distinctly given her my word that i will not intrude upon her again  dont be so foolish  douglass face clouded you are privileged to say so he said  not at all said mrs fairfax frightened but when i think of marian i feel like an old woman and venture to remonstrate with all the presumption of age i beg your pardon  he bowed then marian joined them and mrs fairfax again gave tongue  where have you been she cried you vanished from my side like a sprite i have been searching for you ever since  i have been looking at the pictures of course i am so glad you have come back sholto i think you might have made time to pay us a visit before this you look so strong and well your beard is a great improvement have you met nelly  i think we saw her at some distance said douglas i have not been speaking to her  how did you enjoy yourself while you were away  as best i could  you look as if you had succeeded very fairly what oclock is it remember that we have to meet nelly at the turnstiles at six  it is five minutes to six now miss lind  thank you mr douglas we had better go i think  as they left the room mrs fairfax purposely lingered behind them  am i right in concluding that you are as frivolous as ever marian he said  quite she replied today especially so i am very happy today  may i ask why  something has happened i will tell you what it is some day perhaps but not now something that realizes a romantic dream of mine the dream has been hovering vaguely about me for nearly two years but i never ventured to teach myself exactly what it was until today  realized here in the academy  it was foreshadowedpromised at home this morning but it was realized here  did you know beforehand that i was coming  not until today mrs leith fairfax said that you would most likely be here  and you are happy  so much so that i cannot help talking about my happiness to you who are the very last personas you will admit when everything is explainedto whom i should unlock my lips on the subject  and why am i not interested in your happiness  i suppose so i hope so but when you learn the truth you will be more astonished than gratified  i dare swear that you are mistaken is this dream of yours an affair of the heart  now you are beginning to ask questions  well i will ask no more at present but if you fear that my long absence has rendered me indifferent in the least degree to your happiness you do me a great injustice  well you were not in a very good humor with me when you went away  i will forget that if you wish me to  i do wish you to forget it and you forgive me  most assuredly  then we are the best friends in the world again this is a great deal better than meeting and pretending to ignore the very thing of which our minds are full you will not delay visiting us any longer now i hope  i will call on your father tomorrow morning may i  he is out of town until monday he will be delighted to see you then he has been talking to me about you a great deal of late but if you want to see him in the morning you had better go to the club i will write to him tonight if you like so that he can write to you and make an appointment  do ah marian instinct is better and truer than intellect i have been for two years trying to believe all kinds of evil of you and yet i knew all the time that you were an angel  marian laughed i suppose that under our good understanding i must let you say pretty things to me you must write me a sonnet before your enthusiasm evaporates i am sure i deserve it as well as clytemnestra  i will but i fear i shall tear it up for its unworthiness afterward  dont i am not a critic talking of critics where has mrs leith fairfax gone to oh there she is  mrs fairfax came up when she saw marian look round for her my dear she said it is past six we must go elinor may be waiting for us  they found elinor seated in the vestibule with conolly at whom mrs fairfax plunged full of words conolly and douglas introduced to one another by marian gravely raised their hats when they had descended the stairs they stood in a group near one of the doors whilst conolly went aside to get their umbrellas just then marmaduke lind entered the building and halted in surprise at finding himself among so many acquaintances  hallo he cried seizing douglass hand and attracting the attention of the bystanders by his boisterous tone here you are again old man delighted to see you didnt spot you at first in the beard george told me you were back i met your mother in knightsbridge last thursday but she pretended not to see me how have you enjoyed yourself abroad eh very much in the old style i suppose  thank you said douglas i trust your people are quite well  hang me if i know said marmaduke i have not troubled them much of late how dye do mrs leith fairfax how are all the celebrities mrs fairfax bowed coldly  dont roar so marmaduke said marian everybody is looking at you  everybody is welcome said marmaduke loudly douglas you must come and see me by jove now that i think of it come and see me all of you i am by myself on weeknights from six to twelve and i should enjoy a housewarming if mrs leith fairfax comes it will be all proper and right let us have a regular party  mrs fairfax looked indignantly at him elinor looked round anxiously for conolly marian struck with the same fear moved toward the door  here marmaduke she said offering him her hand goodbye you are in one of your outrageous humors this afternoon  what am i doing he replied i am behaving myself perfectly let us settle about the party before we go  good evening mr lind said conolly coming up to them with the umbrellas this is yours i think mrs leith fairfax  good evening said marmaduke subsiding iwell you are all off are you  quite time for us i think said elinor goodbye  mrs fairfax with a second and more distant bow passed out with conolly and douglas elinor waited a moment to whisper to marmaduke  first rate said marmaduke in reply to the whisper and beginning to talk like one oclock oh yes i tell you he shook elinors hand at such length in his gratitude for the inquiry that she was much relieved when a servant in livery interrupted him  missus wants to speak to you sir afore she goes said the man  elinor shook her head at marmaduke and hurried away to rejoin the rest outside as they went through the courtyard they passed an open carriage in which reclined a pretty woman with dark eyes and delicate artificial complexion her beauty and the elegance of her dress attracted their attention suddenly marian became aware that conolly was watching her as she looked at the woman in the carriage she was about to say something when to her bewilderment elinor nudged her then she understood too and looked solemnly at susanna susanna observing her stared insolently in return and marian averted her head like a guilty person and hurried on conolly saw it all and did not speak until they rejoined mrs fairfax and douglas in piccadilly  how do you propose to go home said douglas  walk to st jamess street where the carriage is waiting at the club take uncle reginald with us and drive home through the park said elinor  i will come with you as far as the club if you will allow me said douglas  conolly then took leave of them and stood still until they disappeared when he returned to the courtyard and went up to his sisters carriage  well susanna said he how are you  oh theres nothing the matter with me she replied carelessly her eyes filling with tears nevertheless  i hear that i have been an uncle for some time past  yes on the wrong side of the blanket  what is its name he said more gravely  lucy  is it quite well  i suppose not according to nurse it is always ill  conolly shrugged his shoulders and relapsed into the cynical manner in which he had used to talk with his sister tired of it already he said poor little wretch  it is very well off she retorted angrily a precious deal better than i was at its age it gets petting enough from its father heaven knows he has nothing else to do i have to work  you have it all your own way at the theatre now i suppose you are quite famous  yes she said bitterly we are both celebrities rather different from old times  we certainly used to get more kicks than halfpence however let us hope all that is over now  who were those women who were with you a minute ago  cousins of lind miss marian lind and miss mcquinch  i remember she is pretty i suppose as usual she hasnt an idea to bless herself with the other looks more of a devil now that you are a great man why dont you marry a swell  i intend to do so  the lord help her then  amen goodbye  oh goodbye go on to soho she added to the coachman settling herself fretfully on the cushions     chapter ix   on monday morning douglas received a note inviting him to lunch at mr linds club he had spent the greater part of the previous night composing a sonnet which he carried with him in his pocket to st jamess street mr lind received him cordially listened to an account of his recent stay abroad and described his own continental excursions both gentlemen expressing great interest at such coincidences as their having put up at the same hotel or travelled by the same line of railway when luncheon was over mr lind proposed that they should retire to the smokingroom  i should like to have a few words with you first as we are alone here said douglas  certainly said mr lind assuming a mild dignity in anticipation of being appealed to as a parent certainly sholto  what i have to say coming so soon after my long absence will probably surprise you i had it in contemplation before my departure and was only prevented from broaching it to you then by circumstances which have happily since lost their significance when i tell you that my communication has reference to marian you will perhaps guess its nature  indeed said mr lind affecting surprise well sholto if it be so you have my heartiest approval you know what a lonely life her marriage will entail on me so you will not expect me to consent without a few regrets but i could not desire a better settlement for her she must leave me some day i have no right to complain  we shall not be very far asunder i hope and it is in marians nature to form many ties but to break none  she is an amiable girl mymy darling child does she know anything of this  i am here at her express request and there remains to me the pleasure of getting her own final consent which i would not press for until armed with your sanction  except for an involuntary hitch of his eyelids mr lind looked as if he believed perfectly in douglass respect for his parental claims quite right he said quite right you have my best wishes i have no doubt you will succeed none there are of course a few affairs to be settleda few contingencies to be provided forchildrenaccidentsand so forth no difficulty is likely to arise between us on that score but still these things have to be arranged  i propose a very simple method of arranging them you are a man of honor and more conversant with business than i give me your instructions my lawyer shall have them within half an hour  that is said like a gentleman and a douglas sholto but i must consider before giving you an answer you have thrown upon me the duty of studying your position as well as marians and i must neither abuse your generosity nor neglect her interest  you will nevertheless allow me to consider the conditions as settled since i leave them entirely in your hands  my own means have been seriously crippled by the extravagance of reginald indeed both my boys have cost me much money i had not like you the good fortune to be an only son i was the fourth son of a younger son there was very little left for me i will treat marian as liberally as i can but i fear i cannot do anything for her that will bear comparison with your munificence  surely i can give her enough i should prefer to be solely responsible for her welfare  oh no that would be too bad oh no sholto i will give her something please god  as you wish mr lind we can arrange it to your satisfaction afterward do you intend returning to westbourne terrace soon  i am afraid not i have to go into the city if you would care to come with me i can shew you the companys place there and the working of the motor it is well worth seeing then you can return with me to the terrace and dine with us after dinner you can talk to marian  douglas consented and they went to queen victoria street to a building which had on each doorpost a brass shield inscribed the conolly electromotor company of london limited at the offices on the first floor they were received obsequiously and informed that mr conolly was within they then went to a door on which appeared the name of the inventor and entered a handsomely furnished office containing several working models of machinery and a writingtable from his seat at which conolly rose to salute his visitors  good evening mr lind how do you do mr douglas  oh said mr lind you two are acquainted i did not know that  yes said conolly i had the pleasure of meeting mr douglas at the academy yesterday evening  indeed marian did not mention that you were there well can we see the wonders of the place mr conolly or do we disturb you  not at all replied conolly turning to one of the models and beginning his showmans lecture with disquieting promptitude hitherto as you are no doubt aware mr douglas steam has kept electricity as a motive power out of the field because it is much less expensive even induced magnetic currents the cheapest known form of electric energy can be obtained only by the use of steam power you generate steam by the combustion of coal electricity without steam can only be generated by the combustion of metals coal is much cheaper than metal consider the vast amount of coal consumed in smelting metals still electricity is a much greater force than steam its stronger so to speak sixpennorth of electricity would do more work than sixpennorth of steam if only you could catch it and hold it without waste up to the present the waste has been so enormous in electric engines as compared with steam engines that steam has held its own in spite of its inferior strength what i have invented is to put it shortly an electric engine in which there is hardly any waste and we can now pump water turn millstones draw railway trains and lift elevators at a saving in fuel and labor of nearly seventy per cent of the cost of steam and added conolly glancing at douglas as a motor of sixhorsepower can be made to weigh less than thirty pounds including fuel flying is now perfectly feasible  what said douglas incredulously does not all trustworthy evidence prove that flying is a dream  so it did because a combination of great power with little weight such as an eagle for instance possesses could not formerly be realized in a machine the lightest known fourhorsepower steam engine weighs nearly fifty pounds with my motor a machine weighing thirty pounds will give rather more than sixhorsepower or in other words will produce a wing power competent to overcome much more than its own gravity if the aeronautical society does not within the next few years make a machine capable of carrying passengers through the air to new york in less than two days i will make one myself  very wonderful indeed said douglas politely looking askance at him  no more wonderful than the flight of a sparrow i assure you we shall presently be conveyed to the top of this building by my motor here you have a model locomotive a model steam hammer and a sewing machine all of which as you see i can set to work however this is mere show you must always bear in mind that the novelty is not in the working of these machines but the smallness of the cost of working  douglas endured the rest of the exhibition in silence understanding none of the contrivances until they were explained and not always understanding them even then it was disagreeable to be instructed by conollyto feel that there were matters of which conolly knew everything and he nothing if he could have but shaped a pertinent question or two enough to prove that he was quite capable of the subject if he chose to turn his attention to it he could have accepted conollys information on the machinery as indifferently as that of a policeman on the shortest way to some place that it was no part of a gentlemans routine to frequent as it was he took refuge in his habitual reserve and lest the exhibition should be prolonged on his account took care to shew no more interest in it than was barely necessary to satisfy mr lind at last it was over and they returned westward together in a hansom  he is a yankee i suppose said douglas as if ingenuity were a low habit that must be tolerated in an american  yes they are a wonderful people for that sort of thing curious turn of mind the mechanical instinct is  it is one with which i have no sympathy it is generally subject to the delusion that it has a monopoly of utility your mechanic hates art pelts it with lumps of iron and strives to extinguish it beneath all the hard and ugly facts of existence on the other hand your artist instinctively hates machinery i fear i am an artist  i dont think you are quite right there sholto no look at the steam engine the electric telegraph thethe other inventions of the century how could we get on without them  quite as well as athens got on without them our mechanical contrivances seem to serve us but they are really mastering us crowding and crushing the beauty out of our lives and making commerce the only god  i certainly admit that the coarser forms of radicalism have made alarming strides under the influence of our modern civilization but the convenience of steam conveyance is so remarkable that i doubt if we could now dispense with it nor as a consistent liberal a moderate liberal do i care to advocate any retrogression even in the direction of ancient greece  douglas was seized with a certain impatience of mr lind as of a wellmannered man who had never learned anything and had forgotten all that he had been taught he did not attempt to argue but merely said coldly i can only say that i wish fate had made me an athenian instead of an englishman of the nineteenth century  mr lind smiled complacently he knew douglas if not athens better but was in too tolerant a humor to say so little more passed between the two until they reached westbourne terrace where marian and her cousin were dressing for dinner when marian came down her beauty so affected douglas that his voice was low and his manner troubled as he greeted her he took her in to dinner and sat in silence beside her heedless alike of his hosts commonplaces and miss mcquinchs acridities  mr lind unceremoniously took a nap after his wine that evening and allowed his guest to go upstairs alone douglas hoped that elinor would be equally considerate but to his disappointment he found her by herself in the drawingroom she hastened to explain  marian is looking for some music she will be back directly  he sat down and took an album from the table saying have you many new faces here  yes but we never discard old faces for new ones it is the old ones that are really interesting  i have not seen this one of mr lind before it is capital ah this of you is an old friend  yes what do you think of the one of constance on the opposite page  she looks as if she were trying to be as lugubrious as possible what dress is that is it a uniform  yes she joined a nursing guild didnt mrs douglas tell you  i believe so i forgot she went into a cottage hospital or something of that kind did she not  she left it because one of the doctors offended her he was rather dreadful he said that in two months she had contributed more to the mortality among the patients than he had in two years and told her flatly that she had been trained for the drawingroom and ought to stay there she was glad enough to have an excuse for leaving for she was heartily sick of making a fool of herself  indeed where is she now  back at towers cottage moping i suppose thats mr conolly the inventor there under jasper  so i perceive clever head rather a plain hard nature with no depths in it is that his wife with the swiss bonnet  his wife why that is a swiss girl the daughter of a guide at chamounix who nursed marian when she sprained her ankle mr conolly is not married  i thought men of his stamp always married early  no he is engaged and engaged to a lady of very good position  he owes that to the diseased craving of modern women for notoriety of any sort what an admirable photograph of marian i never saw it before it is really most charming when was it taken  last august at geneva she does not like itthinks it too coquettish  then perhaps she will give it to me  she will be only too glad i daresay you have caught her at a soft moment tonight  i cannot find that duet anywhere said marian entering what up already sholto where is papa  i left him asleep in the diningroom i have just been asking miss mcquinch whether she thought you would give me a copy of this carte  that geneva one it is most annoying how people persist in admiring it it always looks to me as if it belonged to an assortment of popular beauties at one shilling each i dont think i have another but you may take that if you wish  thank you said douglas drawing it from the book  i think you have a copy of every photograph i have had taken in my life she said sitting down near him and taking the album i have several of yours too you must get one taken soon for me i have not got you with your beard yet i have a little album upstairs which aunt dora gave me on my eighth birthday and the first picture in it is you dressed in flannels holding a bat and looking very stern as captain of your eleven at eton i used to stand in great awe of you then do you remember telling me once that zanoni was a splendid book and that i ought to read it  pshaw no i must have been a young fool but it seems that i had the grace even then to desire your sympathy  i assure you i read it most reverently down in wiltshire where nelly kept a select library of fiction concealed underneath her mattress and i believed every word of it nelly and i agreed that you were exactly like zanoni but she was hardly to blame for she had never seen you  things like that make deep impressions on children said elinor thoughtfully you were a zanoni in my imagination for years before i saw you when we first met you treated me insufferably if you had known how my childish fancy had predisposed me to worship you you might have vouchsafed me some more consideration and i might have gone on believing you a demigod to the end of the chapter i have hardly forgiven you yet for disenchanting me  i am sorry said douglas sarcastically i must have been sadly lacking in impressiveness but on the other hand i recollect that you did not disappoint me in the least you fully bore out the expectations i had been led to form of you  i have no doubt i did said elinor yet i protest that my reputation was as unjust as yours however i have outlived my sensitiveness to this injustice and have even contracted a bad habit of pretending to act up to it occasionally before foolish people marian are you sure that duet is not on the sofa in my room  oh the sofa i looked only in the green case  i will go and hunt it out myself excuse me for a few minutes  douglas was glad to see her go yet he was confused when he was alone with marian he strolled to the window outside which the roof of the porch had been converted into a summer retreat by a tent of pinkstriped canvass the tent is up already he said i noticed it as we came in  yes would you prefer to sit there we can carry out this little table and put the lamp on it there is just room for three chairs  we need not crowd ourselves with the table he said there will be light enough we only want to talk  very well said marian rising will you give me that woolen thing that is on the sofa it will do me for a shawl he placed it on her shoulders and they went out  i will sit in this corner said marian you are too big for the campstool you had better bring a chair i am fond of sitting here when the crimson shade is on the lamp and papa asleep in its roseate glow the view is quite romantic there is something ecstatically snug in hiding here and watching it douglas smiled and seated himself as she suggested near her with his shoulder against the stone balustrade  marian said he after a pause you remember what passed between us at the academy yesterday  you mean our solemn league and covenant yes  why did we not make that covenant before life is not so long nor happiness so common that we can afford to trifle away two years of it i wish you had told me when i last came here of that old photograph of mine in your album  but this is not a new covenant it is only an old one mended we were always good friends until you quarrelled and ran away  that was not my fault marian  then it must have been mine however it does not matter now  you are right prometheus is unbound now and his despair is only a memory sanctifying his present happiness you know why i called on your father this morning  it was to see the electromotor in the city was it not  good heavens marian he said rising what spirit of woman or spirit of mischief tempts you to coquet with me even now  i really thought that was the reasonbesides of course your desire to make papa amends for not having been to see him sooner after your return  marian he said still remonstrantly  she looked at him with sudden dread and instinctively recognized the expression in his face  you know as well as i he continued that i went to seek his consent to our solemn league and covenant as you call it if that covenant were written on your heart as it is on mine you would not inflict on me this pretty petty torture your father has consented he is delighted now may i make a guess at that happy secret you told me of yesterday and promised i should know one day  stop wait said marian very pale i must tell you that secret myself  hush do not be so moved remember that your confession is to be whispered to me alone  dont talk like that it is all a mistake my secret has nothing to do with you douglas drew back a little way  i am engaged to be married  what do you mean he said sternly advancing a step and looking down menacingly at her with his hand on the back of his chair  i have said what i mean replied marian with dignity but she rose quickly as soon as she had spoken and got past him into the drawingroom he followed her and she turned and faced him in the middle of the room paler than before  you are engaged to me he said  i am not she replied  that is a lie he exclaimed struggling in his rage to break through the strong habit of selfcontrol it is a damnable lie but it is the most cruel way of getting rid of me and therefore the one most congenial to your heartlessness  sholto said marian her cheeks beginning to redden you should not speak to me like that  i say he cried fiercely that it is a lie  whats the matter said elinor coming hastily into the room  sholto has lost his temper said marian firmly her indignation getting the better of her fear now that she was no longer alone with him  it is a lie repeated douglas unable to shape a new sentence elinor and marian looked at one another in perplexity then mr lind entered  gently pray said he you can be heard all through the house marian what is the matter  she did not answer but douglas succeeded after a few efforts in speaking intelligibly your daughter he said with the assistance of her friend mrs leith fairfax and a sufficient degree of direct assurance on her own part has achieved the triumph of bringing me to her feet a second time after i had unfortunately wounded her vanity by breaking her chains for two years  that is utterly false interrupted marian with excitement  i say said douglas in a deeper tone and with a more determined manner that she set mrs leith fairfax on me with a tale of love and regret for my absence she herself with her own lips deliberately invited me to seek your consent to our union she caused you to write me the invitation i received from you this morning she told me that my return realized a dream that had been haunting her for two years she begged me to forgive her the past and to write her a sonnet of which she said she was at least more worthy than clytemnestra and of which i say she is at best less worthy than cressida he took a paper from his pocket as he spoke and with a theatrical gesture tore it into fragments  this is very extraordinary said mr lind irresolutely is it some foolish quarrel or what is the matter pray let us have no more unpleasantness  you need fear none from me said douglas i do not propose to continue my acquaintance with miss lind  mr douglas has proposed to marry me and i have refused him said marian he has lost his temper and insulted me i think you ought to tell him to go away  gently marian gently what am i to believe about this  what i have told you said douglas i confirm on my honor which you can weigh against the pretences of a twice perjured woman  sholto  i have to speak plainly on my own behalf mr lind i regret that you were not in a position this morning to warn me of your daughters notable secret  if it is a secret and you are a gentleman you will hold your tongue interposed elinor sharply  papa said marian i became engaged yesterday to mr conolly i told mr douglas this in order to save him from making me a proposal that is the reason he has forgotten himself i had not intended to tell you so suddenly but this misunderstanding has forced me to  engaged to mr conolly cried mr lind i begin to fear thatenga he took breath and continued to marian i forbid you to entertain any such engagement sholto there is evidently nothing to be gained by discussing this matter in hot blood it is some girlish absurditysomesomesome  i apologize for having doubted the truth of the excuse said douglas but i see that i have failed to gauge miss linds peculiar taste i beg you to understand mr lind that my pretensions are at an end i do not aspire to the position of mr conollys rival  you are already in the position of mr conollys unsuccessful rival and you fill it with a very bad grace said elinor  pray be silent elinor said mr lind this matter does not concern you marian go to your room for the present i shall speak to you afterwards  marian flushed and repressed a sob i wish i were under his protection now she said looking reproachfully at douglas as she crossed the room  what can you expect from a father but hostility said elinor bitterly you are a coward like all your sex she added turning to douglas then she suddenly opened the door and passed out through it with marian whilst the housemaids fled upstairs the footman shrank into a corner of the landing and the page hastily dragged the cook down to the kitchen  the two men left together in the drawingroom were for some moments quite at a loss then mr lind after a preliminary cough or two said sholto i cannot describe to you how shocked i am by what i have just heard i am deeply disappointed in marian i trusted her implicitly but of course i now see that i have been wrong in allowing her so much liberty evidently a great deal has been going on of which i had not any suspicion  douglas said nothing his resentment was unabated but his rage naturally peevish and thin in quality was subsiding though it surged back on him at intervals but now that he no longer desired to speak passionately he would not trust himself to speak at all suddenly mr lind broke out with a fury that astonished him preoccupied as he was  thisthis fellow must have had opportunities of thrusting himself into her society of which i knew nothing i thought she barely knew him and if i had known could i have suspected her of intriguing with an illbred adventurer yes i might my experience ought to have warned me that the taint was in her blood her mother did the same thingleft the position i had given her to run away with a charlatan disgracing me without the shadow of an excuse or reason except her own innate love for what was low i thought marian had escaped that i was proud of herplaced ununbounded confidence in her  she has struck me a blow said douglas the infernal treachery he checked himself and after a moment resumed in his ordinary formal manner i must leave you mr lind i am quite unable at present to discuss what has passed any conventional expressions of regret would begoodnight  he bowed and left the room mr lind taken aback did not attempt to detain him or even return his bow but stood biting his lips with a frown of discomfiture and menace when he was alone he paced the room several times then he procured some writing materials and sat down before them he wrote nothing but after sitting for some time he went upstairs passing marians room he listened the sharp voice and restless movements of his niece were the only sounds he heard they seemed to frighten him for he stole on quickly to his own room and went to bed even there he could hear a shrill note of conversation occasionally from the opposite room where marian was sitting on a sofa trying to subdue the hysteria which had been gaining on her since her escape from the balcony whilst elinor seated on the corner of a drawer which projected from the dressingtable talked incessantly in her most acrid tones  henceforth she said uncle reginald is welcome to my heartiest detestation i have been waiting ever since i knew him for an excuse to hate him and now he has given me one he has taken partlike a true parentagainst you with a selfintoxicated fool whom he ought to have put out of the house he has told me to mind my own business i shall be even with him for that some day i am as vindictive as an elephant i hate people who are not vindictive they are never grateful either only incapable of any enduring sentiment and douglas sholto douglas the hero the newdigate poet the handsome man what a noble fellow he is when a little disappointment rubs his varnish off i am glad i called him a coward to his face i am thoroughly well satisfied with myself altogether at last i have come out of a scene without having forgotten the right thing to say you never see people in all their selfishness until they pretend to love you see what you owe to your loving suitor sholto douglas see what you owe to your loving father reginald lind  i do not think that my father should have told me to leave the room said marian it was sholtos place to have gone not mine  mr lind who has so suddenly and deservedly descended from papa to my father judiciously sided with the stronger and richer party  nelly i shall be as unhappy after this as even sholto can desire i feel very angry with papa and yet i have no right to be i suppose it is because i am in the wrong i deceived him about the engagement  bosh you didnt tell him because you knew you couldnt trust him and now you see how right you were  even so nelly i must not forget all his past care of me  what care has he ever taken of you he was very little better acquainted with you than he was with me when you came to keep house for him and make yourself useful of course he had to pay for your board and lodging and education the police would not have allowed him to leave you to the parish besides he was proud of having a nice pretty daughter to dispose of you were quite welcome to be happy so long as you did not do anything except what he approved of but the moment you claim your independence as a grown woman the moment you attempt to dispose of yourself instead of letting him dispose of you bah i might have been my fathers pet if i had been a nonentity as it was he spared no pains to make me miserable and as i was only a helpless little devil of a girl he succeeded to his hearts content uncle reginald will try to do exactly the same tomorrow he will come and bully you instead of apologizing as he ought see if he doesnt  if i had as much reason to complain of my childhood as you have perhaps i should not feel so shocked and disappointed by his turning on me tonight surely when he saw me attacked as i was he ought to have come to my assistance  any stranger would have taken your part the footman would if you had asked him but then james is not your father  it seems a very small thing to be bidden to leave the room but i will never expose myself to a repetition of it  quite right but what do you mean to do for after all though parental love is an imposition parental authority is a fact  i will get married  out of the frying pan into the fire certainly if you are resolved to marry the present is as good as another time and more convenient but there must be some legal formalities to go through you cannot turn into the first church you meet and be married offhand  ned must find out all that i am sadly disappointed and disilluded nelly  time will cure you as it does everybody and you will be the better for being wiser by the bye what did sholto mean about mrs fairfax  i dont know  she has evidently been telling him a parcel of lies do you remember her hints about him yesterday at lunch i have not the least doubt that she has told him you are frantically in love with him she as good as told you the same about him  oh she is not capable of doing such a thing  isnt she we shall see  i dont know what to think said marian despondently i used to believe that both you and ned thought too little of other people but it seems now that the world is nothing but a morass of wickedness and falsehood and sholto too who would have believed that he could break out in that coarse way do you remember the day that fleming the coachman lost his temper with auntie down at the cottage sholto was exactly like that not a bit more refined or dignified  rather less so because fleming was in the right let us go to bed we can do nothing tonight but fret and wish for tomorrow better get to sleep resentment does not keep me awake i can vouch for that i got well broken in to it when i was a child i heard uncle reginald going to his room some time ago i am getting sleepy too though i feel the better for the excitement  very well to bed be it said marian but she did not sleep at all as well as nelly     chapter x   next morning mr lind rose before his daughter was astir and went to his club where he breakfasted he then went to the offices in queen victoria street finding the boardroom unoccupied he sat down there and said to one of the clerks  go and tell mr conolly that i desire to speak to him if he is disengaged and if anyone wants to come in say that i am busy here i do not wish to be disturbed for half an hour or so  yes sir said the clerk departing a minute later he returned and said mr conly is disengaged and he says will you be so good as to come to his room sir  i told you to ask him to come here said mr lind  well thats what he said sir said the clerk speaking in official board school english shloy gow to him and tell him again  no no it does not matter said mr lind and walked out through the office the clerk held the door open for him and carefully closed it when he had passed through  ow oy sy cried the clerk this is fawn this is  wots the row said another clerk  woy owld lind sends me in to conly to cam in to him into the boardroom aw right says conly awsk him to cam in eah to me you should a seen the owld jossers feaches wnoy towld im oyd zoyred jou to sy e was to cam in eah to me shloy gow and tell him again i says as cool as ennything now says he oil gow myself thets wot aw loike in conly he tikes tham fellers dahn wen they troy it on owver im  meanwhile mr lind went to conollys room returned his greeting by a dignified inclination of the head and accepted with a cold thank you the chair offered him conolly who had received him cordially checked himself there was a pause during which mr lind lost countenance a little then conolly sat down and waited  ahem said mr lind i have to speak to you withwith reference toto aa matter which has accidentally come to my knowledge it would be painful and unnecessaryquite unnecessary to go into particulars  conolly remained politely attentive but said nothing mr lind began to feel very angry but this helped him to the point  i merely wishthat is i quite wish you to understand that any intimacy that may have arisen between you andand a member of my family mustmust in short be considered to be at an end my daughter isi may tell youengaged to mr sholto douglas whom you know and thereforeyou understand  mr lind said conolly decisively your daughter is engaged to me  mr lind lost his temper and rose exclaiming i beg you will not repeat that either here or elsewhere  pray be seated said conolly courteously  i have nothing more to say sir  conolly rose as though the interview were at an end and seemed to wait for his visitor to go  we understand one another i presume said mr lind dubiously  not quite i think said conolly relenting i should suggest our discussing the matter in full now that we have a favorable opportunityif you will be so good  mr lind sat down and said with condescension i am quite willing to listen to you  thank you said conolly will you tell me what your objections are to my engagement with your daughter  i had hoped sir that your common sense and knowledge of the world would have rendered an explanation superfluous  they havnt said conolly  mr lind rose to boiling point again oh mr conolly i assure you i have no objection to explain myself none whatever i merely wished to spare you as far as possible since you insist on my mentioning what i think you must be perfectly well aware of i can only say that from the point of view of english society our positions are different and therefore an engagement between you and any member of my family is unsuitable andin shortout of the question however advantageous it might be to you that is all  mr lind considered he had had the better of that and leaned back in his chair more confidently conolly smiled and shook his head appreciative of the clearness with which mr lind had put his case but utterly unmoved by it he considered for a moment and then said weighing his words carefully  your daughter with her natural refinement and delicate habits is certainly not fit to be married to a foulmouthed fellow ignorant dirty besotted and out of place in any company except at the bar in a public house that is probably your idea of a workman but the fact of her having consented to marry me is a proof that i do not answer to any such description as you have hinted it will be an advantage to me in some ways to have a lady for my wife but i should have no difficulty in purchasing that advantage even with my present means which i expect to increase largely in the course of some years do you not underrate your daughters personal qualities when you assume that it was her position that induced me to seek her hand  i am quite aware of my daughters personal advantages they are additional reasons against her contracting an imprudent marriage  precisely but in what respect would her marriage with me be imprudent i possess actual competence and a prospect of wealth i come of a long lived and healthy family my name is beyond comparison more widely known than yours mr lind recoiled i now find myself everywhere treated with a certain degree of consideration which an alliance with your daughter will not diminish  in fact you are conferring a great honor on my family by condescending to marry into it  i dont understand that way of looking at things mr lind and so i leave you to settle the question of honor as you please but you must not condemn me for putting my position in the best possible light in order to reconcile you to an inevitable fact  what do you mean by an inevitable fact sir  my marriage of course i assure you that it will take place  but i shall not permit it to take place do you think to ignore me in the matter  practically so if you give your consent i shall be glad for the sake of marian who will be gratified by it but if you withhold it we must dispense with it by opposing us you will simplyby making marians home unbearable to herprecipitate the wedding conolly under the influence of having put the case neatly here relaxed his manner so far as to rest his elbows on the table and look pleasantly at his visitor  do you know to whom you are speaking said mr lind driven by rage and a growing fear of defeat into desperate selfassertion  i am speaking said conolly with a smile to my future fatherinlaw  i am a director of this company of which you are the servant as you shall find to your cost if you persist in holding insulting language to me  if i found any director of this company allowing other than strictly business considerations to influence him at the board i should insist on his resigning  mr lind looked at him severely then indignantly then unsteadily without moving him in the least at last he said more humbly i hope you will not abuse your position mr conolly i do not know whether you have sufficient influence over marian to induce her to defy me but however that may be i appeal to your better feelings put yourself in my place if you had an only daughter  excuse my interrupting you said conolly gently but that will not advance the argument unless you put yourself in mine besides i am pledged to marian if she asks me to break off the match i shall release her instantly  you will bind yourself to do that  i cannot help myself i have no more power to make her marry me than you have to prevent her  i have the authority of a parent and i must tell you mr conolly that it will be my duty to enlighten my poor child as to the effect a union with you must have on her social position you have made the most of your celebrity and your prospects she may be dazzled for the moment but her good sense will come to the rescue yet i am convinced  i have certainly spared no pains to persuade her unless the habit of her childhood can induce marian to defer to your prejudiceyou must allow me to call it so it is really nothing moreshe will keep her word to me  mr lind winced recollecting how little his conduct toward marian during her childhood was calculated to accustom her to his influence it seems to me sir he said suddenly thinking of a new form of reproach that to use your own plain language you are nothing more or less than a radical  radicalism is not considered a reproach amongst workmen said conolly  i shall not fail to let her know the confidence with which you boast of your power over her  i have simply tried to be candid with you you know exactly how i stand if i have omitted anything ask me and i will tell you at once  mr kind rose i know quite as much as i care to know he said i distinctly object to and protest against all your proceedings mr conolly if my daughter marries you she shall have neither my countenance in society nor one solitary farthing of the fortune i had destined for her i recommend the latter point to your attention  i have considered it carefully mr lind and i am satisfied with what she possesses in her own right  oh you have ascertained that have you  i should hardly have proposed to marry her but for her entire pecuniary independence of me  indeed and have you explained to her that you wish to marry her for the sake of securing her income  i have explained to her everything she ought to know taking care of course to have full credit for my frankness  mr lind after regarding him with amazement for a moment walked to the door  i am a gentleman he said pausing there for a moment and too oldfashioned to discuss the obligations of good breeding with a radical if i had believed you capable of the cynical impudence with which you have just met my remonstrances i should have spared myself this meeting goodmorning  goodmorning said conolly gravely when the door closed he sprang up and walked to and fro chuckling rubbing his hands and occasionally uttering a short laugh when he had sufficiently relieved himself by this exercise he sat down at his desk and wrote a note    the conolly electromotor company of london limited queen   victoria street ec    this is to let your everradiant ladyship know that i am fresh   from an encounter with your father who has retired in great wrath   defeated but of opinion that he deserved no better for arguing   with a radical i thought it better to put forth my strength at   once so as to save future trouble i send this post haste in order   that you may be warned in case he should go straight home and scold   you i hope he will not annoy you muchec  having despatched the office boy to westbourne terrace with this letter conolly went off to lunch mr lind went back to his club and then to westbourne terrace where he was informed that the young ladies were together in the drawingroom some minutes later marian discussing conollys letter with elinor was interrupted by a servant who informed her that her father desired to see her in his study  now for it marian said nelly when the servant was gone remember that you have to meet the most unreasonable of adversaries a parent asserting his proprietary rights in his child dont be sentimental leave that to him he will be full of a fathers anguish on discovering that his cherished daughter has feelings and interests of her own besides conolly has crushed him and he will try to crush you in revenge  i wish i were not so nervous said marian i am not really afraid but for all that my heart is beating very unpleasantly  i wish i were in your place said elinor i feel like a charger at the sound of the trumpet  i am glad for poor papas sake that you are not said marian going out  she knocked at the study door and her fathers voice as he bade her come in impressed her more than ever before he was seated behind the writingtable in front of which a chair was set for his daughter she unaccustomed from her childhood to submit to any constraint but that which the position of a guest which she so often occupied had trained her to impose on herself was rather roused than awed by this magisterial arrangement she sat down with less than her usual grace of manner and looked at him with her brows knitted it was one of the rare moments in which she reminded him of her mother an angry impulse to bid her not dare look so at him almost got the better of him however he began prudently with a carefully premeditated speech  it is my duty marian he said gravely to speak of the statement you made last night we need not allude to the painful scene which took place then better let that rest and be forgotten as soon as possible but the discovery of what you have been doing without my knowledge has cost me a sleepless night and a great deal of anxiety i wish to reason with you now quite calmly and dispassionately and i trust you will remember that i am older and have far more experience of the world than you and that i am a better judge of your interests than you yourself can possibly be ahem i have been this morning to the city where i saw mr conolly and endeavored to make him understand the true nature of his conduct toward meand i may add toward youin working his way clandestinely into an intimacy with you i shall not describe to you what passed but i may say that i have found him to be a person with whom you could not hope for a days happiness even apart from his habits and tastes which are those of a mere workman his social and i fear his religious views are such as no lady no properlyminded woman of any class could sympathize with you will be better able to judge of his character when i tell you that he informed me of his having taken care before making any advances to you to ascertain how much money you had he boasted in the coarsest terms of his complete influence over you evidently without a suspicion of the impression of venality and indelicacy which his words were calculated to make on me besides marian i am sure you would not like to contract a marriage which would give me the greatest pain which would offend my family and which would have the effect of shutting you out from all good society  you are mistaken in him papa  i beg you will allow me to finish marian he had to think for a moment before he could substantiate this pretence of having something more to say i have quite made up my mind from personal observation of mr conolly that even an ordinary acquaintance between you is out of the question i in short refuse to allow anything of the kind to proceed and i must ask you to respect my wishes in the matter there is another subject which i will take this opportunity of mentioning but as i have no desire to force your inclinations i shall not press you for a declaration of your feelings at present sholto douglas  i do not want to hear anything about sholto douglas said marian rising  i expect you marian to listen to what i have to say  on that subject i will not listen i have felt very sore and angry ever since you told me last night to leave the room when sholto insulted me as if i were the aggressor  angry i am sorry to hear you say so to me  it is better to say so than to think so there is no use in going on with this conversation papa it will only lead to more bitterness between us and i had enough of that when i tasted it for the first time last night we shall never agree about mr conolly i have promised to marry him and therefore i am not free to withdraw even if i wished to  a promise made by you without my sanction is not binding andlisten to me if you pleasei have obtained mr conollys express assurance that if you wish to withdraw he is perfectly willing that you should  of course he would not marry me if i did not wish it  but he is willing that you should withdraw he leaves you quite free  yes and as you told me he is quite confident that i will keep faith with him and so i will i have had a letter from him since you saw him  what said mr lind rising also  dont let us quarrel papa said marian appealingly why may i not marry whom i please  who wants to prevent you pray i have most carefully abstained from influencing you with regard to sholto douglas but this is a totally different question it is my duty to save you from disgracing yourself  where is the disgrace mr conolly is an eminent man i am not poor and can afford to marry anyone i can respect i can respect him what objection have you to him i am sure he is far superior to sholto  mr douglas is a gentleman marian mr conolly is not and it is out of the question for you to ally yourself with aa member of the proletariat however skilful he may be in his handicraft  what is a gentleman papa  a gentleman marian is one who is well born and well bred and who has that peculiar tone and culture which can only be acquired by intercourse with the best society i think you should know that as well as i i hope you do not put these questions from a desire to argue with me  i only wish to do what is right surely there is no harm in arguing when one is not convinced  humph well i have said all that is necessary i am sure that you will not take any step calculated to inflict pain on meat least an act of selfishness on your part would be a new and shocking experience for me  that is a very unfair way of putting it papa you give me no good reason for breaking my word and making myself unhappy and yet you accuse me of selfishness in not being ready to do both  i think i have already given you my assurance weighted as it is by my age my experience my regard for your welfare and i hope my authority as a parent that both your honor and happiness will be secured by your obeying me and forfeited by following your own headstrong inclinations  marian almost crushed by this hesitated a moment twisting her fingers and looking pitiably at him then she thought of conolly rallied and said i can only say that i am sorry to disagree with you but i am not convinced  do you mean that you refuse to obey me  i cannot obey you in this matter papa i  that is enough said mr lind gravely beginning to busy himself with the writing materials marian for a moment seemed about to protest against this dismissal then she checked herself and went out of the room closing the door quite quietly behind her thereby unconsciously terrifying her father who had calculated on a slam  well said elinor when her cousin rejoined her in the drawingroom have you been selfish and disobedient have you lacerated a fathers heart  he is thoroughly unfair said marian however it all comes to this he is annoyed at my wanting to marry ned and i believe there will be no more peace for me until i am in a house of my own what shall we do in the meantime where shall we go i cannot stay here  why not uncle reginald will sulk sit at dinner without speaking to us and keep out of our way as much as he can but you can talk to me we neednt mind him it is he who will be out in the cold biting his nose to vex his face such a state of things is new to you but i have survived weeks of it without a single sympathizer and been none the worse except perhaps in temper he will pretend to be inexorable at first then he will come down to wounded affection and he will end by giving in  no nelly i couldnt endure that sort of existence if people cannot remain friends they should separate at once i will not sleep in this house tonight  hurrah cried miss mcquinch that will be beginning the war with spirit if i were in your place i would stay and fight it out at close quarters i would make myself so disagreeable that nobody can imagine what life in this house would be but your plan is the bestif you really mean it  certainly i mean it where shall we go nelly  hm i am afraid none of the family would make us very comfortable under the circumstances except marmaduke it would be a splendid joke to go to west kensington only it would tell as much against us and ned as against the roman father i have it we will go to mrs topliss in st marys terrace my mother always stays there when she is in town mrs toplis knows us if she has a room to spare she will give it to us without making any bother  yes that will do are you ready to come now  if you can possibly wait five minutes i should like to put on my hat and change my boots we will have to come back and pack up when we have settled about the room we cannot go without clothes i should like to have a nightdress at least have you any money  i have the housekeeping money but that of course i shall not take i have thirty pounds of my own  and i have my old stocking which contains nearly seventeen say fifty in round numbers that will keep us going very comfortably for a month  ridiculous it will last longer than that oh  well  we mustnt go after all i forgot you  what of me  where will you go when i am married you cant live by yourself and papa may not welcome you back if you take my part against him  he would not in any case so it makes no difference to me i can go home if the worst comes to the worst it does not matter my present luxurious existence must come to an end some time or another whether we go to mrs topliss or not  i am sure ned will not object to your continuing with me if i ask him  no poor fellow he wont objectat first but he might not like it you have no right to inflict me on him no i stick to my resolution on that point send for the carriage it is time for us to be off and mrs toplis will be more impressed if we come in state than if we trudge afoot  hush said marian who was standing near the window here is george with a face full of importance  uncle reginald has written to him said elinor  then the sooner we go the better said marian  i do not care to have the whole argument over again with george  as they passed through the hall on their way out they met the clergyman  well george said elinor how are the heathen getting on in belgravia you look lively  are you going out marian he said solemnly disregarding his cousins banter  we are going to engage a couple of rooms for some errant members of the family said elinor may we give you as a reference  certainly i may want to speak to you before i go marian when will you return  i do not know probably we shall not be long you will have plenty of opportunities in any case  will you walk into the study please sir said the parlormaid  the rev george was closeted with his father for an hour when he came out he left the house and travelled by omnibus to westbourne grove whence he walked to a house in uxbridge road here he inquired for mr conolly and learning that he had just come in sent up a card he was presently ushered into a comfortable room with a pleasant view of the garden a meal of tea wheatcakes and fruit was ready on the table conolly greeted his visitor cordially and rang for another cup the rev george silently noted that his host dined in the middle of the day and had tea in the evening afraid though as he was of conolly he felt strengthened in his mission by these habits quite out of the question for marian the tea also screwed up his courage a little but he talked about the electromotor in spite of himself until the cloth was removed when conolly placed two easy chairs opposite one another at the window put a box of cigarets on a little table close at hand and invited his visitor to smoke but as it was now clearly time to come to business the cigaret was declined solemnly so conolly having settled himself in an easy attitude waited for the clergyman to begin the rev george seemed at a loss  has your father spoken to you about an interview he had with me this morning said conolly goodnaturedly helping him out  yes that in fact is one of the causes of my visit  what does he say  i believe he adheres to the opinion he expressed to you but i fear he may not have exhibited that selfcontrol in speaking to you which i fully admit you have as much right to expect as anyone else  it does not matter i can quite understand his feeling  it does matterpardon me we should be sorry to appear wanting in consideration for you  that is a trifle let us keep the question straight before us we need make no show of consideration for one another i have shown none toward your family  but i assure you our only desire is to arrange everything in a friendly spirit  no doubt but when i am bent on doing a certain thing which you are equally bent on preventing no very friendly spirit is possible except one of us surrender unconditionally  hear me a moment mr conolly i have no doubt i shall be able to convince you that this romantic project of my sisters is out of the question your ambitionif i may say so without offencevery naturally leads you to think otherwise but the prompting of selfinterest is not our safest guide in this life  it is the only guide i recognize if you are going to argue the question and your arguments are to prevail they must be addressed to my selfinterest  i cannot think you quite mean that mr conolly  well waive the point for the present i am open to conviction you know what my mind is i have not changed it since i saw your father this morning you think i am wrong  not wrong i do not say for a moment that you are wrong i  mistaken illadvised any term you like  i certainly believe that you are mistaken let me urge upon you first the fact that you are causing a daughter to disobey her father now that is an awful fact may iappealing to that righteousness in which i am sure you are not naturally deficientask you whether you have reflected on that fact  it is not half so awful to me as the fact of a father forcing his daughters inclinations however awful is hardly the word for the occasion let us come to business mr lind i want to marry your sister because i have fallen in love with her you object have you any other motive than aristocratic exclusiveness  indeed you quite mistake i have no such feeling we are willing to treat you with every possible consideration  then why object  well we are bound to look to her happiness we cannot believe that it would be furthered by an unsuitable match i am now speaking to you frankly as a man of the world  as a man of the world you know that she has a right to choose for herself you see our points of view are different on sundays for instance you preach to a highly privileged audience at your church in belgravia whilst i lounge here over my breakfast reading reynolds newspaper i have not many social prejudices although a workman i dont look on every gentleman as a bloodsucker who seizes on the fruits of my labor only to pursue a career of vice i will even admit that there are gentlemen who deserve to be respected more than the workmen who have neglected all their opportunitiesslender as they areof cultivating themselves a little you on the other hand know that an honest mans the noblest work of god that natures gentlemen are the only real gentlemen that kind hearts are more than coronets and simple faith than norman blood and so forth but when your approval of these benevolent claptraps is brought to such a practical test as the marriage of your sister to a workman you see clearly enough that they do not establish the suitability of personal intercourse between members of different classes that being so let us put our respective philosophies of society out of the question and argue on the facts of this particular case what qualifications do you consider essential in a satisfactory brotherinlaw  i am not bound to answer that but primarily i should consider it necessary to my sisters happiness that her husband should belong to the same rank as she  you see you are changing your ground i am not in the same rankafter your senseas she but a moment ago you objected to the match solely on the ground of unsuitability  where is the difference said the clergyman with some warmth i have not changed my ground at all it is the difference in rank that constitutes the unsuitability  let us see then how far you are righthow far suitability is a question of rank a gentleman may be and frequently is a drunkard a gambler a libertine or all three combined  stay mr conolly you show how little you understand the only true significance  one moment mr lind you are about to explain away the term gentleman into man of honor honest man or some other quite different thing let me put a case to you i have a fellow at queen victoria street working for thirty shillings a week who is the honestest man i know he is as steady as a rock supports all his wifes family without complaining and denies himself beer to buy books for his son because he himself has experienced what it is to be without education but he is not a gentleman  pardon me sir he is a true gentleman  suppose he calls on you tomorrow and sends up his name with a request for an interview you wont know his name and the first question you will put to your servant is what sort of person is he suppose the servant knows him and sharing your professed opinion of the meaning of the word replies he is a gentleman on the strength of that you will order him to be shewn in and the moment you see him you will feel angry with your servant for deceiving you completely as to the sort of man you were to expect by using the word gentleman in what you call its true sense or reverse the case suppose the caller is your cousin mr marmaduke lind and your highprincipled servant by mistaking the name or how not causes you to ask the same question with respect to him the answer will be that mr marmadukebeing a scampis not a gentleman you would be just as completely deceived as in the other case no mr lind you might as well say that this workman of mine is a true lord or a true prince as a true gentleman a gentleman may be a rogue and a knifegrinder may be a philosopher and philanthropist but they dont change their ranks for all that  the clergyman hesitated then he said timidly even admitting this peculiar view of yours mr conolly does it not tell strongly against yourself in the present instance  no and i will presently shew you why not when we digressed as to the meaning of the word gentleman we were considering the matter of suitability i was saying that a gentleman might be a drunkard or briefly a scoundrel a scoundrel would be a very unsuitable husband for mariani perceive i annoy you by calling her by her name  nno oh no it does not matter  therefore gentility alone is no guarantee of suitability the only gentlemanliness she needs in a husband is ordinary good address presentable manners sense enough to avoid ridiculous solecisms in society and so forth marian is satisfied with me on these points and her approval settles the question finally as to rank i am a skilled workman the first in my trade and it is only by courtesy and forbearance that i suffer any man to speak of my class as inferior take us all professions and trades together and you will find by actual measurement round the head and round the chest and round our manners and characters if you like that we are the only genuine aristocracy at present in existence therefore i meet your objection to my rank with a pointblank assertion of its superiority now let us have the other objections if there are any others  the clergyman received this challenge in silence then after clearing his throat uneasily twice he said  i had hoped mr conolly to have been able to persuade you on general grounds to relinquish your design but as you are evidently not within reach of those considerations which i am accustomed to see universally admitted it becomes my painful duty to assure you that a circumstance on the secrecy of which you are relying is known to me and through me to my father  what circumstance is that  a circumstance connected with mr marmaduke lind whom you mentioned just now you understand me i presume  oh you have found that out  i have it only remains for me to warn my sister that she is about to contract a close relationship with one who isi must say itliving in sin with our cousin  what do you suppose will be the result of that  i leave you to imagine said the clergyman indignantly rising  stop a bit you do not understand me yet i see you have said that my views are peculiar what if i have taken the peculiar view that i was bound to tell marian this before proposing to her and have actually told her  but surelythat is not very likely  the whole affair is not very likely our marriage is not likely but it is going to happen nevertheless she knows this circumstance perfectly well you told her yourself  i when  the year before last at carbury towers it is worth your consideration too that by mistrusting marian at that time and refusing to give her my sisters address you forced her to appeal to me for help and so advanced me from the position of consulting electrician to that of friend in need she knew nothing about my relationship to the woman in a state of sin as you call it and actually deputed me to warn your cousin of the risk he was running by his intimacy with her whilst i was away running this queer errand for her she found out that the woman was my sister and of course rushed to the conclusion that she had inflicted the deepest pain on me her penitence was the beginning of the sentimental side of our acquaintance had you recognized that she was a woman with as good a right as you to know the truth concerning all matters in this world which she has to make her way through you would have answered her question and then i suppose i should have gone away without having exchanged a word with her on any more personal matters than induction coils and ohms of resistance and in all probability you would have been spared the necessity of having me for a brotherinlaw  well sir said the rev george dejectedly if what you say be true i cannot understand marian i can only grieve for her i shall not argue with you on the nature of the influence you have obtained over her i shall speak to her myself since you will not hear me  that is hardly fair i have heard you and am willing to hear more if you have anything new to urge  you have certainly listened to my voice mr conolly but i fear i have used it to very little purpose  you will fail equally with marian believe me even i whose ability to exercise influence you admit never obtained the least over my own sister she knew me too well on my worst side and not at all on my best if as i presume your father has tried in vain what hope is there for you  only my humble trust that a priest may be blessed in his appeal to duty even where a fathers appeal to natural affection has been disregarded  well well said conolly kindly rising as his visitor disconsolately prepared to go you can try i got on by dint of dogged faith in myself  and i get on by lowly faith in my master i would i could imbue you with the same feeling  conolly shook his head and they went downstairs in silence hallo said he as he opened the door it is raining let me lend you a coat  thank you no not at all goodnight said the clergyman quickly and hastened away through the rain from conollys civilities  when he arrived at westbourne terrace there was a cab waiting before the house the door was opened to him by marians maid who was dressed for walking  master is in the drawingroom sir with miss mcquinch she said meaning evidently look out for squalls  he went upstairs and found elinor with her hat on standing by the pianoforte with battle in her nostrils mr lind looking perplexed and angry was opposite to her  george said mr lind close the door do you know the latest news  no  marian has run away  run away  yes said miss mcquinch she has fled to mrs topliss at st marys terrace withas uncle reginald was just sayinga most dangerous associate  with  with me in short  and you have counselled her to take this fatal step  no i advised her to stay but she is not so well used to domestic discomfort as i am so she insisted on going we have got very nice rooms you may come and see us if you like  is this a time to display your bitter and flippant humor said the rev george indignantly i think the spectacle of a wrecked home  stuff interrupted elinor impatiently what else can i say uncle reginald tells me i have corrupted marian and refuses to believe what i tell him and now you attack me as if it were my fault that you have driven her away if you want to see her she is within five minutes walk of you it is you who have wrecked her home not she who has wrecked yours  there is no use in speaking to elinor george said mr lind with the air of a man who had tried it you had better go to marian and tell her what you mentioned this afternoon what has been the result of your visit  he maintains that she knows everything said the rev george with a dispirited glance at elinor i fear my visit has been worse than useless  it is impossible that she should know he lies said mr lind go and tell her the truth george and say that i desire heri order herto come back at once say that i am waiting here for her  but uncle reginald began elinor in a softer tone than before whilst the clergyman stood in doubt  i think continued mr lind that i must request you elinor to occupy the rooms you have taken until you return to your parents i regret that you have forced me to take this step but i cannot continue to offer you facilities for exercising your influence over my daughter i will charge myself with all your expenses until you go to wiltshire  elinor looked at him as if she despaired of his reason then seeing her cousin slowly going to the door she said  you dont really mean to go on such a fools errand to marian george  elinor cried mr lind  what else is it said elinor you asserted all your authority yourself this morning and only made matters worse yet you expect her to obey you at second hand besides she is bound in honor not to desert me now and i will tell her so too if i see any sign of her letting herself be bullied  i fear marian will not pay much heed to what i say to her said the clergyman  if you are coming said elinor you had better come in my cab goodnight uncle reginald  stay said mr lind irresolutely elinor iyouwill you exercise your influence to induce marian to return i think you owe me at least so much  i will if you will withdraw your opposition to her marriage and let her do as she likes but if you can give her no better reason for returning than that she can be more conveniently persecuted here than at st marys terrace she will probably stay where she is no matter how i may influence her  if she is resolved to quarrel with me i cannot help it said mr lind pettishly  you know very well that she is the last person on earth to quarrel with anyone  she has been indulged in every way this is the first time she has been asked to sacrifice her own wishes  to sacrifice her whole life you mean it is the first time she has ever hesitated to sacrifice her own comfort and therefore the first time you are conscious that any sacrifice is required let me tell her that you will allow her to take her own course uncle reginald he is well enough off and they are fond of one another a man of genius is worth fifty men of rank  tell her if you please elinor that she must choose between mr conolly and me if she prefers him well and good i have done with her that is my last word  so now she has nobody to turn to in the world except him that is sensible come cousin george i am off  i do not think i should do any good by going said the clergyman  then stay where you are said elinor goodnight and she abruptly left the room  it was a dreadful mistake ever to have allowed that young fury to enter the house said mr lind she must be mad what did he say  he said a great deal in attempted selfjustification but i could make no impression on him we have no feelings in common with a man of his type no he is evidently bent on raising himself by a good marriage  we cannot prevent it  oh surely we  i tell you we cannot prevent it repeated mr lind turning angrily upon his son how can we what can we do she will marry thisthisthisthis beggar i wish to god i had never seen her mother  the clergyman stood by cowed and said nothing  you had better go to that woman of marmadukes continued mr lind and try whether she can persuade her brother to commute his interest in the company and go back to america or to the devil i will take care that he gets good terms even if i have to make them up out of my own pocket if the worst comes she must be persuaded to leave marmaduke offer her money women of that sort drive a hard bargain but they have their price  but sir consider my profession how can i go to drive a bargain with a woman of evil reputation  well i must go myself i suppose  oh no i will go only i thought i would mention it  a clergyman can go anywhere you are privileged come to breakfast in the morning we can talk over matters then     chapter xi   one morning the rev george lind received a letter addressed in a handwriting which he did not remember and never thenceforth forgot within the envelope he found a dainty little bag made of blue satin secured by ribbons of the same material this contained a note written on scented paper edged with gold and decorated with a miniature representation of a pierrot sitting crosslegged conning a book on the open pages of which appeared the letters lv the clergyman recognized the monogram no more than the writing but as it was evidently from a lady he felt a pleasant thrill of expectation as he unfolded the paper                                          laurel grove west kensington                                              wednesday   dear mr george    i have made poor little lucy believe that kew is the most heavenly   place on earth to spend a may morning so bob has had to promise to   row her down there tomorrow thursday after breakfast and i shall   be at home alone from eleven to one this is very short notice i   know but opportunities are scarce and another might not present   itself for a month    believe me dear mr george                                       yours sincerely                                             lalage virtue  the rev george became thoughtful and absently put the note in a little rack over the mantelpiece then recollecting that a prying servant or landlady might misinterpret it he transferred it to his pocket after breakfast having satisfied himself before the mirror that his dress was faultless and his expression saintly he went out and travelled by rail from sloane square to west kensington whence he walked to laurel grove an elderly maid opened the gate it was a rule with the rev george not to look at strange women and this morning the asceticism which he thought proper to his office was unusually prominent in his thoughts he did not look up once while the maid conducted him through the shrubbery to the house and he fully believed that he had not seen at the first glance that she was remarkably plain as susanna took care that all her servants should be passing by the drawingroom where he had been on a previous occasion they went on to a smaller apartment at the back of the house  what room is this he asked uneasily  missuss purjin bodoor sir replied the main  she opened the door and the clergyman entering found himself in a small room luxuriously decorated in sham persian but containing ornaments of all styles and periods which had been purchased and introduced just as they had caught susannas fancy she was seated on a ottoman dressed in wide trousers turkish slippers a voluminous sash a short greek jacket a long silk robe with sleeves and a turban all of fine soft materials and rare colors her face was skilfully painted and her dark hair disposed so as not to overweight her small head the clergyman foolishly resisting a natural impulse to admire her felt like st anthony struggling with the fascination of a disguised devil he responded to her smile of welcome by a stiff bow  sit down she said you mustnt mind this absurd dress it belongs to a new piece i am studying i always study in character it is the only way to identify myself with my part you see  it seems a very magnificent dress certainly said the clergyman nervously  thank you for the compliment  no no said he hastily i had no such intention  of course not said susanna with a laugh it was merely an unpremeditated remark all compliments are of course i know all about that but do you think it a proper costume  in what sense may i ask  is it a correct eastern dress i am supposed to be one of the wives of the caliph somebody al something you have no idea how difficult it is to get a reliable model for a dress before laying out a heap of money on it this was designed in paris but i should like to hear it criticizedchronologically or whatever you call itby a scholar  i really do not know madam i am not an orientalist and my studies take a widely different direction from yours  yes of course said susanna with a sigh but i assure you i often wish for your advice particularly as to my elocution which is very faulty you are such a master of the art  the clergyman bowed in acceptance of the compliment and began to take heart for to receive flattery from ladies in exchange for severe reproof was part of his daily experience  i have come here he said to have a very serious conversation with you  all right doctor fire away  this sudden whim of conferring on him a degree in divinity and her change of mannerimplying that she had been laughing at him beforeirritated him i presume he said that you are acquainted with the movements of your brother  of ned said susanna frowning a little no what should i know about him  he is i believe about to be married  no screamed susanna throwing herself back and making her bangles and ornaments clatter get out doctor you dont mean it  certainly i mean it it is not my profession to jest i must also tell you that his marriage will make it quite impossible for you to continue here with my cousin  why who is he going to marry  ahem he has succeeded in engaging the affections of my sister  what your sister marian lind  yes  susanna uttered a long whistle and then with a conviction and simplicity which prevented even the rev george from being shocked said well i am damned i know more than one fool of a girl who will be sick and sorry to hear it she paused and added carelessly i suppose all your people are delighted  i do not know why you should suppose so we have had no hand in the matter my sister has followed her own inclinations  indeed let me tell you young man that your sister might have gone farther and fared worse  doubtless however you will see now how impossible it is that you should remain in your presentthat you should continue here in fact  what do you mean  you cannot said the clergyman accustomed to be bold and stern with female sinners when you are sisterinlaw to miss lind live as you are now doing with her cousin  why not  because it would be a scandal i will say nothing at present of the sin of it you will have to account for that before a greater than i  just so doctor you dont mind the sin but when it comes to a scandal  i did not say so i abhor the sin i have prayed earnestly for your awakening and shall do so in spite of the unregenerate hardness of heart  hallo doctor draw it mild if you please i am not one of your parishioners you know perhaps that is the reason your prayers for me have not met with much attention let us stick to business you may talk shop as much as you please afterwards what do you want me to do  to sever your connexion with marmaduke at once believe me it will not prove so hard a step as it may seem you have but to ask for strength to do it and you will find yourself strong it will profit you even more than poor marmaduke  will it i dont see it doctor you think it will profit you thats plain enough but it wont profit me it wont profit bob and it wont by any means profit the child  not immediately perhaps in a worldly sense  that is the sense i mean drop all that other stuff i dont believe in you parsons you are about the worst lot going as far as i can see just tell me this doctor your sister is a very nice girl i have no doubt she would hardly have snapped up ned if she wasnt but why is she to have everything her own way  i do not understand  well listen here is a young woman who has had every chance in life that hick could give her silk cradles gold rattles rank wealth schooling travelling swell acquaintances and anything else she chose to ask for even when she is fool enough to want to get married her luck sticks to her and she catches ned who is a man in a thousandthough lord forbid we should have many of his sort about yet shes not satisfied she wants me to give up my establishment just to keep her family in countenance  she knows nothing of my visit i assure you  even if she doesnt it makes no odds as to the facts she can go her own way and i will go mine i shant want to visit her and i dont suppose she will visit me so she need trouble herself no more than if there was no such person as i in the world  but you will find that it will be greatly to your advantage to leave this house it is not our intention that you shall suffer in a pecuniary point of view by doing so my father is rich  what is that to me he doesnt want me to go and live with him does he  you quite misunderstand me no such idea ever entered  there go on i only said that to get a rise out of you doctor how do you make out that i should gain by leaving this house  my father is willing to make you some amends for the withdrawal of such portion of marmadukes income as you may forfeit by ceasing your connexion with him  you have come to buy me out in fact is that it what a clever old man your father must be knows the world thoroughly eh  i hope i have not offended you  bless you doctor nobody could be offended with you suppose i agree to oblige you you have a very seductive high church way about you who is to make marmaduke amends for such portion of my income as our separation will deprive him of eh i see that that staggers you a little if you will just tot up the rent of this house since we have had it the price of the furniture our expenses including my carriage and marmadukes horse and the boat six hundred pounds of debt that he ran up before he settled down with me and other little things and then find out from his father how much money he has drawn within the last two years i think you will find it rather hard to make the two balance your uncle is far too good a man to give marmaduke money to spend on me but he was not too good to keep me playing in the provinces all through last autumn just to make both ends meet when i ought to have been taking my holiday i wish you would tell his mother your blessed pious aunt dora to send bob the set of diamonds his grandmother left him instead of sermons which he never reads  i thought marmaduke had nearly a thousand a year independently of his father  a thousand a year what is that and your uncle would stop even that if he could to keep it out of my hands you may tell him that if it didnt come into my hands it would hardly last a week only for the child and the garden and the sort of quiet life he leads here he would spend a thousand a month and look at my expenses look at my dresses i suppose you think that people wear cotton velvet and glazed calico on the stage as mrs siddons did in the old days when they acted by candlelight why between dress and jewellery i have about two hundred pounds on my back at the present moment and you neednt think that any manager alive will find dresses to that tune at the theatre they think me overpaid at fifty pounds a week although they might shut up the house tomorrow if my name was taken out of the bills tell your father that so far from my living on bob it is as much as i can do to keep this place going by my worknot to mention the worry of it which always falls on the woman  i certainly had no idea of the case being as you describe said the clergyman losing his former assurance but would it not then be better for you to separate  certainly not i want my house and home so does he if an income is rather tight halving it is a very good way to make it tighter no if i left bob he would go to the devil and very likely i should go to the devil too and disgrace you in earnest  but my dear madam consider the disgrace at present  what disgrace when your sister becomes mrs ned what will be the difference between her position and mine dont look aghast what will be the difference  surely you do not suppose that she will dispense with the sacrament of marriage before casting in her lot with your brother  i bet you my next weeks salary that you dont get ned to enter a church he will be tied up by a registrar of course your sister will have the law of him somehow she cant help herself she is not independent and so she must be guaranteed against his leaving her without bread and butter i can support myself and may shew bob a clean pair of heels tomorrow if i choose even if she has money of her own she darent stick to her freedom for fear of society i snap my fingers at society and care as little about it as it cares about me and i have no doubt she would be glad to do the same if she had the pluck i confess i shouldnt like to make a regular legal bargain of going to live with a man i dont care to make love a matter of money it gives it a taste of the harem or even worse poor bob meaning to be honorable offered to buy me in the regular way at st georges hanover square before we came to live here but of course i refused as any decent woman in my circumstances would understand me now doctor i dont want to give myself any virtuous airs or to boast of behaving better than your sister i know the world and i know that she will marry ned just as much because she thinks it right as because she cant help herself but dont you try to make me swallow any gammon about my disgracing you and so forth i intend to stay as i am i can respect myself and i dont care whether you or your family respect me or not if you dont approve of me why nobody asks you to associate with me if you want society you have your own lot to mix with if i want it i can fill this house tomorrow not with stupid fine ladies but with really clever people who are not at all shy of me look at me at the present moment i am receiving a morning visit from the best born and most popular parson in belgravia i wonder doctor what your parishioners would think if they could see you now  i must confess that i do not understand you at all you seem to see everything reversedupside down youiyou bewilder me miss conol  sh mademoiselle lalage virtue if you please or you may call me susanna if you like since we are as good as related  i fear said the clergyman blushing that we have no common ground on which to argue i am sorry i have no power to influence you  oh dont say that i really like you doctor and would do more for you than most people if your father had had the cheek to come himself to offer me money and so forth i would have put him out of the house double quick whereas i have listened to you like a lamb never mind your hat yet have a bottle of champagne with me  thank you no  dont you drink at all  no  you should it would give a fillip to your sermons let me send you a case of champagne promise to drink a bottle every sunday in the vestry before you come out to preach and i will take a pew for the season in your church thats good of me isnt it  i must go said the rev george rising after hastily pretending to look at his watch will you excuse me  nonsense she said rising also and slipping her hand through his arm to detain him wait and have some luncheon why doctor i really think youre afraid of me do stay  impossible i have much business which i am boundpray let me go pleaded the clergyman piteously ineffectually struggling with susanna who had now got his arm against her breast you must be mad he cried drops of sweat breaking out on his brow as he felt himself being pulled helplessly toward the ottoman she got her knee on it at last and he made a desperate effort to free himself  oh how rough you are she exclaimed in her softest voice adroitly tumbling into the seat as if he had thrown her down and clinging to his arms so that it was as much as he could do to keep his feet as he stooped over her striving to get upright at which supreme moment the door was opened by marmaduke who halted on the threshold to survey the two reproachfully for a moment then he said  george im astonished at you i have not much opinion of parsons as a rule but i really did think that you were to be depended on  marmaduke said the clergyman colouring furiously and almost beside himself with shame and anger you know perfectly well that i am actuated in coming here by no motive unworthy of my profession you misunderstand what you have seen i will not hear my calling made a jest of  quite right doctor said susanna giving him a gentle pat of encouragement on the shoulder defend the cloth always i was only asking him to stay to lunch bob cant you persuade him  do old fellow said marmaduke come you must i havnt had a chat with you for ever so long im really awfully sorry i interrupted you what on earth did you make susanna rig herself out like that for  hold your tongue bob mr george has nothing to do with my being in character this is what came last night in the box i could not resist trying it on this morning i am zobeida the light of the harem if you please i must have your opinion of the rouge song doctor observe this is a powder puff i suppose you never saw such a thing before i am making up my face for a visit of the sultan and i am apologizing to the audience for using cosmetics the original french is improper so i will give you the english version by the celebrated robinson the cleverest adapter of the day    poor odalisques in captive thrall   must never let their charms pall     if they get the sack     they neer come back   for the bosphorus is the boss for all   in this harem harem harem harem harum scarum place  intellectual isnt it  susanna whilst singing executed a fantastic slow dance stopping at certain points to clink a pair of little cymbals attached to her ankles and to look for a moment archly at the clergyman  no he said hurt and offended into a sincerity of manner which compelled them to respect him for the first time i will not stay and i am very sorry i came and he left the room his cheeks tingling marmaduke followed him to the gate come and look us up soon again old fellow he said  marmaduke said the clergyman you are travelling as fast as you can along the road to hell  as he hurried away marmaduke leaned against the gate and made the villas opposite echo his laughter  on my soul its a shame said he when he returned to the house poor old george  he found no worse than he had made up his mind to find said susanna what right has he to come into my house and take it for granted to my face that i am a disgrace to his sister one would think i was a common woman from the streets  pshaw what does he know he is only a mollycoddling parson poor fellow he will give them a rare account of you when he goes back  let him said susanna he can tell them how little i care for their opinion anyhow  the rev george took the next train to the city and went to the offices of the electromotor company where he found his father they retired together to the boardroom which was unoccupied just then  i have been to that woman said the clergyman  well what does she say  she is an entirely abandoned person she glories in her shame i have never before met with such an example of complete and unconscious depravity yet she is not unattractive there is a wonderfully clever refinement even in her coarseness which goes far to account for her influence over marmaduke  no doubt but apart from her personal charms about which i am not curious is she willing to assist us  no i could make no impression on her at all  well it cannot be helped did you say anything about conollys selling his interest here and leaving the country  no said the clergyman struck with a sense of remissness i forgot that the fact is i hardly had the oppor  never mind it is just as well that you did not it might have made mischief  i do not think it is of the least use to pursue her with any further overtures besides i really could not undertake to conduct them  may i ask said mr lind turning on him suddenly what objection you have to marians wishes being consulted in this matter  the rev george recoiled speechless  i certainly think said mr lind more smoothly that marian might have trusted to my indulgence instead of hurrying away to a lodging and writing the news in all directions but i must say i have received some very nice letters about it jasper is quite congratulatory the court journal has a paragraph this week alluding to it with quite good taste conolly is a very remarkable man and as the court journal truly enough remarks he has won a high place in the republic of art and science as a liberal i cannot say that i disapprove of marians choice and i really think that it will be looked on in society as an interesting one  mr linds son eyed him dubiously for quite a long time then he said slowly am i to understand that i may now speak of the marriage as a recognized thing  why not pray  of course since you wish it and it cannot be helped the clergyman again looked at his father still more dubiously he saw in his eye that there would be a quarrel if the interview lasted much longer so he said i must go home now i have to write my sermon for next sunday  very good do not let me detain you goodbye  the rev george returned to his rooms quite dazed by the novelty of his sensations he had always respected his father beyond other men and now he knew that his father did not deserve his respect in the least that was one conviction uprooted and susanna had done something to himhe did not exactly know what but he felt altogether a different man from the clergyman of the day before he had come face to face with what he called vice for the first time and found it not at all what he had supposed it to be he had believed that he knew it to be most dangerously attractive to the physical but utterly repugnant to the moral sense and such fascination he was prepared to resist to the utmost but he was attacked in just the opposite way and thereby so thrown off his guard that he did not know he was attacked at all so that he told himself vaingloriously that the shafts of the enemy had fallen harmlessly from his breastplate of faith for he was not in the least charmed by susannas person he had detected the paint on her cheeks and had noted with aversion a certain unhealthy bloat in her face and an alcoholic taint in her breath he exulted in the consciousness that he had been genuinely disgusted not as a matter of duty but unaffectedly as a matter of simple nature what interested him in her was her novel and bold moral attitude her selfrespect in the midst of her sin her striking arguments in favor of an apparently indefensible course of life hers was no common case of loose living he felt there was a soul to be saved there if only heaven would raise her up a friend in some man absolutely proof against the vulgar fascination of her prettiness he began to imagine a certain greatness of character about her a capacity for heroic repentance as well as for heroic sin before long he was amusing himself by thinking how it might have gone with her if she had him for her counsellor instead of a gross and thoughtless rake like marmaduke  it is not necessary to follow the wild goose chase which the rev georges imagination ran from this startingpoint to the moment when he was suddenly awakened by an unmistakable symptom to the fact that he was being outwitted and beglamoured like the utter novice he was by a power which he believed to be the devil he rushed to the little oratory he had arranged with a screen in the corner of his sittingroom and prayed aloud long and earnestly but the hypnotizing process did not tranquilize him as usual it excited him and led him finally to a passionate appeal for pardon and intercession to a statuet of the virgin mother of whom he was a very devout adorer he had always regarded himself as her especial champion in the church of england and now he had been faithless to her and indelicate into the bargain and yet in spite of his contrition he felt that he was having a tremendous spiritual experience which he would not for worlds have missed the climax of it was the composition of his sunday sermon the labor of which secured him a sound sleep that night it was duly delivered on the following sunday morning in this form  dearly beloved brethren in the twentythird verse of the third chapter of st marks gospel we find this question how can satan cast out satan how can satan cast out satan if you will read what follows you will perceive that that question was not answered my brethren it is unanswerable it never has been and it never can be answered  in these latter days when the power of satan has become so vast when his empire and throne tower in our midst so that the faithful are cast down by the exceeding great shadow thereof and when temples innumerable are open for his worship it is no strange thing that many fainthearted ones should give half their hearts to beelzebub and should hope by the prince of devils to cast out devils yes this is what is taking place daily around us oh you who seek to excuse this book to infidel philosophers by shewing with how much facility a glib tongue may reconcile it with their socalled science i tell you that it is science and not the bible that shall need that apology in the great day of wrath and therefore i would have you my brethren earnestly discountenance all endeavors to justify the word of god by explaining it in conformity with the imaginations of the men of science how can satan cast out satan he cannot but he can lead you into the sin of adding to and of taking from the words of this book he can add plagues unto you and take away your part out of the holy city  in this great london which we inhabit we are come upon evil days the rage of the blasphemer the laugh at the scoffer the heartless lipservice of the worldling and the light dalliance of the daughters of music are offered every hour upon a thousand baalaltars within this very parish i would ask some of you who spend your evenings in the playhouses which multiply around us like weeds sown in the rank soil of human frailty what justification you make to yourselves when you are alone in the watches of the night and your conscience saith what went ye out for to see you will then complain of the bitterness of life and prate of the refining influences of music of the help to spiritualmindedness given by the exhibition on the public stage of mockeries of gods world wherein some pitiful temporal triumph of simulated virtue in the last act is the apology for the vicious trifling that has gone before and in whom do you there see typified that virtue which you should shield in your hearts from the contamination of the theatre is it not in some woman whose private life is the scandalous matter of your whispered conversations and whose shameless face smirks at you from the windows of those pictureshops which are a disgrace to our national morality is it from such as she that you will learn to be spiritualminded does she appear before your carnal crowds repentant her forehead covered with ashes her limbs covered with sackcloth no her brow is glowing with unquenchable fire to kindle the fuel that the devil has hidden in your hearts her raiment is cloth of gold and she is not covered with it naked and unashamed she smiles and weeps in mockery of the virtue which you would persuade yourselves that she represents to you will you learn spiritualmindedness from the sight of her eyes from the sound of her mouth from the measure of her steps or from the music and the dancing that cease not within the doors of her temple how can satan cast out satan whom think ye to deceive by whitening the sepulchre is it yourselves the devil has blinded you already is it god who shall hide anything from him i tell you that he who makes the pursuit of virtue a luxury and takes refuge from sin not before the altar but in the playhouse is casting out devils by beelzebub the prince of the devils  as i look about me in this church i see many things intended to give pleasure to the carnal eye were the cost of all these dainty robes this delicate headgear these clouds of silk of satin of lace and of sparkling jewels were the price of these things brought into the churchs treasury how loudly might the gospel resound in lands between whose torrid shores and the tropical sun the holy shade of calvary has not yet fallen but you will say it is a good thing to be comely in the house of the lord the sight of what is beautiful elevates the mind uncleanness is a vice this then is how you will war with uncleanness not by prayer and holy living not by pouring of your superfluity into the lap of the poor and entering by the strait gate upon the narrow path in a garment without seam no by the dead and damning gold by the purple and by the scarlet by the brightness of the eyes that is born of new wine by the mincing gait and the gloved fingers and by the musk and civet instead of the myrrh and frankincense by these things are you fain to purge your uncleanness and will they suffice can satan cast out satan beware for though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the lord god there shall come a day when your lace and feathers shall hang on you as heavy as your chains of gold to drag you down to him in whose name you have thought to cast out devils do not think that these things are harmless vanities nothing can fill the human heart and be harmless if your thoughts be not of god they will keep your minds distraught from his grace as effectually as the blackest broodings of crime can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without number saith the lord god yes your minds are too puny to entertain the full worship of god do you think they are spacious enough to harbor the worship of baal side by side with it much less dare you pretend that the baal altar is erected for the honor of god that you may come into his presence comely and clean it is but a few days since i stood in the presence of a woman who boasted to me that she bore upon her the value of two hundred pounds of our money i cared little for the value of money that was upon her but what shall be said of the weight of sin her attire represented for those costly garments were the wages of sinof hardened shameless damnable sin yet there is not before me a finer dress or a fairer face will you my sisters trust to the comeliness of visage and splendor of raiment in which such a woman as this can outshine you will you continue to cast out your devils by beelzebub the prince of devils be advised whilst there is yet time ask yourself again and again how can satan cast out satan  when sin is committed in a great city for wages is there no fault on the side of those who pay the wages there is more than fault there is crime i trust there are few among you who have done such crime but i know full well that it may be said of london today thou art full of stirs a joyous city thy slain men are not slain with the sword nor dead in battle no our young men are slain by the poison of beelzebub the prince of the devils nor is the crafty old subterfuge lacking here there are lost ones in this town who say it is by our means that virtue is preserved to the rich it is we who appease the wicked rage which would otherwise wreck society there are men who boast that they have brought their sins only to the houses of shame and that they have respected purity in the midst of their foulness such things must be they say let us alone lest a worse thing ensue when they are filled full with sin they cry lo our appetite has gone from us and we are clean they are willing to slake lust with satiety but not to combat it with prayer they tread one woman into the mire and excuse themselves because the garment of her sister is spotless how vain is this lying homage to virtue how can satan cast out satan  oh my brethren this hypocrisy is the curse and danger of our age the atheist no longer an execration an astonishment a curse and a reproach poses now as the friend of man and the champion of right those who incur the last and most terrible curse in this book do so in the name of that truth for which they profess to be seeking art profanely veiling its voluptuous nakedness with the attributes of religion disguises folly so subtly that it seems like virtue in the slothful eyes of those who neglect continually to watch and pray the vain woman puts on her ornaments to do honor to her creators handiwork the lustful man casts away his soul that society may be kept clean there is not left in these latter days a sin that does not pretend to work the worlds salvation nor a man who flatters not himself that the sin of one may be the purging of many to such i say look to your own soul of no other shall any account be demanded of you a day shall come in which a fire shall be kindled among your gods the lord shall array himself with this land as a shepherd putteth on his garment be sure that then if ye shall say i am a devil but i have cast out many devils he will reply unto you how can satan cast out satan who shall prompt you to an answer to that question nay though in his boundless mercy he give you a thousand years to search and spread before you all the books of science and sociology in which you were wont to find excuses for sin what will it avail you will a scoff or a quibble over a doubtful passage serve your turn no you cannot scoff whilst your tongue cleaves to the roof of your mouth for fear and there will be no passage doubtful in all the scriptures on that day for the light of the lords countenance will be over all things     book iii     chapter xii   one sunday afternoon as the sun was making rainbows in the cloud of spray thrown from the fountain in kew gardens sholto douglas appeared there amongst the promenaders on the banks of the pond he halted on the steps leading down to the basin gazing idly at the waterfowl paddling at his feet a lady in a becoming grey dress came to the top of the steps and looked curiously at him somehow aware of this he turned indifferently as if to leave and found that the lady was marian her ripened beauty her perfect selfpossession a gain in her as of added strength and wisdom and a loss in her as of gentleness outgrown and timidity overcome dazzled him for a momentcaused a revulsion in him which he half recognized as the beginning of a dangerous passion his former love for her suddenly appeared boyish and unreal to him and this ruin of a once cherished illusion cost him a pang meanwhile there she was holding out her hand and smiling with a cool confidence in the success of her advance that would have been impossible to marian lind  how do you do she said  thank you i am fairly well you are quite well i hope  i am in rude health i hardly knew you at first  am i altered  you are growing stout  indeed time has not been so bounteous to me as to you  you mean that i am stouter than you she laughed and the sound startled him he got from it an odd impression that her soul was gone but he hastened to protest  no no you know i do not i meant that you have achieved the impossiblealtered for the better  i am glad you think so i cling to my good looks desperately now that i am growing matronly how is mrs douglas  she is quite well thank you mr conolly is i trust  he is suffering from eucalyptus on the brain at present do not trouble yourself to maintain that admirable expression of shocked sadness eucalyptus means gumtree and ned is at present studying the species somewhere in the neighborhood he came here with that object he never goes anywhere without an object he wants to plant eucalyptuses round some new works where the people suffer from ague  oh you mean that he is here in the gardens  yes i left him among the trees as i prefer the flowers i want to see the lilies there used to be some in a hothouse or rather a hot bath near this  that is it on our right may i go through it with you  just as you please  thank you it is a long time since we last met is it not  more than a year fifteen months i have not seen you since i was married  douglas looked rather foolish at this he was fatter lazier altogether less tenacious of his dignity than of old and his embarrassment brought out the change strikingly marian liked him all the better for it he was less imposing but he was more a man and less a mere mask at last reddening a little he said i remember our last meeting very well we were very angry then i was infuriated in fact when i recognized you a minute ago i was not quite sure that you would renew our acquaintance  i had exactly the same doubt about you  a very unnecessary doubt not a sincere one i am afraid you know too well that your least beck will bring me to you at any time  dont you think we had better not begin that i generally repeat my conversations to ned not that he will mind if you dont  douglas now felt at his ease and in his clement he was clearly welcome to philander recovering his poise at once he began in his finest voice you need not chide me there can be no mistake on my part now you can entangle me without fear and i can love without hope ned is an unrepealed statute of forbiddance go on mrs conolly play with me it will amuse you andspiritless wretch that i amit will help me to live until you throw me away crushed again  you seem to have been quite comfortable without me at least you look extremely well i suspect you are becoming a little lazy and attached to your dinner your old haughtiness seems to have faded into a mere habit it used to be the most active principle in you are you quite sure that nobody else has been helping you to live as you call it  helping me to forget you mean no not one time has taught me the way to vegetate and so i no longer need to live as you have remarked i have habits not active principles but one at least of these principles is blossoming again even as i speak if i could only live as that lily lives now  in a warm bath  no floating on the surface of a quiet pool looking up into your eyes with no memory for the past no anticipation of the future  delightful especially for me i think we had better go and look for ned  were i in his place i would not be absent from your side nowor ever  that is to say if you were in his place you wouldnt be in his placeamong the gum trees perhaps you would be right  he is the only man i have ever stooped to envy  you have reason to said marian suddenly grave  i envy him sometimes myself what would you give to be never without a purpose never with a regret to regard life as a succession of objects each to be accomplished by so many days work to take your pleasure in trifling lazily with the consciousness of possessing a strong brain to study love family affection and friendship as a doctor studies breathing or digestion to look on disinterestedness as either weakness or hypocrisy and on death as a mere transfer of your social function to some member of the next generation  i could achieve all that if i would at the cost of my soul i would not for worlds be such a man save on one condition  to wit  that only as such could i win the woman i loved  oh you would not think so much of an insignificant factor like love if you were ned  may i ask do you too think of love as an insignificant factor  i oh i am not a sociologist besides i have never been in love  what you have never been in love  not the real romantic burning suicidal love your sonnets used to breathe  then you do not know what love is  do you  you should know whether i do or not  should i then i conclude that you do not you are growing stout your dress is not in the least neglected i am certain you enjoy life thoroughly no you have never known love in all its novelisticpoetic outrageousness that respectable old passion is a myth  you look for signs that only children shew when an oak dies it does not wither and fall at once as a sapling does perhaps you will one day know what it is to love  perhaps so  in any case you will be able to boast of having inspired the passion  i hope soat least i mean that it is all nonsense do look at that vegetable lobster of a thing that cactus  in order to set off its ugliness properly you should see yourself against the background of palms with that great fanlike leaf for a halo and  thank you i see it all in my minds eye by your eloquent description you are quite right in supposing that i like compliments but i am particular about their quality and i dont need to be told i am pretty in comparison with a hideous cactus you would not have condescended to make such a speech long ago you are changed  not toward you on my honor  i did not mean that i meant toward yourself  i am glad you have taken even that slender note of me i find you somewhat changed too  i did not know that i shewed it but it is true i feel as if marian lind was a person whom i knew once but whom i should hardly know again  the change in me has not produced that effect i feel as though marian lind were the history of my life  you have become quite a master of the art of saying pretty things you are nearly as glib at it as ned  we have the same incentive to admiration  the same you do not suppose that ned pays me compliments he never did such a thing in his life no i first discovered his talent in that direction at palermo where i surprised him in an animated discourse with the darkeyed daughter of an innkeeper there that was the first conversation in italian i succeeded in following a week later i could understand the language almost as well as he however dont let us waste the whole afternoon talking stuff i want to ask you about your mother i should greatly like to call upon her but she has never made me any sign since my marriage and mrs leith fairfax tells me that she never allows my name to be mentioned to her i thought she was fond of me  so she was but she has never forgiven you for making me suffer as you did you see she has more spirit than i she would be angered if she saw me now tamely following the triumphal chariot of my fair tyrant  seriously do you think if i made a raid on manchester square some morning i could coax back her old feeling for me  i think you will be quite safe in calling at all events tell me what day you intend to venture i know my mother will not oppose me if i shew that i wish you to be kindly received  most disinterested of you thank you i will fail or succeed on my own merits not on your recommendation you must not say a word to her about me or my project  if you command me not to  i do command you  i must obey but i fear that the more submissive i am the more imperious you will become  very likely and now look along that avenue to the left do you see a man in a brown suit with straw hat to match walking towards us at a regular pace and keeping in a perfectly straight course he looks at everybody he passes as if he were counting them  he is looking back at somebody now as if he had missed the number  just so but that somebody is a woman doubtless a pretty one probably dark you recognize him i see there is a frost come over you which convinces me that you are preparing to receive him in your old ungracious way i warn you that i am accustomed to see ned made much of he has caught sight of us  and has just remarked that there is a man talking to his wife  quite right see his speculative air now he no longer attends to us he is looking at the passersby as before that means that he has recognized you and has stowed the observation compactly away in his brain to be referred to when he comes up to us  so much method must economize his intellect very profitably how do you do mr conolly it is some time since we have had the pleasure of meeting  glad to see you mr douglas we have been away all the winter are you staying in london  yes  i hope you will spend an occasional hour with us at holland park  you are very kind thank you yes if mrs conolly will permit me  i should make you come home with us now said marian but for this sunday being a special occasion nelly mcquinch is to spend the evening with us and as i have not seen her since we came back i must have her all to myself come next sunday if you care to  do said conolly half past three is our sunday hour if you cannot face that we are usually at home afterwards the entire evening marian we have exactly fifteen minutes to catch our train  oh let us fly if we miss it nelly will be kept waiting half an hour  then they parted douglas promising to come to them on that day week  dont you think he is growing very fat said she as they walked away  yes he is beginning to take the world easily he does not seem to be making much of his life  what matter so long as he enjoys it  pooh he doesnt know what enjoyment means  they said nothing further until they were in the train where marian sat looking listlessly through the window whilst conolly opposite reclining against the cushions looked thoughtfully at her  ned said she suddenly  my dear  do you know that sholto is more infatuated about me than ever  naturally you are lovelier than when he last saw you  you are nearly as complimentary as he said marian blushing with a gratification which she was very unwilling to betray he noticed it sooner than you i discovered it myself in the glass before either of you  no doubt you did what station is this  i dont know then raising her voice so as to be overheard she exclaimed here is a stupid man coming into our carriage  a young man entered the compartment and after one glance at marian who turned her back on him impatiently spent the remainder of the journey making furtive attempts to catch a second glimpse of her face conolly looked a shade graver at his wifes failure in perfect selfcontrol but he by no means shared her feelings toward the intrusive passenger marian and he were in different humors and he did not wish to be left alone with her  as they walked from addison road railway station to their house conolly mused in silence with his eyes on the gardens by the way marian who wished to talk followed his measured steps with impatience  let me take your arm ned i cannot keep up with you  certainly  i hope i am not inconveniencing you she said after a further interval of silence  hmno  i am afraid i am it does not matter i can get on by myself  arm in arm is such an inconvenient and ridiculous mode of locomotionyou need not struggle in the public street now that you have got my arm you shall keep iti say it is such an inconvenient and ridiculous mode of locomotion that if you were any one else i should prefer to wheel you home in a barrow our present mode of proceeding would be inexcusable if i were a tractionengine and you my tender  then let me go what will the people think if they see a great engineer violating the laws of mechanics by dragging his wife by the arm  they will appreciate my motives and in fact if you watch them you will detect a thinlydisguised envy in their countenances i violate the laws of mechanicsto use your own sarcastic phrasefor many reasons i like to be envied when there are solid reasons for it it gratifies my vanity to be seen in this artistic quarter with a pretty woman on my arm again the sense of possessing you is no longer an abstraction when i hold you bodily and feel the impossibility of keeping step with you besides man who was a savage only yesterday has his infirmities and finds a poetic pleasure in the touch of the woman he loves and i may add that you have been in such a bad temper all the afternoon that i suspect you of an itching to box my ears and therefore feel safer with your arm in my custody  oh indeed i have not been in a bad temper i have been most anxious to spend a happy day  and i have been placidly reflective and not anxious at all is that what has provoked you  i am not provoked but you might tell me what your reflections are about  they would fill volumes if i could recollect them  you must recollect some of them from the time we left the station until a moment ago when we began to talk you were pondering something with the deepest seriousness what was it  i forget  of course you forgetjust because i want to know what a crowded road this is she disengaged herself from his arm and this time he did not resist her  that reminds me of it the crowd consists partly of people going to the procathedral the procathedral contains an altar an altar suggests kneeling on hard stone and that brings me to the disease called housemaids knee which was the subject of my reflections  a pleasant subject for a fine sunday thank you i dont want to hear any more  but you will hear more of it for i am going to have the steps of our house taken away and replaced by marble or slate or something that can be cleaned with a mop and a pail of water in five minutes  why  my chain of thought began at the door steps we have passed all whitened beautifully so as to display every footprint and all representing an expenditure of useless injurious labor in hearthstoning that ought to madden an intelligent housemaid i dont think our armande is particularly intelligent but i am resolved to spare her knees and her temper in future by banishing hearthstone from our establishment forever i shudder to think that i have been walking upon those white steps and flag ways of ours every day without awakening to a sense of their immorality  i cannot understand why you are always disparaging armande and i hate an illkept house front none of our housemaids ever objected to hearthstoning or were any the worse for it  no they would not have gained anything by objecting they would only have lost their situations you need not fear for your house front i will order a porch with porphyry steps and alabaster pillars to replace your beloved hearthstone  yes that will be clever do you know how easy it is to stain marble armande will be on her knees all day with a bottle of turpentine and a bit of flannel  you are thinking of inkstains marian you forget that it does not rain ink and that nelly will hardly select the porch to write her novels in  lots of people bring ink on a doorstep tax collectors and gasmen carry bottles in their pockets  ask them into the drawingroom when they call my dear or better still dont pay them so that they will have no need to write a receipt let me remind you that ink shews as much on white hearthstone as it can possibly do on marble yet extensive disfigurements of steps from the visits of tax collectors are not common  now ned you know that you are talking utter nonsense  yes my dear i think i perceive nelly looking out of the window for us here she is at the door  marian hastened forward and embraced her cousin miss mcquinch looked older and her complexion was drier than before but she had apparently begun to study her appearance for her hat and shoes were neat and even elegant which they had never been within marians previous experience of her  you are not changed in the least she said as she gave conolly her hand i have just been wondering at the alteration in marian she has grown lovely  i have been telling her so all day in the vain hope of getting her into a better temper come into the drawingroom have you been waiting for us long  about fifteen minutes i have been admiring your organ i should have tried the piano but i did not know whether that was allowable on sunday  oh why did you not pound it to your hearts content ned scandalizes the neighbors every sunday by continually playing armande dinner as soon as possible please  i like this house it is exactly my idea of a comfortable modern home  you must stay long enough to find out its defects said conolly we read your novel at verona but we could not agree as to which characters you meant to be taken as the good ones  that was only neds nonsense said marian most novels are such rubbish i am sure you will be able to live by writing just as well as mrs fairfax can conolly shewed miss mcquinch his opinion of this unhappy remark by a whimsical glance which she repudiated by turning sharply away from him and speaking as affectionately as she could to marian  after dinner they returned to the drawingroom which ran from the front to the back of the house marian opened a large window which gave access to the garden and sat down with elinor on a little terrace outside conolly went to the organ  may i play a voluntary while you talk he asked i shall not scandalize any one the neighbors think all music sacred when it is played on the organ  we have a nice view of the sunset from here said marian in a low voice turning her forehead to the cool evening breeze  stuff said elinor we didnt come here to talk about the sunset and what a pretty house you have and so forth i want to knowgood heavens what a thundering sound that organ makes  please dont say anything about it to him he likes it said marian when he wishes to exalt himself he goes to it and makes it roar until the whole house shakes whenever he feels an emotional impulse he vents it at the organ or the piano or by singing when he stops he is satisfied his mind is cleared and he is in a goodhumored playful frame of mind such as i can gratify  but you were always very fond of music dont you ever play together as we used to do or sing to one anothers accompaniments  i cannot i hardly ever touch the piano when he is in the house  why are you afraid of preventing him from having his turn  no it is not so much that butit sounds very sillyif i attempt to play or sing in his presence i become so frightfully nervous that i hardly know what i am doing i know he does not like my singing  are you sure that is not merely your fancy it sounds very like it  no at first i used to play a good deal for him knowing that he was fond of music and fancyingpoor fool that i was here marian spoke so bitterly that nelly turned and looked hard at her that it was part of a married womans duty in a house to supply music after dinner at that time he was working hard at his business and he spent so much time in the city that he had to give up playing himself besides we were flying all about england opening those branch offices and what not he always took me with him and i really enjoyed it and took quite an interest in the company when we were in london although i was so much alone in the daytime i was happy in anticipating our deferred honeymoon then the time for that paradise came ned said that the company was able to walk by itself at last and that he was going to have a long holiday after his drynursing of it we went first to paris where we heard all the classical concerts that were given while we were there i found that he never tired of listening to orchestral music and yet he never ceased grumbling at it he thought nothing of the great artists in paris then we went for a tour through brittany and there in spite of his classical tastes he used to listen to the peasants songs and write them down he seemed to like folk songs of all kinds irish scotch russian german italian no matter where from so one evening at a lodging where there was a piano i played for him that old arrangement of irish melodiesyou knowirish diamonds it is called  oh lord yes i remember believe me if all with variations  yes he thought i meant it in jest he laughed at it and played a lot of ridiculous variations to burlesque it i didnt tell him that i had been in earnest perhaps you can imagine how i felt about it then after that in italy he got permissionor rather bought itto try the organ in a church it was growing dusk i was tired with walking and somehow between the sense of repose and the mysterious twilight in the old church i was greatly affected by his playing i thought it must be part of some great mass or symphony and i felt how little i knew about music and how trivial my wretched attempts must appear to him when he had such grand harmonies at his fingers ends but he soon stopped and when i was about to tell him how i appreciated his performance he said what an abominable instrument a bad organ is i had thought it beautiful of course i asked him what he had been playing i said was it not by mozart and then i saw his eyebrows go up so i added as a saving clause that perhaps it was something of his own my dear girl said he it was only an entracte from an opera of donizettis he was carrying my shawl at the time and he wrapped it about my shoulders in the tenderest manner as he said this and made love to me all the evening to console me in his opinion the greatest misfortune that can happen anyone is to make a fool of oneself and whenever i do it he pets me in the most delicate manner as if i were a child who had just got a tumble when we settled down here and got the organ he began to play constantly and i used to practise the piano in the daytime so as to have duets with him but though he was always ready to play whenever i proposed it he was quite different then from what he was when he played by himself he was all eyes and ears and the moment i played a wrong note he would name the right one then i generally got worse and stopped he never lost his patience or complained but i used to feel that he was urging me on or pulling me back or striving to get me to do something which i could not grasp then he would give me up in despair and play on mechanically from the notes before him thinking of something else all the time i practised harder and tried again i thought at first i had succeeded because our duets went so smoothly and we were always so perfectly together but i discoveredby instinct i believethat instead of having a musical treat he was only trying to please me he thought i liked playing duets with him and accordingly he used to sit down beside me and accompany me faithfully no matter how i chose to play  dear me why doesnt he get rubinstein to play with him since he is so remarkably fastidious  it is not so much mechanical skill that i lack but there is somethingi cannot tell what it is i found it out one night when we were at mrs saunderss she is an incurable flirt and she was quite sure that she had captivated ned who is always ready to make love to anyone that will listen to him  a nice sort of man to be married to  he only does it to amuse himself he does not really care for them i almost wish he did sometimes but it is often none the less provoking what is worse no amount of flirtation on my part would make him angry what happened at mrs saunderss was this the scotts of putney were there and the first remark ned made to me was who is the woman that knows how to walk it was mrs scott you know you used to say she moved like a panther afterward mrs scott sang caller herrin in that vulgar scotch accent that leaks out occasionally in her speech with ned at the piano everybody came crowding in to listen and there was great applause i cannot understand it she is as hard and matteroffact as a woman can be i dont believe the expression in her singing comes one bit from true feeling i heard ned say to her thank you mrs scott no englishwoman has the secret of singing a ballad as you have it i knew very well what that meant i have not the secret well mrs scott came over to me and said mr conolly is a very pairtinaceous man he persuaded me into shewing him the way the little song is sung in scotland and i stood up without thinking and see now i have been raguilarly singing a song in company for the first time in my life of course it was a ridiculous piece of affectation ned talked about mrs scott all the way home and played caller herrin four times next day that finished my domestic musical career i have never sung for him since except once or twice when he has asked me to try the effect of some passage in one of his musicbooks  and do you never sing when you go out as you used to  only when he is not with me or when people force me to if he is in the room i am so nervous that i can hardly get through the easiest song he never offers to accompany me now and generally leaves the room when i am asked to sing  perhaps he sees the effect his presence has on you  even so he ought to stay he used to like me to listen to him at first  miss mcquinch looked at the sunset with exceeding glumness there was an ominous pause then she said abruptly you remember how we used to debate whether marriage was a mistake or not have you found out  i dont know  that sounds rather as if you did know are you quite sure you are not in low spirits this evening he was bantering you about being out of temper when you came in perhaps you quarrelled at kew  quarrel he quarrel i cannot explain to you how we are situated nelly you would not understand me  suppose you try for instance is he as fond of you as he was before you married him  i dont know  miss mcquinch shrugged herself impatiently  really i do not nelly he has changed in a wayi do not quite know how or why at first he was not very ceremonious he used to make remarks about people and discuss everything that came into his head quite freely before me he was always kind and never grumbled about his dinner or lost his temper or anything of that kind butit was not that he was coarse exactly he was not that in the least but he was very open and unreserved and plain in his language and somehow i did not quite like it he must have found this out he sees and feels everything by instinct for he slipped back into his old manner and became more considerate and attentive than he had ever been before i was made very happy at first by the change but i do not think he quite understood what i wanted i did not at all object to going down to the country with him on his business trips but he always goes alone now and he never mentions his work to me and he is too careful as to what he says to me of course i know that he is right not to speak ill of anybody but still a man need not be so particular before his wife as before strangers he has given up talking to me altogether that is the plain truth whatever he may pretend when we do converse his manner is something like what it was in the laboratory at the towers of course he sometimes becomes more familiar only then he never seems in earnest but makes love to me in a bantering half playful half sarcastic way  you are rather hard to please perhaps i remember you used to say that a husband should be just as tender and respectful after marriage as before it you seem to have broken poor ned into this and now you are not satisfied  nelly if there is one subject on which girls are more idiotically ignorant than on any other it is happiness in marriage a courtier a lover a man who will not let the winds of heaven visit your face too harshly is very nice no doubt but he is not a husband i want to be a wife and not a fragile ornament kept in a glass case he would as soon think of submitting any project of his to the judgment of a doll as to mine if he has to explain or discuss any serious matter of business with me he does so apologetically as if he were treating me roughly  well my dear you see when he tried the other plan you did not like that either what is the unfortunate man to do  i dont know i suppose i was wrong in shrinking from his confidence i am always wrong it seems to me that the more i try to do right the more mischief i contrive to make  this is all pretty dismal marian what sort of conduct on his part would make you happy  oh there are so many little things he makes me jealous of everything and everybody i am jealous of the men in the cityi was jealous of the sanitary inspector the other daybecause he talks with interest to them i know he stays in the city later than he need it is a relief to me to go out in the evening or to have a few people here once or twice a week but i am angry because i know it is a relief to him too i am jealous even of that organ how i hale those bach fugues listen to the maddening thing twisting and rolling and racing and then mixing itself up into one great boom he can get on with bach he cant get on with me i have even condescended to be jealous of other womenof such women as mrs saunders he despises her he plays with her as dexterously as she thinks she plays with him but he likes to chat with her and they rattle away for a whole evening without the least constraint she has no conscience she talks absolute nonsense about art and literature she flirts even more disgustingly than she used to when she was belle woodward but she is quickwitted like most irish people and she enjoys a broad style of jesting which ned is a great deal too tolerant of though he would as soon die as indulge in it before me then there is mrs scott who is just as shrewd as belle and much cleverer i have heard him ask her opinion as to whether he had acted well or not in some stroke of businesssomething that i had never heard of of course i wish i were half as hard and strong and selfreliant as she is her husband would be nothing without her  i am afraid i was right all along marian marriage is a mistake there is something radically wrong in the institution if you and ned cannot be happy no pair in the world can  we might be very happy if marian stopped to repress a sob  anybody might be very happy if there is not much consolation in ifs you could not be better off than you are unless you could be marian lind again think of all the women who would give their souls to have a husband who would neither drink nor swear at them nor kick them nor sulk whenever he was kept waiting half a minute for anything you have no little pests of children  i wish i had that would give us some interest in common we sometimes have lucy marmadukes little girl up here and ned seems to me to be fond of her she is a very bold little thing  i saw marmaduke last week he is not half so jolly as he was  he lives in chambers in westminster now and only comes out in this direction occasionally to see lucy i am afraid she has taken to drinking i believe she is going to america i hope she is for she makes me uncomfortable when i think of her  does youryour ned ever speak of her  no he used to before he changed as i described now he never mentions her hush here he is  the sound of the organ had ceased and conolly came out and stood between them  how do you like my consoler as marian calls it said he  do you mean the organ  yes  i wasnt listening to you  you should have i played the great fugue in a minor expressly for your entertainment you used to work at liszts transcription of it the organ is only occasionally my consoler for the most part i am driven to it by habit and a certain itching in my fingers marian is my real consoler  so she has just been telling me said elinor conollys surprise escaped him for just a moment in a quick glance at marian she colored and looked reproachfully at her cousin who added i am sure you must be a nuisance to the neighbors  probably said conolly  i do not think you should play so much on sunday said marian  i know marian winced well if the neighbors will either melt down the church bells they jangle so horribly within fifteen yards or so of my unfortunate ears or else hang them up two hundred feet high in a beautiful tower where they would sound angelic as they do at utrecht then perhaps i will stop the organ to listen to them until then i will take the liberty of celebrating the day of rest with such devices as the religious folk cannot forbid me  pray do not begin to talk about religion ned  my way of thinking is too robust for marian miss mcquinch i admit that it does not at first sight seem pretty or sentimental but i do not know how even marian can prefer the church bells to bach  what do you mean by even marian said elinor sharply  i should have said marian who is tolerant and kind to everybody and everything i hope you have forgiven me for carrying her off from you miss mcquinch you are adopting an ominous tone toward me i fear she has been telling you of our quarrels and my many domestic shortcomings  no said elinor as far as i can judge from her account you are a monotonously amiable husband  indeed hm would you like your coffee out here  yes  do not stir marian i will ring for it  when he was gone marian said nelly for heavens sake say nothing that could make the slightest coldness between ned and me i am clinging to him with all my heart and soul and you must help me those sharp things that you say to him stab me cruelly and he is clever enough to guess everything i have said to you from them  if i cannot keep myself from making mischief i shall go away said elinor dont suppose i am in a huff i am quite serious i have an unlucky tongue and my disposition is such that when i see that a jug is cracked i feel more inclined to smash and have done with it than to mend it and handle it tenderly ever after however i hope your marriage is not a cracked jug yet     chapter xiii   on the following wednesday douglas called on his mother at manchester square in the afternoon as if to emphasize the purely filial motive of his visit he saluted his mother so affectionately that she was emboldened to be more demonstrative with him than she usually ventured to be  my darling boy she said holding him fondly for a moment this is the second visit you have paid your poor old mother this week i want to speak to you about something too marian has been with me this morning  what has she gone said douglas  why said mrs douglas did you know she was coming  she mentioned to me that she intended to come he replied carelessly but she bade me not to tell you  that accounts for your two visits well sholto i do not blame you for spending your time in gayer places than this  you must not reproach me for neglecting you mother you know my disposition i am seldom good company for any one and i do not care to come only to cast a damp on you and your friends when i am morose i hope you received marian kindly  i did not expect to see her and i told her so  mother  but it made no difference there is no holding her in check now sholto she cares no more for what i say than if i was her father or you what could i do but kiss and forgive her she got the better of me  yes said douglas gloomily she has a wonderful face  the less you see of her face the better sholto i hope you will not go to her house too often  do you doubt my discretion mother  no no sholto but i am afraid of any unpleasantness arising between you and that man these working men are so savage to their wives and so jealous of gentlemen i hardly like your going into his house at all  absurd mother you must not think that he is a navvy in fustian and corduroys he seems a sensible man his address is really remarkably good considering what he is as to his being savage he is quite the reverse his head is full of figures and machinery and i am told that he does nothing at home but play the piano he must bore marian terribly i do not want to go to his house particularly but marian and he are of course very sensitive to anything that can be construed as a slight and i shall visit them once or twice to prevent them from thinking that i wish to snub conolly he will be glad enough to have me at his dinnertable i am afraid i must hurry away now i have an appointment at the club can i do anything for you in town  no thank you sholto i thought you would have stayed with me for a cup of tea  thank you dear mother no not today i promised to be at the club  if you promised of course you must go goodbye you will come again soon will you not  some day next week if not sooner goodbye mother  douglas left manchester square not to go to his club where he had no real appointment but to avoid spending the afternoon with his mother who though a little hurt at his leaving her was also somewhat relieved by being rid of him they maintained toward one another an attitude which their friends found beautiful and edifying but like artists models they found the attitude fatiguing in spite of their practice and its dignity  at hyde park corner douglas heard his name unceremoniously shouted turning he saw marmaduke lind carelessly dressed walking a little behind him  where are you going to said marmaduke abruptly  why do you ask said douglas never disposed to admit the right of another to question him  i want to have a talk with you come and lunch somewhere will you  yes if you wish  lets go to the south kensington museum  the south my dear fellow why not suggest putney or the star and garter why do you wish to go westward from hyde park in search of luncheon  i have a particular reason i am to meet someone at the museum this afternoon and i want to ask your advice first you might as well come its only a matter of a few minutes if we drive  well as you please i have not been to the museum for years  all right come aloh damn theres lady carbury and constance coming out of the park dont look at them come on  but constance sitting a little more uprightly than her mother who was supine upon the carriage cushions had seen the two gentlemen as they stood talking  mamma she said theres marmaduke and sholto douglas  where said the countess lifting her head quickly josephs drive slowly where are they constance  they are going away i believe marmaduke saw us there he is passing the hospital  we must go and speak to them look pleasant child and dont make a fool of yourself  surely youll not speak to him mamma you dont expect me  nonsense i heard a great deal about him the other day he has moved from where he was living and is quite reformed his father is very ill do as i tell you josephs stop half way to the hotel  i say said marmaduke finding himself outmanoeuvred come back there they are right ahead confound them what are they up to  it cannot be helped said douglas there is no escape you must not cross it would be pointedly rude  marmaduke went on grumbling when he attempted to pass the countess called his name and greeted him with smiles  we want to know how your father is she said we have had such alarming accounts of him i hope he is better  they havnt told me much about him said marmaduke there was deuced little the matter with the governor when i saw him last  wicked prodigal what shall we do to reform him mr douglas he has not been to see us for three years past and during that time we have had the worst reports of him  you never asked me to go and see you  silly fellow did you expect me to send you invitations and leave cards on you who are one of ourselves come tomorrow to dinner your uncle the bishop will be there and you will see nearly all the family besides you cannot plead that you have not been invited now will you come  no i cant stand the bishop besides i have taken to dining in the middle of the day  come after dinner then  mamma said constance peevishly cant you see that he does not want to come at all what is the use of persecuting him  no i assure you said marmaduke its only the bishop i object to ill come after dinner if i can  and pray what is likely to prevent you said the countess  devilment of some sort perhaps he replied since you have all given me a bad name i dont see why i should make any secret of earning it  the countess smiled slyly at him implying that she was amused but must not laugh at such a sentiment in constances presence then turning so as to give the rest of the conversation an air of privacy she whispered i must tell you that you no longer have a bad name it is said that your wild oats are all sown and i will answer for it that even the bishop will receive you with open arms  and dry my repentant tears on his apron the old hypocrite said marmaduke speaking rather more loudly than before well we must be trotting we are going to the south kensington museumto improve our minds  why that is where we are going at least constance is she is going to work at her painting while i pay a round of visits wont you come with us  thank you id rather walk a man should have gloves and a proper hat for your sort of travelling  nonsense you look very nice besides it is only down the brompton road  the worst neighborhood in london to be seen in with me i know all sorts of queer people down brompton way i should have to bow to them if we met and that wouldnt do before herindicating constance who was conversing with douglas  you are incorrigible i give you up goodbye and dont forget tomorrow evening  i wonder said marmaduke as the carriage drove off what shes saying about me to constance now  that you are the rudest man in london perhaps  serve her right i hate her i have got so now that i cant stand that sort of woman you see her game dont you she cant get constance off her hands and she thinks theres a chance of me still how well she knows about the governors state of health and conny too grinning at me as if we were the best friends in the world if that girl had an ounce of spirit she would not look on the same side of the street with me  douglas without replying called a cab marmadukes loud conversation was irksome in the street and it was now clear that he was unusually excited at the museum they alighted and passed through the courts into the grillroom where they sat down together at a vacant table and ordered luncheon  you were good enough to ask my advice about something said douglas what is the matter  well said marmaduke i am in a fix affairs have become so uncomfortable at home that i have had to take up my quarters elsewhere  i did not know that you had been living at home i thought your father and you were on the usual terms  my father look here i mean homemy home my place at hammersmith not down at the governors  oh i beg your pardon  of course you know all about my establishment there with lalage virtue her real name is susanna conolly  is it true then that she is a cousin of marians husband  cousin shes his sister and marians sisterinlaw  i never believed it  its true enough but thats not the mischief douglas i tell you shes the cleverest woman in london she can do anything she likes she can manage a conversation with any foreigner in his own language whether she knows it or not she gabbles italian like a native she can learn off her part in a new piece music and all between breakfast and luncheon any day she can cook she can make a new bonnet out of the lining of an old coat she can drive a bargain with a jew she says she never learns a thing at all unless she can learn it in ten minutes she can fence and shoot she can dance anything in the world i never knew such a mimic as she is if you saw her take off the bones at the christy minstrels youd say she was the lowest of the low next minute she will give herself the airs of a duchess or do the ingenuous in a style that would make conny burst with envy to see her preaching like george would make you laugh for a week theres nothing she couldnt do if she chose and now what do you think she has taken to liquor champagne by the gallon she used to drink it by the bottle now she drinks it by the dozenby the case she wanted it to keep up her spirits that was the way it began if she felt down a glass of champagne would set her up then she was always feeling down and always setting herself up at last feeling down came to mean the same thing as being sober you dont know what a drunken woman is douglas unless youve lived in the same house with one douglas recoiled and looked very sternly at marmaduke who proceeded more vehemently shes nothing but a downright beast shes either screaming at you in a fit of rage or clawing at you in a fit of fondness that makes you sick when she falls asleep there she is a besotted heap tumbled anyhow into bed snoring and grunting like a pig when she wakes she begins planning how to get more liquor think of what you or i would feel if we saw our mothers tipsy by god that child of mine wouldnt believe its eyes if it saw its mother sober only for lucy id have pitched her over long ago i did all i could when i first saw that she was overdoing the champagne i swore id break the neck of any man i caught bringing wine into the house i sacked the whole staff of servants twice because i found a lot of fresh corks swept into the dustpan i stopped drinking at home myself i got in doctors to frighten her i tried bribing coaxing threatening i knocked her down once when i caught her with a bottle in her hand and she fell with her head against the fender and frightened me a good deal more than she hurt herself it was no use sometimes she used to defy me and say she would drink she didnt care whether she was killing herself or not other times she cried implored me to save her from destroying herself asked me why i didnt thrash the life out of her whenever i caught her drunk promised on her oath never to touch another drop the same evening she would be drunk again and when i taxed her with it say that she wasnt drunk that she was sick and that she prayed the almighty on her knees to strike her dead if she had a bottle in the house aye and the very stool she knelt on would be a wine case with a red cloth stuck to it with a few giltheaded nails to make it look like a piece of furniture next day she would laugh at me for believing her and ask me what use i supposed there was in talking to her how she managed to hold on at the theatre i dont know she wouldnt learn new parts and stuck to old ones that she could do in her sleep she knew them so well she would go on the stage and get through a long part when she couldnt walk straight from the wing to her dressingroom of course her voice went to the dogs long ago but by dint of screeching and croaking she pulls through she says she darent go on sober now that she knows she should break down the theatre has fallen off too the actors got out of the place one by onethey didnt like playing with herand were replaced by a thirdrate lot the audiences used to be very decent now they are all cads and fast women the game is up for her in london she has been offered an engagement in america on the strength of her old reputation but what is the use of it if she continues drinking  that is very sad said douglas with cold disgust perfunctorily veiled by a conventional air of sympathy but if she is irreclaimable why not leave her  so i would only for the child i have left herat least ive taken lodgings in town but i am always running out to laurel grove i darent trust lucy to her and she knows it for she wouldnt let me take the poor little creature away although she doesnt care two straws for it she knows that it gives her a grip over me well i have not seen her for a week past i have tried the trick of only going out in the evening when she has to be at the theatre and now she has sent me a long letter and i dont exactly know what to do about it she swears she has given up drinkingnot touched a spoonful since i saw her last shes as superstitious as an old woman and yet she will swear to that lie with oaths that make me uncomfortable although i am pretty thickskinned in religious matters then she goes drivelling on about me having encouraged her to drink at first and then turned upon her and deserted her when i found out the mischief i had done i used to stand plenty of champagne but i am sure i never thought what would come of it then she says she gave up every friend in the world for me broke with her brother and lost her place in society her place in society mind you douglas thats not bad is it then of course i am leaving her to die alone with her helpless child i might have borne with her a little longer she will not trouble me nor anyone else much more and so on the upshot is that she wants me to come back she says i ought to be there to save the child from her if i dont care to save her from herself that i was the last restraint on her and that if i dont come she will make an end of the business by changing her tipple to prussic acid the whole thing is a string of maudlin rot from beginning to end and i believe she primed herself with about four bottles of champagne to write it still i dont want to leave her in the lurch you are a man who stand pretty closely on your honor do you think i ought to go back i may tell you that as regards money she is under no compliment to me her earnings were a good half of our income and she saved nothing out of them in fact i owe her some money for two or three old debts she paid for me we always shared like husband and wife  i hardly understand your hesitation lind you can take the little girl out of her hands allow her something and be quit of her  thats very easy to say but i cant drag her child away from her if she insists on keeping it  well so much the better for you it would be a burden to you pay her for its maintenance that is probably what she wants  no no said marmaduke impatiently you dont understand youre talking as if i were a rake living with a loose woman  douglas looked at him doubtfully i confess i do not understand he said perhaps you will be good enough to explain  its very simple i went to live with her because i fell in love with her and she wouldnt marry me she had a horror of marriage and i was naturally not very eager for it myself matters must be settled between us as if we were husband and wife paying her off is all nonsense she doesnt want money and i want the child so she has the advantage of me only for the drink i would go back to her tomorrow but i cant stand her when she is not sober i bore with it long enough and now all i want is to get lucy out of her hands and be quit of her as you sayalthough it seems mean to leave her  she must certainly be a very extraordinary woman if she refused to marry you are you sure she is not married already  bosh not she she likes to be independent and she has a sort of selfrespectnot like constance and the old countess who hunted me long enough in the hope of running me down at last in a church  if you offered her marriage that certainly frees you from the least obligation to stay with her she reserved liberty to leave you and of course the same privilege was implied on your part if you have no sentimental wish to return to her you are most decidedly not bound in honor to  im fond enough of her when she is sober but i loathe her when she is fuddled if she would only give up drinking we might make a fresh start but she wont  you must not think of doing that get rid of her my dear fellow this marriage of marians has put the affair on a new footing altogether i tell you candidly i think that under the circumstances your connexion with conollys sister is a disgraceful one  hang conolly everybody thinks of marian and nobody of susanna i have heard enough of that side of the question marian married him with her eyes open  do you mean to say that she knew  of course she did conolly told her fairly enough hes an extraordinary card that fellow  reginald lind told my mother that the discovery was made by accident after the marriage and that they were all shocked by it it was he who said that it was conollys cousin that you were with  uncle rej is an old liar so are most of the family i never believe a word they say  marian must have been infatuated i advise you to break the connexion she will be glad to give you the child if she sees that you are resolved to leave her she only holds on because she hopes to make it the means of bringing you back  i expect youre about right she wants me to meet her here today at half past three thats the reason i came  do you know that it now wants twenty minutes of four  whew so it does i had better go and look for her im very much obliged to you old fellow for talking it over with me i suppose you dont want to meet her  i should be in the way at present  then goodbye  marmaduke leaving douglas in the grillroom went upstairs to the picture galleries where several students were more or less busy at their easels lady constance was in the sheepshanks gallery copying sternes maria by charles landseer as best she could she had been annoyed some minutes before by the behavior of a stout woman in a rich costume of black silk who had stopped for a moment to inspect her drawing lady constance by a look had made her aware that she was considered intrusive whereupon she had first stared lady constance out of countenance and then deliberately scanned her work with an expression which conveyed a low opinion of its merit having thus revenged herself she stood looking uneasily at the door for a minute and at last wandered away into the adjoining gallery a few minutes later marmaduke entered looking round as if in search of someone  here i am said constance to him playfully  so i see said marmaduke recognizing her with rueful astonishment you knew i was looking for you did you  of course i did sir  youre clever so you are what are you doing here  dont you see i am copying a picture  oh its very pretty which one are you copying  what an impertinent question you can tell my poor copy well enough only you pretend not to  yes now that i look closely at it i fancy its a little like mary the maid of the inn there  its not mary its mariasternes maria  indeed do you read sterne  certainly not said constance looking very serious  then what do you paint his maria for how do you know whether she is a fit subject for you  hush sir you must not interrupt my work  i suppose you have lots of fun here over your art studies eh  who  you and all the other girls here  oh i am sure i dont know any of them  quite right too your ladyship dont make yourself cheap i hope none of the low beggars ever have the audacity to speak to you  i dont know anything about them said lady constance pettishly all i mean is that they are strangers to me  most likely theyll remain so you all seem to stick to the little pictures tremendously why dont you go in for high art theres a big picture of adam and eve why dont you paint that  will you soon be leaving town she replied looking steadily at her work and declining to discuss adam and eve who were depicted naked receiving no reply she looked round and saw marmaduke leaving the room with the woman in the black silk dress  who is that girl said susanna as they went out  thats lady constance whom i was to have married  i guessed as much when i saw you talking to her she is a true english lady heaven bless her i took the liberty of looking at her painting and she stared at me as if i had bitten her  she is a little fool  she will not be such a little fool as to try to snub me again i think bob did you get my letter  of course i got it or i shouldnt be here  well  well i dont believe a word of it  thats plain speaking  there is no use mincing matters you are just as likely to stop drinking as you are to stop breathing  perhaps i shall stop breathing before long  very likely at your present rate  that will be a relief to you  it will be a relief to everybody and a release for yourself you have made me miserable for a year past and now you expect me to be frightened at the prospect of being rid of you  i dont expect you to be frightened i expect you to do what all men do throw me aside as soon as i have served your turn  yes of course you are the aggrieved party wheres lucy  i dont know and i dont care  well i want to know and i do care is she at home  how do i know whether she is at home or not i left her there very likely she is with her aunt marian telling stories about her mother  she is better there than with you what harm has she done you that you should talk about her in that way  no harm i dont object to her being there she has very pleasant conversations with mrs ned which she retails to me at home aunty marian why do you never drink champagne mamma is always drinking it and then mamma why do you drink so much wine aunty marian never drinks any good heavens the little devil told me this morning by way of consolation that she always takes care not to tell her aunty that i get drunk  what did you do to her for saying it  dont lose your temper i didnt strangle her nor even box her ears why should i she only repeats what you teach her  she repeats what her eyes and ears teach her if she learned the word from me she learned the meaning from you a nice lesson for a child hardly three years old  susanna sat down on a bench and looked down at her feet after a few moments she tightened her lips rose and walked away  hallo where are you going to said marmaduke following her  im going to get some drink i have been sober and miserable ever since i wrote to you i have not got much thanks for it except to be made more miserable so ill get drunk and be happy  no you shant said marmaduke seizing her arm and forcibly stopping her  what does it matter to you whether i do or not you say you wont come back then leave me to go my own way  here you sit down he said pushing her into a chair i know your game well enough you think you have me safe as long as you have the child  oh thats it is it why dont you go out take a cab and go to laurel grove for her there is nothing to prevent you taking her away  i have a good mind to do it  well do it i wont stop you why didnt you do it long ago her home is no place for her im not fit to have charge of her i have no fancy for having her talking about me and most likely mimicking me to other people  thats exactly what i want to arrange with you to do if you will only be reasonable listen let us part friends susanna since there is no use in our going on together you must give me the child it would only be a burden to you and i can have it well taken care of you can keep the house just as it is i will pay the rent of it  what good is the house to me  cant you hear me out it will be good to you to live in i suppose or you can set it on fire and wipe it off the face of the earth for what i care i can give you five hundred pounds down  five hundred pounds and what will you live on until your october dividends come in on credit i suppose do you think you can impose on me by flourishing money before me i will never take a halfpenny from you no not if i starve for it  thats all nonsense susanna you must  must i do you think you can make me take your money as you made me sit down here by force  i only offer you what i owe you those debts  i dont want what you owe me if you think it mean to leave me you shant plaster up your conscience with bank notes you would like to be able to say in your club that you treated me handsomely  i dont think it mean to leave you not a bit of it any other man would have left you months ago if i had married that little fool inside there and she had taken to drink i wouldnt have stood it a week i have stood it from you nearly a year can you expect me to stay under the same roof with you with the very thought of you making me sick and angry i was looking at some of your old likenesses the other day and i declare that it is enough to make a man cry to look at your face now and listen to your voice when you used to lecture me for losing a twenty pound note at billiards and coming home half screwedno man shall ever see me drunk againi little thought which of us would be the first to go to the dogs  i shall not trouble you long  what is the use of harping on that i have seen you drunk so often that i should almost be glad to see you dead  stop said susanna rising all right you need say no more talking will not remedy matters and it makes me feel pretty much as if you were throwing big stones at my heart youre in the right i suppose ive chosen to make a beast of myself and i must take the consequences you can have the child i will send for my things you wont see me at laurel grove again goodbye  but  dont say another word bob goodbye he took her hand irresolutely she drew it quickly away nodded to him and went out whilst he stood wondering whether it would be safeseeing that he did not desire a reconciliationto kiss her goodbye     chapter xiv   on sunday afternoon douglas walked facing a glorious sunset along uxbridge road to holland park where he found mrs conolly miss mcquinch and marmaduke a little girl was playing in the garden they were all so unconstrained and so like their old selves that douglas at once felt that conolly was absent  i am to make neds excuses said marian he has some pressing family affairs to arrange she seemed about to explain further but marmaduke looked so uneasily at her that she stopped then resuming gaily she added i told ned that he need not stand on ceremony with you fancy my saying that of you the most punctilious of men  quite right i am glad that mr conolly has not suffered me to interfere with his movements he replied with a smile which he suppressed as he turned and greeted miss mcquinch with his usual cold composure but to marmaduke who seemed much cast down he gave an encouraging squeeze of the hand not that he was moved by the misfortunes of marmaduke but he was thawed by the beauty of marian  we shall have a pleasant evening continued marian let us fancy ourselves back at westbourne terrace again reminiscences make one feel so deliciously aged and sad let us think that it is one of our old sunday afternoons sholto had better go upstairs and shave to heighten the illusion  not for me since i cannot see myself particularly if i have to call you mrs conolly if i may call you marian as i used to do i think that our conversation will contain fewer reminders of the lapse of time  of course said marian disregarding an anxious glance from elinor what else should you call me we were talking about nellys fame when you came in the colonial edition of her book has just appeared behold the advertisement  there was a newspaper open on the table and marian pointed to one of its columns as she spoke douglas took it up and read the following    now ready a new and cheaper edition crown 8vo 5s    the waters of marah    by elinor mcquinch    superior to many of the numerous tales which find a ready sale at   the railway bookstall athenaeum    there is nothing to fatigue and something to gratify the idle   reader examiner    there is a ring of solid metal in the waters of marah daily   telegraph    miss mcquinch has fairly established her claim to be considered   the greatest novelist of the age middlingtown mercury    replete with thrilling and dramatic incident instinct with   passion and pathos ladies gazette    tabuteau  son covent garden  that is very flattering said douglas as he replaced the paper on the table  highly so said elinor coriolanus displaying his wounds in the forum is nothing to it and she abruptly took the paper and threw it disgustedly behind the sofa just then a message from the kitchen engaged marians attention and douglas to relieve her from her guests for the moment strolled out upon the little terrace whither marmaduke had moodily preceded him  still in your difficulties lind he said with his perfunctory air of concern looking at the garden with some interest  im out of my difficulties clean enough said marmaduke theres the child among the currant bushes and i am rid of her mother for good i suppose  so much the better i hope it has not cost you too much  not a rap i met her in the museum after our confab on wednesday and told her what you recommended that i must have the child and that she must go she said all right and shook hands i havnt seen her since  i congratulate you  i dont feel comfortable about her  absurd man what better could you have done  thats just what i say it was her own fault i did all in my power i offered her five hundred pounds down she wouldnt have it of course but could i help that next day when she sent her maid for her things i felt so uneasy that i came to conolly and told him the whole affair he behaved very decently about it and said that i might as well have left her six months ago for all the good my staying had done or was likely to do he has gone off to see her todayshe is in lodgings somewhere near the theatre and he will let me know in case any money is required i should like to know what they are saying to one another about me theyre a rum pair  well let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die said douglas with an unnatural attempt at humor marian seems happy we must not spoil her evening  yes she is always in good spirits when he is away  indeed  it seems to me that they dont pull together i think she is afraid of him  you dont mean to say that he illtreats her said douglas fiercely  no i dont mean that he thrashes her or anything of that sort and yet he is just that sort of chap that i shouldnt be surprised at anything he might do as far as ordinary matters go he seems to treat her particularly well but ive noticed that she shuts up and gets anxious when he comes into the room and he has his own way in everything  is that all he embarrasses her by his behavior i suppose perhaps she is afraid of his allowing his breeding to peep out  not she his manners are all right enough besides as he is a genius and a celebrity and all that people dont expect him to be conventional he might stand on his head if he chose  sholto said marian joining them have you spoken to little lucy  no  then you are unacquainted with the most absolute imp on the face of the earth said elinor you neednt frown marmaduke it is you who have made her so  leave her alone said marmaduke to marian who was about to call the child petting babies is not in douglass line she will only bore him  not at all said douglas  it does not matter whether she bores him or not said marian he must learn to take a proper interest in children lucy come here  lucy stopped playing and said what for  because i ask you to dear said marian gently  the child considered for a while and then resumed her play miss mcquinch laughed marmaduke muttered impatiently and went down the garden lucy did not perceive him until he was within a few steps of her when she gave a shrill cry of surprise and ran to the other side of a flowerbed too wide for him to spring across he gave chase but she with screams of laughter avoided him by running to and fro so as to keep on the opposite side to him feeling that it was undignified to dodge his child thus he stopped and bade her come to him but she only laughed the more he called her in tones of command entreaty expostulation and impatience at last he shouted to her menacingly she placed her thumbnail against the tip of her nose spread her fingers and made him a curtsy he uttered an imprecation and returned angrily to the house saying between his teeth  let her stay out since she chooses to be obstinate  she is really too bad today said marian i am quite shocked at her  she is quite right not to come in and be handed round for inspection like a doll said elinor  she is very bold not to come when she is told said marian  yes from your point of view said elinor i like bold children  marmaduke was sulky and marian serious for some time after this incident they recovered their spirits at dinner when marian related to douglas how she had become reconciled to his mother afterward marmaduke suggested a game at whist  oh no not on sunday said marian whist is too wicked  then what the dickens may we do said marmaduke may nelly play écarté with me  well please dont play for money and dont sit close to the front window  come along then nell you two may sing hymns if you like  i wish you could sing sholto said marian it is an age since we last had a game of chess together do you still play  yes said douglas i shall be delighted but i fear you will beat me now as i suppose you have been practising with mr conolly  playing with ned no he hates chess he says it is a foolish expedient for making idle people believe they are doing something very clever when they are only wasting their time he actually grumbled about the price of the table and the pieces but i insisted on having them i suppose in remembrance of you  it is kind of you to say that marian will you have black or white  white please unless you wish me to be always making moves with your men  now will you move  i think i had rather you began remember our old conditions you are not to checkmate me in three moves and you are not to take my queen  very well you may rely upon it i shall think more of my adversary than of my game check  oh you have done it in three moves that is not fair i wont play any more unless you take back that  no i assure you it is not checkmate my bishop should be at the other side for that there of course that will do  what a noise marmaduke makes over his cards i hope the people next door will not hear him swearing  impossible you must not move that knight it exposes your king do you know i think there is a great charm about this house  indeed yes it is a pretty house  and this sunset hour makes it additionally so besides it is inexpressibly sad to see you here a perfectly happy and perfectly beautiful mistress of this romantic foreign home  what do you mean sholto  i call it a foreign home because though it is yours i have no part nor lot in it remember we are only playing at old times tonight everything around from the organ to the ring on your finger reminds me that i am a stranger here it seems almost unkind of you to regret nothing whilst i am full of regrets  check said marian mind your game sir  flippant exclaimed douglas impatiently moving his king i verily believe that if your husband were at the bottom of the thames at this moment you would fly off unconcernedly to some other nest and break hearts with as much indifference as ever  i wish you would not make suggestions of that sort sholto you make me uncomfortable something might happen to ned i wish he were home he is very late  happy man you can be serious when you think about him i envy him  what sholto douglas stoop to envy any mortal prodigious  yes it has come to that with me why should i not envy him his career has been upward throughout he has been a successful worker in the world where i have had nothing real to do when the good things i had been dreaming of and longing for all my life came in his path he had them for the mere asking i valued them so highly that when i fancied i possessed them i was the proudest of men i am humble enough now that i am beggared  you are really talking the greatest nonsense  no doubt i am still in love marian you see there is no harm in telling you so now  on the contrary it is now that there is harm for shame sholto  i am not ashamed i tell you of my love because now you can listen to me without uneasiness knowing that it is no longer associated with hope or desire or anything but regret you see that i do not affect the romantic lover i eat very well i play chess i go into society and you reproach me for growing fat  marian bent over the chessboard for a moment to hide her face then she said in a lower voice i have thoroughly convinced myself that there is no such thing as love in the world  that means that you have never experienced it  i have told you already that i have never been in love and that i dont believe a bit in it i mean romantic love of course  i verily believe that you have not the future has one more pang in store for me for you will surely love some day  i am getting too old for that i fear at what age pray did you receive the arrow in your heart  when i was a boy i loved a vision the happiest hours of my life were those in which i was slowly tremulously daring to believe that i had found my vision at last in you and then the dreams that followed what a career was to have been mine i remember how you used to reproach me because i was austere with women and proud with men how could i have been otherwise i contrasted the gifts of all other women with those of my elect and the lot of all other men with my own can you wonder that doing so i carried my head among the clouds you must remember how unfamiliar failure was to me at school at oxford in society i had sought distinction without misgiving and attained it without difficulty my one dearest object i deemed secure long before i opened my lips and asked expressly for it i think i walked through life at that time like a somnambulist for i have since seen that i must have been piling mistake upon mistake until out of a chaos of meaningless words and smiles i had woven a paphian love temple at the first menace of disappointmenta thing as new and horrible to me as deathi fled the country i came back with only the ruins of the doomed temple you were not content to destroy a ruin the feat was too easy to be glorious so you rebuilt it in one hour to the very dome and lighted its altars with more than their former radiance then as though it were but a house of cardsas indeed it was nothing elseyou gave it one delicate touch and razed it to its foundations yet i am afraid those altar lamps were not wholly extinguished they smoulder beneath the ruins still  i wonder why they made you the newdigate poet at oxford sholto you mix your metaphors most dreadfully dont be angry with me i understand what you mean and i am very sorry i say flippant things because i must how can one meet seriousness in modern society except by chaff  i am not angry i had rather you did not understand the more flippant you are the more you harden my heart and i want it to be as hard as the nether millstone your pity would soften me and i dread that  i believe it does every man good to be softened if you ever really felt what you describe you greatly overestimated me what can you lose by a little more softness i often think that menparticularly good menmake their way through the world too much as if it were a solid mass of iron through which they must cutas if they dared not relax their hardest edge and finest temper for a moment surely that is not the way to enjoy life  perhaps not still it is the way to conquer in life it may be pleasant to have a soft heart but then someone is sure to break it  i do not believe much in broken hearts besides i do not mean that men should be too soft for instance sentimental young men of about twenty are odious but for a man to get into a fighting attitude at the barest suggestion of sentiment to believe in nature as something inexorable and to aim at being as inexorable as nature is not that almost as bad  do you know any such man you must not attribute that sort of hardness to me  oh no i was not thinking of you i was not thinking of anyone in fact i only put a case i sometimes have disputes with ned on the subject one of his cardinal principles is that there is no use in crying for spilt milk i always argue that as irremediable disasters are the only ones that deserve or obtain sympathy he might as well say that there is no use in crying for anything then he slips out of the difficulty by saying that that was just what he meant and that there is actually no place for regret in a wellregulated scheme of life in debating with women men brazen out all the ridiculous conclusions of which they are convicted and then they say that there is no use in arguing with a woman neither is there because the woman is always right  yes because she suffers her heart to direct her  you are just as bad as the rest of your sex i see where you cannot withold credit from a woman you give it to her heart and deny it to her head  there i wont play any more said miss mcquinch suddenly at the other end of the room have you finished your chess marian  we are nearly done ring for the lamps please nelly let us finish sholto  whose turn is it to move i beg your pardon for my inattention  mineno yours stop it must be mine i really dont know  nor do i i have forgotten my game  then let us put up the board we can finish some other night  it had become dark by this time and the lamps were brought in whilst douglas was replacing the chessmen in their box  now said marian let us have some music marmaduke will you sing uncle ned for us we have not heard you sing for ages  i believe it is more than three years since that abominable concert at wandsworth and i have not heard you sing since said elinor  i forget all my songshavnt sung one of them for months however here goes have you a banjo in the house  no said marian i will play an accompaniment for you  all right see here you need only play these three chords when one sounds wrong play another youll learn it in a moment  marmadukes voice was not so fresh nor his fun so spontaneous as at wandsworth but they were not critical enough to appreciate the difference they laughed like children at him elinor was asked to play but she would not she had renounced that folly she said then at douglass request marian sang in memory of wandsworth rose softly blooming when she had finished elinor asked for some old melodies knowing that marian liked these best so she began gaily with the oak and the ash and robin adair after that finding both herself and the others in a more pathetic vein she sang them the bailiffs daughter of islington and the banks of allan water at the end of which marmadukes eyes were full of tears and the rest sat quite still she paused for a minute and then broke the silence with auld robin gray which affected even douglas who had no ear as she sang the last strain the click of a latchkey was heard from without instantly she rose closed the pianoforte softly and sat down at some distance from it her action was reflected by a change in their behavior they remembered that they were not at home and became more or less uneasily selfconscious elinor was the least disturbed conollys first glance on entering was at the piano his next went in search of his wife  ah he said surprised i thought somebody was singing  oh dear no said elinor drily you must have been mistaken  perhaps so said he smiling but i have been listening carefully at the window for ten minutes and i certainly dreamt that i heard auld robin gray  marian blushed conolly did not seem to have been moved by the song he was alert and loquacious before he had finished his greeting and apology to douglas they all felt as little sentimental as they had ever done in their lives marian after asking whether he had dined became silent and dropped the pretty airs of command which as hostess she had worn before  have you any news said marmaduke at last douglas knows the whole business we are all friends here  only what we expected said conolly affairs are exactly as they were i called today at her address  how did you get it said marmaduke  i wrote for it to her at the theatre  and did she send it  of course but she did not give me any encouragement to call on her and in fact evidently did not want to see me her appearance has altered very much for the worse she is a confirmed dipsomaniac and she knows it i advised her to abstain in future she asked me in her sarcastic sisterly way whether i had any other advice to give her i told her that if she meant to go on her proper course was to purchase a hogshead of brandy keep it by her side and condense the process of killing herself which may at present take some years into a few days  oh ned you did not really say that to her said marian  i did indeed the shocking part of the affair is not as you seem to think my giving the advice but that it should be the very best advice i could have given  i do not think i would have said so  most likely not said conolly with a smile you would have said something much prettier but dipsomania is not one of the pretty things of life nor can it by any stretch of benevolent hypocrisy be made to pass as one when susanna and i get talking we do not waste time in trying to spare one anothers feelings if we did we should both see through the attempt and be very impatient of it  did she tell you what she intends to do said marmaduke  she has accepted an american engagement when that draws to a close it will she says be time enough for her to consider her next step but she has no intention of leaving the stage until she is compelled  has she any intention of reforming her habits said elinor bluntly  i should say every intention but no prospect of doing so dipsomaniacs are always intending to reform but they rarely succeed has lucy been put to bed  lucy is in disgrace said elinor marian looked at her apprehensively  in disgrace said conolly more seriously how so  elinor described what had taken place in the garden when she told how the child had disregarded marians appeal conolly laughed  lucy has no sense of how pretty she would have looked toddling in obediently because her aunt asked her to he said she is like all children very practical and will not assist in getting up amiable little scenes without good reason rendered  elinor glanced at marian and saw that though douglas was speaking to her in a low voice she was listening nervously to her husband so she said sharply it is a pity you were not here to tell us what to do  apparently it is said conolly complacently  what would you have done said marian suddenly interrupting douglas  i suppose said conolly looking round at her in surprise i should have answered her questiontold her what she was wanted for if i asked you to do anything and you enquired why you would be extremely annoyed if i answered because i ask you  i would not ask why said marian i would do it  that would be very nice of you said conolly but you cannot expect such a selfish mistrustful and curious animal as a little child to be equally kind and confiding lucy is too acute not to have learned long since that grown people systematically impose on the credulity and helplessness of children  thats true said elinor reluctantly marian turned away and quietly resumed her conversation with douglas after a minute she strolled with him into the garden whither marmaduke had already retired to smoke  has the evening been a pleasant one miss mcquinch said conolly left alone with her  yes we have had a very pleasant evening indeed we played chess and écarté and we all agreed to make old times of it marmaduke sang for us and marian had us nearly in tears with those old ballads of hers  and then i came in and spoiled it all eh  certainly not why do you say that  merely a mischievous impulse to say something true jealousy perhaps because i missed being here earlier you think then that if i had been here the evening would have been equally pleasant and marian equally happy in her singing  dont you like marians singing  could you not have refrained from that most indiscreet question  i ought to have it came out unawares do not answer it  that would make matters worse and there is no reason whatever why the plain truth should not be told when i was a child i heard every day better performances than marians she believes there is something pretty and good in music and patronizes it accordingly to the best of her ability i do not like to hear music patronized and when marian lovely as she is gives her pretty renderings of songs which i have heard a hundred times from singers who knew what they were about then though i admire her as i must always my admiration is rather increased than otherwise when she stops because then i am no longer conscious of a deficiency which even my unfortunate sister could supply  your criticism of her singing sounds more sincere than your admiration of her loveliness i am not musician enough to judge all i know is that her singing is good enough for me  i know you are displeased because it is not good enough for me but how can i help myself poor marian  do hush said elinor here she is  you need not be in such a hurry duke said marian what can it matter to you how late you get back  no said marmaduke ive got to write home the governor is ill and my mammy will send me a fivesheet sermon if i neglect writing tonight you will keep lucy for another week wont you box her ears if she gives you any cheek she wants it shes been spoiled  if we find we can do no better than that with her we shall hand her back to you said conolly then the visitors took their leave marian gently pressed douglass hand and looked into his eyes as he bade her farewell elinor seeing this glanced uneasily at conolly and unexpectedly met his eye there was a gleam of cynical intelligence in it that did not reassure her a few minutes later she went to bed leaving the couple alone together conolly looked at his wife for a moment with an amused expression but she closed her lips irresponsively and went to the table for a book which she wanted to bring upstairs she would have gone without a word had he not spoken to her  marian douglas is in love with you  she blushed thought a moment and said quietly very well i shall not ask him to come again  why  she colored more vividly and suddenly and said i thought you cared i beg your pardon  my dear he replied amiably if you exclude everybody who falls in love with you we shall have no one in the house but blind men  and do you like men to be in love with me  yes it makes the house pleasant for them it makes them attentive to you and it gives you great power for good when i was a romantic boy any good woman could have made a saint of me let them fall in love with you as much as they please afterwards they will seek wives according to a higher standard than if they had never known you but do not return the compliment or your influence will become an evil one  ned i had not intended to tell you this but now i will sholto douglas not only loves me but he told me so today  of course a man always does tell it sooner or later  marian sat down on the sofa and looked at him for some time gravely and a little wistfully i think she said i should feel very angry if any woman made such a confession to you  a christian british lady does not readily forgive a breach of convention nor a woman an invasion of her privileges even when they have become a burden to her  what do you mean by that she said rising  marian he said looking straight at her are you dissatisfied  what reason have i to  never mind the reasons are you  no said she steadfastly  he smiled indulgently pressed her hand for a moment against his cheek and went out for the short walk he was accustomed to take before retiring     chapter xv   in october marian was at sark holiday making at the house of hardy mcquinchs brother who had recently returned to england with a fortune made in australia conolly having the house at holland park to himself fitted a spare room as a laboratory and worked there every night one evening returning home alone a little before five oclock he shut himself into this laboratory and had just set to work when armande the housemaid interrupted him  mrs leith fairfax sir  conolly had had little intercourse with mrs fairfax since before his marriage when he had once shewn her the working of his invention at queen victoria street and as marian had since resented her share of douglass second proposal by avoiding her society as far as possible without actually discontinuing her acquaintance this visit was a surprise conolly looked darkly at armande and went to the drawingroom without a word  how do you do mr conolly said mrs fairfax as he entered i need not ask you are looking so well have i disturbed you  you havemost agreeably pray sit down  i know your time is priceless i should never have ventured to come but that i felt sure you would like to hear all the news from sark i have been there for the last fortnight marian told me to call on you the moment i returned  yes said conolly convinced that this was not true she promised to do so in her last letter  mrs fairfax on the point of publishing a few supplementary fictions checked herself and looked suspiciously at him  the air of sark has evidently benefited you he said as she paused you are looking very welli had almost said charming  mrs fairfax glanced archly at him and said nonsense but indeed the trip was absolutely necessary for me i should hardly have been alive had i remained at work and poor willie mcquinch was bent on having me  he has been described to me as an inveterate lion hunter  it is not at all pleasant i assure you to be persecuted with invitations from people who wish to see a real live novelist but william mcquinchs place at sark is really palatial he is called sarcophagus on account of his wealth a great many people whom he knew were staying in the island besides those in the house with us marian was the beauty of the place how every one admires her why do you not go down mr conolly  i am too busy besides it will do marian good to be rid of me for a while  absurd mr conolly you should not leave her there by herself  by herself why is not the place full  yes but i do not mean that there is nobody belonging to her there  you forget miss mcquinch is her bosom friend there is marmaduke her cousin and his mother her aunt dora then is there not mr sholto douglas one of her oldest and most attached friends  oh is mr douglas in charge of her  no doubt he will take charge of her if she is overtaken by her second childhood whilst he is there meanwhile she is in charge of herself is she not and there is hardly any danger of her feeling lonely  no sholto douglas will provide against that  your opinion confirms the accounts i have had from other sources it appears that mr douglas is very attentive to my wife  very indeed mr conolly you must not think that i am afraid of anythinganything  anything  welloh you know what i mean anything wrong at least not exactly wrong but  anything undomestic  yes you see marians position is a very difficult one she is so young and so good looking that she is very much observed and it seems so strange her being without her husband  pretty ladies whose husbands are never seen often get talked about in the world do they not  that is just what i mean how cleverly you get everything out of me mr conolly i called here without the faintest idea of alluding to marians situation and now you have made me say all sorts of things what a fortune you would have made at the bar  i must apologize i did not mean to crossexamine you naturally of course you would not like to make me uneasy about marian  it is the very last thing i should desire but now that it has slipped out i really think you ought to go to sark  indeed i rather infer that i should be very much in the way  the more reason for you to go mr conolly  not at all mrs leith fairfax the attentions of a husband are stale unsuited to holiday time picture to yourself my arrival at sark with the tender assurance in my mouth marian i love you she would reply so you ought am i not your wife the same advance from anothermr douglas for instancewould affect her quite differently and much more pleasantly  mr conolly is this indifference or supreme confidence  neither of these conjugal claptraps i merely desire that marian should enjoy herself as much as possible and the more a woman is admired the happier she is perhaps you think that in deference to the general feeling in such matters i should become jealous  mrs fairfax again looked doubtfully at him i cannot make you out at all mr conolly she said submissively i hope i have not offended you  not in the least i take it that having observed certain circumstances which seemed to threaten the welfare of one very dear to you as i am aware marian is the trouble they caused you found unpremeditated expression in the course of a conversation with me conolly beamed at her as if he thought this rather neatly turned  exactly so but i do not wish you to think that i have observed anything particular  certainly not still you think there would be no harm in my writing to marian to say that her behavior has attracted your notice and  good heavens mr conolly you must not mention me in the matter you are so innocentat least so frank so workmanlike if i may say so in your way of dealing with things i would not have marian know what i have saidi really did not notice anythingfor worlds you had better not write at all but just go down as if you went merely to enjoy yourself and dont on any account let marian suspect that you have heard anything goodness knows what mischief you might make in youryour ingenuousness  but i should have thought that the opinion of an old and valued friend like yourself would have special weight with her  you know nothing about it clever engineer as you are you do not understand the little wheels by which our great machine of society is worked  true mrs leith fairfax he rejoined echoing the cadence of her sentence educated as a mere mechanic i am still a stranger to the elegancies of life i usually depend on marian for direction but since you think that it would be injudicious to appeal to her in the present instance  out of the question mr conolly  i must trust to your guidance in the matter what do you suggest  mrs fairfax was about to reply when the expression which she habitually wore like a mask in society wavered and broke her lip trembled her eyes filled with tears she rose with a sniff that was half a sob when she spoke her voice was sincere for the first time and at the sound of it conollys steely hard manner melted and his inhuman selfpossession vanished  you think she said that i came here to make mischief i did not marian is nothing to me she does not even like me but i dont want to see her ruin herself merely because she is too inexperienced to know when she is well off i have had to fight my way in london and i know what it is and what the world is she is not fit to take charge of herself goodbye mr conolly you are a great deal too young yourself to know the danger for all your cleverness you may tell her that i came here and gossipped against her if you like she will never speak to me again but if it saves her i dont care goodbye  my dear mrs fairfax he said with entire frankness i am now deeply and sincerely obliged to you and in proof that he was touched he kissed her hand with the ease and grace of a man who had been carefully taught how to do it mrs fairfax recovered herself and almost blushed as he went with her to the door chatting easily about the weather and the addison road trains  she was not the last visitor that evening she had hardly been fifteen minutes gone when the rev george presented himself and was conducted to the laboratory where he found conolly with his coat off surrounded by apparatus the glowing fire comfortable chairs and preparations for an evening meal gladdened him more than the presence of his brotherinlaw with whom he never felt quite at ease  you wont mind my fiddling with these machines while i talk said conolly  not at all not at all i shall witness your operations with great interest you must not think that the wonders of science are indifferent to me  so you are going on to sark you say  yes may i ask whether you will be persuaded to come  no for certain i have other fish to fry here  i think it would renovate your health to come for a few days  my health is always right as long as i have work did you meet mrs fairfax outside  ayes i passed her  you spoke to her i suppose  a few words yes  do you know what she came here for  no but stay i am wrong she mentioned that she came for a book she lent you  she mentioned what was not true what did she say to you about marian  well sheshe was just saying that it is perhaps as well that i should go down to sark at once as marian is quite alone  the clergyman looked so guilty as he said this that conolly laughed outright at him you mean he said that marian is not quite alone well very likely douglas occupies himself a good deal with her if so there may be some busybody or another down there fool enough to tell her that people are talking about her that would spoil her holiday so it is lucky that you are going down no one will take it upon themselves to speak to her when you are there and if they say anything to you you can let it in at one ear and out at the other  that is of course unless i should see her really acting indiscreetly  i had better tell you beforehand what you will see if you keep your eyes open you will see very plainly that douglas is in love with her also that she knows that he is in love with her in fact she told me so and you will see she rather likes it every married woman requires a holiday from her husband occasionally even when he suits her perfectly  the rev george stared if i follow you arighti am not sure that i doyou impute to marian the sin of entertaining feelings which it is her duty to repress  i impute no sin to her you might as well tell a beggar that he has no right to be hungry as a woman that it is her duty to feel this and not to feel that  but marian has been educated to feel only in accordance with her duty  so have you how does it work however continued conolly without waiting for an answer i dont deny that marian shews the effects of her education they are deplorably evident in all her conscientious actions  you surprise and distress me this is the first intimation i have received of your having any cause to complain of marian  nonsense i dont complain of her but what you call her education as far as i can make it out appears to have consisted of stuffing her with lies and making it a point of honor with her to believe them in spite of sense and reason the sense of duty that rises on that sort of foundation is more mischievous than downright want of principle i dont dispute your right you who constitute polite society to skin over all the ugly facts of life but to make your daughters believe that the skin covers healthy flesh is a crime poor marian thinks that a room is clean when all the dust is swept out of sight under the furniture and if honest people rake it out to bring it under the notice of those whose duty it is to remove it she is disgusted with them and ten to one accuses them of having made it themselves she doesnt know what sort of world she is in thanks to the misrepresentations of those who should have taught her she will deceive her children in just the same way if she ever has any if she had been taught the truth in her own childhood she would know how to face it and would be a strong woman as well as an amiable one but it is too late now the truth seems natural to a child but to a grown woman or man it is a bitter lesson in the learning though it may be invigorating when it is well mastered and you know how seldom a hard task forced on an unwilling pupil is well mastered  what is truth said the clergyman sententiously  all that we know master pilate retorted conolly with a laugh and we know a good deal it may seem small in comparison with what we dont know but it is more than any one of us can hold for all that we know for instance that the world was not planned by a sentimental landscape gardener if marian ever learns thatwhich she may although i am neither able nor willing to teach it to hershe will not thank those who gave her so much falsehood to unlearn until then she will i am afraid do little else than lay up a store of regrets for herself  this is very strange we always looked upon marian as an exceptionally amiable girl  so she is unfortunately there is no institution so villainous but she will defend it no tyranny so oppressive but she will make a virtue of submitting to it no social cancer so venomous but she will shrink from cutting it out and plead that it is a comfortable thing and much better as it is she knows that she disobeyed her father and that he deserved to be disobeyed yet she condemns other women who are disobedient and stands out against nelly mcquinch in defence of the unselfishness of parental love she knows that the increased freedom of movement allowed to her as a married woman has been healthy for her yet she looks coldly at other young women who assert their right to freedom and are not afraid to walk through the streets without a sheepdog human or otherwise at their heels she knows that marriage is not what she expected it to be and that it gives me many unfair advantages over her and she knows also that ours is a happier marriage than most nevertheless she will encourage other girls to marry she will maintain that the chain which galls her own wrists so often is a string of honeysuckles and if a woman identifies herself with any public movement for the lightening of that chain she wont allow that that woman is fit to be admitted into decent society there is not one of these shams to which she clings that i would not like to take by the throat and shake the life out of and she knows it even in that she has not the consistency to believe me wrong because it is undutiful and out of keeping with the honeysuckles to lack faith in her husband in order to blind herself to her inconsistencies she has to live in a rosecolored fog and what with me constantly in spite of myself blowing this fog away on the one side and the naked facts of her everyday experience as constantly letting in the daylight on the other she must spend half the time wondering whether she is mad or sane between her desire to do right and her discoveries that it generally leads her to do wrong she passes her life in a wistful melancholy which i cant dispel i can only pity her i suppose i could pet her but i hate treating a woman like a child it means giving up all hope of her becoming rational she may turn for relief any day either to love or religion and for her own sake i hope she will choose the first of the two evils it is the least permanent and conolly having disburdened himself resumed his work without any pretence of waiting for the clergymans comments  well said the rev george cautiously i do not think i have quite followed your opinions which seem to me to be exactly upside down as if they were projected upon the retina of your minds eyeto use shakspears happy phrasejust as they would be upon youryour real eye you know but i can assure you that your view of marian is an entirely mistaken one you seem to think that she does not give in her entire adherence to the doctrines of the establishment this is a matter which i venture to say you do not understand  admitted interposed conolly hastily here is my workmans tea are you fond of scones  i hardly know anythingthe simplest fare will satisfy me  so it does me when i can get nothing better help yourself pray  conolly did not sit down to the meal but worked whilst the clergyman ate presently the rev george warmed by the fire and cheered by the repast returned to the subject of his hosts domestic affairs  come he said i am sure that a few judicious words would lead to an explanation between you and marian  i also think that a few words might do so but they would not be judicious words  why not can it be injudicious to restore harmony in a household  no but that would not be the effect of an explanation because the truth is not likely to reconcile us if i were to explain the difficulty to a man he would argue but marian would just infer that i despised her and nothing else  oh no oh dear no a few kind words an appeal to her good sense a little concession on both sides  all excellent for a pair estranged by a flash of temper or a motherinlaw or a trifle of jealousy or too many evenings spent at the club on the mans part or too many dances with a gallant on the womans but no good for us we have never exchanged unkind words there are no concessions to be made her good sense is not at fault besides these few kind words that are supposed to be such a sovereign remedy for all sorts of domestic understandings are generally a few kind fibs if i told them marian wouldnt believe them fibs dont make lasting truces either no the situation is graver than you think just suppose for instance that you undertake to restore harmony as you call it what will you say to her  well it would depend on circumstances  but you know the circumstances on which it depends how would you begin  there are little ways of approaching delicate subjects with women for instance i might say casually that it was a pity that a pair so happily situated as you two should not agree perfectly  you would get no further for marian would never admit that we do not agree she does not know what her complaint is and therefore feels bound in honor to maintain that she has nothing to complain of she is not the woman to cast reproach on me for a discontent she cannot explain or if she could explain it how much wiser should you be i have explained and you confess you cannot understand me the difference between us is neither her fault nor mine and all the explanations in the world will not remove it  if you would allow me to appeal to her religious duty  religion she doesnt believe in it  what exclaimed the clergyman unaffectedly shocked surely surely  listen to me believing in a doctrine doesnt mean holding up your hand and saying credo it means habitually acting on the assumption that the doctrine is true marian thinks it wrong not to go to church and she will hold up her hand and cry credo to the immortality of her soul or to any verse in the new testament the shareholders of our concern in the city will do the same but do they or she ever act on the assumption that they are immortal or that riches are dross or that class prejudice is damnable never they dont believe it you will find that marian has been thoroughly trained to separate her practice from her religious professions and if you allude to the inconsistency she will instinctively feel that you are offending against good taste in short her credo doesnt mean faith it means churchgoing which is practised because it is respectable and is respectable because it is a habit of the upper caste but churchgoing is churchgoing and business is business as marian will soon let you know if you meddle with her business however we need not argue about that we know one anothers views and can agree to differ  i should be false to my duty as a christian priest if i made any such agreement  perhaps so but at any rate we cant spend all our lives over the same argument no as i was saying take my advice and let marian alone  but what do you intend to do then  what can i do but wait experience must wear out some of her illusions she will at least find out that she is no worse off than other women and better off than some of them since the job cannot be undone we must try how making the best of it will work i am pretty hopeful myself how are affairs getting on at your chapel i am told that the sermons of your locum tenens send the congregation asleep  he is not at his best in the pulpit a good fellow a most loving man but not able to grapple with a large congregation after all i am obliged to confess that very few of our cloth are the power of preaching is quite an exceptional one and it is a gift as well as a trust i humbly believe that the power of the tongue comes of a higher ordination than the bishops  nothing further was said about marian the clergymans object in visiting conolly was it presently appeared to borrow a portmanteau when he was gone conolly returned to the laboratory and wrote the following letter    my dear marian    i have just had two unexpected visits one from mrs fairfax and   one from george mrs lf said you asked her to call and give me   the news when i told her without blushing that you had written   to prepare me for her visit she was rather put out justly   thinking me to mean that i did not believe her as this is fully   the thirtysixth falsehood in which you have detected good mrs f   i fear you will be compelled in spite of your principle of   believing the best of everybody to regard her in future as a not   invariably accurate woman she came with the object of making me go   down to sark you were so young and so much admired mr douglas   was so attentive you should not be left entirely alone and so   forth you will be angry with her but she thinks douglas so   irresistible that she is genuinely anxious about you i believe she   really meant well this time as to our reverend brother his   portmanteau burst in the train coming from edinburgh so he came to   borrow mine having apparently resolved to wear out those of all   his friends before buying a new one unfortunately he met mrs f   down the road and she urged him to go down to sark just as she had   urged me now as george is incapable of holding his tongue when he   ought i feel sure that unless i tell you what mrs f said he   will anticipate me otherwise i should not have mentioned it until   your return for fear of annoying you and spoiling your visit so   if his reverence hints or lectures you will know what he means and   not heed him mrs fs confidences have probably not been confined   to me but were i in your place i should not make the slightest   change in my conduct in consequence at all events if you feel   constrained to display any sudden accession of reserve toward   douglas tell him the reason because if you dont he will ascribe   the change to coquetry    i have turned the spare room on the first floor into a laboratory   and am sitting in it now im thinking of fitting it up like a   studio and having private views of my inventions as scott has of   his pictures parsons man came with some flowers the other day   and informed me that three balls to the first of which he was   invited took place in the house while i was away one or two   trifling dilapidations and the fact that somebody has been   tampering with the locks of the organ and piano dispose me to   believe this tale parsons man declares that he was too virtuous   to come to the two last entertainments after finding out that the   first was a clandestine one but i believe he made himself   disagreeable and was not invited probably he quarrelled with some   military follower of armandes for he was particularly bitter on   the subject of a common soldier making free in a gentlemans house   i have not said anything to the two culprits but i have contrived   to make them suspect that i know all and they now do their duty   with trembling diligence some man sat on the little walnut table   and broke it but no other damage worth mentioning has been done   the table was absurdly repaired with a piece of twine and pushed   into the recess between the organ and the front window whence i   sometimes amuse myself by the experiment of pulling it into broad   daylight it is always pushed back again before i return in the   evening    how are you off for money i have plenty of loose cash just now   madame called last monday and asked matilda who opened the door   when you would be back thereupon i interviewed her i must say she   is loyal to her clients for i had great difficulty in extracting   her bill which was of course what she called about she   evidently recognizes the necessity of keeping husbands in the dark   in such matters one of the items was for the lace on your   maccaronicolored body which as i chanced to remember you   supplied yourself after a brief struggle she deducted it so i   paid her the balance only 35£ 13s 9d    when are you coming back to me after sark i   fear you will find home a little dull nevertheless i   should like to see you again come back before christmas   at any rate                       yours dear marian in solitude                                                    ned  the answer came two days later than return of post and ran thus                                           melbourne house sark                                                  sunday   my dear ned    how very provoking about the servants i do not mind matilda so   much but i do think it hard that we could not depend on armande   considering all the kindness we have shewn her i can scarcely   believe that she would have acted so badly unless she were led away   by matilda whom i will pack off the moment i return as to   armande i will give her another chance but she shall have a sharp   talking to i am quite sure that a great deal more mischief has   been done than you noticed if the carpet was danced on for three   nights by men in heavy boots it must be in ribbons it is really   too bad i do not want any money indeed the twenty pounds you sent   me last was quite unnecessary as i have nearly sixteen left what   a rogue madame is to try and make you pay for my lace i am sorry   you paid the bill she had no business to call for her money she   is never paid so soon by anybody we have had great fun down   here it has been one continual garden party all through and the   weather is still lovely mr mcquinch is very colonial but i think   his ways make the house pleasanter than if he were still english   carbury is quite stupid in comparison to this place i have danced   more than i ever did in my life before and now we are so tired of   frivolity that if any one ventures to strum a waltz or propose a   game we all protest we tried to get up some choral music but it   was a failure on friday george who is looked on as a great man   here was asked to give us a shakespeare reading he was only too   glad to be asked for he had heard simonton the actor read at a   bazaar in scotland and was full of richard the third in   consequence he was not very bad but his imitation of simonton was   so obvious and so queerly mixed with his own churchy style that he   seemed rather monotonous and affected at least i thought so i was   dreadfully uncomfortable during the reading because of marmaduke   who behaved scandalously there were some schoolboys present and   he not only encouraged them to misbehave themselves but was worse   than any of them himself at last he pretended to be overcome by   the heat and went out of the room to my great relief but when   the passage about the early village cock came he crew outside the   door where he had been waiting expressly to do it nobody could   help laughing and the boys screamed so that mr mcquinch took two   of them out by the collar i believe he was glad of the excuse to   go out and laugh himself george was very angry and no wonder he   will hardly speak to marmaduke who of course denies all   knowledge of the interruption but george knows better all the   hardy mcquinches are down here uncle hardy is rather stooped from   rheumatism nelly is now the chief personage in the family lydia   and jane are nowhere beside her they are goodhumored bouncing   girls but they are certainly not brilliant i hope it is not aunt   doras walnut table that is broken was it not mean of parsons man   to tell on armande i think since you have plenty of loose cash   we might venture on a set of those curtains we saw at protheroes   for the drawingroom i can easily use the ones that are there now   for portières    you must not think that i have written this all at once i shall   be able to finish today as it is sunday and i have made an   excuse to stay away from church george is to preach and somehow i   never feel toward the service as i ought when he officiates i know   you will laugh at this    the first part of your letter must have a paragraph   all to itself i hardly know what to say i could not   have believed that mrs leith fairfax would have behaved   as she has done i was so angry at first that for   fully an hour i felt ill and i spoke quite wickedly to   george the day after he arrived because he said that   sholto had better not take me down to dinner although   his doing so was quite accidental i know you will believe   me when i tell you that i was quite unconscious   that he had been unusually attentive to me and i was   about to write you an indignant denial only i shewed   nelly your letter and she crushed me by telling me she   had noticed it too we nearly had a quarrel about it   but she counted up the number of times i had danced   with him and sat beside him at dinner and i suppose an   evilminded woman looking on might think what mrs   leith fairfax thought but there is no excuse for her   she knows that sholto and i have been intimate since   we were children and there is something odious in her   of all people pretending to misunderstand us what is   worse she was particularly friendly and confidential with   me while she was here and although i tried to keep   away from her at first she persisted in conciliating me   and persuaded me that douglas had entirely mistaken   what she said that other time who could have expected   her to turn round and calumniate me the moment my   back was turned how can people do such things i   hope we shall not meet her again for i will never speak   to her i have not said anything to douglas how   could i it would only make mischief i feel that the   right course is to come home as soon as i can and in the   meantime to avoid him as much as possible so you   may expect me on saturday next mr mcquinch is   quite dismayed at my departure which he says will be   the signal for a general breaking up but this i cannot   help i shall be glad to go home of course still i   am sorry to leave this place where we have all been so   jolly i will write and let you know what train i shall   come by but you need not trouble to meet me unless   you like i can get home quite well by myself after   all it is just as well that i am getting away it was   pleasant enough but now i feel utterly disgusted with   everything and everybody i find i must stop they   have just come in from church and i must go down                              your affectionate                                         marian     chapter xvi   one saturday afternoon in december marian and elinor sat drinking tea in the drawingroom at holland park elinor was present as an afternoon caller she no longer resided with the conollys marian had been lamely excusing herself for not having read elinors last book  pray dont apologize said elinor i remember the time when you would have forced yourself to read it from a sense of duty and i am too delighted to find that nonsense washing out of you at last to feel the wound to my vanity oh say no more my dear you can read it still whenever you please brother george read it and was shocked because the heroine loves the villain and tells him so without waiting to be asked it is odd that long ago when i believed so devoutly in the tender passion i never could write a really flaming love story  dont begin to talk like that said marian crossly people do fall in love fortunately for them it may be injudicious and it may turn out badly but it fills up life in a way that all the barren philosophy and cynicism on earth cannot do you think i would not rather have to regret a lost love than to repine because i had been too cautious to love at all the disappointments of love warm the heart more than the triumphs of insensibility  thats rather a good sentence said elinor your talk is more classical than my writing but what would the departed marian lind have said  the departed marian lind was so desperately wise that she neglected that excellent precept be not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou destroy thyself i took up the bible last night for the first time since my marriage and i thought what fools we two used to be when we made up our minds to avoid all the mistakes and follies and feelings of other people and to be quite superior and rational he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap it is all so true in spite of what ned says we were very clever at observing the wind and regarding the clouds and what are we the better for it how much irreparable mischief i wonder did we do ourselves by letting our little wisdoms stifle all our big instincts look at those very other people whom we despised how happy they are in spite of their having always done exactly what their hearts told them  i think we are pretty well off as people go i know i am certainly it was part of our wisdom that marriage was a bad thing and i grant that though you married in obedience to your instincts you are as well off as i but i dont see that we are the worse for having thought a little  i did not marry in obedience to my instincts nelly and you know it i made a disinterested marriage with a man whom i felt i could respect as my superior i was convinced then that a grand passion was a folly  and what do you think now  i think that i did not know what i was talking about  i believe you were in love with ned when you married him and long enough before that too  of course i loved him i love him still  do you really to hear you one would think that you only respected him as a superior  you have no right to say that you dont understand  perhaps not would you mind explaining  i do not mean anything particular but there are two kinds of love there is a love which ones good sense suggestsa sort of moral approval  elinor laughed go on she said what is the other sort  the other sort has nothing to do with good sense it is an overpowering impulsea cravinga faith that defies logicsomething to look forward to feeling in your youth and look back to with a kindling heart in your age  indeed isnt the difference between the two sorts much the same as the difference between the old love and the new  what do you mean  i think i will take another cup of tea you neednt stop flying out at me though i dont mind it  excuse me i did not mean to fly out at you  its rather odd that we so seldom meet now without getting on this subject and having a row has that struck you at all  marian turned to the fire and remained silent  listen to me marian you are in the blues why dont you go to ned and tell him that he is a castiron walking machine and that you are unhappy and want the society of a fleshandblood man have a furious scene with him and all will come right  it is very easy to talk i could not go to him and make myself ridiculous like that the words would choke me besides i am not unhappy  what a lie you wicked woman a moment ago you were contemning all prudence and now you will not speak your mind because you are afraid of being ridiculous what is that but observing the wind and regarding the clouds i should like to know  i wish you would not speak harshly to me even in jest it hurts me  serve you right i am not a bit remorseful no matter let us talk of something else where did those flowers come from  douglas sent them i am going to the theatre tonight and i wanted a bouquet  very kind of him i wonder he did not bring it himself he rarely misses an excuse for coming  why do you say that nelly he comes here very seldom except on sunday and that is a regular thing just as your coming is  he was here on tuesday you saw him at mrs saunderss on wednesday he was at your athome on thursday and he sends a bouquet on saturday  i cannot help meeting him out and not to invite him to my athome would be to cut him pray are you growing spiteful like mrs leith fairfax  marian you got out of bed at the wrong side this morning and you have made that mistake oftener since your return from sark than in all your life before douglas has become a lazy goodfornothing and he comes here a great deal too often instead of encouraging him to dangle after you as he does and to teach you all those finely turned sentiments about love which you were airing a minute ago you ought to make him get called to the bar or sent into parliament or put to work in some fashion  nelly  bother nelly it is true and you know it as well as i do  if he fancies himself in love with me i cannot help it  you can help his following you about  i cannot he does not follow me about why does not ned object he knows that sholto is in love with me and he does not care  oh if it is only to make ned jealous then i have nothing more to say you may flirt away as hard as you please theres a knock at the door just in time to prevent us from quarrelling i know whose knock it is too  marian had flushed slightly at the sound and elinor with her feet stretched out before her lapped the carpet restlessly with her heels and watched her cousin sourly as douglas entered he was in evening dress  goodevening said elinor so you are going to the theatre too  why said douglas is any one coming with us shall we have the pleasure of your company  no replied elinor drily i thought mr conolly was perhaps going with you  i shall be very glad i am sure if he will said douglas  he will not said marian i doubt if he will come home before we start  you got my flowers safely i see  yes thank you they are beautiful  they need be if you are to wear them  i think i will go said elinor if you can spare me marian has been far from amiable and if you are going to pay her compliments i shall very soon be as bad as she goodbye douglas gratefully went with her to the door she looked very hard at him and almost made a grimace as they parted but she said nothing  i am very glad she went said marian when douglas returned she annoys me everything annoys me  you are leading an impossible life here marian he said putting his hand on her chair and bending over her whilst it lasts everything will annoy you and i who would give the last drop of my blood to spare you a moments pain shall never experience the delight of seeing you happy  what other life can i lead  douglas made an impulsive movement as though to reply but he hesitated and did not speak marian was not looking at him she was gazing into the fire  sholto she said after an interval of silence you must not come here any more  what  you are too idle you come here too often why do you not become a barrister or go into parliament or at least write books if nelly can succeed as an author surely you can  i have left all that behind me i am a failure you know why let us talk no more of it  do not go on like that said marian pettishly i dont like it  i am afraid to say or do anything you are so easily distressed  yes i know i am very cross elinor remarked it too i think you might bear with me sholto here most unexpectedly she rose and burst into tears when my whole life is one dreary record of misery i cannot always be patient i have been forbearing toward you many times  douglas was at first frightened for he had never seen her cry before then as she sat down again and covered her face with her handkerchief he advanced intending to kneel and put his arm about her but his courage failed he only drew a chair to the fire and bent over as he sat beside her till his face was close to hers saying it is all the fault of your mad marriage you were happy until then i have been silent hitherto but now that i see your tears i can no longer master myself listen to me marian you asked me a moment since what other life was open to you there is a better life leave england with me andand marian had raised her head and as she looked steadily at him he stopped and his lips became white  go on she said i am not angry what else  nothing else except happiness his voice died away there was a pause then recovering himself he went on with something of his characteristic stateliness there is no use in prolonging your present life it is a failure like mine why should you hesitate you know how seldom the mere letter of duty leads to either happiness or justice you can rescue me from a wasted existence you can preserve your own heart from a horrible slow domestic decay he will not care he cares for nothing he is morally murdering you you have no children to think of i love you and i offer you your choice of the fairest spots in the wide world to pass our future in with my protection to ensure your safety and comfort there wherever it may be you know what a hollow thing conventional virtue is who are the virtuous people about you mrs leith fairfax and her like if you love me you must know that you are committing a crime against nature in living as you are with a man who is as far removed from you in every human emotion as his workshop is from heaven you have striven to do your duty by him in vain he is none the happier we are unutterably the more miserable let us try a new life i have lived in society here all my days and have found its atmosphere most worthless most selfish most impure i want to be freeto shake the dust of london off my feet and enter on a life made holy by love you can respond to such an aspiration you too must yearn for a pure and free life it is within our reach you have but to stretch out your hand say something to me are you listening  it seems strange that i should be listening to you quite calmly as i am although you are proposing what the world thinks a disgraceful thing  does it matter what the world thinks i would not even to save myself from a wasted career ask you to take a step that would really disgrace you but i cannot bear to think of you looking back some day over a barren past and knowing that you sacrificed your happiness to fashionan idol do you remember last sunday when we discussed that bitter saying that women who have sacrificed their feelings to the laws of society secretly know that they have been fools for their pains he did not deny it you could give no good reason for disbelieving it you know it to be true and i am only striving to save you from that vain regret you have shewn that you can obey the world with grace and dignity when the world is right shew now that you can defy it fearlessly when it is tyrannical trust your heart marianmy darling marian trust your heartand mine  for what hour have you ordered the carriage  the carriage is that what you say to me at such a moment are you still flippant as ever  i am quite serious say no more now if i go i will go deliberately and not on the spur of your persuasion i must have time to think what hour did you say  seven  then it is time for me to dress you will not mind waiting here alone  if you would only give me one hopeful word i think i could wait happily forever  what can i say  say that you love me  i am striving to discover whether i have always loved you or not surely if there be such a thing as love we should be lovers  he was chilled by her solemn tone but he made a movement as if to embrace her  no she said stopping him i am his wife still i have not yet pronounced my own divorce  she left the room and he walked uneasily to and fro until she returned dressed in white he gazed at her with quickened breath as she confronted him neither heeded the click of her husbands latchkey in the door without  when i was a little boy marian he said gazing at her i used to think that paul delaroches christian martyr was the most exquisite vision of beauty in the world i have the same feeling as i look at you now  marian reminds me of that picture too said conolly i remember wondering he continued smiling as they started and turned toward him why the young ladyshe was such a perfect ladywas martyred in a ball dress as i took her costume to be marians wreath adds to the force of the reminiscence  if i recollect aright said marian taking up his bantering tone with a sharper irony delaroches martyr shewed a fine sense of the necessity of having her wrists gracefully tied i am about to follow her example by wearing these bracelets which i can never fasten be good enough to assist me both of you  she extended a hand to each and conolly after looking at the catch for a moment closed it dexterously at the first snap by the bye he said whilst douglas fumbled at the other bracelet i have to run away to glasgow tonight by the ten train we shall not see one another again until monday evening  douglass hand began to shake so that the gold band chafed marians arm there there she said drawing it away from him you do it for me ned sholto has no mechanical genius her hand was quite steady as conolly shut the clasp why must you go to glasgow  they have got into a mess at the works there and the engineer has telegraphed for me to go down and see what is the matter i shall certainly be back on monday have something for me to eat at half past seven i am sorry to be away from our sunday dinner douglas but you know the popular prejudice if you want a thing done see to it yourself  sholto has been very eloquent this evening on the subject of popular prejudices said marian he says that to defy the world is a proof of honesty  so it is said conolly i get on in the world by defying its old notions and taking nobodys advice but my own follow douglass precepts by all means do you know that it is nearly a quarter to eight  oh let us go we shall be late  i shall not see you tomorrow douglas goodnight  goodnight said douglas keeping at some distance for he did not care to offer conolly his hand before marian now pleasant journey  thank you hallo marian had impatiently turned back what have you forgotten  my operaglass said marian no thanks you would not know where to look for it i will go myself  she went upstairs and conolly after a pause followed and found her in their bedroom closing the drawer from which she had just taken the operaglass  marian he said you have been crying today is anything wrong or is it only nervousness  only nervousness said marian how did you find out that i had been crying it was only for an instant because nelly annoyed me does my face shew it  it does to me not to anyone else are you more cheerful now  yes i am all right i will go to glasgow with you if you like  conolly recoiled disconcerted why he said do you wish he recovered himself and added it is too cold my dear and i must travel very fast i shall be busy all the time besides you are forgetting the theatre and douglas who by the bye is catching cold on the steps  well i had better go with douglas since it will make you happier  go with douglas my dear one if it will make you happier said he kissing her to his surprise she threw her arm round him held him fast by the shoulder and looked at him with extraordinary earnestness he gave a little laugh and disengaged himself gently saying dont you think your nervousness is taking a turn rather inconvenient for douglas she let her hands fall closed her lips and passed quietly out he went to the window and watched her as she entered the carriage douglas held the door open for her and conolly looking at him with a sort of pity noted that he was in his way a handsome man and that his habit of taking himself very seriously gave him a certain dignity the brougham rolled away into the fog conolly pulled down the blind and began to pack his portmanteau to a vigorously whistled accompaniment     chapter xvii   conolly returned from glasgow a little before eight on monday evening there was no light in the window when he entered the garden miss mcquinch opened the door before he reached it  what he said going the moment i come in then seeing her face by the hall lamp he put down his bag quickly and asked what the matter was  i dont know whether anything is the matter i am very glad you have returned come into the drawingroom i dont want the servants to hear us talking  there is no light here he said following her in is it possible you have been waiting in the dark  he lit a candle and was about to light a lamp when she exclaimed impatiently oh i did not notice it what does it matter do let the lamp alone and listen to me he obeyed much amused at her irritation  where has marian gone to she asked  is she out he said suddenly grave you forget that i have come straight from glasgow  i have been here since three oclock marian sent me a note not to come on sundaythat she should be out and that you were away but they tell me that she was at home all yesterday except for two hours when she was out with sholto she packed her trunks in the evening and went away with them she told the cabman to drive to euston i dont know what it all means and i have been half distracted waiting here for you i thought you would never come there is a note for you on your dressingtable  he pursed his lips a little and looked attentively at her but said nothing  wont you go and open it she said anxiously it must contain some explanation  i am afraid the explanation is obvious  you have no right to say that how do you know if you are not going to read her letter you had better say so at once i dont want to pry into it i only want to know what is become of marian  you shall read it by all means will you excuse me whilst i fetch it  she stamped with impatience he smiled and went for the letter which after a brief absence he placed unopened on the table before her saying  i suppose this is it i laid my hand on it in the dark  are you going to open it she said hardly able to contain herself  no  he had not raised his voice but it struck her that he was in a rage his friendly look and quiet attitude first reassured then on second thoughts exasperated her  why wont you  i really dont know somehow i am not curious it interests you pray open it  i will die first if it lie there until i open it it will lie there forever  he opened the envelope neatly with a paper cutter and handed her the enclosure she kept down her hands stubbornly he smiled a little still presenting it at last she snatched it much as she would have liked to snatch a handful of his hair having read it she turned pale and looked as she had used to in her childhood when in disgrace and resolute not to cry i had rather have had my two hands cut off she said passionately after a pause  it is very sad for you said conolly sympathetically he is an educated man but i cannot think that he has much in him  he is a selfish lying conceited hound educated indeed and what are you going to do may i ask  eat my supper i am as hungry as a bear  yes you had better i think goodevening he seemed to know that she would not leave for he made no movement to open the door for her on her way out she turned and so came at him with her fists clenched that for a moment he was doubtful whether she would not bodily assault him  are you a brute or a fool or both she said letting her temper loose how long do you intend to stand there doing nothing  what can i do miss mcquinch he said gently  you can follow her and bring her back before she has made an utter idiot of herself with that miserable blackguard are you afraid of him if you are i will go with you and not let him touch you  thank you he said goodhumoredly but you see she does not wish to live with me  good god man what woman do you think could wish to live with you i suppose marian wanted a human being to live with and not a calculating machine you would drive any woman away if you had feeling enough to have kicked him out of the house and then beaten her black and blue for encouraging him you would have been more of a man than you are she would have loved you more you are not a man you are a stone full of brainssuch as they are listen to me mr conolly there is one chance leftif you will only make haste go after them overtake them thrash him within an inch of his life and bring her back and punish her how you please so long as you shew her that you care you can do it if you will only make up your mind he is a coward and he is afraid of you i have seen it in his eye you are worth fifty of himif you would only not be so cold bloodedif you will only godear mr conollyyoure not really insensibleyou will wont you  this the first tender tone he had ever heard in her voice made him look at her curiously what does the letter say he asked still quietly but inexorably  she snatched it up again here she said our marriage was a mistake i am going away with douglas to the other side of the world it is all i can do to mend matters pray forget me that is what her letter says since you condescend to ask  it is too late then you felt that as you read it i think  yes she cried sitting down in a paroxysm of grief but unable to weep it is too late and it is all your fault what business had you to go away you knew what was going to happen you intended it to happen you wanted it to happen you are glad it has happened and it serves you right pray forget her oh yes poor girl she need not trouble about that i declare there is nothing viler meaner cowardlier selfisher on earth than a man oh if we had only done what we always said we would dokept free from you  it was a good plan said conolly submissively  was it how were we to know that you were not made of flesh and blood pray there let me go the table was between them but she rose and shook off an imaginary detaining hand i dont want to hear anything more about it i suppose you are right not to care very likely she was right to go too so we are all right and everything is for the best no doubt marian is ruined of course but what does that matter to you she was only in your way you can console yourself with your here armande came in and elinor turned quickly to the fireplace and stood there so that the housemaid should not see her face  your dinner sir said armande with a certain artificiality of manner that was under the circumstances significant there is a nice fire in the laboratory  thank you said conolly presently armande  the things will spoil if you wait too long sir the mistress was very particular with me and cook about it and armande with an air of declining further responsibility went out  what shall i do without marian said conolly not one woman in a hundred is capable of being a mistress to her servants she saved me all the friction of housekeeping  you are beginning to feel your loss said elinor facing him again a pleasant thing for a woman of her talent to be thrown away to save you the friction of housekeeping if you had paid half the attention to her happiness that she did to your dinners you would not be in your present predicament  have you really calculated that it is twice as easy to make a woman happy as to feed a man  calc yes i have i tell you that it is three times as easysix times as easy more fool the woman you can make a woman happy for a week by a word or a kiss how long do you think it takes to order a weeks dinners i suppose you consider a kiss a weakness  i am afraidjudging by the resultthat i am not naturally clever at kissing  no i should think not indeed then you had better go and do what you are clever ateat your dinner  miss mcquinch did you ever see an unfortunate little child get a severe fall and then instead of a little kindly petting catch a sound whacking from its nurse for daring to startle her and spoil its clothes  well what is the point of that  you remind me a little of the nurse i have had a sort of fall this evening  and now you are going to pretend to be hurt i suppose because you dont care to be told that it is your own fault that is a common experience with children too i tell you plainly that i dont believe you are hurt at all though you may not be exactly pleasedjust for the moment however i did not mean to be uncivil if you are really sorry i am at least as sorry i have not said all i think  what more  nothing of any use to say i see i am wasting my time hereand no doubt wasting yours too  well i think you have had your turn if you are not thoroughly satisfied pray go on for ten minutes longer your feelings do you credit as the phrase goes still do not forget that you thought just the same of me a week ago and that if you had said as much then you might have prevented what has happened giving me a piece of your mind now is of no use except as far as it relieves you to marian or me or anyone else it does no good so when you have said your worst we cannot do better i think than set our wits to work about our next move  elinor received this for a moment in dudgeon then she laughed sourly and said there is some sense in that i am as much to blame as anybody i dont deny itif that is any comfort to you but as to the next move you say yourself that it is too late to do anything and i dont see that you can do much  that is so but there are a few things to be faced first i have to set marian and myself free  how  divorce her  divorce elinor looked at him in dismay he was unmoved then her gaze fell slowly and she said yes i suppose you have a right to that  she also  so that she may marry himfrom a sense of duty that will be so happy for her  she will have time before she is free to find out whether she likes him or not there will be a great fuss in the family over the scandal  do you care about that i dont  no however thats a detail marian will perhaps write to you if so just point out to her that her five hundred a year belongs to her still and makes her quite independent of him and of me that is all i think you need take no pains now to conceal what has happened the servants below know it as well as we in a week it will be town talk  elinor looked wistfully at him her impetuosity failing her as she felt how little effect it was producing yet her temper rather rose than fell at him there was a much more serious hostility than before in her tone as she said  you seem to have been thoroughly prepared for what has happened i do not want any instructions from you as to what i shall write to marian about her money affairs i want to know in case she takes it into her head to come back when she has found what a fool she has made of herself whether i may tell her that you are glad to be rid of her and that there is no use in her humiliating herself by coming to your door and being turned away  shall i explain the situation to you from my point of view said he at the sound of his voice she looked up in alarm the indulgent halfplayful manner which she had almost lost the sense of because it was so invariable with him in speaking to ladies was suddenly gone she felt that the real man was coming out now without ceremony he was quick to perceive the effect he had produced to soften it he placed a comfortable chair on the hearthrug and said in his ordinary friendly way sit nearer the fire we can talk more comfortably now he continued standing with his back to the mantelpiece let me tell you miss mcquinch that when you talk of my turning people away from my door you are not talking fair and square sense to me i dont turn my acquaintances off in that way much less my friends and a woman who has lived with me as my wife for eighteen months must always be a rather particular friend i liked her before i was her husband and i shall continue to like her when i am no longer her husband so you need have no fear on that score but i wont remain her husband you said just now that i knew what was going to happen that i intended it to happen wanted it to happen and am glad it happened there is more truth in that than you thought when you said it for some time past marian has been staying with me as a matter of custom and convenience only using me as a cover for her philandering with douglas and paying me by keeping the house very nicely for me i had asked myself once or twice how long this was to last i was in no hurry for the answer for although i was wifeless and had no one to live with who really cared for me i was quite prepared to wait a couple of years if necessary on the chance of our making it up somehow but sooner or later i should have insisted on closing our accounts and parting and i am not sorry now that the end has come since it was inevitable though i am right sorry for the way it has come instead of eloping in the conventional way she should have come to an understanding with me i could easily have taken her for a trip in the states where we could have stopped a few months in south dakota and got divorced without any scandal i have never made any claims on her since she found out that she didnt care for me and she might have known from that that i was not the man to keep her against her will and play dog in the manger with a fellow like douglas however thats past praying for now she has had enough of me and i have had more than enough of her set and her family except that i should like to remain good friends with you you are the only one of the whole lot worth your salt it is understood of course that you take marians part against me on all issues but will you be friends as far as is consistent with that  all right said nelly shortly  shake hands on it and ill tell you something else that will help you to understand me better he said holding out his hand she gave hers and when the bargain was struck he turned to the fire and seated himself on the edge of the table  you know that when i married he resumed i was promoted to mix in fashionable society for the first time of course you do that was the whole excitement of the affair for the family you know the impression i made on polite society better probably than i do now tell me do you know what impression polite society made on me  dont understand  perhaps it has never occurred even to you sharp as you are that i could have taken society otherwise than at its own valuation of itself as something much higher more cultivated and refined than anything that i had been accustomed to well i never believed in that much at any time but it was not until i had made a mésalliance for marians sake that i realized how infinitely beneath me and my class was the one i had married into  mésalliancewith marian i take back the shake hands  mésalliance with her class for her sake i made the distinction purposely now what am i miss mcquinch a worker i belonged and belong to the class that keeps up the world by its millions of serviceable hands and serviceable brains all the pride of caste in me settles on that point i admit no loafer as my equal the man who is working at the bench is my equal whether he can do my days work or not provided he is doing the best he can but the man who does not work anyhow and the class that does not work is a class below mine when i annoyed marian by refusing to wear a tall hat and cuffs i did so because i wanted to have it seen as i walked through piccadilly and st jamess street that i did not belong there just as your people walk through a poor street dressed so as to shew that they dont belong there to me a man like your uncle marians father or like marmaduke or douglas loafing idly round spending money that has been made by the sweat of men like myself are little better than thieves they get on with the queerest makeshifts for selfrespect old mr lind with family pride douglas with personal vanity and marmaduke with a sort of interest in his own appetites and his own jollity everything is a sham with them they have drill and etiquet instead of manners fashions instead of tastes small talk instead of intercourse everything that is special to them as distinguished from workers is a sham when you get down to the real element in them good or bad you find that it is something that is common to them and to all civilized mankind the reason that this isnt as clear to other workmen who come among them as it is to me is that most workmen share their ignorance of the things they affect superiority in poor jackson whom you all call the yankee cad and who is not a cad at all in his proper place among the engineers at our works believes in the sham refinements he sees around him at the athomes he is so fond of he has no art in himno trained ear for music or for fine diction no trained eye for pictures and colors and buildings no cultivated sense of dignified movement gesture and manner but he knows what fashionable london listens to and looks at and how it talks and behaves and he makes that his standard and sets down what is different from it as vulgar now the difference between me and him is that i got an artistic training by accident when i was young and had the natural turn to profit by it before i ever saw a west end londoner i knew beautiful from ugly rare from common in music speech costume and gesture for in my fathers operatic and theatrical companies there did come now and then among the crowd of thirdraters a dancer an actor a scenepainter a singer or a bandsman or conductor who was a fine artist consequently i was not to be taken in like jackson by madeup faces trashy pictures drawling and lounging and strutting and tailoring drawingroom singing and drawingroom dancing any more than by bad ventilation and unwholesome hours and food not to mention polite dram drinking and the round of cruelties they call sport i found that the moment i refused to accept the habits of the rich as standards of refinement and propriety the whole illusion of their superiority vanished at once when i married marian i was false to my class i had a sort of idea that my early training had accustomed me to a degree of artistic culture that i could not easily find in a working girl and that would be quite natural to marian i soon found that she had the keenest sense of what was ladylike and no sense of what was beautiful at all a drawing a photograph or an engraving sensibly framed without a white mount round it to spoil it pained her as much as my wrists without cuffs on them no mill girl could have been less in sympathy with me on the very points for which i had preferred her to the mill girls the end of it was that i felt that love had made me do a thoroughly vulgar thingmarry beneath me these aristocratic idle gentlemen will never be shamed out of their laziness and lowmindedness until the democratic working gentlemen refuse to associate with them instead of running after them and licking their boots i am heartily glad now to be out of their set and rid of them instead of having to receive them civilly in my house for marians sake the whole business was strangling me the strain of keeping my feeling to myself was more than you can imagine do you know that there have been times when i have been so carried away with the idea that she must be as tired of the artificiality of our life as i was that i have begun to speak my mind frankly to her and when she recoiled hurt and surprised and frightened that i was going to turn coarse at last i have shut up and sat there apparently silent but really saying under my breath why dont you go why dont you leave me vanish fly away to your own people you must be a dream i never married you you dont know me you cant be my wife your lungs were not made to breathe the air i live in i have said a thousand things like that and then wondered whether there was any truth in telepathywhether she could possibly be having my thoughts transferred to her mind and thinking it only her imagination i would ask myself whether i despised her or not calling on myself for the truth as if i did not believe the excuses i made for her out of the fondness i could not get over i am fond of her still sometimes i did not reallypractically i meandespise her until i gave up thinking about her at all there was a certain kind of contempt in that indifference beyond a doubt there is no use denying it besides it is proved to me now by the new respect i feel for her because she has had the courage and grit to try going away with douglas but my love for her is over nothing short of her being born over againa thing that sometimes happenswill ever bring her into contact with me after this to put it philosophically she made the mistake of avoiding all realities and yet marrying herself to the hardest of realities a working man so it was inevitable that she should go back at last to the region of shadows and mate with that ghostliest of all unrealities the nonworking man perhaps too the union may be more fruitful than ours the cross between us was too violent now you have the whole story from my point of view what do you  hush said elinor interrupting him what is that noise outside  the house bell began to ring violently and they could hear a confused noise of voices and footsteps without  can she have come back said elinor starting up  impossible said conolly looking disturbed for the first time they stood a moment listening with averted eyes a second peal from the bell was followed by roars of laughter amid which a remonstrant voice was audible then the house door was hammered with a stick conolly ran downstairs at once and opened it on the step he found marmaduke reeling in the arms of the rev george  how are you ol fler said marmaduke plunging into the hall the parson is tight i found him tumbling about high street and brought him along  pray excuse this intrusion whispered the rev george you see the state he is in he accosted me near campden hill and i really could not be seen walking with him into town i wonder he was not arrested  he is the worse for drink but he is sober enough to know how to amuse himself at your expense said conolly aloud come up to the laboratory miss mcquinch is there  but he is not fit urged the clergyman look at him trying to hang up his hat how absurdi should rather say how deplorable i assure you he is perfectly tipsy he has been ringing the bells of the houses and requesting females to accompany us better warn elinor  nonsense said conolly i have some news that will sober him here is miss mcquinch are you going  yes said elinor i should lose my patience if i had to listen to georges comments and i am tired i would rather go  not yet nelly wont um stay and talk to ums marmadukes  let me go said elinor snatching away her hand which he had seized you ought to be at home in bed you are a sot at this marmaduke laughed boisterously she passed him contemptuously and left the three men then went upstairs marmaduke dropping his pretence of drunkenness under the influence of conollys presence  marian is not in i presume said the clergyman when they were seated  no said conolly she has eloped with douglas  they stared at him then marmaduke gave a long whistle and the clergyman rose pale what do you mean sir he said  conolly did not answer and the rev george slowly sat down again  well im damned sorry for it said marmaduke emphatically it was a mean thing for douglas to do with all his brag about his honor  the rev george covered his face with his handkerchief and sobbed  come shut up old fellow and dont make an ass of yourself said marmaduke what are you going to do conolly  i must simply divorce her  go for heavy damages conolly knock a few thousand out of him just to punish him  he could easily afford it besides why should i punish him  my dear friend cried the clergyman you must not dream of a divorce i implore you to abandon such an idea consider the disgrace the impiety the publicity would kill my father  conolly shook his head  there is no such thing as divorce known to the church what god hath joined together let no man put asunder  she had no right to bolt said marmaduke thats certain  i was married by a registrar said conolly and as there is no such thing as civil marriage known to the church our union from the ecclesiastical point of view has no existence we were not joined by god in fact in your sense to deny her the opportunity of remarrying would be to compel her to live as an adulteress in the eye of the law which by the bye would make me the father of douglass children i cannot merely because your people are afraid of scandal take such a revenge on marian as to refuse her the freedom she has sacrificed so much for after all since our marriage has proved a childless one the only reason for our submitting to be handcuffed to one another now that our hearts are no longer in the arrangement is gone  the game began at sark said marmaduke douglas stuck to her there like a leech hes been about the house here a good deal since she came back i often wondered you didnt kick him out but of course it was not my business to say anything was she huffed into going you hadnt any row with her just before had you  we never had rows  that was your mistake conolly you should have heard poor susanna and me fighting we always ended by swearing we would never speak to one another again nothing duller than a smooth life if you had given marian something to complain of she would have been too much taken up with it to bother about douglas  but have you ascertained whither they have gone said the clergyman distractedly will you not follow them  i know nothing of their movements probably they are crossing to new york  but surely you ought to follow her said the rev george you may yet be in time to save her from worse than death  yah said marmaduke drop all that rot george worse than death be hanged serves the family right they are a jolly sight too virtuous it will do them good to get shewn up a bit  if you have no respect for the convictions of a priest exclaimed the rev george shedding tears you might at least be silent in the presence of a heartbroken brother and husband  oh i dont want to shew any want of consideration for you or conolly said marmaduke sulkily no doubt its rough on you but as to the feelings of the family i tell you flatly that i dont care if the whole crew were brought to the old bailey tomorrow and convicted of bigamy it would take the conceit out of them  i know not how to break this wretched news to my father said the rev george turning disconsolately from his sottish cousin to conolly  it is no such uncommon occurrence the less fuss made about it the better she is not to blame and i shall not be heard crying out misery and disgrace your family can very well follow my example i have nothing to say against her and i believe she has nothing to say against me nothing can prevent such publicity as a petition for divorce must entail your father will survive it never fear  the clergyman remembering how vainly he had tried to change conollys intention when marian was to be married felt that he should succeed no better now that she was to be divorced silent and cast down he sat dangling his handkerchief between his knees and leaning forward on his elbows toward the fire  you must excuse me if i see my way straight through to the end i daresay you would rather realize it gradually inevitable as it is added conolly looking down with some pity at his drooping figure i cannot help my habit of mind when are you going to be married he continued to marmaduke  i dont know the countess is in a hurry im not but i suppose it will be some time in spring  you have made up your mind to it at last  oh i never had any particular objection to it only i dont like to be hunted into a corner conny is a good little girl and will make a steady wife i dont like her mother but as for herself she is fond of me and after all i did lead her a dance long ago besides old boy the earl is forking out handsomely and as i have some notion of settling down to farm his dust will come in conveniently as capital  the clergyman rose and slowly pulled on his woolen gloves  if youre going i will see you part of the way said marmaduke ill cheer you up you know you neednt tell the governor until tomorrow  i had rather go alone if you intend to behave as you did before  never fear im as sober as a judge now come along away with melancholy youll have douglas for a brotherinlaw before this time next year  this seemed to have been in the clergymans mind for he shook hands with his host more distantly than usual when they were gone conolly went to the laboratory and rang for his neglected dinner which he ate with all a travellers appetite from the dinner table he went straight to the organ and played until a little before midnight when after a brief turn in the open air he retired to bed and was soon quietly asleep     book iv     chapter xviii   miss mcquinch spent christmas morning in her sittingroom reading a letter which had come by the morning post it was dated the 17th december at new york and the formal beginning and ending were omitted this was an old custom between marian and her cousin in their girlish correspondence they had expressed their affection by such modes of address as my darling marian and my dearest nelly subsequently they became oppressed by these ceremonies and dropped them thereafter their letters contained only the matter to be communicated and the signature  you are the only person in england wrote marian to whom i dare write now a month ago i had more correspondents than i had time to answer do you know nelly i hesitated before commencing this letter lest you should no longer care to have anything to do with me that may have been an unworthy thought for a friend but it was an unavoidable one for a woman  and now comes the great vain question what does everybody say oh if i could only disembody myself fly back to london for a few hours and listen invisibly to society talking about me i know this is mean but one must fill up life with some mean curiosities so please tell me what kind of sensation i have caused just the usual one i suppose half the people never would have thought it and the other half knew all along what it would come to well i do not care much about the world in general but i cannot quiet my conscience on the subject of my father and george it must be very hard on papa that after being disappointed in my marriage and having suffered long ago from what my mother did he should now be disgraced by his daughter for disgraced alas is the word i am afraid poor georges prospects must be spoiled by the scandal which i know well must be terrible i thought my first duty was to leave ned free and to free myself at all hazards and so i did not dwell on the feelings and interests of others as much as i perhaps ought to have done there is one point about which i am especially anxious it never occurred to me before i went that people might say that my going was neds fault and that he had treated me badly you must contradict this with all your might and main if you hear it even hinted at  there is no use in putting off the confession any longer nelly i have made an utter fool of myself i wish i were back with ned again there what do you think of that now for another great confession and a most humiliating one sholto is ai dont know what epithet is fair i suppose i have no right to call him an impostor merely because we were foolish enough to overrate him but i can hardly believe now that we ever really thought that there were great qualities and powers latent beneath his proud reserve ned i know never believed in sholto and i in my infinite wisdom set that down to his not understanding him ned was right as usual if you want to see how selfish people are and how skindeep fashionable politeness is take a voyage go with a picked company of the nice people you have met for an hour or so at a dinner or an athome and see how different they will appear when they have been cooped up in a ship with you day and night for a week an ocean steamer is the next worst thing to the palace of truth poor sholto did not stand the ordeal he was ridiculously distant in his manner to the rest of the passengers and in little matters at table and so forth he was really just as selfish as he could be he was impatient because i was ill the first two days and afterwards he seemed to think that i ought not to speak to anyone but himself the doctor who was very attentive to me was his particular aversion and it was on his account that we had our first quarrel the upshot of which was a scene between them which i overheard one very fine day when all the passengers were on deck sholto met the doctor in the saloon and offered him a guinea for his attendance on me telling him in the most offensively polite way that i would not trouble him for any further services the doctor retorted very promptly and concisely and though what he said was not dignified i sympathized with him and took care to be very friendly with him at dinner meals take place on hoard ship at intervals of ten minutes it is horrifying to see the quantity of food the elderly people consume to prevent further hostilities i took care to be always in the way when the doctor encountered sholto afterwards i cannot imagine ned involving himself in such a paltry squabble it is odd how things come about i used to take sholtos genius for granted and think a great deal of it in another sense i used to take neds genius for granted and think nothing of it now i have found out in a single fortnight that we saw all of sholto that there was to be seen his reserves of talent existed only in our imagination he has absolutely no sense of humor and he is always grumbling neither the servants nor the food nor the rooms nor the wine satisfy him imagine how this comes home to me who from not having heard grumbling for two years had forgotten that men ever were guilty of it i flirted a little a very little with the doctor not because i meant anything serious but because it amused me and made the trip pleasant sholto will not understand this one day on board i was indiscreet enough to ask sholto the use of a piece of machinery belonging to the ship ned would have known or if he had not would very soon have found out sholto didnt know and was weak enough to pretend that he did so he snubbed me by saying that i could not understand it this put me on my mettle and i asked the surgeon that afternoon about it the surgeon didnt know and said so but he appealed to the first officer who explained it i intended to revenge myself on sholto by retailing the explanation to him next day but unfortunately whether through the first officers want of perspicuity or my own stupidity i was not a bit the wiser for the explanation  i can tell you nothing as to what we are likely to do next as sholto has given up all his prospects for me i cannot honorably desert him i know now that i have ruined myself for nothing and i must at least try to hide from him that he has done likewise i can see that he is not happy but he tries so desperately to persuade himself that he is and clings so to the idea that the world is well lost for me that i have not the heart to undeceive him so we are still lovers and cynical though it sounds i make him a great deal happier in my insincerity than i could if i really loved him because i humor him with a cunning quite incompatible with passion he on the other hand being still sincere tries my patience terribly with his jealousies and importunities as he has nothing to do he is almost always with me and a man who has no office to go toi dont care who he isis a trial of which you can have no conception so much for our present relations but i fearindeed i knowthat they will not last long i dare not look steadily at the future in spite of all that he has sacrificed for me i cannot live forever with him there are times at which he inspires me with such a frenzy of aversion and disgust that i have to put the strongest constraint upon myself to avoid betraying my feelings to him we intended going to the west indies direct from here in search of some idyllic retreat where we could live alone together he still entertains this project but as i have totally abandoned it i put him off with some pretext for remaining here whenever he mentions it i have only one hope of gaining a separation without being open to the reproach of having deserted him you remember how we disputed that saturday about the merits of a grand passion which i so foolishly longed for well i have tried it and proved it to be a lamentable delusion selfish obstinate blind intemperate and transient as it has evaporated from me so it will evaporate from sholto in the course of time it would have done so already but that his love was more genuine than mine when the time comes he will get rid of me without the least remorse and so he will have no excuse for reviving his old complaints of my treachery  one new and very disagreeable feature in my existence which i had partly prepared myself for is the fear of detection we sailed before our flight had become public and as there was fortunately no one on board who knew us i had a nine days respite and could fearlessly approach the other women who i suppose would not have spoken to me had they known the truth but here it is different neds patents are so much more extensively worked here than in england and the people are so goahead that they take a great interest in him and are proud of him as an american the news got into the papers a few days after we arrived to appreciate the full significance of this you should know what american newspapers are one of them actually printed a long account of my going away with every paragraph headed in large print domestic unhappiness the serpent in the laboratory the temptation the flight the pursuit and so on all invented of course other papers give the most outrageous anecdotes old jokes are revived and ascribed to us i am accused of tearing his hair out and he of coming home late at nights drunk two portraits of ferocious old women supposed to be neds motherinlaw have been published the latest version appeared in a sunday paper and is quite popular in this hotel according to it ned was in the habit of devoting me to science by trying electrical experiments on me this the account says was kind of rough on the poor woman the day before i scooted a new machine appeared before the house drawn by six horses what are them men foolin round with mr c said i thats hubbys latest replied ned i guess its the boss electrodynamic fixin in the universe full charge that battery with a pint of washing soda an youll fetch up a current fit to ravage a contnent you shall have a try tmorro mornin sal youre better seasoned to it than most britishers but if it dont straighten your hair and lift the sparks outer your eyelashes you bet it wont mr c said i that night this is only what the paper says mind i stole out of bed arranged the wires on each side of ned so that if he stirred an inch he would make contact charged the battery and gently woke him saying mr c love dont stir for your life them things thats ticklin your whiskers is the conductors of that boss fixin o yourn if i was you id lie still until the battery runs down darn it all said ned afraid to lift his lips for a shout and coming out in cold water all over the forehead it wont run down for a week clear thatll answer me nicely i replied goodbye mr c young douglas from the corner grocery is waitin for me with a shay down the avenue i cannot help laughing at these things but they drive sholto frantic he is always described in them as a young man from some shop or other he tries hard out of delicacy to keep the papers which contain them away from me but i hear about them at breakfast and buy them downstairs in the hall for myself another grievance of sholtos is that i will not have meals privately but my dislike to being always alone with him is greater than my dread that my secret will leak out and that some morning i shall see in the peoples faces that the mrs forster who has so often been regaled with the latest account of the great scandal is no other than the famous mrs conolly that evil day will come sooner or later but i had rather face it in one of these wonderful hotels than in a boardinghouse which i might be asked to leave as to taking a house of our own i shrink from any such permanent arrangement we are noticed a good deal sholto is of course handsome and distinguished and people take a fancy to me just as they used to long ago i was once proud of this but now it is a burden to me for instance there was a mrs crawford staying here with her husband a general who has just built a house here she was so determined to know me that i found it hard to keep her off without offending her at last she got ill and then i felt justified in nursing her sholto was very sulky because i did so and wanted to know what business it was of mine i did not trouble myself about his anger and mrs crawford was well in two days in fact i think sholto was right in saying that she had only overeaten herself after that i could avoid her no longer and she was exceedingly kind to me she wanted to introduce me to all her new york friends and begged me to leave the hotel and go to her new mansion there was plenty of room for us she said i did not know what to say i could not repay her kindness by going to her house under false colors and letting her introduce me to her circle and yet i could make no reasonable excuse at last seeing that she attributed my refusals to pride i told her plainly that if her friends were to learn my history by any accident they might not thank her for the introduction she was quite confounded but she did not abate her kindness in the least although my reservation of confidence in only giving her a hint of the truth checked her advances you may think this an insane indiscretion on my part but if you knew how often i have longed to stand up before everybody and proclaim who i am and so get rid of the incubus of a perpetual falsehood you would not be so much surprised there is one unspeakable blessing in american law it is quite easy to obtain a divorce one can get free without sacrificing everything except bare existence i do not care what anybody may argue to the contrary our marriage laws are shameful  i shall expect to hear from you very soon if you desert me nelly there is no such thing as friendship in the world i want particularly to know what ned didas far as you knowwhen he heard the news is papa very angry and above all could you find out how mrs douglas is i thought that sholto would be uneasy and remorseful about her but he does not really care half so much as i do how selfish i have been i used to flatter myself that i was thoughtful for others because i made a habita detestably selfconscious habitof being considerate in trifles and in the end after being so vaingloriously attentive to the momentary comfort of all connected with me i utterly forgot them and thought only of myself when their whole happiness was concerned i never knew how high i stood in my own estimation until i found how far the discovery of my folly and selfishness made me fall tell me everything i cannot write any more now my eyes are smarting i feel as if i had been writing for a whole month instead of two days goodbye for three weeks  marian  ps i have just learnt from a very severe criticism in one of the papers that mdlle lalage virtue has failed here completely i fear from the wording that her unfortunate habit was apparent to the audience     chapter xix   on a cold afternoon in january sholto douglas entered a hold in new york and ascended to a room on the first floor marian was sitting there thinking with a letter in her lap she only looked up for a moment when he entered and he plucked off his sealskin gloves and threw aside his overcoat in silence  it is an infernal day he said presently  marian sighed and roused herself the rooms look cheerless in winter without the open fireplaces we are accustomed to in england  damn the rooms he muttered  marian took up her letter again  do you know that he has filed a petition for divorce he said aggressively  yes  you might have mentioned it to me probably you have known it for days past  yes i thought it was a matter of course  or rather you did not think at nil i suppose you would have left me in ignorance forever if i had not heard from london myself  is it of importance then  certainly it isof vital importance  have you any other news from whom have you heard  i have received some private letters  oh i beg your pardon  five minutes passed in silence he looked out of the window frowning she sat as before  how much longer do you intend to stay in this place he said turning upon her suddenly  in new york  this is new york i believe  i think we may as well stay here as anywhere else  indeed on what grounds have you arrived at that cheering conclusion  marian shrugged her shoulders i dont know she said  nor do i you do not seem happy here at least if you are you fail to communicate your state of mind to those about you  so it seems  what does that mean  that you do not seem to be happy either  how in the devils name can you expect me to be happy in this city do you think it is pleasant to have no alternative to the society of american men except that of a sulky woman  sholto said marian rising quickly and looking at him in surprise  spare me these airs he said coldly you will have to accustom yourself to hear the truth occasionally  she sat down again i am not giving myself airs she said earnestly i am astonished have i really been sulky  you have been in the sulks for days past and you are in them at this moment  there is some misunderstanding between us then for you have seemed to me quite cross and out of sorts for the last week and i thought you were out of temper when you came in just now  that is rather an oldfashioned retort  sholto i do not know whether you intend it or not but you are speaking very slightingly to me  he muttered something and walked across the room and back i am quite clear on one point at least he said it was not for this sort of thing that i crossed the atlantic with you and you had bettor make our relations more agreeable if you wish me to make them permanent  you to make them permanent i do not understand  i shall not shrink from explaining myself if your husbands suit is undefended he will obtain a decree which will leave you a single woman in six months now whatever you may think to the contrary there is not a club in london that would hold me in any way bound to marry you after the manner in which you have behaved let me remind you that your future position depends on your present conduct you have apparently forgotten it  she looked at him and he went back to the window  my husbands suit cannot be defended she said doubtless you will act according to the dictates of the london clubs  i do not say so he said turning angrily i shall act according to the dictates of my own common sense and do not be too sure that the petition will be unopposed the law recognizes the plea of connivance  but it would be a false plea said marian raising her voice  i shall not discuss that with you whether your husband was blind or merely kept his eyes shut will not be decided by us you have been warned we will drop the subject now if you please  do you suppose said marian with a bright color in her cheeks that after what you have said anything could induce me to marry you  he was startled and remained for a moment motionless then he said in his usual cold tone as you please you may think better of it i will leave you for the present when we meet again you will be calmer  yes she said goodbye  without answering he changed his coat for a silk jacket transferred his cigarcase to a pocket in it and went out when he had passed the threshold he hesitated and returned  why do you say goodbye he said after clearing his throat uneasily  i do not like to leave you without saying it  i hope you have not misunderstood me marian i did not mean that we should part  i know that nevertheless we shall part i will never sleep beneath the same roof with you again  come he said shutting the door this is nonsense you are out of temper  so you have already told me she said becoming pale  well butmarian perhaps i may have spoken rather harshly just now but i did not mean you to take it so you must be reasonable  pray let us have no more words about it i need no apologies and desire no advances goodbye is enough  but marian said he coming nearer you must not fancy that i have ceased to love you  above all said marian let us have no more of that you say you hate this place and the life we lead here i am heartily sick of it and have been so for a long time  let us go elsewhere  yes but not together one word she added resolutely seeing his expression become fierce i will not endure any violence even of language from you i know of old what you are when you lose your temper and if you insult me i will summon aid and proclaim who i am  do you think i am going to strike you  no because you dare not but i will not listen to oaths or abuse  what have you to complain of what is your grievance  i make no complaint i exercise the liberty i bought so dearly to go where i please and do what i please  and to desert me when i have sacrificed everything for you i have incurred enormous expenses alienated my friends risked my position in society and broken my mothers heart for your sake  but for that i would have left you before i am very sorry  you have heard something in that letter which makes you hope that your husband will take you back not a woman in london will speak to you  i tell you i am not going back oh sholto dont be so mean can we not part with dignity we have made a mistake let us acknowledge it quietly and go our several ways  i will not be got rid of so easily as you suppose he said his face darkening menacingly do you think i believe in your going out alone from this hotel and living by yourself in a strange city come who is it  who is what do you mean  what new connexion have you formed you were very anxious about our ship returning the other dayanxious about the mails of course perhaps also about the surgeon  i understand you think i am leaving you to go to some other man i will tell you now the true reason  do said he sarcastically biting his lip  i will i am leaving you because instead of loving you as i foolishly thought i could i neither respect nor even like you you are utterly selfish and narrowminded and i deserve my disappointment for having deserted for your sake a far better man i am sorry you have sacrificed so much for me but if you had been worthy of a womans regard you would not have lost me  douglas stared at her i selfish and narrowminded he said with the calm of stupefaction  yes  i may have been narrowminded in devoting myself so entirely to you said he slowly after a pause but though i do not ask for gratitude i think i have been sufficiently a loser to disregard such a monstrous assertion as that i am selfish  you show your selfishness by dwelling on what you have lost you never think of what i have lost i make no profession of unselfishness i am suffering for my folly and egoism and i deserve to suffer  in what way pray are you suffering you came here because you had a wretched home and a husband who was glad to be rid of you you do what you like and have what you like name one solitary wish of yours that has not been silently gratified  i do not find fault with you you have been generous in supplying me with luxuries such as money can obtain but it was not the want of money that made me fancy my home wretched it is not true that i can do as i like how many minutes is it since you threatened to cast me off if i did not make myself agreeable to you can you boast of your generosity after taunting me with my dependence on you  you misunderstood me marian i neither boasted nor threatened nor taunted i have even apologized for that moments irritation if you cannot forgive such a trifle you yourself can have very little generosity  perhaps not i do not violently resent things but i cannot forget them nor feel as i did before they happened  you think so at present let us cease this bickering lovers quarrels should not be carried too far  i am longing to cease it it worries me and it does not alter my determination in the least  do you mean  i do mean dont look at me like that you make me angry instead of frightening me  and do you think i will suffer this quietly  you may suffer it as you please said marian stepping quietly to the wall and pressing a button i will never see you again if i can help it if you follow me or persecute me in any way i will appeal to the police for protection as mrs conolly i despise you more than i do any one on earth  he turned away and snatched up his coat and hat she stood apparently watching him quietly but really listening with quickened heart to his loud and irregular breathing as he opened the door to go out he was confronted on the threshold by a foreign waiter  vas you reeng said the waiter doubtfully retreating a step  i will not be accountable for that womans expenses from this time forth said douglas pointing at her you can keep her at your own risk or turn her into the streets to pursue her profession as you please  the waiter smiting vaguely looked first at the retreating figure of douglas and then at marian  i want another room if you please she said one on any of the upper floors will do but i must have my things moved there at once  her instructions were carried out after some parley in the meantime douglass man servant appeared and said that he had been instructed to remove his masters luggage  is mr forster leaving the hotel she asked  i dont know his arrangements madam  i guess i do then said a sulky man who was preparing to wheel away marians trunk hes about to shift his billet to the gran central  marian still in a towering rage sat down in her new room to consider her situation to fix her attention which repeatedly wandered to what had passed between her and douglas she counted her money and found that she had besides a twenty pound note which she had brought with her from london only a few loose dollars in her purse her practice in housekeeping at westbourne terrace and holland park had taught her the value of money too well to let her suppose that she could afford to remain at a first rate american hotel with so small a sum in her possession at home conolly had made her keep a separate banking account and there was money to her credit there but in her ignorance of the law she was not sure that she had not forfeited all her property by eloping she resolved to move at once into some cheap lodging and to live economically until she could ascertain the true state of her affairs or until she could obtain some employment to support her she faced poverty without fear never having experienced it  it was still early in the afternoon when she left the hotel and drove to the crawfords  so you have come at last cried mrs crawford who was fifty years of age and stout but leaner in the face than fat englishwomen of that age usually are  i just expected youd soon git tired of being grand all by yourself in the hotel yonder  i fear i shall have to be the reverse of grand all by myself in some very shabby lodging said marian dont be surprised mrs crawford can one live in new york on ten dollars a week  you cant live on ten dollars a week in new york nor on a hundred you rode here didnt you  yes of course  of course if you have only ten dollars a week you should have walked i know the sort you are mrs forster you wont be long getting rid of your money no matter where you live but whats wrong hows your husband  i dont know i hope he is quite well said marian her voice trembling a little mrs crawford you are the only friend i have in america and you have been so very kind to me that since i must trouble some one i have ventured to come to you the truth is that i have left my husband and i have only about one hundred dollars in the world i must live on that until i get some employment or perhaps some money of my own from england  chut child nawnsnse exclaimed mrs crawford with benevolent intolerance you go right back to your husband i spose youve had a rumpus with him but you mustnt mind that all men are a bit selfish and i should say from what i have seen of him that he is no exception to the rule but you cant have perfection hes a fine handsome fellow and he knows it and as for you i dont know what they reckon you in england but youre the bestlooking woman in noo york thats surtn its a pity for such a pair to fall out  he is not selfish said marian you never saw him i am afraid i must shock you mrs crawford mr forster is not my husband  no do did you ever tell the general that  general crawford oh no  think of that man being cuter than me a woman he always said so and the grit you must have to tell it out as cool as that well im sorry to hear it though mrs forster its a bad accounta very bad one but if i take what you said just now rightly youre married  i am i have deserted a very good husband  its a pity you didnt find that out a little sooner isnt it  i know mrs crawford i thought i was acting for the best  thought you were acting for the best in running away from a good husband well you british aristocrats are singular you throw stones at us because our women are so free and our divorces so easy yet youre always scandlizing us and now you tell me youve done it on morl grounds who educated you child and what do you intend to do now  for the present only to get a lodging will you tell me where i should look for one i dont know the east from the west end of this town and i am so inexperienced that i might make a mistake easily as to the character of the places will you direct me to some street or quarter in which i should he likely to find suitable rooms i can live very economically  i dont know what to do said mrs crawford perplexedly turning her rings on her fingers you ought to be ashamed of yourself and you so pretty  perhaps you would rather not assist me you may tell me so candidly i shall not be offended  you mustnt take me up like that i must have a talk with the general about you i dont feel like letting you go into some ordinary place by yourself but i cant ask you to stay here without consulting  oh no you must not think of any such thing i must begin to face the world alone at once i assure you mrs crawford i could not come here i should only keep your friends away  but nobody knows you  sooner or later i should meet someone who does there are hundreds of people who know me by sight who travel every year besides my case is a very public one unfortunately may i take you into my confidence  if you wish my dear i dont ask you for it but i will take it kindly  i know you will you must have heard all about me mr forsters real name is douglas  mrs crawford stifled a whoop of surprise and you are you  i am  only think and that was douglas why i thought he was a straighthaired sleeky canting snake of a man and you too are not a bit like what i thought you are quite a person mrsmrs conolly  i have no right to bear that name any longer pray call me by my assumed name still and keep my secret i hope you do not believe all the newspapers said  no of course not said mrs crawford but whose fault was it  mine altogether mine i wish you would tell people that mr conolly is blameless in the matter  he will take care of his own credit never fear i am sure you got some provocation i know what men are the general is not my first husband  no i got no provocation mr conolly is not like other men i got discontented because i had nothing to desire and now about the lodgings mrs crawford do not think i am changing the subject from reticence it is the question of money that makes me anxious all my resources would be swallowed up at the hotel in less than a week  lodgings you mean rooms i guess people here mostly go to boardinghouses and as to the cheapness you dont know what cheapness is cant you make some arrangement with your great relations in england have you no property of your own  i cannot tell whether my property remains my own or not you must regard me as a poor woman i am quite determined to have the lodgings and i should like to arrange about them at once for i am rather upset by something that happened this morning  well if you must you must i know a place that might suit you i lived in it myself when i was not so well off as i am at present it is a little downtown but you will have to put up with that for the sake of economy  mrs crawford who had read in the papers of her guests relationship to the earl of carbury then sent for her carriage and dressed herself handsomely when they had gone some distance they entered a wide street crossed half way along by an avenue and an elevated railway  what do you think of this neighborhood said mrs crawford  it is a fine wide street replied marian but it looks as if it needed to be swept and painted  the other end is quieter im afraid you wont like living here  marian had hitherto thought of such streets as thoroughfares not as places in which she could dwell beggars cannot be choosers she said with affected cheerfulness looking anxiously ahead for the promised quiet part  boardinghouses are so much the rule here that it is not easy to get rooms you will find mrs myers a good soul and though the house is not much to look at it is comfortable enough inside  the appearance of the street improved as they went on and the house they stopped at though the windows were dingy and the paint old was better than marian had hoped for a minute before she remained in the carriage whilst her companion conferred with the landlady within twenty minutes passed before mrs crawford reappeared looking much perplexed  mrs myers has a couple of rooms that would do you very well only you would be on the same floor with a woman who is always drunk she has pawned a heap of clothes and promises to leave every day but mrs myers hasnt got rid of her yet its very provoking shes quiet and doesnt trouble any one but still of course  she cannot interfere with me said marian if that is the only objection let it pass i need have nothing to say to her if she is not violent nor noisy her habits are her own affair  oh she wont trouble you you can keep to yourself english fashion  then let us agree at once i cannot face any more searching and bargaining  youre looking pale are you sure you are not ill  no it is nothing i am rather tired  they went in together and marian was introduced to mrs myers a nervous widow of fifty the rooms were small and the furniture and carpets old and worn but all was clean and there was an open fireplace in the sittingroom  they will do very nicely thank you said marian i will send for my luggage and i think i will just telegraph my new address and a few words to a friend in london  if you feel played out i can see after your luggage said mrs crawford but i advise you to come back with me have a good lunch at delmonicos and send your cablegram yourself  marian roused herself from a lassitude which was coming upon her and took mrs crawfords advice when they returned to the richer quarter of the town and especially after luncheon her spirits revived at the hotel she observed that the clerk was surprised when arranging for the removal of her luggage and the forwarding of her letters she mentioned her new address douglas she found had paid all expenses before leaving she did not linger in the building for the hotel staff stared at her curiously she finished her business by telegraphing to elinor separated write to new address have i forfeited my money this cost her nearly five dollars  only that you must find out about your money i wouldnt have let you spend all that said mrs crawford  i did not think it would have cost so much said marian i was horrified when he named the price however it cannot be helped  we may as well be getting back to mrs myerss now its late  yes i suppose so said marian sighing i am sorry i did not ask nelly to telegraph me i am afraid my funds will not last so long as i thought  well we shall see the general was greatly taken with you for the way you looked after me when i was ill yonder so you have two friends in noo york city at any rate  you have proved that to me today i am afraid i shall have to trouble you further if i get bad news you will have to help me to find some work  yes never mind that until the bad news comes i hope you wont mope at mrs myerss how does the american air agree with you  pretty well i was sick for the first two days of our passage across and somehow my digestion seems to have got out of order in consequence of late i have been a little unwell in the mornings  oh thats so is it humph i see i shall have to come and look after you occasionally  why  never you mind my dear but dont go moping nor going without food to save money take care of yourself  it is nothing serious said marian with a smile only a passing indisposition you need not be uneasy about me this is the house is it not i shall lose myself whenever i go out for a walk here  this is it now goodbye ill see you soon meanwhile you take care of yourself as youre told  it was dark when marian entered her new residence mrs myers was standing at the open door remonstrating with a milkman marian hastily assured her that she knew the way and went upstairs alone she was chilled and weary her spirits had fallen again during her journey from the telegraph office as she approached her room hoping to find a good fire she heard a flapping noise which was suddenly interrupted by the rattle of a falling poker followed by the exclamation in a womans voice och musha i wouldnt doubt you marian entering saw a robust young woman kneeling before the grate trying to improve a dull fire that burnt there she had taken up the poker and placed it standing against the bars so that it pointed up the chimney and she was now using her apron fanwise as a bellows the fire glowed in the draught and marian by its light noted with displeasure that the young womans calico dress was soiled and her hair untidy  i think  god bless us ejaculated the servant starting and turning a comely dirty face toward marian  did i frighten you said marian herself startled by the exclamation  you put the life acrass in me said the servant panting and pressing her hand on her bosom  i am sorry for that i was going to say that i think you need not take any further trouble with the fire it will light of itself now  very well miss  what is your name  liza redmon miss  i should like some light eliza if you please  yis miss would you wish to take your tay now miss  yes thank you  eliza went away with alacrity marian put off her bonnet and furs and sat down before the fire to despond over the prospect of living in that shabby room waited on by that slipshod irish girl who roused in her something very like racial antipathy presently eliza returned carrying a small tray upon which she had crowded a lighted kerosene lamp a china tea service a rolledup table cloth a supply of bread and butter and a copper kettle when she had placed the lamp on the mantelpiece and the kettle by the fire she put the tray on the sofa and proceeded to lay the cloth which she shook from its folds and spread like a sail in the air by seizing two of the corners in her hands and pulling them apart whilst she held the middle fold in her teeth then she adroitly wafted it over the table making a breeze in which the lamp flared and marian blinked her movements were very rapid and in a few moments she had arranged the tea service and was ready to withdraw  my luggage will be sent here this evening or tomorrow eliza will you tell me when it comes  yis miss  you know that my name is mrs forster do you not  mrs forster yis miss  marian made no further attempt to get miss changed to maam and eliza left the room as she crossed the landing she was called by someone on the same floor marian started at the sound it was a womans voice disagreeably husky a voice she felt sure she had heard before and yet one that was not familiar to her  eliza eliza marian shuddered  yis yis said eliza impatiently opening a door  come here alanna said the voice with mock fondness the door was then closed and marian could hear the murmur of the conversation which followed it was still proceeding when mrs myers came in  i didnt ought to have left you to find your way up here alone mrs forster she said but i do have such worry sometimes that im bound to leave either one thing or another undone  it does not matter at all mrs myers your servant has been very attentive to me  the hired girl shes smart she isdoes everything right slick away the only trouble is to keep her out of that room shes in there now unless i am always after her she is slipping out on errands pawning and buying drink for that unfortunate young creature  for whom  a person that mrs crawford promised to tell you about  so she did said marian but i did not know she was young  shes older than you a deal i knew her when she was a little girl and i often forget how old she is she was the prettiest child even now she would talk you into anything but i cant help her its nothing but drink drink drink from morning til night theres eliza coming out of her room eliza  yis maam said eliza looking in  you stay in the house eliza do you hear i wont have you go out  could i spake a word to you maam said eliza lowering her voice  no eliza im engaged with mrs forster  she wants to see you whispered eliza  go downrs eliza this minute i wont see her  mrs myers cried the voice marian again shrank from the sound mrs myers aunt sally come to your poor soozy mrs myers looked perplexedly at marian the voice resumed after a pause with an affected yankee accent i guess ill raise a shine if you dont come  i must go said mrs myers i promise you mrs forster she shall not annoy you she shall go this week it aint right that you should be disturbed by her  mrs myers went into the other room eliza ran downrs and marian heard her open the house door softly and go out she also heard indistinctly the voices of the landlady and her lodger after a time these ceased and she drank her tea in peace she was glad that mrs myers did not return although she made no more comfortable use of her solitude than to think of her lost home in holland park comparing it with her dingy apartment and pressing her handkerchief upon her eyes when they became too full of tears she had passed more than an hour thus when eliza roused her by announcing the arrival of the luggage thereupon she bestirred herself to superintend its removal to her bedroom where she unpacked a trunk which contained her writingcase and some books with these were stowed her dresses much miscellaneous finery and some handsomely worked underclothing eliza standing by could not contain her admiration and marian though she did not permit her to handle the clothes had not the heart to send her away until she had seen all that the trunk contained marian heard her voice afterward in the apartment of the drunken lodger and suspected from its emphasis that the girl was describing the rare things she had seen  marian imparted some interest to her surroundings that evening by describing them in a letter to elinor when she had finished she was weary and the fire was nearly out she looked at her watch and finding to her surprise that is was two hours after midnight rose to go to bed before leaving the room she stood for a minute before the oldfashioned pierglass with one foot on the fender and looked at her image pitying her own weariness and enjoying the soft beauty of her face and the gentleness of her expression her appearance did not always please her but on this occasion the mirror added so much to the solace she had found in writing to elinor that she felt almost happy as she took the lamp to light her to her bedroom  she had gone no farther than the landing when a sound of unsteady footsteps on the stairs caused her to stop as she lifted the lamp and looked up she saw a strange woman descending toward her holding the balustrade and moving as though with pains in her limbs this woman whose black hair fell nearly to her waist was dressed in a crimson satin dressinggown warmly padded and much stained and splashed she had fine dark eyes and was young boldlooking and handsome but when she came nearer the moist pallor of her skin the slackness of her lower lip and jaw and an eager and worn expression in her fine eyes gave her a thirsty reckless leer that filled marian with loathing her aspect conveyed the same painful suggestion as her voice had done before but more definitely for it struck marian with a shock that conolly in the grotesque metamorphosis of a nightmare might appear in some such likeness the lamp did not seem to attract her attention at first but when she came within a few steps she saw some one before her and dazzled by the light peered at marian who lost her presence of mind and stood motionless gradually the womans expression changed to one of astonishment she came down to the landing stopped grasping the handrail to steady herself and said in her husky voice  oh lord its not a woman at all its d ts then not quite convinced by this explanation she suddenly stretched out her hand and attempted to grasp marians arm missing her aim she touched her on the breast and immediately cried mrs ned  marian shrank from her touch and recovered her courage  do you know me she said  i should rather think i do i have gone off a good deal in my appearance or you would know me youve seen me on the stage i suppose im your sisterinlaw perhaps you didnt know you had one  are you miss susanna conolly  thats who i am at least i am what is left of miss susanna you dont look overjoyed to make my acquaintance but i was as goodlooking as you once take my advice mrs ned dont drink champagne the end of champagne is brandy and the end of brandy is susanna made a grimace and indicated herself  i am afraid we shall disturb the house if we talk here we had better say goodnight  no no dont be in such a hurry to get rid of me come into my room with me for a while ill talk quietly im not drunk ive just slept it off and i was coming down for some more you may as well keep me from it for a few minutes i suppose ned hasnt forbidden you to speak to me  oh no said marian yielding to a feeling of pity come into my room there is a scrap of fire there still  we used to lodge in this room long ago in my fathers time said susanna following marian into the room and reclining with a groan on the sofa im rather in a fog you know i cant make out how the deuce you come to be here did ned send you to look after me is he in new york is he here  no said marian foreseeing with a bitter pang and a terrible blush what must follow he is in england i am alone here  well why what i dont understand  have you not read the papers said marian in a low voice turning her head away  papers no not since i saw an account of my brilliant debût here of which i suppose you have heard i never read i do nothing but drink what has happened  marian hesitated  is it any secret said susanna  no it is no secret said marian turning and looking at her steadily all the world knows it i have left your brother and i do not know whether i am still his wife or whether i am already divorced  you dont mean to say youre on the loose cried susanna  marian was silent  i always told ned that no woman could stand him said susanna with sodden vivacity after a pause during which marian had to endure her astonished stare he always thought you the very pink of propriety of course there was another man in it whats become of him if i may ask  i have left him said marian sternly you need impute no fault to your brother in the matter miss conolly he is quite blameless  yes said susanna not in the least impressed he always is blameless how is bob i mean marmaduke your cousin i call him bob short for cherry bob  he is very well thank you  now bob was not a blameless man but altogether the reverse and he was a capital fellow to get on with ned was always right always sure of himself and there was an end he has no variety i wonder will bob ever get married  he is going to be married in the spring  who to  to lady constance car  damn that woman exclaimed susanna i hate her she was always throwing herself at his head curse her damn her i wish  miss conolly said marian i hope you will not think me rude but i am very tired and it is very late i must go to bed  well will you come and see me tomorrow it will be an act of charity i am dying here all alone you are a nice woman and i know what you must feel about me but you will get used to me i wont annoy you i wont swear i wont say anything about your cousin ill keep sober do come you are a good sort bob always said so and you might save me from destroying myself say youll come  if you particularly wish it i will said marian not disguising her reluctance  youd rather not of course said susanna despondently  i am afraid i cannot be of any use to you  for that matter no one is likely to be of much use to me but its hard to be imprisoned in this den without anyone to speak to but eliza however do as you please i did as i pleased and i must take the consequences just tell me one thing did you find me out by accident  quite  that was odd susanna groaned again as she rose from the sofa well since you wont have anything to do with me goodbye youre quite right  i will come and see you i do not wish to avoid you if you are in trouble  do said susanna eagerly touching marians hand with her moist palm well get on better than you think i like you and ill make you like me if i could only keep from it for two days i shouldnt be a bit disgusting goodnight  goodnight said marian overcoming her repugnance to susannas hand and clasping it remember that my name here is mrs forster  all right goodnight thank you you will never be sorry for having compassion on me  wont you take a light  i dont require one i can find what i want in the dark  she went into her apartment marian went quickly up to her own bedroom and locked herself in her first loathing for susanna had partly given way to pity but the humiliation of confessing herself to such a woman as an unfaithful wife was galling when she went to sleep she dreamed that she was unmarried and at home with her father and that the household was troubled by susanna who lodged in a room upstairs     chapter xx   sholto douglas returned to england in the ship which carried marians letter to elinor on reaching london he stayed a night in the hotel at euston and sent his man next day to take rooms for him at the west end early in the afternoon the man reported that he had secured apartments in charles street st jamess it was a fine wintry day and douglas resolved to walk not without a sense of being about to run the gauntlet  it proved the most adventurous walk he had ever taken in his life everybody he knew seemed to be lying in wait for him in portland place he met miss mcquinch who with the letter fresh in her pocket looked at him indignantly and cut him at the laugham hotel he passed a member of his club who seemed surprised but nodded coolly in regent street he saw lady carburys carriage waiting before a shop he hurried past the door for he had lost courage at his encounter with elinor there were however two doors and as he passed the second the countess lady constance and marmaduke came out just before him  where the devil is the carriage said marmaduke loudly  hush everybody can hear you said lady constance  what do i care whetherhallo douglas how are you  marmaduke proffered his hand lady carbury plucked her daughter by the sleeve and hurried to her carriage after returning douglass stern look with the slightest possible bow constance imitated her mother douglas haughtily raised his hat  how obstinate marmaduke is said the countess when she had bidden the coachman drive away at once he is going to walk down regent street with that man  but you didnt cut him mamma  i never dreamed of his coming back so soon and of course i cannot tell whether he will be cut or not we must wait and see what other people will do if we meet him again we had better not see him  look here old fellow said marmaduke as he walked away with douglas youve come back too soon it wont do take my advice and go away again until matters have blown over hang it its too flagrant you have not been away two months  i believe you are going to be married said douglas allow me to congratulate you  thank you fine day isnt it  very fine  marmaduke walked on in silence douglas presently recommenced the conversation  i only arrived in london last night i have come from new york  indeed pleasant voyage  very pleasant  another pause  has anything special happened during my absence  nothing special  was there much fuss made about my going  well there was a great deal of fuss made about it excuse my alluding to the subject again i shouldnt have done so if you hadnt asked me  oh my dear fellow you neednt stand on ceremony with me  thats all very well douglas but when i alluded to it just now you as good as told me to mind my own business  i told you so  not in those words perhaps however the matter is easily settled you bolted with marian i know that and you know it if the topic is disagreeable say so and it is easily avoided if you want to talk about it better not change the subject when i mention it  you have taken offence needlessly i changed the subject inadvertently  hm well has she come back with you  no  do you mean that youve thrown her over  i have said nothing of the kind as a matter of fact she has thrown me over  thats very strange you are not going to marry her then i suppose  how can i i tell you she has deserted me let me remind you lind that i should not be bound to marry her in any case and i shall certainly not do so now if i chose to justify myself i could easily do so by her own conduct  i expect you will not be troubled for any justification people seem to have made up their minds that you were wrong in the first instance and you ought to keep out of the way until they have forgottenoh confound it heres conolly now for gods sake dont let us have any row  douglas whitened and took a step back into the roadway before he recovered himself for conolly had come upon them suddenly as they turned into charles street a group of gentlemen stood on the steps of the clubhouse which stands at that corner  bless me said conolly with perfect good humor douglas back again why on earth did you run away with my wife and what have you done with her  the party on the steps ceased chatting and began to stare  this is not the place to call me to account sir said douglas still on his guard and very ill at ease if you have anything to say to me which cannot be communicated through a friend it had better be said in private  i shall trouble you for a short conversation said conolly how do you do lind where can we go i do not belong to any club  my apartments are at hand said douglas  i suppose i had better leave you said marmaduke  your presence will not embarrass me in the least said conolly  i have not sought this interview said douglas i therefore prefer mr lind to witness what passes  conolly nodded assent and they went to a house on the doorstep of which douglass man was waiting and ascended to the front drawingroom  now sir said douglas without inviting his guests to sit down conolly alone took off his hat marmaduke went aside and looked out of the window  i know the circumstances that have led to your return said conolly so we need not go into that i want you however to assist me on one point do you know what marians pecuniary position is at present  i decline to admit that it concerns me in any way  of course not but it concerns me as i do not wish that she should be without money in a foreign city she has telegraphed a question about her property to miss mcquinch that by itself is nothing but her new address which i first saw on a letter this morning happens to be known to me as that of a rather shabby lodginghouse  i know nothing of it  i do it means that she is poor i can guess at the sum she carried with her to america now if you will be good enough to tell me whether you have ever given her money if so how much and what her expenditure has been you will enable me to estimate her position at present  i do not know that you have any right to ask such questions  i do not assert any right to ask them on the contrary i have explained their object i shall not press them if you think that an answer will in any way compromise you  i have no fear of being compromised none whatever  conolly nodded and waited for an answer  i may say that my late trip has cost me a considerable sum i paid all the expenses and missmrs conolly did not to my knowledge disburse a single fraction she did not ask me to give her money had she done so i should have complied at once  thank you thats all right she will be able to hold out until she hears from us goodafternoon  allow me to add sir before you go said douglas asserting himself desperately against conollys absolutely sincere disregard of him and preoccupation with marian that mrs conolly has been placed in her present position entirely through her own conduct i repudiate the insinuation that i have deserted her in a foreign city and i challenge inquiry on the point  quite so quite so assented conolly carelessly goodbye lind and he took his hat and went out  by george said marmaduke admiringly he did that damned welldamned well look here old man take my advice and clear out for another year or so you cant stay here as a lookeron i see most of the game and thats my advice to you as a friend  douglas whose face had reddened and reddened with successive rushes of blood until it was now purple lost all selfcontrol at marmadukes commiserating tone i will see whether i cannot put him in the wrong he burst out in the debased voice of an ignobly angry man do you think i will let him tell the world that i have been thrown over and fooled  thats your own story isnt it at least i understood you to say so as we came along  let him say so and ill thrash him like a dog in the street ill  whats the use of thrashing a man who will simply hand you over to the police and quite right too what rot  we shall see we shall see  very well do as you like you may twist one anothers heads off for what i care he has had the satisfaction of putting you into a rage at all events  i am not in a rage  very well have it your own way  will you take a challenge to him from me  no i am not a born fool  that is plain speaking  marmaduke put his hands into his pockets and whistled i think i will take myself off he said presently  as you please replied douglas coldly  i will look in on you some day next week when you have cooled down a bit goodbye  douglas said nothing and marmaduke with a nod went out some minutes later the servant entered and said that mr lind was below  what back again said douglas with an oath  no sir its old mr lindmr reginald  did you say i was in  the man belonging to the house did sir  confound his officiousness i suppose he must come up  reginald lind entered and bowed douglas placed a chair for him and waited mute and a little put out mr linds eyes and voice shewed that he also was not at his ease but his manner was courtly and his expression grave as douglas had in his boyhood been accustomed to see them  i am sorry sholto said mr lind that i cannot for the present meet you with the cordiality which formerly existed between us however unbearable your disappointment at marians marriage may have been you should not have taken a reprehensible and desperate means of remedying it i speak to you now as an old friendas one who knew you when the disparity in our ages was more marked than it is at present  douglas bowed  i have just heard from mr conollywhom i met accidentally in pall mallthat you have returned from america he gave me no further account of you except that he had met you and spoken to you here i hope nothing unpleasant passed  the meeting was not a pleasant one i shall take steps to make mr conolly understand that  nothing approaching to violence i trust  no mr conollys discretion averted it i am not sure that a second interview between us will end so quietly  the interview should not have taken place at all sholto i need not point out to you that prudence and good taste forbid any repetition of it  i did not seek it mr lind he forced it upon me i promise you that if a second meeting takes place it will be forced upon him by me and will take place in another country  that is a young mans idea sholto the day for such crimes thank heaven is past and gone let us say no more of it i was speaking to your mother on sunday have you seen her yet  no  sholto you hit us all very hard that monday before christmas i know what i felt about my daughter but i can only imagine what your mother must have felt about her son  i am not insensible to that i has been rather my misfortune than my fault that i have caused you to suffer if it will gratify you to know that i have suffered deeply myself and am now indeed a broken man i can assure you that such is the case  it is fortunate for us all that matters are not absolutely irremediable i will so far take you into my confidence as to tell you that i have never felt any satisfaction in marians union with mr conolly though he is unquestionably a remarkable man yet there was a certain degree of incongruity in the matchyou will understand mewhich placed marian apart from her family whilst she was with him i have never entered my daughters house without a feeling that i was more or less a stranger there had she married you in the first instance the case would have been different i wish she had however that is past regretting now what i wish to say is that i can still welcome you as marians husband even though she will have a serious error to live down and i shall be no less liberal to her than if her previous marriage had never taken place  douglas cleared his throat but did not speak  well said mr lind after a pause reddening  this is a very painful matter said douglas at last as a man of the world mr lind you must be aware that i am not bound to your daughter in any way  i am not speaking to you as a man of the world i am speaking as a father and as a gentleman  doubtless your position as a father is an unfortunate one i can sympathize with your feelings but as a gentleman  think of what you are going to say sholto if you speak as a gentleman you can have only one answer if you have any other you will speak as a scoundrel the last sentence came irrepressibly to mr linds lips but the moment he had uttered it he felt that he had been too precipitate  sir  i repeat as a scoundrelif you deny your duty in the matter  i decline to continue this conversation with you mr lind you know as well as i do that no gentleman is expected or even permitted by society to take as his wife a woman who has lived with him as his mistress  no man who betrays a lady and refuses to make her all the reparation in his power can claim to be a gentleman  you are dreaming mr lind your daughter was the guardian of her own honor i made her no promises it is absurd to speak of a woman of her age and experience being betrayed as though she were a child  i always understood that you prided yourself on acting up to a higher standard of honorable dealing than other men if this is your boasted  mr lind said douglas interrupting him with determination no more of this if you please briefly i will have nothing whatever to say to mrs conolly in the future if her reputation were as unstained as your own i would still refuse to know her i have suffered from her the utmost refinements of caprice and treachery and the coarsest tirades of abuse she left me of her own accord in spite of my entreaties to her to stayentreaties which i made her in response to an exhibition of temper which would have justified me in parting from her there and then it is true that i have moulded my life according to a higher standard of honor than ordinary men and it is also true that that standard is never higher never more fastidiously acted up to than where a woman is concerned i have only to add that i am perfectly satisfied as to the propriety of my behavior in marians case and that i absolutely refuse to hear another accusation of unworthiness from you much as i respect you and your sorrow  mr lind though he saw that he must change his tone found it hard to subdue his temper for though not a strong man he was unaccustomed to be thwarted sholto he said you are not serious you are irritated by some lovers quarrel  i am justly estranged from your daughter and i am resolved never to give her a place in my thoughts again i have madly wasted my youth on her let her be content with that and the other things i have sacrificed for her sake  but this is dreadful think of the life she must lead if you do not marry her she will be an outcast she will not even have a name  she would not be advised she made her choice in defiance of an explicit warning of the inevitable results and she must abide by it i challenge the most searching inquiry into my conduct mr lind it will be found if the truth be told that i spared her no luxury before she left me and that far from being the aggressor it is i who have the right to complain of insult and desertion  still even granting that her unhappy position may have rendered her a little sore and impatient at times do you not owe her some forbearance since she gave up her home and her friends for you  sacrifice for sacrifice mine was the greater of the two like her i have lost my friends and my position hereto some extent at least worse i have let my youth slip by in fruitless pursuit of her for the home which she hated i offered her one ten times more splendid i gave her the devotion of a gentleman to replace the indifference of a blacksmith what have i not done for her i freed her from her bondage i carried her across the globe i watched her housed her fed her clothed her as a princess i loved her with a love that taught her a meaning of the word she had never known before and when i had served her turnwhen i had rescued her from her husband and placed her beyond his reachwhen she became surfeited with a wealth of chivalrous love which she could not comprehend and when a new world opened before her a fresh field for intrigue i was assailed with slanderous lies and forsaken do you think mr lind that in addition to this i will endure the reproaches of any maneven were he my own father  but she suffers more being a woman the world will be comparatively lenient toward you if you and she were married and settled with no consciousness of being in a false position and no wearing fear of detection you would get on together quite differently  it may be so but i shall never put it to the test  listen a moment sholto just consider the matter calmly and rationally i am a rich manat least i can endow marian better than you perhaps think i see that you feel aggrieved and that you fear being forced into a marriage which you have as you sayi fully admit it most fullya perfect right to decline but i am urging you to make marian your legal wife solely because it is the best course for both of you that i assure you is the feeling of society in the matter everybody speaks to me of your becoming my soninlaw the earl says no other course is possible i will give you ten thousand pounds down on her weddingday you will lose nothing conolly will not claim damages he has contradicted the report that he would i will pay the costs of the divorce as well mind i do not mean that i will settle the money on her i will give it to her unconditionally in other words it will become your property the moment you become her husband  i understand said douglas contemptuously however as it is merely a question of making your daughter an honest woman in consideration of so much cash i have no doubt you will find plenty of poorer men who will be glad to close with you for half the money you are much in the city now i believe allow me to suggest that you will find a dealer there more easily than in st jamess  mr lind reddened again i do not think you see the matter in the proper light he said you are asked to repair the disgrace you have brought on a lady and upon her family i offer you a guarantee that you will not lose pecuniarily by doing so whatever other loss you may incur you are bound to bear it as the penalty of your own act i appeal to you sir as one gentleman appeals to another to remove the dishonor you have brought upon my name  to transfer it to my own you mean thank you mr lind the public is more accustomed to associate conjugal levity with the name of lind than with that of douglas  if you refuse me the justice you owe to my daughter you need not couple that refusal with an insult  i have already explained that i owe your daughter nothing you come here and offer me ten thousand pounds to marry her i decline the bargain you then take your stand upon the injury to your name i merely remind you that your name was somewhat tarnished even before mrs conolly changed it for the less distinguished one which she has really dishonored  douglas said mr lind trembling i will make you repent this i will have satisfaction  as you remarked when i declared my readiness to give satisfaction in the proper quarter the practice you allude to is obsolete fortunately so i think in our case  you are a coward sir douglas rang the bell i will expose you in every club in london  shew this gentleman out said douglas to his servant  you have received that order because i told your master that he is a rascal said mr lind to the man i shall say the same thing to every man i meet between this house and the committeeroom of his club  the servant looked grave as mr lind left the room soon after douglas whose selfrespect annihilated by conolly had at first been thoroughly restored by mr lind felt upset again by the conclusion of the interview finding solitude and idleness intolerable he went into the streets though he no longer felt any desire to meet his acquaintances and twice crossed the haymarket to avoid them as he strolled about thinking of all that had been said to him that afternoon he grew morose twice he calculated his expenditure on the american trip and the difference that an increment of ten thousand pounds would make in his property suddenly in turning out of air street into piccadilly he found himself face to face with lord carbury  how do you do said the latter pleasantly but without the unceremonious fellowship that had formerly existed between them  thank you said douglas i am quite well  a pause followed jasper not knowing exactly what to say next  i am considering where i shall dine said douglas have you dined yet  no i promised to dine at home this evening my mother likes to have a family dinner occasionally  douglas knew that before the elopement he would have been asked to join the party i suppose people have been pleased to talk a good deal about me of late he said  yes i fear so however i hope it will pass over  it shews no sign of passing over as yet then  well it has become a little stale as a topic but there is undeniably a good deal of feeling about it still if you will excuse my saying so i think that perhaps you would do well to keep out of the way a little longer  presuming of course that popular feeling is a matter about which i am likely to concern myself  that is a question for you to decide excuse the hint  the question is whether it is not better to be on the spot so as to strangle calumny at its source than to hide myself abroad whilst a host of malicious tongues are busy with me  as to that douglas i assure you you have been very fairly treated the chief blame as usual has fallen on the weaker sex nothing could exceed the moderation of those from whom the loudest complaints might have been expected reginald lind has hardly ever mentioned the subject even to me he only shook his head and said that it was an old attachment as to conolly we have actually reproached him for making excuses for you  aye a very astute method of bringing me into contempt allow me to enlighten you a little jasper lind whose daughter i have discovered to be one of the worst of women has just offered me ten thousand pounds to marry her that speaks for itself conolly who drove her into my arms by playing the tyrant whilst i played the lover is only too glad to get rid of her at the same time he is afraid to fight me and ashamed to say so therefore he impudently pretends to pity me for being his gull in the matter but i will stop that  conolly is a particular friend of mine douglas let us drop the subject if you dont mind  if he is your friend of course i have nothing more to say i think i will turn in here and dine goodevening  they parted without any salutation and douglas entered the restaurant and dined alone he came out an hour later in improved spirits and began to consider whether he would go to the theatre or venture into his club he was close to a lamp at a corner of leicester square when he stopped to debate the point with himself and in his preoccupation he did not notice a fourwheeled cab going slowly past him carrying a lady in an old white opera cloak this was mrs leith fairfax who recognizing him called to the cabman to drive a little past the lamp and stop  good heavens she said in a halfwhisper you here what madness possessed you to come back  i had no further occasion to stay away  how coolly you say so you have iron nerves all you douglases i have heard all and i know what you have suffered how soon will you leave london  i have no intention of leaving it at present  but you cannot stay here  pray why not is not london large enough for any man who does not live by the breath of the world  out of the question mr douglas absolutely out of the question you must go away for a year at the very least you must yield something to propriety  i shall yield nothing i can do without any section of society that may feel called upon to do without me  oh you must subdue that imperious nature of yours for your mothers sake if not for your own besides you have been very wicked and reckless and daring just like a douglas you ought to do penance with a good grace i may conclude since you are here that elinor mcquinchs story is true as far as the facts go  i have not heard her story  it is only that you have parted fromyou know  that is true can i gratify your curiosity in any other particular  strive not to let yourself be soured mr douglas i shudder when i think of what you have undergone at the hands of one woman there i will not allude to it again  you will do wisely mrs leith fairfax what i have suffered i have suffered i desire no pity and will endure none  that is so like yourself i must hurry on to covent garden or i shall be late will you come and see me quietly some day before you go i am never at home to any one on tuesdays but if you come at about five caroline will let you in it will be dark nobody will see you we can have a chat then  thank you said douglas coldly stepping back and raising his hat i shall not intrude on you goodevening  she waved her hand at him and the cab departed he walked quickly back to charles street and called his servant  i suppose no one has called  yes sir mrs douglas came very shortly after you went out she wishes you to go to the square this evening sir  this evening i am afraidbuckstone  yes sir  is she looking well  a little tired sir but quite well i have no doubt  how much of the luggage have you unpacked  only your portmanteau sir i thought  so much the better pack it again i am going to brussels tonight find out about the trains i shall want you to take a hansom and take a note to chester square but come back at once without waiting to be spoken to  very good sir  douglas then sat down and wrote the note    my dear mother    i am sorry i was out when you called i did not expect you as i   am only passing through london on my way to brussels i am anxious   to get clear of this vile city and so shall start tonight   buckstone tells me you are looking well and this assurance must   content me for the present as i find it impossible to go to you   you were quite right in warning me against what has happened but   it is all past and broken off now and i am still as ever                                       your affectionate son                                                sholto douglas     chapter xxi   one day eliza out of patience came to mrs myers and said  a thin maam will you come up and spake to miss conolly shes rasin ructions above stairs  oh dear oh dear said mrs myers cant you keep her quiet  arra how can i kape her quiet an she cryin an roarin dyin an desarted  ask mrs forster to go in and coax her to stop  mrs forsthers at dhuddher ind o the town whisht there she is

she wont mind mebad manners to her  mrs myers hesitated the lodger became noisier  i spose ive got to go said mrs myers plaintively she went upstairs and found susanna lying on the sofa groaning with a dressinggown and a pair of thick boots on  what is the matter with you miss susan youre goin on fit to raise the street  for gods sake go and get something for me make the doctor do something im famishing i must be poisoned  lord forbid  look at me i cant eat anything oh i cant even drink i tell you i am dying of thirst  well miss susan thers plenty for you to eat and drink  what is the good of that when i can neither eat nor drink nothing will stay inside me if i could only swallow brandy i shouldnt care i thought i could die drunk oh send eliza out for some laudanum i cant stand this ill kill myself  be quiet miss susan youll be better presently whats the use of talkingabout the doctor he says youll not be able to drink for days and that you will get your health back in consequence you are doing yourself no good by screeching like that and you are ruining me and my house  your house is all you care about curse you i hope you may die deserted yourself dont go away dear aunt sally you wont leave me here alone will you if you do ill scream like a hundred devils  i dont know what to do with you said mrs myers crying youll drive me as mad as yourself why did i ever let you into this house  oh bother are you beginning to howl now have you any sardines or anything spicy i think i could eat some salted duck no i couldnt though go for the doctor there must be something that will do me good what use is he if he cant set me right all i want is something that will make me able to drink a tumbler of brandy  the lord help you praise goodness heres mrs forster coming up whatll she think of you if you keep moaning like that mrs forster will you step in here and try to quiet her a bit shes clean mad  come here cried susanna as marian entered come and sit beside me you may get out you old cat i dont want you any longer  hush pray said marian putting her bonnet aside and sitting down by the sofa what is the matter  the same as last night only a great deal worse said susanna shutting her eyes and turning her head aside its all up with me this time mrs ned im dying not of drink but of the want of it is that fiend of a woman gone  yes you ought not to wound her as you did just now she has been very kind to you  i dont care oh dear me i wonder how long this is going to last  shall i go for the doctor  no what can he do stay with me i wish i could sleep or eat  you will be better soon the doctor says that nature is making an effort to rescue you from your habit by making it impossible for you to drink try and be patient will you not take off those heavy boots  no i cant feel my feet without them i shall never be better said susanna writhing impatiently im done for how old are you you neednt mind telling me i shall soon be beyond repeating it  i was twentyfive in june last  i am only twentynine i started at eighteen and got to the top of the tree in seven years i came down quicker than i went up i might have gone on easily for fifteen years more only for drinking champagne i wish i had my life to live over again you wouldnt catch me playing burlesque if i had got the chance i know i could have played tragedy or real italian opera i had to work hard at first and they wont fill my place very readily thats one comfort my cleverness was my ruin ned was not half so quick it used to take him months to learn things that i picked up offhand and yet you see how much better he has done than i  do not disturb yourself with vain regrets think of something else shall we talk about marmaduke  no i dont particularly care to somehow at my pass one thinks most about ones self and about things that happened long ago people that i came to know later on like bob seem to be slipping away from me there was a baritone in my fathers company a tremendous man with shining black eyes and a voice like a great bellquite pretty at the top though he must have been sixty at least and he was very fat but he was the most dignified man i ever saw you should have heard him do the duke in lucrezia borgia or sing pro peccatis from rossinis stabat mater i was ten years old when he was with us and my grand ambition was to sing with him when i grew up he would shake his head if he saw susanetta now i would rather hear him sing three bars than have ten visits from bob oh dear i thought this cursed pain was getting numbed but it is worse than ever  try to keep from thinking of it i have often wondered that you never speak of your child i have heard from my friend in london that it is very well and happy  oh you mean lucy she was a lively little imp  would you not like to see her again  no thank you she is well taken care of i suppose i am glad she is out of my hands she was a nuisance to me and i am not a very edifying example for her what on earth should i want to see her for  i wish i had the good fortune to be a mother  susanna laughed never say die mrs ned you dont know what may happen to you yet there now i know without opening my eyes that you are shocked bless your delicacy how do you think i should have got through life if id been thinskinned what good does it do you you are pining away in this hole of a lodging you squirm when mrs myers tries to be friendly with you and i sometimes laugh at your expression when eliza treats you to a little blarney about your looks now i would just as soon gossip and swear at her as go to tea with the queen  i am not shocked at all you see as badly as other people when your eyes are shut  they will soon shut up forever i half wish they would do it at once i wonder whether i will get any ease before there is an end of me  perhaps the end of you on earth will be a good beginning for you somewhere else susanna  thank you now the conversation has taken a nice cheerful turn hasnt it well i cant be much worse off than i am at present anyhow i must take my chance  would you like to see a clergyman i dont want to alarm you i am sure you will get better the doctor told me so but i will go for one if you like  no i dont want to be botheredat least not yet besides i hate clergymen all except your brother the doctor who fell in love with me  very well i only suggested it in case you should feel uneasy  i dont feel quite easy but i dont care sufficiently about it to make a fuss it will be time enough when i am actually at deaths door all i know is that if there is a place of punishment in the next world it is very unfair considering what we suffer in this i didnt make myself or my circumstances i think i will try to sleep i am half dead as it is with pain and weariness dont go until i am asleep  i will not let me get you another pillow  no said susanna drowsily dont touch me  marian sat listening to her moaning respiration for nearly half an hour then having some letters to write she went to her own room to fetch her desk whilst she was looking for her pen which was mislaid she heard susanna stirring the floor creaked and there was a clink as of a bottle a moment later marian listening with awakened suspicion was startled by the sound of a heavy fall mingled with a crash of breaking glass she ran back into the next room just in time to see susanna on her hands and knees near the stove lift her white face for a moment displaying a bleeding wound on her temple and then stumble forward and fall prone on the carpet marian saw this saw the walls of the room revolve before her and fainted upon the sofa which she had reached without knowing how  when she recovered the doctor was standing by her and eliza was picking up fragments of the broken bottle the smell of the spilled brandy reminded her of what had happened  where is miss conolly she said trying to collect her wits i am afraid i fainted at the very moment when i was most wanted  all right said the doctor keep quiet youll be well presently dont be in a hurry to talk  marian obeyed and the doctor whose manner was kind though different to that of the london physicians to whom she was accustomed presently left the room and went upstairs eliza was howling like an animal the sound irritated marian even at that pass she despised the whole irish race on its account she could hardly keep her temper as she said  is miss conolly seriously hurt  oa blessed hour shes kilt her heads dhreepin wid blood  marian shuddered and felt faint again  lord almighty save use i doa knoa how she done it at all at all she must ha fell agin the stoave its the dhrink dhrink dhrink that brought her to it its little i knew what that wairy bottle o brandy would do to her or sorra bit o me would ha got it  you did very wrong in getting it eliza  what could i do miss when she axed me  there is no use in crying over it now it would have been kinder to have kept it from her  sure i know manys the time i tould her so but she could talk the birds off the bushes and it wint to me heart to refuse her god send her well out of her throuble  here the doctor returned how are you now he said  i think i am better pray dont think of me how is she  its all over hallo come miss biddy you go and cry in the kitchen he added pushing eliza who had set up an intolerable lamentation out of the room  how awful said marian stunned are you quite sure she seemed better this morning  quite sure said the doctor smiling grimly at the question she was practically dead when they carried her upstairs poor girl its easier to kill a person than you think mrs forster although she tried so long and so hard without succeeding but shed have done it shed have been starved into health only to drink herself back into starvation and the end would have been a very bad one better as it is by far  doctor i must go out and telegraph the news to london i know one of her relatives there  the doctor shook his head i will telegraph if you like but you must stay here youre not yet fit to go out  i am afraid i have not been well lately said marian i want to consult you about myselfnot now of course after what has happened but some day when you have leisure to call  you can put off consulting me just as long as you please but this accident is no reason why you shouldnt do it at once if there is anything wrong the sooner you have adviceyou neednt have it from me if you prefer some other doctorthe better  upon this encouragement marian described to him her state of health he seemed a little amused asked her a few questions and finally told her coolly that she might expect to become a mother next fall she was so utterly dismayed that he began to look stern in anticipation of an appeal to him to avert this an appeal which he had often had to refuse without ever having succeeded in persuading a woman that it was futile or convincing her that it was immoral but marian spared him this she was overwhelmed by the new certainty that a reconciliation with her husband was no longer possible her despair at the discovery shewed her for the first time how homesick she really was  when the doctor left mrs myers came she exclaimed wept and gossiped until two police officers arrived marian related to them what she had seen of the accident and became indignant at the apparent incredulity with which they questioned her and examined the room after their departure eliza came to her and invited her to go upstairs and see the body of susanna she refused with a shudder but when she saw that the girl was hurt as well as astonished it occurred to her that avoidance of the dead might if it came to conollys knowledge be taken by him to indicate a lack of kind feeling toward his sister so she overcame her repugnance and went with eliza the windowshades were drawn down and the dressingtable had been covered with a white cloth on which stood a plaster statuet of the virgin and child with two lighted candles before it to please eliza who had evidently made these arrangements marian whispered a few words of approval and turned curiously to the bed the sight made her uncomfortable the body was decently laid out its wounded forehead covered with a bandage and elizas rosary and crucifix on its breast but it did not as marian had hoped suggest peace or sleep it was not susanna but a vacant thing that had always underlain her and which apart from her was ghastly  she died a good catholic anyhow the light o heaven to her sowl said eliza whimpering but speaking as though she expected and defied marian to contradict her  amen said marian  its sure and sartin there never was a conolly a prodestan yet  marian left the room resolving to avoid such sights in future mrs myers was below anxious to resume the conversation which the visit of the police had interrupted marian could not bear this to escape she left the house and went to her only friend in new york mrs crawford whose frequent visits she had never before ventured to return to her she narrated the events of the day  this business of the poor girl killing herself is real shocking said mrs crawford perhaps your husband will come over here now and give you a chance of making up with him  if he does i must leave new york mrs crawford  what are you frightened of if he is as good a man as you say you ought to be glad to see him im sure he would have you back depend on it he has been longing for you all this time and when he sees you again as pretty as ever he will open his arms to you he wont like you any the worse for being a little bashful with him after such an escapade  i would not meet him for any earthly consideration after what the doctor told me today i should throw myself out of the window i think if i heard him coming upstairs i should like to see him if i were placed where he could not see me but face him i could not  well my dear i think its right silly of you though the little strangerit will be a regular strangeris a difficulty theres no two ways about that  besides i have been thinking over things alone in my room and i see that it is better for him to be free i know he was disappointed in me he is not the sort of man to be tied down to such an ignorant woman as i  what does he expect from a woman if youre not good enough for him he must be very hard to please  marian shook her head he is capable of pitying and being considerate with me she said i know that but i am not sure that it is a good thing to be pitied and forborne with there is something humiliating in it i suppose i am proud as you often tell me but i should like to be amongst women what he is amongst men supported by my own strength even within the last three weeks i have felt myself becoming more independent in my isolation i was afraid to go about the streets by myself at first now i am getting quite brave that unfortunate woman did me good taking care of her and being relied on so much by her has made me rely on myself more thanks to you i have not much loneliness to complain of and yet i have been utterly cast down sometimes i cannot tell what is best sometimes i think that independence is worth all the solitary struggling it costs then again i remember how free from real care i was at home and yearn to be back there it is so hard to know what one ought to do  you have been more lively since you got such a pleasant answer to your telegram i wish the general would offer to let me keep my own money and as much more as i wanted not that he is closefisted poor man that reminds me to tell you that you must stay the evening he wants to see you as bad as can benever stops asking me to bring you up some time when hes at home you mustnt excuse yourself the general will see you safe back to your place  but if visitors come mrs crawford  nobody will come if they do they will be glad to see you what do they know about you you cant live like a hermit all your life  marian sooner than go back to mrs myerss stayed and the evening passed pleasantly enough although three visitors came a gentleman with his wife and brother the lady besides eating and replying to the remarks with which mrs crawford occasionally endeavored to entertain her did nothing but admire marians dress and listen to her conversation her husband was polite but marian comparing him with the english gentlemen of her acquaintance thought him rather oppressively respectful and too much given to conversing in little speeches he had been in london and he described in a correct narrative style his impressions of st pauls the tower and westminster palace his brother fell in love with mrs forster at first sight and sat silent until she remarked to him how strangely the hotel omnibuses resembled old english stage coaches when he became recklessly talkative and soon convinced her that american society produced quite as choice a compound of offhandedness and folly as london could but all this was amusing after her long seclusion and once or twice when the thought of dead susanna came back to her she was ashamed to be so gay  no one was stirring at mrs myerss when she returned they had left her lamp in the entry and she took it upstairs with her going softly lest she should disturb the household susannas usual call and petition for a few minutes talk was no longer to be feared for susanna was now only a memory marian tried not to think of the body in the room above though she was free from the dread which was just then making eliza tremble cry and cross herself to sleep she disliked the body all the more as she distinguished it from the nolonger existent woman a feat quite beyond the irish peasant girl she sat down and began to think the crawfords and their friends had been very nice to her no doubt the lady would not have been civil had she known all but then the lady was a silly person they were not exactly what marian considered the best sort of people but new york was not london she would not stay at mrs myerss her income would enable her to lodge more luxuriously if she could afford to furnish some rooms for herself she would get some curtains she had seen one day lately when shopping with mrs crawford they would go well with  a noise in the room overhead susannas death chamber marian gave a great start and understood what eliza meant by having the life put across in her she listened painfully conscious of the beats of her heart the noise came again a footstep or a chair pushed back orshe was not certain what could mrs myers be watching at the bedside it was not unlikely could susanna be recoveringfinding herself laid out for dead and making a struggle for life up there alone that would be inconvenient undesirable even marian forgot just then to consider that obvious view wrong and unfeeling but anyhow she must go and see and if necessary help she wished there were some one to keep her company but was ashamed to call eliza and she felt that she would be as well by herself as with mrs myers there was nothing for it but to take a candle and go alone no repetition of the noise occurred to daunt her afresh and she reached the landing above almost reassured and thinking how odd it was that the idea of finding somebodysusannathere though it had come as a fear was fading out as a disappointed hope  finding herself loth to open the door she at last set her teeth and did it swiftly as if to surprise someone within she did surprise some one her husband sitting by his sisters body he started violently on seeing her and rose whilst she mechanically shutting the door without turning leaned back against it with her hand behind her and looked at him openmouthed  marian he said in a quite unexpectedly apprehensive tone putting up his hand deprecatingly remember hereindicating the figure on the bedis an end of hypocrisy no unrealities now i cannot bear them let us have no trash of magnanimous injured husband erring but repentant wife we are man and woman nothing less and nothing more after our marriage you declined intercourse on those terms and i accepted your conventions to please you now i refuse all conventions you have broken them yourself if you will not have the truth between us avoid me until i have subsided into the old groove again there he added wincing dont blush what have you to blush for it was the only honest thing you ever did  i dont understand  no he said gently but with a gesture of despair how could you you never did and you never will  if you mean to accuse me of having deceived you said marian greatly relieved and encouraged by a sense of being now the injured party you are most unjust i dont excuse myself for behaving wickedly but i never deceived you or told you a falsehood never when he first spoke wrongly to me i told you at once and you did not care  not a straw it was nothing to me that he loved you the point was did you love him if not then all was well if so our marriage was already at an end but you mistake my drift falsehood is something more than fibbing you never told fibsexcept the two or three dozen a week that mere politeness required and which you never thought of counting but you never told me the truth marian because you never told your self the truth you told me what you told yourself i grant you and so you were not conscious of deceit i dont reproach you surely you can bear to be told what every honest man tells himself almost daily  i suppose i have deserved it said marian but unkind words from you are a new experience you are very unlike yourself tonight  he repressed with visible effort an explosion of impatience on the contrary i am like myselfi actually am myself tonight i hope then the explosion came is it utterly impossible for you to say something real to me only learn to do that and you may have ten love romances every year with other men if you like be anything rather than a ladylike slave and liar there as usual the truth makes you shrink from me as i said before i refuse further intercourse on such terms they have proved unkind in the long run  you spoke plainly enough to her said marian glancing at the bed but in the long run it did her no good  she would have laughed me to scorn if i had minced matters for she never deceived herself society by the power of the purse set her to nautchgirls work and forbade her the higher work that was equally within her power being enslaved and debauched in this fashion how could she be happy except when she was not sober it was her own immediate interest to drink it was her tradesmans interest that she should drink it was her servants interest that she should be pleased with them for getting drink for her she was clever goodnatured more constant to her home and her man than you a living fountain of innocent pleasure as a dancer singer and actress and here she lies after mischievously spending her talent in a series of entertainments too dull for hell and too debased for any better place dead of a preventable disease chiefly because most of the people she came in contact with had a direct pecuniary interest in depraving and poisoning her aye look at her with the cross on her breast the virgin mother in plaster looking on from where she kept her mirror when she was alive and the people outside complacently saying serve her right  marian feared for a moment that he would demolish elizas altar by hurling the chair through it dont ned she said timidly putting her hand on his arm  dont what he said taken aback she drew her hand away and retreated a step coloring at the wifely liberty she had permitted herself to take i beg your pardon i thoughti thought you were going to take the cross away no she added quickly seeing him about to speak and anticipating a burst of scepticism it is not that but the servant is an irish girla roman catholic she put it there and she meant well and will be hurt if it is thrown aside  and you think it better that she should remain in ignorance of what educated people think about her superstition than that she should suffer the mortification of learning that her opinions are not those of all the world however i had no such intention elizas idol is a respectable one as idols go  there was a pause then marian said it must have been a great shock to you when you came and found what had happened i am very sorry but had we not better go downrs it seems so unfeeling somehow to talk without minding her i suppose you consider that foolish but i think you are upset by it yourself  you see a change in me then  you are not quite yourself i think  i tell you again that i am myself at last you do not seem to like the real man any better than the unreal i am afraid you will not have me on any terms well let us go downstairs since you prefer it  oh not unless you wish it too said marian a little bewildered  he took her candle and led the way out without another word or a look at the bed marian as he stood aside to let her go downstairs before him was suddenly seized with a fantastic fear that he was going to kill her she did not condescend to hurry or look back but she only felt safe when they were in her room and he no longer behind her  sit down he said placing the candle on the mantelpiece she sat down at the table and he stood on the hearthrug now said he about the future are you coming back will you give the life at holland park another trial  i cannot she said bending her head almost on her hands i should disgrace you and there is another reason  it is not in your power nor in that of all london to disgrace me if i do not feel disgraced it is useless to say that you cannot if you say i will not then that will settle it what is the other reason  it is not yet born but it will be  that is no reason to me do you think i shall be a worse father to it than he would have been  no indeed but it would be unfair to you he made an impatient gesture i dont understand you ned would you not rather be free  freedom is a fools dream i am free i can divorce you if i please if i live with you again it will be by my own choice you are free too you have burnt your boats and are rid of fashionable society of your family your position your principles and all the rest of your chains forever you are declassed by your own act and if you can frankly give a sigh of relief and respect yourself for breaking loose from what is called your duty then you are the very woman i want for a wife i may not be the very man you want for a husband but at all events you are free to choose free to change after you choose if you choose me free anyhow for i will divorce you if you refuse and then you will beindependentyour own mistressabsolute proprietor of your own childeverything that married women and girls envy you have a foretaste of that freedom now what is it worth one or two conditions more or less to comply with that is all nature and society still have you hard and fast the main rules of the game are inviolable  i think it is a good thing to be free said marian timidly  that means i will not  not will not but i think i had better not  a characteristic distinction marian i once thought like you that freedom was the one condition to be gained at all cost and hazard my favorite psalm was that nonsense of john hays    for always in thine eyes o liberty   shines that high light whereby the world is saved   and though thou slay us we will trust in thee  and she does slay us now i am for the fullest attainable life that involves the least endurable liberty you dont see that yet very well you have libertyliberty to hurt as well as help yourself and you are right to try whether it will not make you happier than wedlock has done  it was not your fault and it is very good of you to offer to take me back i know will my refusing disappoint you at all ned  i am prepared for it you may refuse or accept i foresee how i shall adapt myself to either set of circumstances  yes i forgot you foresee everything said marian with some bitterness  no i only face what i see that is why you do not like living with me goodbye do not look troubled we shall meet again tomorrow and often afterward i hope but tonight makes an end of the irrational knot  goodnight said marian rather forlornly after a pause proffering her hand  one folly more he said taking her in his arms and kissing her she made no resistance if such a moment could be eternal we should never say goodbye he added as it is we are wise not to tempt fortune by asking her for such another  you are too wise ned she said suffering him to replace her gently in the chair  it is impossible to be too wise dearest he said and unhesitatingly turned and left her
