99031844	selected poems of oscar wilde     it is thought that a selection from oscar wildes early verses may be of interest to a large public at present familiar only with the always popular ballad of reading gaol also included in this volume  the poems were first collected by their author when he was twentysex years old and though never until recently well received by the critics have survived the test of nine editions readers will be able to make for themselves the obvious and striking contrasts between these first and last phases of oscar wildes literary activity  the intervening period was devoted almost entirely to dramas prose fiction essays and criticism  robert ross reform club april 5 1911    contents   the ballad of reading gaol ave imperatrix to my wife  with a copy of my poems

is included for the benefit of reciters and their audiences who have found the entire poem too long for declamation  i have tried to obviate a difficulty without officiously exercising the ungrateful prerogatives of a literary executor by falling back on a text which represents the authors first scheme for a poem  never intended of course for recitation  robert ross    poem the ballad of reading gaol    in memoriam of c t w sometimes trooper of the royal horse guards obiit hm prison reading berkshire july 7th 1896   i  he did not wear his scarlet coat for blood and wine are red and blood and wine were on his hands when they found him with the dead the poor dead woman whom he loved and murdered in her bed  he walked amongst the trial men in a suit of shabby grey a cricket cap was on his head and his step seemed light and gay but i never saw a man who looked so wistfully at the day  i never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue which prisoners call the sky and at every drifting cloud that went with sails of silver by  i walked with other souls in pain within another ring and was wondering if the man had done a great or little thing when a voice behind me whispered low that fellows got to swing  dear christ the very prison walls suddenly seemed to reel and the sky above my head became like a casque of scorching steel and though i was a soul in pain my pain i could not feel  i only knew what hunted thought quickened his step and why he looked upon the garish day with such a wistful eye the man had killed the thing he loved and so he had to die  yet each man kills the thing he loves by each let this be heard some do it with a bitter look some with a flattering word the coward does it with a kiss the brave man with a sword  some kill their love when they are young and some when they are old some strangle with the hands of lust some with the hands of gold the kindest use a knife because the dead so soon grow cold  some love too little some too long some sell and others buy some do the deed with many tears and some without a sigh for each man kills the thing he loves yet each man does not die  he does not die a death of shame on a day of dark disgrace nor have a noose about his neck nor a cloth upon his face nor drop feet foremost through the floor into an empty space   he does not sit with silent men who watch him night and day who watch him when he tries to weep and when he tries to pray who watch him lest himself should rob the prison of its prey  he does not wake at dawn to see dread figures throng his room the shivering chaplain robed in white the sheriff stern with gloom and the governor all in shiny black with the yellow face of doom  he does not rise in piteous haste to put on convictclothes while some coarsemouthed doctor gloats and notes each new and nervetwitched pose fingering a watch whose little ticks are like horrible hammerblows  he does not know that sickening thirst that sands ones throat before the hangman with his gardeners gloves slips through the padded door and binds one with three leathern thongs that the throat may thirst no more  he does not bend his head to hear the burial office read nor while the terror of his soul tells him he is not dead cross his own coffin as he moves into the hideous shed  he does not stare upon the air through a little roof of glass he does not pray with lips of clay for his agony to pass nor feel upon his shuddering cheek the kiss of caiaphas   ii   six weeks our guardsman walked the yard in the suit of shabby grey his cricket cap was on his head and his step seemed light and gay but i never saw a man who looked so wistfully at the day  i never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue which prisoners call the sky and at every wandering cloud that trailed its ravelled fleeces by  he did not wring his hands as do those witless men who dare to try to rear the changeling hope in the cave of black despair he only looked upon the sun and drank the morning air  he did not wring his hands nor weep nor did he peek or pine but he drank the air as though it held some healthful anodyne with open mouth he drank the sun as though it had been wine  and i and all the souls in pain who tramped the other ring forgot if we ourselves had done a great or little thing and watched with gaze of dull amaze the man who had to swing  and strange it was to see him pass with a step so light and gay and strange it was to see him look so wistfully at the day and strange it was to think that he had such a debt to pay  for oak and elm have pleasant leaves that in the springtime shoot but grim to see is the gallowstree with its adderbitten root and green or dry a man must die before it bears its fruit  the loftiest place is that seat of grace for which all worldlings try but who would stand in hempen band upon a scaffold high and through a murderers collar take his last look at the sky  it is sweet to dance to violins when love and life are fair to dance to flutes to dance to lutes is delicate and rare but it is not sweet with nimble feet to dance upon the air  so with curious eyes and sick surmise we watched him day by day and wondered if each one of us would end the selfsame way for none can tell to what red hell his sightless soul may stray  at last the dead man walked no more amongst the trial men and i knew that he was standing up in the black docks dreadful pen and that never would i see his face in gods sweet world again  like two doomed ships that pass in storm we had crossed each others way but we made no sign we said no word we had no word to say for we did not meet in the holy night but in the shameful day  a prison wall was round us both two outcast men we were the world had thrust us from its heart and god from out his care and the iron gin that waits for sin had caught us in its snare   iii   in debtors yard the stones are hard and the dripping wall is high so it was there he took the air beneath the leaden sky and by each side a warder walked for fear the man might die  or else he sat with those who watched his anguish night and day who watched him when he rose to weep and when he crouched to pray who watched him lest himself should rob their scaffold of its prey  the governor was strong upon the regulations act the doctor said that death was but a scientific fact and twice a day the chaplain called and left a little tract  and twice a day he smoked his pipe and drank his quart of beer his soul was resolute and held no hidingplace for fear he often said that he was glad the hangmans hands were near  but why he said so strange a thing no warder dared to ask for he to whom a watchers doom is given as his task must set a lock upon his lips and make his face a mask  or else he might be moved and try to comfort or console and what should human pity do pent up in murderers hole what word of grace in such a place could help a brothers soul   with slouch and swing around the ring we trod the fools parade we did not care  we knew we were the devils own brigade and shaven head and feet of lead make a merry masquerade  we tore the tarry rope to shreds with blunt and bleeding nails we rubbed the doors and scrubbed the floors and cleaned the shining rails and rank by rank we soaped the plank and clattered with the pails  we sewed the sacks we broke the stones we turned the dusty drill we banged the tins and bawled the hymns and sweated on the mill but in the heart of every man terror was lying still  so still it lay that every day crawled like a weedclogged wave and we forgot the bitter lot that waits for fool and knave till once as we tramped in from work we passed an open grave  with yawning mouth the yellow hole gaped for a living thing the very mud cried out for blood to the thirsty asphalte ring and we knew that ere one dawn grew fair some prisoner had to swing  right in we went with soul intent on death and dread and doom the hangman with his little bag went shuffling through the gloom and each man trembled as he crept into his numbered tomb  that night the empty corridors were full of forms of fear and up and down the iron town stole feet we could not hear and through the bars that hide the stars white faces seemed to peer  he lay as one who lies and dreams in a pleasant meadowland the watchers watched him as he slept and could not understand how one could sleep so sweet a sleep with a hangman close at hand  but there is no sleep when men must weep who never yet have wept so we  the fool the fraud the knave  that endless vigil kept and through each brain on hands of pain anothers terror crept  alas it is a fearful thing to feel anothers guilt for right within the sword of sin pierced to its poisoned hilt and as molten lead were the tears we shed for the blood we had not spilt  the warders with their shoes of felt crept by each padlocked door and peeped and saw with eyes of awe grey figures on the floor and wondered why men knelt to pray who never prayed before  all through the night we knelt and prayed mad mourners of a corse the troubled plumes of midnight were the plumes upon a hearse and bitter wine upon a sponge was the savour of remorse   the grey cock crew the red cock crew but never came the day and crooked shapes of terror crouched in the corners where we lay and each evil sprite that walks by night before us seemed to play  they glided past they glided fast like travellers through a mist they mocked the moon in a rigadoon of delicate turn and twist and with formal pace and loathsome grace the phantoms kept their tryst  with mop and mow we saw them go slim shadows hand in hand about about in ghostly rout they trod a saraband and the damned grotesques made arabesques like the wind upon the sand  with the pirouettes of marionettes they tripped on pointed tread but with flutes of fear they filled the ear as their grisly masque they led and loud they sang and long they sang for they sang to wake the dead  oho they cried the world is wide but fettered limbs go lame and once or twice to throw the dice is a gentlemanly game but he does not win who plays with sin in the secret house of shame  no things of air these antics were that frolicked with such glee to men whose lives were held in gyves and whose feet might not go free ah wounds of christ they were living things most terrible to see  around around they waltzed and wound some wheeled in smirking pairs with the mincing step of a demirep some sidled up the stairs and with subtle sneer and fawning leer each helped us at our prayers  the morning wind began to moan but still the night went on through its giant loom the web of gloom crept till each thread was spun and as we prayed we grew afraid of the justice of the sun  the moaning wind went wandering round the weeping prisonwall till like a wheel of turning steel we felt the minutes crawl o moaning wind what had we done to have such a seneschal  at last i saw the shadowed bars like a lattice wrought in lead move right across the whitewashed wall that faced my threeplank bed and i knew that somewhere in the world gods dreadful dawn was red  at six oclock we cleaned our cells at seven all was still but the sough and swing of a mighty wing the prison seemed to fill for the lord of death with icy breath had entered in to kill  he did not pass in purple pomp nor ride a moonwhite steed three yards of cord and a sliding board are all the gallows need so with rope of shame the herald came to do the secret deed  we were as men who through a fen of filthy darkness grope we did not dare to breathe a prayer or to give our anguish scope something was dead in each of us and what was dead was hope  for mans grim justice goes its way and will not swerve aside it slays the weak it slays the strong it has a deadly stride with iron heel it slays the strong the monstrous parricide  we waited for the stroke of eight each tongue was thick with thirst for the stroke of eight is the stroke of fate that makes a man accursed and fate will use a running noose for the best man and the worst  we had no other thing to do save to wait for the sign to come so like things of stone in a valley lone quiet we sat and dumb but each mans heart beat thick and quick like a madman on a drum  with sudden shock the prisonclock smote on the shivering air and from all the gaol rose up a wail of impotent despair like the sound that frightened marshes hear from some leper in his lair  and as one sees most fearful things in the crystal of a dream we saw the greasy hempen rope hooked to the blackened beam and heard the prayer the hangmans snare strangled into a scream  and all the woe that moved him so that he gave that bitter cry and the wild regrets and the bloody sweats none knew so well as i for he who lives more lives than one more deaths than one must die   iv   there is no chapel on the day on which they hang a man the chaplains heart is far too sick or his face is far too wan or there is that written in his eyes which none should look upon  so they kept us close till nigh on noon and then they rang the bell and the warders with their jingling keys opened each listening cell and down the iron stair we tramped each from his separate hell  out into gods sweet air we went but not in wonted way for this mans face was white with fear and that mans face was grey and i never saw sad men who looked so wistfully at the day  i never saw sad men who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue we prisoners called the sky and at every careless cloud that passed in happy freedom by  but there were those amongst us all who walked with downcast head and knew that had each got his due they should have died instead he had but killed a thing that lived whilst they had killed the dead  for he who sins a second time wakes a dead soul to pain and draws it from its spotted shroud and makes it bleed again and makes it bleed great gouts of blood and makes it bleed in vain  like ape or clown in monstrous garb with crooked arrows starred silently we went round and round the slippery asphalte yard silently we went round and round and no man spoke a word  silently we went round and round and through each hollow mind the memory of dreadful things rushed like a dreadful wind and horror stalked before each man and terror crept behind  the warders strutted up and down and kept their herd of brutes their uniforms were spick and span and they wore their sunday suits but we knew the work they had been at by the quicklime on their boots  for where a grave had opened wide there was no grave at all only a stretch of mud and sand by the hideous prisonwall and a little heap of burning lime that the man should have his pall  for he has a pall this wretched man such as few men can claim deep down below a prisonyard naked for greater shame he lies with fetters on each foot wrapt in a sheet of flame  and all the while the burning lime eats flesh and bone away it eats the brittle bone by night and the soft flesh by day it eats the flesh and bone by turns but it eats the heart alway  for three long years they will not sow or root or seedling there for three long years the unblessed spot will sterile be and bare and look upon the wondering sky with unreproachful stare  they think a murderers heart would taint each simple seed they sow it is not true  gods kindly earth is kindlier than men know and the red rose would but blow more red the white rose whiter blow  out of his mouth a red red rose out of his heart a white for who can say by what strange way christ brings his will to light since the barren staff the pilgrim bore bloomed in the great popes sight  but neither milkwhite rose nor red may bloom in prisonair the shard the pebble and the flint are what they give us there for flowers have been known to heal a common mans despair  so never will winered rose or white petal by petal fall on that stretch of mud and sand that lies by the hideous prisonwall to tell the men who tramp the yard that gods son died for all  yet though the hideous prisonwall still hems him round and round and a spirit may not walk by night that is with fetters bound and a spirit may but weep that lies in such unholy ground  he is at peace  this wretched man  at peace or will be soon there is no thing to make him mad nor does terror walk at noon for the lampless earth in which he lies has neither sun nor moon  they hanged him as a beast is hanged they did not even toll a requiem that might have brought rest to his startled soul but hurriedly they took him out and hid him in a hole  they stripped him of his canvas clothes and gave him to the flies they mocked the swollen purple throat and the stark and staring eyes and with laughter loud they heaped the shroud in which their convict lies  the chaplain would not kneel to pray by his dishonoured grave nor mark it with that blessed cross that christ for sinners gave because the man was one of those whom christ came down to save  yet all is well he has but passed to lifes appointed bourne and alien tears will fill for him pitys longbroken urn for his mourners will be outcast men and outcasts always mourn   v   i know not whether laws be right or whether laws be wrong all that we know who lie in gaol is that the wall is strong and that each day is like a year a year whose days are long  but this i know that every law that men have made for man since first man took his brothers life and the sad world began but straws the wheat and saves the chaff with a most evil fan  this too i know  and wise it were if each could know the same  that every prison that men build is built with bricks of shame and bound with bars lest christ should see how men their brothers maim  with bars they blur the gracious moon and blind the goodly sun and they do well to hide their hell for in it things are done that son of god nor son of man ever should look upon  the vilest deeds like poison weeds bloom well in prisonair it is only what is good in man that wastes and withers there pale anguish keeps the heavy gate and the warder is despair  for they starve the little frightened child till it weeps both night and day and they scourge the weak and flog the fool and gibe the old and grey and some grow mad and all grow bad and none a word may say  each narrow cell in which we dwell is a foul and dark latrine and the fetid breath of living death chokes up each grated screen and all but lust is turned to dust in humanitys machine  the brackish water that we drink creeps with a loathsome slime and the bitter bread they weigh in scales is full of chalk and lime and sleep will not lie down but walks wildeyed and cries to time  but though lean hunger and green thirst like asp with adder fight we have little care of prison fare for what chills and kills outright is that every stone one lifts by day becomes ones heart by night  with midnight always in ones heart and twilight in ones cell we turn the crank or tear the rope each in his separate hell and the silence is more awful far than the sound of a brazen bell  and never a human voice comes near to speak a gentle word and the eye that watches through the door is pitiless and hard and by all forgot we rot and rot with soul and body marred  and thus we rust lifes iron chain degraded and alone and some men curse and some men weep and some men make no moan but gods eternal laws are kind and break the heart of stone  and every human heart that breaks in prisoncell or yard is as that broken box that gave its treasure to the lord and filled the unclean lepers house with the scent of costliest nard  ah happy they whose hearts can break and peace of pardon win how else may man make straight his plan and cleanse his soul from sin how else but through a broken heart may lord christ enter in  and he of the swollen purple throat and the stark and staring eyes waits for the holy hands that took the thief to paradise and a broken and a contrite heart the lord will not despise  the man in red who reads the law gave him three weeks of life three little weeks in which to heal his soul of his souls strife and cleanse from every blot of blood the hand that held the knife  and with tears of blood he cleansed the hand the hand that held the steel for only blood can wipe out blood and only tears can heal and the crimson stain that was of cain became christs snowwhite seal   vi   in reading gaol by reading town there is a pit of shame and in it lies a wretched man eaten by teeth of flame in a burning windingsheet he lies and his grave has got no name  and there till christ call forth the dead in silence let him lie no need to waste the foolish tear or heave the windy sigh the man had killed the thing he loved and so he had to die  and all men kill the thing they love by all let this be heard some do it with a bitter look some with a flattering word the coward does it with a kiss the brave man with a sword    the ballad of reading gaol    a version based on the original draft of the poem   i  he did not wear his scarlet coat for blood and wine are red and blood and wine were on his hands when they found him with the dead the poor dead woman whom he loved and murdered in her bed  he walked amongst the trial men in a suit of shabby grey a cricket

 some love too little some too long some sell and others buy some do the deed with many tears and some without a sigh for each man kills the thing he loves yet each man does not die  he does not die a

can write no stately proem as a prelude to my lay from a poet to a poem i would dare to say  for if of these fallen petals one to you seem fair love will waft it till it settles on your hair  and when

all the woods are alive with the murmur and sound of spring and the rosebud breaks into pink on the climbing briar and the crocusbed is a quivering moon of fire girdled round with the belt of an amethyst ring  and the plane to the pinetree is whispering some tale of love till it rustles with laughter and tosses its mantle of green and the gloom of the wychelms hollow is lit with the iris

the lead or that proud aragon bent low his head or that moroccos fiery heart grew cold for in that gorgeous dress of beaten gold which is more golden than the golden sun no woman veronese looked upon

how vain and dull this common world must seem to such a one as thou who shouldst have talked at florence with mirandola or walked through the cool olives of the academe thou shouldst have gathered reeds from a green stream for goatfoot pans shrill piping and have played with the white girls in that phaeacian glade where grave odysseus wakened from his dream  ah surely once some urn of attic clay held thy wan dust and thou hast come again back to this common world so dull and vain for thou wert weary of the sunless day the heavy fields of scentless asphodel the loveless lips with which men kiss in hell    poem sonnet on hearing the dies irae sung in the sistine chapel    nay lord not thus white lilies in the spring sad olivegroves or silverbreasted dove teach me more clearly of thy life and love than terrors of red flame and thundering the hillside vines dear memories of thee bring a bird at evening flying to its nest tells me of one who had no place of rest i think it is of thee the sparrows sing come rather on some autumn afternoon when red and brown are burnished on the leaves and the fields echo to the gleaners song come when the splendid fulness of the moon looks down upon the rows of golden sheaves and reap thy harvest  we have waited long    poem ave maria gratia plena    was this his coming  i had hoped to see a scene of wondrous glory as was told of some great god who in a rain of gold broke open bars and fell on danae or a dread vision as when semele sickening for love and unappeased desire prayed to see gods clear body and the fire caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly with such glad dreams i sought this holy place and now with wondering eyes and heart i stand before this supreme mystery of love some kneeling girl with passionless pale face an angel with a lily in his hand and over both the white wings of a dove  florence    poem libertatis sacra fames    albeit nurtured in democracy and liking best that state republican where every man is kinglike and no man is crowned above his fellows yet i see spite of this modern fret for liberty better the rule of one whom all obey than to let clamorous demagogues betray our freedom with the kiss of anarchy wherefore i love them not whose hands profane plant the red flag upon the piledup street for no right cause beneath whose ignorant reign arts culture reverence honour all things fade save treason and the dagger of her trade or murder with his silent bloody feet    poem roses and rue    to l l   could we dig up this longburied treasure were it worth the pleasure we never could learn loves song we are parted too long  could the passionate past that is fled call back its dead could we live it all over again were it worth the pain  i remember we used to meet by an ivied seat and you warbled each pretty word with the air of a bird  and your voice had a quaver in it just like a linnet and shook as the blackbirds throat with its last big note  and your eyes they were green and grey like an april day but lit into amethyst when i stooped and kissed  and your mouth it would never smile for a long long while then it rippled all over with laughter five minutes after  you were always afraid of a shower just like a flower i remember you started and ran when the rain began  i remember i never could catch you for no one could match you you had wonderful luminous fleet little wings to your feet  i remember your hair  did i tie it for it always ran riot  like a tangled sunbeam of gold these things are old  i remember so well the room and the lilac bloom that beat at the dripping pane in the warm june rain  and the colour of your gown it was amberbrown and two yellow satin bows from your shoulders rose  and the handkerchief of french lace which you held to your face  had a small tear left a stain or was it the rain  on your hand as it waved adieu there were veins of blue in your voice as it said goodbye was a petulant cry  you have only wasted your life ah that was the knife when i rushed through the garden gate it was all too late  could we live it over again were it worth the pain could the passionate past that is fled call back its dead  well if my heart must break dear love for your sake it will break in music i know poets hearts break so  but strange that i was not told that the brain can hold in a tiny ivory cell gods heaven and hell    poem from the garden of eros    in this poem the author laments the growth of materialism in the nineteenth century  he hails keats and shelley and some of the poets and artists who were his contemporaries although his seniors as the torchbearers of the intellectual life  among these are swinburne william morris rossetti and brunejones   nay when keats died the muses still had left one silver voice to sing his threnody 1 but ah too soon of it we were bereft when on that riven night and stormy sea panthea claimed her singer as her own and slew the mouth that praised her since which time we walk alone  save for that fiery heart that morning star 2 of rearisen england whose clear eye saw from our tottering throne and waste of war the grand greek limbs of young democracy rise mightily like hesperus and bring the great republic him at least thy love hath taught to sing  and he hath been with thee at thessaly and seen white atalanta fleet of foot in passionless and fierce virginity hunting the tusked boar his honied lute hath pierced the cavern of the hollow hill and venus laughs to know one knee will bow before her still  and he hath kissed the lips of proserpine and sung the galilaeans requiem that wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine he hath discrowned the ancient gods in him have found their last most ardent worshipper and the new sign grows grey and dim before its conqueror  spirit of beauty tarry with us still it is not quenched the torch of poesy the star that shook above the eastern hill holds unassailed its argent armoury from all the gathering gloom and fretful fight  o tarry with us still for through the long and common night  morris our sweet and simple chaucers child dear heritor of spensers tuneful reed with soft and sylvan pipe has oft beguiled the weary soul of man in troublous need and from the far and flowerless fields of ice has brought fair flowers to make an earthly paradise  we know them all gudrun the strong mens bride aslaug and olafson we know them all how giant grettir fought and sigurd died and what enchantment held the king in thrall when lonely brynhild wrestled with the powers that war against all passion ah how oft through summer hours  long listless summer hours when the noon being enamoured of a damask rose forgets to journey westward till the moon the pale usurper of its tribute grows from a thin sickle to a silver shield and chides its loitering car  how oft in some cool grassy field  far from the cricketground and noisy eight at bagley where the rustling bluebells come almost before the blackbird finds a mate and overstay the swallow and the hum of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves have i lain poring on the dreamy tales his fancy weaves  and through their unreal woes and mimic pain wept for myself and so was purified and in their simple mirth grew glad again for as i sailed upon that pictured tide the strength and splendour of the storm was mine without the storms red ruin for the singer is divine   the little laugh of water falling down is not so musical the clammy gold close hoarded in the tiny waxen town has less of sweetness in it and the old halfwithered reeds that waved in arcady touched by his lips break forth again to fresher harmony  spirit of beauty tarry yet awhile although the cheating merchants of the mart with iron roads profane our lovely isle and break on whirling wheels the limbs of art ay though the crowded factories beget the blindworm ignorance that slays the soul o tarry yet  for one at least there is  he bears his name from dante and the seraph gabriel 3  whose double laurels burn with deathless flame to light thine altar he 4 too loves thee well who saw old merlin lured in viviens snare and the white feet of angels coming down the golden stair  loves thee so well that all the world for him a gorgeouscoloured vestiture must wear and sorrow take a purple diadem or else be no more sorrow and despair gild its own thorns and pain like adon be even in anguish beautiful  such is the empery  which painters hold and such the heritage this gentle solemn spirit doth possess being a better mirror of his age in all his pity love and weariness than those who can but copy common things and leave the soul unpainted with its mighty questionings  but they are few and all romance has flown and men can prophesy about the sun and lecture on his arrows  how alone through a waste void the soulless atoms run how from each tree its weeping nymph has fled and that no more mid english reeds a naiad shows her head    poem the harlots house    we caught the tread of dancing feet we loitered down the moonlit street and stopped beneath the harlots house  inside above the din and fray we heard the loud musicians play the treues liebes herz of strauss  like strange mechanical grotesques making fantastic arabesques the shadows raced across the blind  we watched the ghostly dancers spin to sound of horn and violin like black leaves wheeling in the wind  like wirepulled automatons slim silhouetted skeletons went sidling through the slow quadrille  then took each other by the hand and danced a stately saraband their laughter echoed thin and shrill  sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed a phantom lover to her breast sometimes they seemed to try to sing  sometimes a horrible marionette came out and smoked its cigarette upon the steps like a live thing  then turning to my love i said the dead are dancing with the dead the dust is whirling with the dust  but she  she heard the violin and left my side and entered in love passed into the house of lust  then suddenly the tune went false the dancers wearied of the waltz the shadows ceased to wheel and whirl  and down the long and silent street the dawn with silversandalled feet crept like a frightened girl    poem from the burden of itys    this english thames is holier far than rome those harebells like a sudden flush of sea breaking across the woodland with the foam of meadowsweet and white anemone to fleck their blue waves  god is likelier there than hidden in that crystalhearted star the pale monks bear  those violetgleaming butterflies that take yon creamy lily for their pavilion are monsignores and where the rushes shake a lazy pike lies basking in the sun his eyes half shut  he is some mitred old bishop in partibus look at those gaudy scales all green and gold  the wind the restless prisoner of the trees does well for palaestrina one would say the mighty masters hands were on the keys of the maria organ which they play when early on some sapphire easter morn in a high litter red as blood or sin the pope is borne  from his dark house out to the balcony above the bronze gates and the crowded square whose very fountains seem for ecstasy to toss their silver lances in the air and stretching out weak hands to east and west in vain sends peace to peaceless lands to restless nations rest  is not yon lingering orange afterglow that stays to vex the moon more fair than all romes lordliest pageants strange a year ago i knelt before some crimson cardinal who bare the host across the esquiline and now  those common poppies in the wheat seem twice as fine  the bluegreen beanfields yonder tremulous with the last shower sweeter perfume bring through this cool evening than the odorous flamejewelled censers the young deacons swing when the grey priest unlocks the curtained shrine and makes gods body from the common fruit of corn and vine  poor fra giovanni bawling at the mass were out of tune now for a small brown bird sings overhead and through the long cool grass i see that throbbing throat which once i heard on starlit hills of flowerstarred arcady once where the white and crescent sand of salamis meets sea  sweet is the swallow twittering on the eaves at daybreak when the mower whets his scythe and stockdoves murmur and the milkmaid leaves her little lonely bed and carols blithe to see the heavylowing cattle wait stretching their huge and dripping mouths across the farmyard gate  and sweet the hops upon the kentish leas and sweet the wind that lifts the newmown hay and sweet the fretful swarms of grumbling bees that round and round the linden blossoms play and sweet the heifer breathing in the stall and the green bursting figs that hang upon the redbrick wall  and sweet to hear the cuckoo mock the spring while the last violet loiters by the well and sweet to hear the shepherd daphnis sing the song of linus through a sunny dell of warm arcadia where the corn is gold and the slight lithelimbed reapers dance about the wattled fold        it was a dream the glade is tenantless no soft ionian laughter moves the air the thames creeps on in sluggish leadenness and from the copse left desolate and bare fled is young bacchus with his revelry yet still from nuneham wood there comes that thrilling melody  so sad that one might think a human heart brake in each separate note a quality which music sometimes has being the art which is most nigh to tears and memory poor mourning philomel what dost thou fear thy sister doth not haunt these fields pandion is not here  here is no cruel lord with murderous blade no woven web of bloody heraldries but mossy dells for roving comrades made warm valleys where the tired student lies with halfshut book and many a winding walk where rustic lovers stray at eve in happy simple talk  the harmless rabbit gambols with its young across the trampled towingpath where late a troop of laughing boys in jostling throng cheered with their noisy cries the racing eight the gossamer with ravelled silver threads works at its little loom and from the dusky redeaved sheds  of the lone farm a flickering light shines out where the swinked shepherd drives his bleating flock back to their wattled sheepcotes a faint shout comes from some oxford boat at sandford lock and starts the moorhen from the sedgy rill and the dim lengthening shadows flit like swallows up the hill  the heron passes homeward to the mere the blue mist creeps among the shivering trees gold world by world the silent stars appear and like a blossom blown before the breeze a white moon drifts across the shimmering sky mute arbitress of all thy sad thy rapturous threnody  she does not heed thee wherefore should she heed she knows endymion is not far away tis i tis i whose soul is as the reed which has no message of its own to play so pipes anothers bidding it is i drifting with every wind on the wide sea of misery  ah the brown bird has ceased  one exquisite trill about the sombre woodland seems to cling dying in music else the air is still so still that one might hear the bats small wing wander and wheel above the pines or tell each tiny dewdrop dripping from the bluebells brimming cell  and far away across the lengthening wold across the willowy flats and thickets brown magdalens tall tower tipped with tremulous gold marks the long high street of the little town and warns me to return i must not wait hark  t is the curfew booming from the bell at christ church gate    poem flower of love    sweet i blame you not for mine the fault was had i not been made of common clay i had climbed the higher heights unclimbed yet seen the fuller air the larger day  from the wildness of my wasted passion i had struck a better clearer song lit some lighter light of freer freedom battled with some hydraheaded wrong  had my lips been smitten into music by the kisses that but made them bleed you had walked with bice and the angels on that verdant and enamelled mead  i had trod the road which dante treading saw the suns of seven circles shine ay perchance had seen the heavens opening as they opened to the florentine  and the mighty nations would have crowned me who am crownless now and without name and some orient dawn had found me kneeling on the threshold of the house of fame  i had sat within that marble circle where the oldest bard is as the young and the pipe is ever dropping honey and the lyres strings are ever strung  keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out the poppyseeded wine with ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead clasped the hand of noble love in mine  and at springtide when the appleblossoms brush the burnished bosom of the dove two young lovers lying in an orchard would have read the story of our love  would have read the legend of my passion known the bitter secret of my heart kissed as we have kissed but never parted as we two are fated now to part  for the crimson flower of our life is eaten by the cankerworm of truth and no hand can gather up the fallen withered petals of the rose of youth  yet i am not sorry that i loved you  ah what else had i a boy to do  for the hungry teeth of time devour and the silentfooted years pursue  rudderless we drift athwart a tempest and when once the storm of youth is past without lyre without lute or chorus death the silent pilot comes at last  and within the grave there is no pleasure for the blindworm battens on the root and desire shudders into ashes and the tree of passion bears no fruit  ah what else had i to do but love you gods own mother was less dear to me and less dear the cytheraean rising like an argent lily from the sea  i have made my choice have lived my poems and though youth is gone in wasted days i have found the lovers crown of myrtle better than the poets crown of bays    footnotes  1  shelley 2  swinburne 3  rossetti 4  burnejones
