wilding even as that gentleman on his feet was proposing to drink to the eyes of the young fools sister  the moments that followed were full of interest a stillness a brooding expectant stillness fell upon the companyand it numbered a round dozenabout lord gervases richly appointed board in the soft candlelight the oval table shone like a deep brown pool in which were reflected the gleaming silver and sparkling crystal that seemed to float upon it  blake sucked in his netherlip his florid face a thought less florid than its wont his prominent blue eyes a thought more prominent under its golden periwig old nick trenchards wizened countenance was darkened by a scowl and his fingers long swarthy and gnarled drummed fretfully upon the table portly lord gervase scoresbytheir host a benign and placid man of peace detesting turbulenceturned crimson now in wordless rage the others gaped and staredsome at young westmacott some at the man he had so grossly affrontedwhilst in the shadows of the hall a couple of lacqueys looked on amazed all teeth and eyes  mr wilding stood very still and outwardly impassive the wine trickling from his long face which if pale was no paler than its habit a vestige of the smile with which he had proposed the toast still lingering on his thin lips though departed from his eyes an elegant gentleman was mr wilding tall and seeming even taller by virtue of his exceeding slenderness he had the courage to wear his own hair which was of a dark brown and very luxuriant dark brown too were his sombre eyes lowlidded and set at a downward slant from those odd eyes of his his countenance gathered an air of superciliousness tempered by a gentle melancholy for the rest it was scored by lines that stamped it with the appearance of an age in excess of his thirty years  thirty guineas worth of mechlin at his throat was drenched empurpled and ruined beyond redemption and on the breast of his blue satin coat a dark patch was spreading like a stain of blood  richard westmacott short sturdy and faircomplexioned to the point of insipidity watched him sullenly out of pale eyes and waited it was lord gervase who broke at last the silencebroke it with an oath a thing unusual in one whose nature was almost womanmild  as gods my life he spluttered wrathfully glowering at richard to have this happen in my house the young fool shall make apology  with his dying breath sneered trenchard and the old rakes words his tone and the malevolent look he bent upon the boy increased the companys malaise  i think said mr wilding with a most singular and excessive sweetness that what mr westmacott has done he has done because he apprehended me amiss  no doubt hell say so opined trenchard with a shrug and had caution dug into his ribs by blakes elbow whilst richard made haste to prove him wrong by saying the contrary  i apprehended you exactly sir he answered defiance in his voice and wineflushed face  ha clucked trenchard irrepressible hes bent on selfdestruction let him have his way in gods name  but wilding seemed intent upon showing how longsuffering he could be he gently shook his head nay now said he you thought mr westmacott that in mentioning your sister i did so lightly is it not so  you mentioned her and that is all that matters cried westmacott ill not have her name on your lips at any time or in any placeno nor in any manner his speech was thick from too much wine  you are drunk cried indignant lord gervase with finality  potvaliant trenchard elaborated  mr wilding set down at last the glass which he had continued to hold until that moment he rested his hands upon the table knuckles downward and leaning forward he spoke impressively his face very grave and those presentknowing him as they didwere one and all lost in wonder at his unusual patience  mr westmacott said he i do think you are wrong to persist in affronting me you have done a thing that is beyond forgiveness and yet when i offer you this opportunity of honourably retrieving he shrugged his shoulders leaving the sentence incomplete  the company might have spared its deep surprise at so much mildness there was but the semblance of it wilding proceeded thus of purpose set and under the calm mask of his long white face his mind worked wickedly and deliberately the temerity of westmacott whose nature was notoriously timid had surprised him for a moment but anon reading the boys mind as readily as though it had been a scroll unfolded for his instruction he saw that westmacott on the strength of his position as his sisters brother conceived himself immune mr wildings avowed courtship of the lady the hopes he still entertained of winning her despite the aversion she was at pains to show him gave westmacott assurance that mr wilding would never elect to shatter his all too slender chances by embroiling himself in a quarrel with her brother andreading him thus arightmr wilding put on that mask of patience luring the boy into greater conviction of the security of his position and richard conceiving himself safe in his entrenchment behind the bulwarks of his brothership to ruth westmacott and heartened further by the excess of wine he had consumed persisted in insults he would never otherwise have dared to offer  who seeks to retrieve he crowed offensively boldly looking up into the others face it seems you are yourself reluctant and he laughed a trifle stridently and looked about him for applause but found none  you are overrash lord gervase disapproved him harshly  not the first coward ive seen grow valiant at a table put in trenchard by way of explanation and might have come to words with blake on that same score but that in that moment wilding spoke again  reluctant to do what he questioned amiably looking westmacott so straightly between the eyes that the boy shifted uneasily on his highbacked chair  nevertheless still full of confidence in the unassailability of his position the mad youth answered to cleanse yourself of what i threw at you  fan me ye winds gasped nick trenchard and looked with expectancy at his friend wilding  now there was one factor with which in basing with such craven shrewdness his calculations upon mr wildings feelings for his sister young richard had not reckoned he was not to know that wilding bruised and wounded by miss westmacotts scorn of him had reached that borderland where love and hate are so merged that they are scarce to be distinguished embittered by the slights she had put upon himslights which his sensitive lovers fancy had magnified a hundredfoldanthony wildings frame of mind was grown peculiar of his love she would have none his kindness she seemingly despised so be it she should taste his cruelty if she scorned his wooing and forbade him to pursue it at least it was not hers to deny him the power to hurt and in hurting her that would not be loved by him some measure of fierce and bitter consolation seemed to await him  he realized perhaps not quite all thisand to the unworthiness of it all he gave no thought but he realized enough as he toyed as cat with mouse with richard westmacott to know that in striking at her through the worthless person of this brother whom she cherishedand who persisted in affording him this opportunitya wicked vengeance would be his  peaceloving lord gervase had heaved himself suddenly to his feet at westmacotts last words still intent upon saving the situation  in heavens name he began when mr wilding ever calm and smiling though now a trifle sinister waved him gently into silence but that persisting calm of mr wildings was too much for old nick trenchard he rose abruptly drawing all eyes upon himself it was time he thought he took a hand in this  in addition to his affection for wilding and his contempt for westmacott he was filled with a fear that the latter might become dangerous if not crushed at once gifted with a shrewd knowledge of men acquired during a chequered life of much sour experience old nick instinctively mistrusted richard he had known him for a fool a weakling a babbler and a bibber of wine out of such elements a villain is soon compounded and trenchard had cause to fear the form of villainy that lay ready to richards hand for it chanced that mr trenchard was second cousin to that famous john trenchard so lately tried for treason and acquitted to the great joy of the sectaries of the west and still more latelybut yesterday in factfled the country to escape the rearrest ordered in consequence of that excessive joy like his more famous cousin nick trenchard was one of the duke of monmouths most active agents and westmacott like wilding vallancey and one or two others at that board stood too committed to the cause of the protestant champion  out of his knowledge of the boy trenchard was led to fear that if he were leniently dealt with now tomorrow when sober he came to realize the grossness of the thing he had done and the unlikelihood of its being forgiven him there was no saying but that to protect himself he might betray wildings share in the plot that was being hatched that in itself would be bad enough but there might be worse for he could scarcely betray wilding without betraying others andwhat mattered mostthe cause itself he must be dealt with out of hand trenchard opined and dealt with ruthlessly  i think anthony said he that we have had words enough shall you be disposing of mr westmacott tomorrow or must i be doing it for you  with a gasp of dismay young richard twisted in his chair to confront this fresh and unsuspected antagonist what danger was this that he had overlooked then even as he turned wildings voice fell on his ear and each word of the few he spoke was like a drop of icy water on westmacotts overheated brain  i protest you are vastly kind nick but i intend myself to have the pleasure of killing mr westmacott and his smile fell now in mockery upon the disillusioned lad  crushed by that bolt from the blue richard sat as if stunned the flush receding from his face until his very lips were livid the shock had sobered him and sobered he realized in terror what he had done and yet even sober he was amazed to find that the staff upon which with such security he had leaned should have proved rotten true he had put much strain upon it but then he had counted that it would stand much strain  he would have spoken but he lacked words so stricken was he and even had he done so it is odds none would have heard him for the late calm was of a sudden turned to garboil every man of that companywith the sole exception of richard himselfwas on his feet and all were speaking at once in clamouring excited chorus  wilding alonethe butt of their expostulationsstood quietly smiling and wiped his face at last with a kerchief of finest lawn dominating the others in the babel rose the voice of sir rowland blakeimpecunious blake blake lately of the guards who had sold his commission as the only thing remaining him upon which he could raise money blake that other suitor for miss westmacotts hand the suitor favoured by her brother  you shall not do it mr wilding he shouted his face crimson no by god you were shamed forever he is but a lad and drunk  trenchard eyed the short powerfully built man beside him and laughed unpleasantly you should get yourself bled one of these days sir rowland he advised there may be no great danger yet but a man cant be too careful when he wears a narrow neckcloth  blakea short powerfully built mantook no heed of him but looked straight at mr wilding who smiling ever calmly returned the gaze of those prominent blue eyes  you will suffer me sir rowland said he sweetly to be the judge of whom i will and whom i will not meet  sir rowland flushed under that mocking glance and caustic tone but he is drunk he repeated feebly  i think said trenchard that he is hearing something that will make him sober  lord gervase took the lad by the shoulder and shook him impatiently well quoth he have you nothing to say you did a deal of prating just now i make no doubt but that even at this late hour if you were to make apology  it would be idle came wildings icy voice to quench the gleam of hope kindling anew in richards breast the lad saw that he was lost and he is a poor thing indeed who cannot face the worst once that worst is shown to be irrevocable he rose with some semblance of dignity  it is as i would wish said he but his livid face and staring eyes belied the valour of his words he cleared his huskiness from his throat sir rowland said he will you act for me  not i cried blake with an oath ill be no party to the butchery of a boy unfledged  unfledged echoed trenchard body o me tis a matter wilding will amend tomorrow hell fledge him never fear hell wing him on his flight to heaven  of set purpose did trenchard add this fuel to the blazing fire it was no part of his views that this encounter should be avoided if richard westmacott were allowed to live after what had passed there were too many tall fellows might go in peril of their lives  richard meanwhile had turned to the man on his leftyoung vallancey a notorious partisan of the duke of monmouths a hairbrained gentleman who was his own worst enemy  may i count on you ned he asked  ayeto the death said vallancey magniloquently  mr vallancey said trenchard with a wry twist of his sharp features you grow prophetic    chapter ii sir rowland to the rescue   from scoresby hall near weston zoyland young westmacott rode home that saturday night to his sisters house in bridgwater a sobered man and an anguished he had committed a folly which was like to cost him his life tomorrow other follies had he committed in his twentyfive yearsfor he was not quite the babe that blake had represented him although he certainly looked nothing like his age but tonight he had contrived to set the crown to all he had good cause to blame himself and to curse the miscalculation that had emboldened him to launch himself upon a course of insult against this wilding whom he hated with all the currish and resentful hatred of the worthless for the man of parts  but there was more than hate in the affront that he had offered there was calculationto an even greater extent than we have seen it happened that through his own fault young richard was all but penniless the pious nonconformist soul of sir geoffrey luptonthe wealthy uncle from whom he had had great expectationshad been so stirred to anger by richards vicious and besotted ways that he had left every guinea that was his every perch of land and every brick of edifice to richards halfsister ruth at present things were not so bad for the worthless boy ruth worshipped him he was a sacred charge to her from their dead father who knowing the stoutness of her soul and the feebleness of richards had in dying imposed on her the care and guidance of her graceless brother but ruth in all things strong was weak with richard out of her very fondness for him to what she had he might help himself and thus it was that things were not so bad with him at present but when richards calculating mind came to give thought to the future he found that this occasioned him some care rich ladies even when they do not happen to be equipped in addition with ruths winsome beauty and endearing nature are not wont to go unmarried it would have pleased richard best to have had her remain a spinster but he well knew that this was a matter in which she might have a voice of her own and it behoved him betimes to take wise measures where possible husbands were concerned  the first that came in a suitors obvious panoply was anthony wilding of zoyland chase and richard watched his advent with foreboding wildings was a personality to dazzle any woman despiteperhaps even because ofthe reputation for wildness that clung to him that he was known as wild wilding to the countryside is true but it were unfairas richard knewto attach to this too much importance for the adoption of so obvious an alliteration the rude country minds needed but a slight encouragement   from the first it looked as if ruth might favour him and richards fears assumed more definite shape if wilding married herand he was a bold masterful fellow who usually accomplished what he aimed ather fortune and estate must cease to be a pleasant pasture land for bovine richard the boy thought at first of making terms with wilding the idea was old it had come to him when first he had counted the chances of his sisters marrying but he found himself hesitating to lay his proposal before mr wilding and whilst he hesitated mr wilding made obvious headway still richard dared not do it there was a something in wildings eye that cried him danger thus in the end since he could not attempt a compromise with this fine fellow the only course remaining was that of direct antagonismthat is to say direct as richard understood directness slander was the weapon he used in that secret duel the countryside was well stocked with stories of mr wildings many indiscretions i do not wish to suggest that these were unfounded still the countryside cajoled by its primitive sense of humour into that alliteration i have mentioned found that having given this dog its bad name it was under the obligation of keeping up his reputation so it exaggerated richard exaggerating those exaggerations in his turn had some details as interesting and unsavoury as they were in the main untrue to lay before his sister  now established love it is well known thrives wondrously on slander the robust growth of a maids feelings for her accepted suitor is but further strengthened by malign representations of his character she seizes with joy the chance of affording proof of her great loyalty and defies the world and its evil to convince her that the man to whom she has given her trust is not most worthy of it not so however with the first timid bud of incipient interest slander nips it like a frost in deadliness it is second only to ridicule  ruth westmacott lent an ear to her brothers stories incredulous only until she remembered vague hints she had caught from this person and from that whose meaning was now made clear by what richard told her which incidentally they served to corroborate corroboration too did the tale of infamy receive from the friendship that prevailed between mr wilding and nick trenchard the old neerdowell who in his timeas everybody knewhad come so low despite his gentle birth as to have been one of a company of strolling players had mr wilding been other than she now learnt he was he would surely not cherish an attachment for a person so utterly unworthy clearly they were birds of a plumage  and so her maiden purity outraged at the thought that she had been in danger of lending a willing ear to the wooing of such a man she had crushed this love which she blushed to think was on the point of throwing out roots to fasten on her soul and was sedulous thereafter in manifesting the aversion which she accounted it her duty to foster for mr wilding  richard had watched and smiled in secret taking pride in the cunning way he had wrought this changethat cunning which so often is given to the stupid by way of compensation for the intelligence that has been withheld them  and now what time discountenanced wilding fumed and fretted all in vain sir rowland blake fresh from london and in full flight from his creditors flashed like a comet into the bridgwater heavens he dazzled the eyes and might have had for the asking the heart and hand of diana hortonruths cousin her heart indeed he had without the asking for diana fell straightway in love with him and showed it just as he showed that he was not without response to her affection there were some tender passages between them but blake for all his fine exterior was a beggar and diana far from rich and so he rode his feelings with a hard grip upon the reins and then in an evil hour for poor diana young westmacott had taken him to lupton house and sir rowland had his first glimpse of ruth his first knowledge of her fortune he went down before ruths eyes like a man of heart he went down more lowly still before her possessions like a man of greed and poor diana might console herself with whom she could  her brother watched him appraised him and thought that in this broken gamester he had a man after his own heart a man who would be ready enough for such a bargain as richard had in mind ready enough to sell what rags might be left him of his honour so that he came by the wherewithal to mend his broken fortunes  the twain made terms they haggled like any pair of traders out of jewry but in the end it was settledby a bond duly engrossed and sealedthat on the day that sir rowland married ruth he should make over to her brother certain values that amounted to perhaps a quarter of her possessions there was no cause to think that ruth would be greatly opposed to thisnot that that consideration would have weighed with richard  but now that all essentials were so satisfactorily determined a vexation was offered westmacott by the circumstance that his sister seemed nowise taken with sir rowland she suffered him because he was her brothers friend on that account she even honoured him with some measure of her own friendship but to no greater intimacy did her manner promise to admit him and meanwhile mr wilding persisted in the face of all rebuffs under his smiling mask he hid the smart of the wounds she dealt him until it almost seemed to him that from loving her he had come to hate her  it had been well for richard had he left things as they were and waited whether blake prospered or not leastways it was clear that wilding would not prosper and that for the season was all that need have mattered to young richard  but in his cups that night he had thought in some dim way to precipitate matters by affronting mr wilding secure as i have shown in his belief that wilding would perish sooner than raise a finger against ruths brother and his drunken astuteness it seemed had been to his mind as a piece of bottle glass to the sight distorting the image viewed through it  with some such bitter reflection rode he home to his sleepless couch some part of those dark hours he spent in bitter reviling of wilding of himself and even of his sister whom he blamed for this awful situation into which he had tumbled at other times he wept from selfpity and sheer fright  once indeed he imagined that he saw light that he saw a way out of the peril that hemmed him in his mind turned for a moment in the direction that trenchard had feared it might he bethought him of his association with the monmouth causeinto which he had been beguiled by the sordid hope of gainand of wildings important share in that same business he was even moved to rise and ride that very night for exeter to betray to albemarle the cause itself so that he might have wilding laid by the heels but if trenchard had been right in having little faith in richards loyalty he had it seems in fearing treachery made the mistake of giving richard credit for more courage than was his endowment for when sitting up in bed fired by his inspiration young westmacott came to consider the questions the lordlieutenant of devon would be likely to ask him he reflected that the answers he must return would so incriminate himself that he would be risking his own neck in the betrayal he flung himself down again with a curse and a groan and thought no more of the salvation that might lie for him that way  the morning of that last day of may found him pale and limp and all atremble he rose betimes and dressed but stirred not from his chamber till in the garden under his window he heard his sisters voice and that of diana horton joined anon by a mans deeper tones which he recognized with a start as blakes what did the baronet here so early assuredly it must concern the impending duel richard knew no mawkishness on the score of eavesdropping he stole to his window and lent an ear but the voices were receding and to his vexation he caught nothing of what was said he wondered how soon vallancey would come and for what hour the encounter had been appointed vallancey had remained behind at scoresby hall last night to make the necessary arrangements with trenchard who was to act for mr wilding  now it chanced that trenchard and wilding had businessbusiness of monmouthsto transact in taunton that morning business which might not be delayed there were odd rumours afloat in the west persistent rumours which had come fast upon the heels of the news of argyles landing in scotland rumours which maintained that monmouth himself was coming over from holland these tales wilding and his associates had ignored the duke they knew was to spend the summer in retreat in sweden with it was alleged the lady henrietta wentworth to bear him company and in the mean time his trusted agents were to pave the way for his coming in the following spring of late the lack of direct news from the duke had been a source of mystification to his friends in the west and now suddenly the information went abroadit was something more than rumour this timethat a letter of the greatest importance had been intercepted from whom that letter proceeded or to whom it was addressed could not yet be discovered but it seemed clear that it was connected with the monmouth cause and it behoved mr wilding to discover what he could with this intent he rode with trenchard that sunday morning to taunton hoping that at the red lion innthat meetingplace of dissentershe might cull reliable information  it was in consequence of this that the meeting with richard westmacott was not to take place until the evening and therefore vallancey came not to lupton house as early as richard thought he should expect him blake howevermore no doubt out of a selfish fear of losing a valued ally in the winning of ruths hand than out of any excessive concern for richard himselfhad risen early and hastened to lupton house in the hope which he recognized as all but forlorn of yet being able to avert the disaster he foresaw for richard  peering over the orchard wall as he rode by he caught a glimpse through an opening between the trees of ruth herself and diana on the lawn beyond there was a wicket gate that stood unlatched and availing himself of this sir rowland tethered his horse in the lane and threading his way briskly through the orchard came suddenly upon the girls their laughter reached him as he advanced and told him they could know nothing yet of richards danger  on his abrupt and unexpected apparition diana paled and ruth flushed slightly whereupon sir rowland might have bethought him had he been booklearned of the axiom amour qui rougit fleurette amour qui plit drame du coeur  he doffed his hat and bowed his fair ringlets tumbling forward till they hid his face which was exceeding grave  ruth gave him good morning pleasantly you london folk are earlier risers than we are led to think she added  twill be the change of air makes sir rowland matutinal said diana making a gallant recovery from her agitation  i vow said he that i had grown matutinal earlier had i known what here awaited me  awaited you quoth diana and tossed her head archly disdainful la sir rowland your modesty will be the death of you archness became this lady of the sunny hair tiptilted nose and complexion that outvied the appleblossoms she was shorter by a halfhead than her darker cousin and made up in sprightliness what she lacked of ruths gentle dignity the pair were foils each setting off the graces of the other  i protest i am foolish answered blake a shade discomfited but i want not for excuse i have it in the matter that brings me here so solemn was his air so sober his voice that both girls felt a premonition of the untoward message that he bore it was ruth who asked him to explain himself  will you walk ladies said blake and waved the hand that still held his hat riverwards adown the sloping lawn they moved away together sir rowland pacing between his love of yesterday and his love of today pressed with questions from both he shaded his eyes to look at the river dazzling in the morning sunlight that came over polden hill and standing thus he unburdened himself at last  my news concerns richard andmr wilding they looked at him miss westmacotts fine level brows were knit he paused to ask as if suddenly observing his absence is richard not yet risen  not yet said ruth and waited for him to proceed  it does credit to his courage that he should sleep late on such a day said blake and was pleased with the adroitness wherewith he broke the news he quarrelled last night with anthony wilding  ruths hand went to her bosom fear stared at blake from out her eyes blue as the heavens overhead a grey shade overcast the usual warm pallor of her face  with mr wilding she cried that man and though she said no more her eyes implored him to go on and tell her what more there might be he did so and he spared not wilding the task indeed was one to which he applied himself with a certain zest whatever might be the outcome of the affair there was no denying that he was by way of reaping profit from it by the final overthrow of an acknowledged rival and when he told her how richard had flung his wine in wildings face when wilding stood to toast her a faint flush crept to her cheeks  richard did well said she i am proud of him  the words pleased sir rowland vastly but he reckoned without diana miss hortons mind was illumined by her knowledge of herself in the light of that she saw precisely what capital this talebearer sought to make the occasion might not be without its opportunities for her and to begin with it was no part of her intention that wilding should be thus maligned and finally driven from the lists of rivalry with blake upon wilding indeed and his notorious masterfulness did she found what hopes she still entertained of winning back sir rowland  surely said she you are a little hard on mr wilding you speak as if he were the first gallant that ever toasted ladys eyes  i am no lady of his diana ruth reminded her with a faint show of heat  diana shrugged her shoulders you may not love him but you cant ordain that he shall not love you you are very harsh i think to me it rather seems that richard acted like a boor  but mistress cried sir rowland half out of countenance and stifling his vexation in these matters it all depends upon the manner  why yes she agreed and whatever mr wildings manner if i know him at all it would be nothing but respectful to the last degree  my own conception of respect said he is not to bandy a ladys name about a company of revellers  bethink you though you said just now it all depended on the manner she rejoined sir rowland shrugged and turned half from her to her listening cousin when all is said poor diana appearsdespite her cunningto have been shortsighted aiming at a defined advantage in the game she played she either ignored or held too lightly the concomitant disadvantage of vexing blake  it were perhaps best to tell us the exact words he used sir rowland she suggested that for ourselves we may judge how far he lacked respect  what signify the words cried blake now almost out of temper i dont recall them it is the air with which he pledged mistress westmacott  ah yesthe manner quoth diana irritatingly well let that be richard threw his wine in mr wildings face what followed then what said mr wilding  sir rowland remembered what mr wilding had said and bethought him that it were impolitic in him to repeat it at the same time not having looked for this crossquestioning he was all unprepared with any likely answer he hesitated until ruth echoed dianas question  tell us sir rowland she begged him what mr wilding said  being forced to say something and being by nature slowwitted and sluggish of invention sir rowland was compelled to his unspeakable chagrin to fall back upon the truth  is not that proof cried diana in triumph mr wilding was reluctant to quarrel with richard he was even ready to swallow such an affront as that thinking it might be offered him under a misconception of his meaning he plainly professed the respect that filled him for mistress westmacott and yet and yet sir rowland you tell us that he lacked respect  madam cried blake turning crimson that matters nothing it was not the place or time to introduce your cousin s name  you think sir rowland put in ruth her air grave judicial almost that richard behaved well  as i would like to behave myself as i would have a son of mine behave on the like occasion blake protested but we waste words he cried i did not come to defend richard nor just to bear you this untoward news i came to consult with you in the hope that we might find some way to avert this peril from your brother  what way is possible asked ruth and sighed i would not i would not have richard a coward  would you prefer him dead asked blake sadly grave  sooner than cravenyes ruth answered him very white  there is no question of that was blakes rejoinder the question is that wilding said last night that he would kill the boy and what wilding says he does out of the affection that i bear richard is born my anxiety to save him despite himself it is in this that i come to seek your aid or offer mine allied we might accomplish what singly neither of us could  he had at once the reward of his cunning speech ruth held out her hands you are a good friend sir rowland she said with a pale smile and pale too was the smile with which diana watched them no more than ruth did she suspect the sincerity of blakes protestations  i am proud you should account me that said the baronet taking ruths hands and holding them a moment and i would that i could prove myself your friend in this to some good purpose believe me if wilding would consent that i might take your brothers place i would gladly do so  it was a safe boast knowing as he did that wilding would consent to no such thing but it earned him a glance of greater kindliness from ruthwho began to think that hitherto perhaps she had done him some injusticeand a look of greater admiration from diana who saw in him her beauideal of the gallant lover  i would not have you endanger yourself so said ruth  it might said blake his blue eyes very fierce be no great danger after all and then dismissing that part of the subject as if like a brave man the notion of being thought boastful were unpleasant he passed on to the discussion of ways and means by which the coming duel might be averted but when they came to grips with facts it seemed that sir rowland had as little idea of what might be done as had the ladies true he began by making the obvious suggestion that richard should tender wilding a full apology that indeed was the only door of escape and blake shrewdly suspected that what the boy had been unwilling to do last nightpartly through wine and partly through the fear of looking fearful in the eyes of lord gervase scoresbys guestshe might be willing enough to do today sober and upon reflection for the rest blake was as far from suspecting mr wildings peculiar frame of mind as had richard been last night this his words showed  i am satisfied said he that if richard were to go today to wilding and express his regret for a thing done in the heat of wine wilding would be forced to accept it as satisfaction and none would think that it did other than reflect credit upon richard  are you very sure of that asked ruth her tone dubious her glance hopefully anxious  what else is to be thought  but put in diana shrewdly it were an admission of richards that he had done wrong  no less he agreed and ruth caught her breath in fresh dismay  and yet you have said that he did as you would have a son of yours do diana reminded him  and i maintain it answered blake his wits worked slowly ever it was for ruth to reveal the flaw to him  do you not understand then she asked him sadly that such an admission on richards part would amount to a liea lie uttered to save himself from an encounter the worst form of lie a lie of cowardice surely sir rowland your kindly anxiety for his life outruns your anxiety for his honour  diana having accomplished her task hung her head in silence pondering  sir rowland was routed utterly he glanced from one to the other of his companions and grew afraid that hethe town gallantmight come to look foolish in the eyes of these country ladies he protested again his love for richard and increased ruths terror by his mention of wildings swordsmanship but when all was said he saw that he had best retreat ere he spoiled the good effect which he hoped his solicitude had created and so he spoke of seeking counsel with lord gervase scoresby and took his leave promising to return by noon    chapter iii diana schemes   notwithstanding the brave face ruth westmacott had kept during his presence when he departed sir rowland left behind him a distress amounting almost to anguish in her mind yet though she might suffer there was no weakness in ruths nature she knew how to endure diana bearing richard not a tenth of the affection his sister consecrated to him was alarmed for him besides her own interests urged the averting of this encounter and so she held in accents almost tearful that something must be done to save him  this too appeared to be richards own view when presentlywithin a few minutes of blakes departurehe came to join them they watched his approach in silence and both notedthough with different eyes and different feelingsthe pallor of his fair face the dark lines under his colourless eyes his condition was abject and his manners never of the bestfor there was much of the spoiled child about richardwere clearly suffering from it  he stood before his sister and his cousin moving his eyes shiftily from one to the other rubbing his hands nervously together  your precious friend sir rowland has been here said he and it was not clear from his manner which of them he addressed not a doubt but he will have brought you the news he seemed to sneer  ruth advanced towards him her face grave her sweet eyes full of pitying concern she placed a hand upon his sleeve my poor richard she began but he shook off her kindly touch laughing angrilya mere cackle of irritability  odso he interrupted her it is a thought late for this mock kindliness  diana in the background arched her brows then with a shrug turned aside and seated herself on the stone seat by which they had been standing ruth shrank back as if her brother had struck her  richard she cried and searched his livid face with her eyes richard  he read a question in the interjection and he answered it had you known any real care any true concern for me you had not given cause for this affair he chid her peevishly  what are you saying she cried and it occurred to her at last that richard was afraid he was a coward she felt as she would faint  i am saying said he hunching his shoulders and shivering as he spoke yet his glance unable to meet hers that it is your fault that i am like to get my throat cut before sunset  my fault she murmured the slope of lawn seemed to wave and swim about her my fault  the fault of your wanton ways he accused her harshly you have so played fast and loose with this fellow wilding that he makes free of your name in my very presence and puts upon me the need to get myself killed by him to save the family honour  he would have said more in this strain but something in her glance gave him pause there fell a silence from the distance came the melodious pealing of church bells high overhead a lark was pouring out its song in the lane at the orchard end rang the beat of trotting hoofs it was diana who spoke presently just indignation stirred her and when stirred she knew no pity set no limits to her speech  i think indeed said she her voice crisp and merciless that the family honour will best be saved if mr wilding kills you it is in danger while you live you are a coward richard  diana he thunderedhe could be mighty brave with womenwhilst ruth clutched her arm to restrain her  but she continued undeterred you are a cowarda pitiful coward she told him consult your mirror it will tell you what a palsied thing you are that you should dare so speak to ruth  dont ruth begged her turning   aye growled richard she had best be silent  diana rose to battle her cheeks crimson it asks a braver man than you to compel my obedience she told him la she fumed ill swear that had mr wilding overheard what you have said to your sister you would have little to fear from his sword a cane would be the weapon hed use on you  richards pale eyes flamed malevolently a violent rage possessed him and flooded out his fear for nothing can so goad a man as an offensive truth ruth approached him again again she took him by the arm seeking to soothe his overtroubled spirit but again he shook her off and then to save the situation came a servant from the house so lost in anger was all richards sense of decency that the mere supervention of the man would not have been enough to have silenced him could he have found adequate words in which to answer mistress horton but even as he racked his mind the footmans voice broke the silence and the words the fellow uttered did what his presence alone might not have sufficed to do  mr vallancey is asking for you sir he announced   richard started vallancey he had come at last and his coming was connected with the impending duel the thought was paralyzing to young westmacott the flush of anger faded from his face its leaden hue returned and he shivered as with cold at last he mastered himself sufficiently to ask  where is he jasper  in the library sir replied the servant shall i bring him hither  yesno he answered i will come to him he turned his back upon the ladies paused a moment still irresolute then as by an effort he followed the servant across the lawn and vanished through the ivied porch  as he went diana flew to her cousin her shallow nature was touched with transient pity my poor ruth she murmured soothingly and set her arm about the others waist there was a gleam of tears in the eyes ruth turned upon her together they came to the granite seat and sank to it side by side fronting the placid river there ruth her elbows on her knees cradled her chin in her hands and with a sigh of misery stared straight before her  it was untrue she said at last what richard said of me was untrue  why yes diana snapped contemptuous the only truth is that richard is afraid  ruth shivered ah no she pleadedshe knew how true was the impeachment dont say it diana  it matters little that i say it snorted diana impatiently it is a truth proclaimed by the first glance at him  he is in poor health perhaps said ruth seeking miserably to excuse him  aye said diana hes suffering from an aguethe result of a lack of courage that he should so have spoken to you give me patience heaven  ruth crimsoned again at the memory of his words a wave of indignation swept through her gentle soul but was gone at once leaving an ineffable sadness in its room what was to be done she turned to diana for counsel but diana was still whipping up her scorn  if he goes out to meet mr wilding hell shame himself and every man and woman that bears the name of westmacott said she and struck a new fear with that into the heart of ruth  he must not go she answered passionately he must not meet him  diana flashed her a sidelong glance and if he doesnt will things be mended she inquired will it save his honour to have mr wilding come and cane him  hed not do that said ruth  not if you asked himno was dianas sharp retort and she caught her breath on the last word of it for just then the devil dropped the seed of a suggestion into the fertile soil of her lovesick soul  diana ruth exclaimed in reproof turning to confront her cousin but dianas mind started upon its scheming journey was now travelling fast out of that devils seed there sprang with amazing rapidity a treelike growth throwing out branches putting forth leaves bearing alreadyin her fancybloom and fruit  why not quoth she after a breathing space and her voice was gentle her tone innocent beyond compare why should you not ask him ruth frowned perplexed and thoughtful and now diana turned to her with the lively eye of one into whose mind has leapt a sudden inspiration ruth she exclaimed why indeed should you not ask him to forgo this duel  how how could i faltered ruth  hed not deny you you know hed not  i do not know it answered ruth but if i did how could i ask it  were i richards sister and had i his life and honour at heart as you have id not ask how if richard goes to that encounter he loses both rememberunless between this and then he undergoes some change were i in your place id straight to wilding  to him mused ruth sitting up how could i go to him  go to him yes diana insisted go to him at oncewhile there is yet time  ruth rose and moved away a step or two towards the water deep in thought diana watched her furtively and slyly the rapid rise and fall of her maiden breast betraying the agitation that filled her as she waitedlike a gamesterfor the turn of the card that would show her whether she had won or lost for she saw clearly how ruth might be so compromised that there was something more than a chance that diana would no longer have cause to account her cousin a barrier between herself and blake  i could not go alone said ruth and her tone was that of one still battling with a notion that is repugnant  why if that is all said diana then ill go with you  i cant i cant consider the humiliation  consider richard rather the fair temptress made answer eagerly be sure that mr wilding will save you all humiliation hell not deny you at a word from you i know what answer he will make he will refuse to push the matter forwardacknowledge himself in the wrong do whatever you may ask him he can do it none will question his courage it has been proved too often she rose and came to ruth she set her arm about her waist again and poured shrewd persuasion over her cousin s indecision tonight youll thank me for this thought she assured her why do you pause are you so selfish as to think more of the little humiliation that may await you than of richards life and honour  no no ruth protested feebly  what then is richard to go out and slay his honour by a show of fear before he is slain himself by the man he has insulted  ill go said ruth now that the resolve was taken she was brisk impatient come diana let jerry saddle for us well ride to zoyland chase at once  they went without a word to richard who was still closeted with vallancey and riding forth they crossed the river and took the road that skirting sedgemoor runs south to weston zoyland they rode with little said until they came to the point where the road branches on the left throwing out an arm across the moor towards chedzoy a mile or so short of zoyland chase here diana reined in with a sharp gasp of pain ruth checked and cried to know what ailed her  it is the sun i think muttered diana her hand to her brow i am sick and giddy and she slipped a thought heavily to the ground in an instant ruth had dismounted and was beside her diana was pale which lent colour to her complaint for ruth was not to know that the pallor sprang from her agitation in wondering whether the ruse she attempted would succeed or not  a short stonesthrow from where they had halted stood a cottage back from the road in a little plot of ground the property of a kindly old woman known to both there diana expressed the wish to rest awhile and thither they took their way ruth leading both horses and supporting her faltering cousin the dame was all solicitude diana was led into her parlour and what could be done was done her corsage was loosened water drawn from the well and brought her to drink and bathe her brow  she sat back languidly her head lolling sideways against one of the wings of the great chair and languidly assured them she would be better soon if she were but allowed to rest awhile ruth drew up a stool to sit beside her for all that her soul fretted at this delay what if in consequence she should reach zoyland chase too lateto find that mr wilding had gone forth already but even as she was about to sit it seemed that the same thought had of a sudden come to diana the girl leaned forward thrustingas if by an effortsome of her faintness from her  do not wait for me ruth she begged  i must child  you must not the other insisted think what it may meanrichards life perhaps no no ruth dear go on go on to zoyland ill follow you in a few minutes  ill wait for you said ruth with firmness  at that diana rose and in rising staggered then well push on at once she gasped as if speech itself were an excruciating effort  but you are in no case to stand said ruth sit diana sit  either you go on alone or i go with you but go at once you must at any moment mr wilding may go forth and your chance is lost ill not have richards blood upon my head  ruth wrung her hands in her dismay confronted by a parlous choice consent to dianas accompanying her in this condition she could not ride on alone to mr wildings house was hardly to be thought of and yet if she delayed she was endangering richards life by the very strength of her nature she was caught in the mesh of dianas scheme she saw that her hesitation was unworthy this was no ordinary cause no ordinary occasion it was a time for heroic measures she must ride on nor could she consent to take diana  and so in the end she went having seen her cousin settled again in the high chair and took with her dianas feeble assurances that she would follow her in a few moments as soon as her faintness passed    chapter iv terms of surrender   mr wilding rode at dawn with mr trenchard madam announced old walters the butler at zoyland chase old and familiar servant though he was he kept from his countenance all manifestation of the deep surprise occasioned him by the advent of mistress westmacott unescorted  he rode at dawn faltered ruth and for a moment she stood irresolute afraid and pondering in the shade of the great pillared porch then she took heart again if he rode at dawn it was not in quest of richard that he went since it had been near eleven oclock when she had left bridgwater he must have gone on other business first and doubtless before he went to the encounter he would be returning home said he at what hour he would return she asked  he bade us expect him by noon madam  this gave confirmation to her thoughts it wanted more than half an hour to noon already then he may return at any moment said she  at any moment madam was the grave reply  she took her resolve i will wait she announced to the mans increasing if undisplayed astonishment let my horse be seen to  he bowed his obedience and she followed hima slender graceful figure in her dovecoloured ridinghabit laced with silveracross the stoneflagged vestibule through the cool gloom of the great hall into the spacious library of which he held the door  mistress horton is following me she informed the butler will you bring her to me when she comes  bowing again in silent acquiescence the whitehaired servant closed the door and left her she stood in the centre of the great room drawing off her ridinggloves perturbed and frightened beyond all reason at finding herself for the first time under mr wildings roof he was most handsomely housed his grandfather who had travelled in italy had built the chase upon the severe and noble lines which there he had learnt to admire and he had embellished its interior too with many treasures of art which with that intent he had there collected  she dropped her whip and gloves on to a table and sank into a chair to wait her heart fluttering in her throat time passed and in the silence of the great house her anxiety was gradually quieted until at last through the long window that stood open came faintly wafted to her on the soft breeze of that june morning the sound of a church clock at weston zoyland chiming twelve she rose with a start bethinking her suddenly of diana and wondering why she had not yet arrived was the childs indisposition graver than she had led ruth to suppose she crossed to the windows and stood there drumming impatiently upon the pane her eyes straying idly over the sweep of elmfringed lawns towards the river gleaming silvery here and there between the trees in the distance  suddenly she caught a sound of hoofs was this diana she sped to the other window the one that stood open and now she heard the crunch of gravel and the champ of bits and the sound of more than two pairs of hoofs she caught a glimpse of mr wilding and mr trenchard  she felt the colour flying from her cheeks again her heart fluttered in her throat and it was in vain that with her hand she sought to repress the heaving of her breast she was afraid her every instinct bade her slip through the window at which she stood and run from zoyland chase and then she thought of richard and his danger and she seemed to gather courage from the reflection of her purpose in this house  mens voices reached hera laugh the harsh cawing of nick trenchard  a lady she heard him cry ods heart tony is this a time for trafficking with doxies she crimsoned an instant at the coarse word and set her teeth only to pale again the next the voices were lowered so that she heard not what was said one sharp exclamation she recognized to be in wildings voice but caught not the word he uttered there followed a pause and she stirred uneasily waiting then came swift steps and jangling spurs across the hall the door opened suddenly and mr wilding in a scarlet ridingcoat his boots white with dust stood bowing to her from the threshold  your servant mistress westmacott she heard him murmur my house is deeply honoured  she dropped him a halfcurtsy pale and tonguetied he turned to deliver hat and whip and gloves to walters who had followed him then closed the door and came forward into the room  you will forgive that i present myself thus before you he said in apology for his dusty raiment but i bethought me you might be in haste and walters tells me that already have you waited nigh upon an hour will you not sit madam and he advanced a chair his long white face was set like a mask but his dark slanting eyes devoured her he guessed the reason of her visit she who had humbled him who had driven him to the very borders of despair was now to be humbled and to despair before him under the impassive face his soul exulted fiercely  she disregarded the chair he proffered my visit has no doubt surprised you she began tremulous and hesitating  i faith no he answered quietly the cause after all is not very far to seek you are come on richards behalf  not on richards she answered on my own and now that the ice was broken the suspense of waiting over she found the tide of her courage flowing fast this encounter must not take place mr wilding she informed him  he raised his eyebrowsfine and level as her ownhis thin lips smiled never so faintly it is i think said he for richard to prevent it the chance was his last night it shall be his again when we meet if he will express regret he left his sentence there in truth he mocked her though she guessed it not  you mean said she that if he makes apology  what else what other way remains  she shook her head and if pale her face was resolute her glance steady  that is impossible she told him last nightas i have the storyhe might have done it without shame today it is too late to tender his apology on the ground would be to proclaim himself a coward  mr wilding pursed his lips and shifted his position it is difficult perhaps said he but not impossible  it is impossible she insisted firmly  ill not quarrel with you for a word he answered mighty agreeable call it impossible if you will admit however that it is all i can suggest you will do me the justice i am sure to see that in expressing my willingness to accept your brothers expressions of regret i am proving myself once more your very obedient servant but that it is you who ask itand whose desires are my commandsi should let no man go unpunished for an insult such as your brother put upon me  she winced at his words at the bow with which he had professed himself once more her servant  it is no clemency that you offer him she said you leave him a choice between death and dishonour  he has wilding reminded her the chance of combat  she flung back her head impatiently i think you mock me said she  he looked at her keenly will you tell me plainly madam he begged what you would have me do  she flushed under his gaze and the flush told him what he sought to learn there was of course another way and she had thought of it but she lackedas well she might all things consideredthe courage to propose it she had come to mr wilding in the vague hope that he himself would choose the heroic part and he to punish for her scorn of him this woman whom he loved to hatingpoint was resolved that she herself must beg it of him whether having so far compelled her he would grant her prayer or not was something he could not just then himself have told you she bowed her head in silence and wilding that faint smile half friendliness half mockery hovering ever on his lips turned aside and moved softly towards the window her eyes veiled behind the long lashes of their drooping lids followed him furtively she felt that she hated him in very truth she marked the upright elegance of his figure the easy grace of his movements the fine aristocratic mould of the aquiline face which she beheld in profile and she hated him the more for these outward favours that must commend him to no lack of women he was too masterful he made her realize too keenly her own weakness and that of richard she felt that just now he controlled the vice that held her fasther affection for her brother and because of that she hated him the more you see mistress westmacott said he his shoulder to her his tone sweet to the point of sadness that there is nothing else she stood her eyes following the pattern of the parquetry her foot unconsciously tracing it her courage ebbed and she had no answer for him after a pause he spoke again still without turning if that was not enough to suit your endsand though he spoke in a tone of everincreasing sadness there glinted through it the faintest ray of mockeryi marvel you should have come to zoylandto compromise yourself to so little purpose  she raised a startled face com compromise myself she echoed oh it was a cry of indignation  what else quoth he and turned abruptly to confront her  mistress horton was was with me she panted her voice quivering as on the brink of tears  tis unfortunate you should have separated he condoled  but but mr wilding i i trusted to your honour i accounted you a gentleman surely surely sir you will not let it be known that i came to you you will keep my secret  secret said he his eyebrows raised tis already the talk of the servants hall by tomorrow twill be the gossip of bridgwater  air failed her her blue eyes fixed him in horror out of her stricken face not a word had she wherewith to answer him  the sight of her thus affected him oddly his passion for her surged up aroused by pity for her plight and awakened in him a sense of his brutality a faint flush stirred in his cheeks he stepped quickly to her and caught her hand she let it lie cold and inert within his nervous grasp  ruth ruth he cried and his voice was for once unsteady give it no thought i love you ruth if youll but heed that no breath of scandal can hurt you  she swallowed hard as how she asked mechanically  he bowed low over her handso low that his face was hidden from her  if you will do me the honour to become my wife he began but got no further for she snatched away her hand her cheeks crimsoning her eyes aflame with indignation he stepped back crimsoning too she had dashed the gentleness from his mood he was angered now and tigerish  oh she panted it is to affront me is this the time or place  he cropped her flow of indignant speech ere it was well begun he caught her in his arms and held her tight and so sudden was the act so firm his grip that she had not the thought or force to struggle  all time is loves time all places are loves place he told her his face close to her own and of all time and places the present ever preferable to the wisefor life is uncertain and short at best i bring you worship and you answer me with scorn but i shall prevail and you shall come to love me in very spite of your own self  she threw back her head away from his as far as the bonds he had cast about her would allow air air she panted feebly  oh you shall have air enough anon he answered with a halfstrangled laugh his passion mounting ever hark you nowhark you for richards sake since youll not listen for my own nor yours there is another course by which i can save both richards life and honour you know it and you counted upon my generosity to suggest it but you overlooked the thing on which you should have counted you overlooked my love count upon that my ruth and richard shall have naught to fear count upon that and when we meet this evening richard and i it is i who will tender the apology i who will admit that i was wrong to introduce your name into that company last night and that what richard did was a just and welldeserved punishment upon me this will i do if youll but count upon my love  she looked up at him fearfully yet with flutterings of hope what ist you mean she asked him faintly  that if youll promise to be my wife  your wife she interrupted him she struggled to free herself released one arm and struck him in the face let me go you coward  he was answered his arms melted from her he fell back a pace very white and even trembling the fire all gone from his eye which was now turned dull and deadly  so be it he said and strode to the bellrope ill not offend again i had not offended nowhe continued in the voice of one offering an explanation cold and formalbut that when first i came into your life you seemed to bid me welcome his fingers closed upon the crimson bellcord she guessed his purpose  wait she gasped and put forth her hand he paused the rope in his his eye kindling anew you you mean to kill richard now she asked him  a swift lifting of his brows was his only answer he tugged the cord from the distance the peal of the bell reached them faintly  oh wait wait she begged her hands pressed against her cheeks he stood impassiblehatefully impassible  if i were to consent to this how how soon he understood the unfinished question interest warmed his face again he took a step towards her but by a gesture she seemed to beg him come no nearer  if you will promise to marry me within the week richard shall have no cause to fear either for his life or his honour at my hands  she seemed now to be recovering her calm very well she said her voice singularly steady let that be a bargain between us spare richards life and honourboth rememberand on sunday next for all her courage her voice quavered and faltered she dared add no more lest it should break altogether  mr wilding drew a deep breath again he would have advanced ruth he cried and some repentance smote him some shame shook him in his purpose at that moment it was in his mind to capitulate unconditionally to tell her that richard should have naught to fear from him and yet that she should go free as the winds her gesture checked him it was so eloquent of aversion he paused in his advance stifled his better feelings and turned once more relentless the door opened and old walters stood awaiting his commands  mistress westmacott is leaving he informed his servant and bowed low and formally in farewell before her she passed out without another word the old butler following and presently through the door that remained open came trenchard in quest of mr wilding who stood bemused  nick sauntered in his left eye almost hidden by the rakish cock of his hat one hand tucked away under the skirts of his plumcoloured coat the other supporting the stem of a long clay pipe at which he was pulling thoughtfully the pipe and he were all but inseparable indeed the year before in london he had given appalling scandal by appearing with it in the mall and had there remained him any character to lose he must assuredly have lost it then  he observed his friend through narrowing eyeshe had small eyes very blue and very bright in which there usually abode a roguish gleam  my sight anthony said he reminds me that i am growing old i wonder did it mislead me on the score of your visitor  the lady who left said wilding with a touch of severity will be mistress wilding by this day senight  trenchard took the pipe from his lips audibly blew out a cloud of smoke and stared at his friend body o me quoth he is this a time for marryingwith these rumours of monmouths coming over  wilding made an impatient gesture i thought to have convinced you they are idle said he and flung himself into a chair at his writingtable  nick came over and perched himself upon the tables edge one leg swinging in the air and what of this matter of the intercepted letter from london to our taunton friends  i cant tell you but of this i am sure his grace is incapable of anything so rash certain is it that hell not stir until battiscomb returns to holland and battiscomb is still in cheshire sounding the dukes friends  yet were i you i should not marry just at present  wilding smiled if you were me youd never marry at all  faith no said trenchard id as soon play at hotcockles or parsonhaslosthiscloak tis a mort more amusing and the sooner done with    chapter v the encounter   ruth wesmacott rode back like one in a dream with vague and hazy notions of what she saw or did so overwrought was she by the interview from which she came her mind so obsessed by it that never a thought had she for diana and her indisposition until she arrived home to find her cousin there before her diana was in tears called up by the reproaches of her mother lady hortonthe relict of that fine soldier sir cholmondeley horton of taunton  the girl had arrived at lupton house a halfhour ahead of miss westmacott and upon her arrival she had expressed surprise either feigned or real at finding ruth still absent detecting the alarm that diana was careful to throw into her voice and manner her mother questioned her and elicited the story of her faintness and of ruths having ridden on alone to mr wildings so outraged was lady horton that for once in a way this woman usually so meek and easeloving was roused to an energy and anger with her daughter and her niece that threatened to remove diana at once from the pernicious atmosphere of lupton house and carry her home to taunton ruth found her still at her remonstrances arrived indeed in time for her share of them  i have been sore mistaken in you ruth the dame reproached her i can scarce believe it of you i have held you up as an example to diana for the discretion and wisdom of your conduct and you do this you go alone to mr wildings houseto mr wildings of all men  it was no time for ordinary measures said ruth but she spoke without any of the heat of one who defends her conduct she was the slyly watchful diana observed very white and tired it was no time to think of nice conduct there was richard to be saved  and was it worth ruining yourself to do that quoth lady horton her colour high  ruining myself echoed ruth and she smiled never so weary a smile i have indeed done that though not in the way you mean  mother and daughter eyed her mystified your good name is blasted said her aunt unless so be that mr wilding is proposing to make you his wife it was a sneer the good woman could not in her indignation repress  that is what mr wilding has done me the honour to propose ruth answered bitterly and left them gaping we are to be married this day senight  a dead silence followed the calm announcement then diana rose at the misery the anguish that could impress so strange and white a look on ruths winsome face she was smitten with remorse her incipient satisfaction dashed this was her work the fruit of her scheming but it had gone further than she had foreseen and for all that no result could better harmonize with her own ambitions and desires for the momentunder the first shock of that announcementshe felt guilty and grew afraid  ruth she cried her voice a whisper of stupefaction oh i wish i had come with you  but you couldnt you were faint and thenrecalling what had passedher mind was filled with sudden concern for diana even amid her own sore troubles are you quite yourself again diana she inquired  diana answered almost fiercely i am quite well and then with a change to wistfulness she added oh i would i had come with you  matters had been no different ruth assured her it was a bargain mr wilding drove it was the price i had to pay for richards life and honour she swallowed hard and let her hands fall limply to her sides where is richard she inquired  it was her aunt who answered her he went forth half an hour agone with mr vallancey and sir rowland  sir rowland had returned then she looked up quickly  yes answered diana but he had achieved nothing by his visit to lord gervase his lordship would not intervene he swore he hoped the cub would be flayed alive by wilding those were his lordships words as sir rowland repeated them sir rowland is in sore distress for richard he has gone with them to the meeting  at least he has no longer cause for his distress said miss westmacott with her bitter smile and sank as one exhausted to a chair lady horton moved to comfort her her motherliness all aroused for this motherless girl usually so wise and strong and seemingly wiser and stronger than ever in this thing that lady horton had deemed a weakness and a folly  meanwhile richard and his two friends were on their way to the moors across the river to the encounter with mr wilding but before they had got him to ride forth vallancey had had occasion to regret that he stood committed to a share in this quarrel for he came to know richard as he really was he had found him in an abject state white and trembling his cowards fancy anticipating a hundred times a minute the death he was anon to die  vallancey had hailed him cheerily  the day is yours dick he had cried when richard entered the library where he awaited him wild wilding has ridden to taunton this morning and is to be back by noon odsbud dicktwenty miles and more in the saddle before coming on the ground heard you ever of the like madness hell be stiff as a broomhandlean easy victim  richard listened stared and finding vallanceys eyes fixed steadily upon him attempted a smile and achieved a horrible grimace  what ails you man cried his second and caught him by the wrist he felt the quiver of the others limb stab me quoth he you are in no case to fight what the plague ails you  i am none so well this morning answered richard feebly lord gervases claret he added passing a hand across his brow  lord gervases claret echoed vallancey in horror as at some outrageous blasphemy frontignac at ten shillings the bottle he exclaimed  still claret never does lie easy on my stomach richard explained intent upon blaming lord gervase s winesince he could think of nothing elsefor his condition  vallancey looked at him shrewdly my cock said he if youre to fight well have to mend your temper he took it upon himself to ring the bell and to order up two bottles of canary and one of brandy if he was to get his man to the ground at alland young vallancey had a due sense of his responsibilities in that connectionit would be well to supply richard with something to replace the courage that had oozed out overnight young richard never loath to fortify himself proved amenable enough to the stiffly laced canary that his friend set before him then to divert his mind vallancey with that rash freedom that had made the whole of somerset know him for a rebel set himself to talk of the protestant duke and his right to the crown of england  he was still at his talk richard listening moodily what time he was slowly but surely befuddling himself when sir rowlandreturning from scoresby hallcame to bring the news of his lack of success richard hailed him noisily and bade him ring for another glass adding with a burst of oaths some appalling threats of how anon he should serve anthony wilding his wits drowned in the stiff liquor vallancey had pressed upon him he seemed of a sudden to have grown as fierce and bloodthirsty as any scourer that ever terrorized the watch  blake listened to him and grunted body o me swore the town gallant if thats the humour youre going out to fight in ill trouble you for the eight guineas i won from you at primero yesterday before you start  richard reared himself by the help of the table and stood a thought unsteadily his glance laboriously striving to engage blakes  damn me quoth he your want of faith dishgraces meand t shgraces you shalt ha the guineas when were backand not before  hum quoth blake to whom eight guineas were a consideration in these bankrupt days and if you dont come back at all upon whom am i to draw  the suggestion sank through dicks halffuddled senses and the scare it gave him was reflected on his face  damn you blake swore vallancey between his teeth is that a decent way to talk to a man who is going out never heed him dick let him wait for his dirty guineas till we return  thirty guineas hiccoughed richard it was only eight anyhowwaitll ive sli the gullet ofs mr wilding he checked on a thought that suddenly occurred to him he turned to vallancey with a ludicrous solemnity sbud he swore s a scurvy trick im playing the duke s treason to himtreason no less and he smote the table with his open hand  whats that quoth blake so sharply his eyes so suddenly alert that vallancey made haste to cover up his fellow rebels indiscretion  its the brandyandcanary makes him dream said he with a laugh and rising as he spoke he announced that it was high time they should set out thus he brought about a bustle that drove the dukes business from richards mind and left blake without a pretext to pursue his quest for information but the mischief was done and blakes suspicions were awake he bethought him now of dark hints that richard had let fall to vallancey in the past few days and of hints less dark with which vallanceywho was a careless fellow at ordinary timeshad answered and now this mention of the duke and of treason to himto what duke could it refer but monmouth  blake was well aware of the wild tales that were going round and he began to wonder now was aught really afoot and was his good friend westmacott in it  if there was he bethought him that the knowledge might be of value and it might help to float once more his shipwrecked fortunes the haste with which vallancey had proffered a frivolous explanation of richards words the bustle with which upon the instant he swept richard and sir rowland from the house to get to horse and ride out to bridgwater were in themselves circumstances that went to heighten those suspicions of sir rowlands but lacking all opportunity for investigation at the moment he deemed it wisest to say no more just then lest he should betray his watchfulness  they were the first to arrive upon the groundan open space on the borders of sedgemoor in the shelter of polden hill but they had not long to wait before wilding and trenchard rode up attended by a groom their arrival had an oddly sobering effect upon young westmacott for which mr vallancey was thankful for during their ride he had begun to fear that he had carried too far the business of equipping his principal with artificial valour  trenchard came forward to offer vallancey the courteous suggestion that mr wildings servant should charge himself with the care of the horses of mr westmacotts party if this would be a convenience to them vallancey thanked him and accepted the offer and thus the groominstructed by trenchardled the five horses some distance from the spot  it now became a matter of making preparation and leaving richard to divest himself of such garments as he might deem cumbrous vallancey went forward to consult with trenchard upon the choice of ground at that same moment mr wilding lounged forward flicking the grass with his whip in an absent manner   mr vallancey he began when trenchard turned to interrupt him  you can leave it safely to me tony he growled but there is something i wish to say nick answered mr wilding his manner mild by your leave then and he turned again to valiancey will you be so good as to call mr westmacott hither  vallancey stared for what purpose sir he asked  for my purpose answered mr wilding sweetly it is no longer my wish to engage with mr westmacott  anthony cried trenchard and in his amazement forgot to swear  i propose added mr wilding to relieve mr westmacott of the necessity of fighting  vallancey in his heart thought this might be pleasant news for his principal still he did not quite see how the end was to be attained and said so  you shall be enlightened if you will do as i request wilding insisted and vallancey with a lift of the brows a snort and a shrug turned away to comply  do you mean quoth trenchard bursting with indignation that you will let live a man who has struck you  wilding took his friend affectionately by the arm it is a whim of mine said he do you think nick that it is more than i can afford to indulge  i say not so was the ready answer but  i thought youd not said mr wilding interrupting and if any doeswhy i shall be glad to prove it upon him that he lies he laughed and trenchard vexed though he was was forced to laugh with him then nick set himself to urge the thing that last night had plagued his mind that this richard might prove a danger to the cause that in the dukes interest if not to safeguard his own person from some vindictive betrayal wilding would be better advised in imposing a reliable silence upon him  but why vindictive mr wilding remonstrated rather must he have cause for gratitude  mr trenchard laughed short and contemptuously there is said he no rancour more bitter than that of the mean man who has offended you and whom you have spared i beg youll ponder it he lowered his voice as he ended his admonition for vallancey and westmacott were coming up followed by sir rowland blake  richard although his courage had been sinking lower and lower in a measure as he had grown more and more sober with the approach of the moment for engaging came forward now with a firm step and an arrogant mien for vallancey had given him more than a hint of what was toward his heart had leapt not only at the deliverance that was promised him but out of satisfaction at the reflection of how accurately last night he had gauged what mr wilding would endure it had dismayed him then as we have seen that this man who he thought must stomach any affront from him out of consideration for his sister should have ended by calling him to account he concluded now that upon reflection wilding had seen his error and was prepared to make amends that he might extricate himself from an impossible situation and richard blamed himself for having overlooked this inevitable solution and given way to idle panic  vallancey and blake watching him and the sudden metamorphosis that was wrought in him despised him heartily and yet were gladfor the sake of their association with himthat things were as they were  mr westmacott said wilding quietly his eyes steadily set upon richards own arrogant gaze his lips smiling a little i am here not to fight but to apologize  richards sneer was audible to all oh he was gathering courage fast now that there no longer was the need for it it urged him to lengths of daring possible only to a fool  if you can take a blow mr wilding said he offensively that is your own affair  and his friends gasped at his temerity and trembled for him not knowing what grounds he had for counting himself unassailable  just so said mr wilding as meek and humble as a nun and trenchard who had expected something very different from him swore aloud and with some circumstance of oaths the fact is continued mr wilding that what i did last night i did in the heat of wine and i am sorry for it i recognize that this quarrel is of my provoking that it was unwarrantable in me to introduce the name of mistress westmacott no matter how respectfully and that in doing so i gave mr westmacott ample grounds for offence for that i beg his pardon and i venture to hope that this matter need go no further  vallancey and blake were speechless in astonishment trenchard livid with fury westmacott moved a step or two forward a swagger unmistakable in his gait his netherlip thrust out in a sneer  why said he his voice mighty disdainful if mr wilding apologizes the matter hardly can go further he conveyed such a suggestion of regret at this that trenchard bounded forward stung to speech  but if mr westmacotts disappointment threatens to overwhelm him he snapped very tartly i am his humble servant and he may call upon me to see that hes not robbed of the exercise he came to take  mr wilding set a restraining hand upon trenchards arm  westmacott turned to him the sneer however gone from his face  i have no quarrel with you sir said he with an uneasy assumption of dignity  its a want that may be soon supplied answered trenchard briskly and as he afterwards confessed had not wilding checked him at that moment he had thrown his hat in richards face  it was vallancey who saved the situation cursing in his heart the bearing of his principal  mr wilding said he this is very handsome in you you are of the happy few who may tender such an apology without reflection upon your courage  mr wilding made him a leg very elegantly you are vastly kind sir said he  you have given mr westmacott the fullest satisfaction and it is with an increased respect for youif that were possiblethat i acknowledge it on my friends behalf  you are sir a very mirror of the elegancies said mr wilding and vallancey wondered was he being laughed at whether he was or not he conceived that he had done the only seemly thing he had made handsome acknowledgment of a handsome apology stung to it by the currishness of richard  and there the matter ended despite trenchards burning eagerness to carry it himself to a different consummation wilding prevailed upon him and withdrew him from the field but as they rode back to zoyland chase the old rake was bitter in his inveighings against wildings folly and weakness  i pray heaven he kept repeating that it may not come to cost you dear  have done said mr wilding a trifle out of patience could i wed the sister having slain the brother  and trenchard understanding at last accounted himself a numskull that he had not understood before but he none the less deemed it a pity richard had been spared    chapter vi the champion   as vainglorious was richard westmacotts retreat from the field of unstricken battle as his advance upon it had been inglorious he spoke with confidence now of the narrow escape that wilding had had at his hands of the things he would have done to wilding had not that gentleman grown wise in time sir rowland who had seen little of richards earlier stricken condition was in a measure imposed upon by his blustering tone and manner not so vallancey who remembered the steps he had been forced to take to bolster up the young mans courage sufficiently to admit of his being brought to the encounter richard so disgusted him that he felt if he did not quit his company soon he would be quarrelling with him himself so congratulating him in a caustic manner that richard did not relish upon the happy termination of the affair vallancey took his leave of him and blake at the crossroads pleading business with lord gervase and left them to proceed without him to bridgwater  blake whose suspicions of some secret matter to which vallancey and richard were wedded had been earlier excited by westmacotts indiscretions was full of sly questions now touching the business which might be taking vallancey to scoresby but richard was too full of the subject of the fear he had instilled into wilding to afford his companion much satisfaction on any other score thus they came to lupton house and as richard swaggered down the lawn into the presence of the ladiesruth and her aunt were occupying the stone bench diana the circular seat about the great oak in the centre of the lawnhe was a very different person from the pale limp creature they had beheld there some few hours earlier loud and offensive was he now in selflaudation and so indifferent to all else that he left unobserved the little smile half wistful half scornful that visited his sisters lips when he sneeringly told how mr wilding had chosen that better part of valour which discretion is alleged to be  it needed diana who blinded by no sisterly affection saw him exactly as he was and despised him accordingly to enlighten him it may also be that in doing so at once she had ends of her own to serve for sir rowland was still of the company  mr wilding afraid she cried her voice so charged with derision that it inclined to shrillness la richard mr wilding was never afraid of any man  faith said rowland although his acquaintance with mr wilding was slight and recent it is what i should think he does not look like a man familiar with fear  richard struck something of an attitude his fair face flushed his pale eyes glittering he took a blow said he and sneered  there may have been reasons diana suggested darkly and sir rowlands eyes narrowed at the hint  again he recalled the words richard had let fall that afternoon wilding and he were fellow workers in some secret business and richard had said that the encounter was treason to that same business whatever it might be and of what it might be sir rowland had grounds upon which to found at least a guess had perhaps wilding acted upon some similar feelings in avoiding the duel he wondered and when richard dismissed dianas challenge with a fatuous laugh it was blake who took it up       you speak maam said he as if you knew that there were reasons and knew too what those reasons might be  diana looked at ruth as if for guidance before replying but ruth sat calm and seemingly impassive looking straight before her she was indeed indifferent how much diana said for in any case the matter could not remain a secret long lady horton silent too and listening looked a question at her daughter  and so after a pause i know both said diana her eyes straying again to ruth and a subtler man than blake would have read that glance and understood that this same reason which he sought so diligently sat there before him  richard indeed catching that sly look of his cousins checked his assurance and stood frowning cogitating then quite suddenly his voice harsh  what do you mean diana he inquired  diana shrugged and turned her shoulder to him you had best ask ruth said she which was an answer more or less plain to both the men  they stood at gaze richard looking a thought foolish blake frowning his heavy lip caught in his strong white teeth  ruth turned to her brother with an almost piteous attempt at a smile she sought to spare him pain by excluding from her manner all suggestion that things were other than she desired  i am betrothed to mr wilding said she  sir rowland made a sudden forward movement drew a deep breath and as suddenly stood still richard looked at his sister as she were mad and raving then he laughed between unbelief and derision  it is a jest said he but his accents lacked conviction  it is the truth ruth assured him quietly   the truth his brow darkened ominouslystupendously for one so fair the truth you baggage he began and stopped in very fury  she saw that she must tell him all  i promised to wed mr wilding this day senight so that he saved your life and honour she told him calmly and added it was a bargain that we drove richard continued to stare at her the thing she told him was too big to be swallowed at a mouthful he was absorbing it by slow degrees  so now said diana you know the sacrifice your sister has made to save you and when you speak of the apology mr wilding tendered you perhaps youll speak of it in a tone less loud  but the sarcasm was no longer needed already poor richard was very humble his makebelieve spirit all snuffed out he observed at last how pale and set was his sisters face and he realized something of the sacrifice she had made never in all his life was richard so near to lapsing from the love of himself never so near to forgetting his own interests and preferring those of ruth lady horton sat silent her heart fluttering with dismay and perplexity heaven had not equipped her with a spirit capable of dealing with a situation such as this blake stood in make believe stolidity dissembling his infinite chagrin and the stormy emotions warring within him for some signs of which diana watched his countenance in vain  you shall not do it cried richard suddenly he came forward and laid his hand on his sisters shoulder his voice was almost gentle ruth you shall not do this for me you must not  by heaven no snapped blake before she could reply you are right richard mistress westmacott must not be the scapegoat she shall not play the part of iphigenia       but ruth smiled wistfully as she answered him with a question where is the help for it  richard knew where the help for it lay and for oncefor just a momenthe contemplated danger and even death with equanimity  i can take up this quarrel again he announced i can compel mr wilding to meet me  ruths eyes looking up at him kindled with pride and admiration it warmed her heart to hear him speak thus to have this assurance that he was anything but the coward she had been so disloyal as to deem him no doubt she had been right in saying that it was his health was the cause of the palsy he had displayed that morning he was a little wild she knew inclined to sit overlate at the bottle with advancing manhood she had no doubt he would overcome this boyish failing meanwhile it was this foolish habitnothing morethat undermined the inherent firmness of his nature and it comforted her generous soul to have this proof that he was full worthy of the sacrifice she was making for him diana watched him in some surprise and never doubted but that his offer was impulsive and that he would regret it when his ardour had had time to cool  it were idle said ruth at lastnot that she quite believed it but that it was allimportant to her that richard should not be imperilled mr wilding will prefer the bargain he has made       no doubt growled blake but he shall be forced to unmake it he advanced and bowed low before her madam said he will you grant me leave to champion your cause and remove this troublesome mr wilding from your path  dianas eyes narrowed her cheeks paled partly from fear for blake partly from vexation at the promptness of an offer that afforded a fresh and so eloquent proof of the trend of his affections  ruth smiled at him in a very friendly manner but gently shook her head  i thank you sir said she but it were more than i could permit this has become a family affair  there was in her tone something which despite its friendliness gave sir rowland his dismissal he was not at best a man of keen sensibilities yet even so he could not mistake the request to withdraw that was implicit in her tone and manner he took his leave registering however in his heart a vow that he would have his way with wilding thus must hethrough her gratitudeassuredly come to have his way with ruth  diana rose and turned to her mother come she said well speed sir rowland ruth and richard would perhaps prefer to remain alone  ruth thanked her with her eyes richard standing beside his sister with bent head and moody gaze did not appear to have heard thus he remained until he and his halfsister were alone together then he flung himself wearily into the seat beside her and took her hand  ruth he faltered ruth  she stroked his hand her honest intelligent eyes bent upon him in a look of pityand to indulge this pity for him she forgot how much herself she needed pity  take it not so to heart she urged him her voice low and crooning as that of a mother to her babe take it not so to heart richard i should have married some day and after all it may well be that mr wilding will make me as good a husband as another i do believe she added her only intent to comfort richard that he loves me and if he loves me surely he will prove kind  he flung himself back with an exclamation of angry pain he was white to the lips his eyes bloodshot it must not beit shall not beill not endure it he cried hoarsely  richard dear she began recapturing the hand he had snatched from hers in his gust of emotion       he rose abruptly interrupting her ill go to wilding now he cried his voice resolute he shall cancel this bargain he had no right to make he shall take up his quarrel with me where it stood before you went to him  no no richard you must not she urged him frightened rising too and clinging to his arm  i will he answered at the worst he can but kill me but at least you shall not be sacrificed  sit here richard she bade him there is something you have not considered if you die if mr wilding kills you she paused  he looked at her and at the repetition of the fate that would probably await him if he persevered in the course he threatened his purely emotional courage again began to fail him a look of fear crept gradually into his face to take the room of the resolution that had been stamped upon it but a moment since  he swallowed hard what then he asked his voice harsh and obeying her command and the pressure on his hand he resumed his seat beside her  she spoke now at length and very gravely dwelling upon the circumstance that he was the head of the family the last westmacott of his line pointing out to him the importance of his existence the insignificance of her own she was but a girl a thing of small account where the perpetuation of a family was at issue after all she must marry somebody some day she repeated and perhaps she had been foolish in attaching too much importance to the tales she had heard of mr wilding probably he was no worse than other men and after all he was a gentleman of wealth and position such a man as half the women in somerset might be proud to own for husband  her arguments and his weaknesshis returning cowardice which made him lend an ear to those same argumentsprevailed with him at least they convinced him that he was far too important a person to risk his life in this quarrel upon which he had so rashly entered he did not say that he was convinced but he said that he would give the matter thought hinting that perhaps some other way might present itself of cancelling the bargain she had made they had a week before them and in any case he promised readily in answer to her entreatiesfor her faith in him was a thing unquenchablethat he would do nothing without taking counsel with her  meanwhile diana had escorted sir rowland to the main gates of lupton house in front of which miss westmacotts groom was walking his horse awaiting him  sir rowland said she at parting your chivalry makes you take this matter too deeply to heart you overlook the possibility that my cousin may have good reason for not desiring your interference  he looked keenly at this little lady to whom a month ago he had been on the point of offering marriage his coxcombry might readily have suggested to him that she was in love with him but that his conscience and inclinations urged him to assure himself that this was not the case  what shall that mean madam he asked her  diana hesitated what i have said is plain she answered and it was clear that she held something back  sir rowland flattered himself upon the shrewdness with which he read her never dreaming that he had but read just what she intended he should  he stood squarely before her shaking his great head not plain enough for me he said then his tone softened to one of prayer tell me he besought her  i cant i cant she cried in feigned distress it were too disloyal  he frowned he caught her arm and pressed it his heart sick with jealous alarm what do you mean tell me tell me mistress horton  diana lowered her eyes youll not betray me she stipulated   why no tell me  she flushed delicately i am disloyal to ruth she said and yet i am loath to see you cozened  cozened quoth he hoarsely his egregious vanity in arms cozened  diana explained ruth was at his house today said she closeted alone with him for an hour or more  impossible he cried  where else was the bargain made she asked and shattered his last doubt you know that mr wilding has not been here  yet blake struggled heroically against conviction  she went to intercede for richard he protested miss horton looked up at him and under her glance sir rowland felt that he was a man of unfathomable ignorance then she turned aside her eyes and shrugged her shoulders very eloquently you are a man of the world sir rowland you cannot seriously suppose that any maid would so imperil her good name in any cause  darker grew his florid countenance his bulging eyes looked troubled and perplexed  you mean that she loves him he said between question and assertion  diana pursed her lips you shall draw your own inference quoth she  he breathed heavily and squared his broad shoulders as one who braces himself for battle against an element stronger than himself  but her talk of sacrifice he cried  diana laughed and again he was stung by her contempt of his perceptions her brother is set against her marrying him said she here was her chance is it not very plain  doubt stared from his eyes why do you tell me this  because i esteem you sir rowland she answered very gently i would not have you meddle in a matter you cannot mend  which i am not desired to mend say rather he replied with heavy sarcasm she would not have my interference he laughed angrily i think you are right mistress diana he said and i think that more than ever is there the need to kill this mr wilding  he took his departure abruptly leaving her scared at the mischief she had made for him in seeking to save him from it and that very night he sought out wilding  but wilding was from home again under its placid surface the west country was in a ferment and if hitherto mr wilding had disdained the insistent rumours of monmouths coming his assurance was shaken now by proof that the government itself was stirring for four companies of foot and a troop of horse had been that day ordered to taunton by the deputylieutenant wilding was gone with trenchard to white lackington in a vain hope that there he might find news to confirm his persisting unbelief in any such rashness as was alleged on monmouths part  so blake was forced to wait but his purpose suffered nothing by delay  returning on the morrow he found mr wilding at table with nick trenchard and he cut short the greetings of both men he flung his hata black castor trimmed with a black featherrudely among the dishes on the board  i have come to ask you mr wilding said he to be so good as to tell me the colour of that hat  mr wilding raised one eyebrow and looked aslant at trenchard whose weatherbeaten face was suddenly agrin with stupefaction  i could not said mr wilding deny an answer to a question set so courteously he looked up into blakes flushed and scowling face with the sweetest and most innocent of smiles youll no doubt disagree with me said he but i love to meet a man halfway your hat sir is as white as virgin snow  blakes slow wits were disconcerted for a moment then he smiled viciously you mistake mr wilding said he my hat is black  mr wilding looked more attentively at the object in dispute he was in a trifling mood and the stupidity of this runagate debtor afforded him opportunities to indulge it why true said he now that i come to look i perceive that it is indeed black  and again was sir rowland disconcerted still he pursued the lesson he had taught himself  you are mistaken again said he that hat is green  indeed quoth mr wilding like one surprised and he turned to trenchard who was enjoying himself what is your own opinion of it nick  thus appealed to trenchards reply was prompt why since you ask me said he my opinion is that its a noisome thing not meet for a gentlemans table and he took it up and threw it through the window  sir rowland was entirely put out of countenance here was a deliberate shifting of the quarrel he had come to pick which left him all at sea it was his duty to himself to take offence at mr trenchards action but that was not the business on which he had come he became angry  blister me he cried must i sweep the cloth from the table before youll understand me  if you were to do anything so unmannerly i should have you flung out of the house said mr wilding and it would distress me so to treat a person of your station and quality the hat shall serve your purpose although mr trenchards concern for my table has removed it our memories will supply its absence what colour did you say it was  i said it was green answered blake quite ready to keep to the point  nay i am sure you were wrong said wilding with a grave air although i admit that since it is your own hat you should be the best judge of its colour i am nevertheless of opinion that it is black  and if i were to say that it is white asked blake feeling mighty ridiculous  why in that case you would be confirming my first impression of it answered wilding and trenchard let fly a burst of laughter at sight of the baronets furious and bewildered countenance and since we are agreed on that continued mr wilding imperturbable i hope youll join us at supper  ill be damned roared blake if ever i sit at table of yours sir  ah said mr wilding regretfully now you become offensive  i mean to be said blake  you astonish me  you lie i dont sir rowland answered him in triumph he had got it out at last  mr wilding sat back in his chair and looked at him his face inexpressibly shocked  will you of your own accord deprive us of your company sir rowland he wondered or shall mr trenchard throw you after your hat  do you mean gasped the other that youll ask no satisfaction of me  not so mr trenchard shall wait upon your friends tomorrow and i hope youll afford us then as felicitous entertainment as you do now  sir rowland snorted and turning on his heel made for the door  give you a good night sir rowland mr wilding called after him walters you rascal light sir rowland to the door  poor blake went home deeply vexed but it was no more than the beginning of his humiliation at mr wildings handsfor what can be more humiliating to a quarrelseeking man than to have his enemy refuse to treat him seriously he and mr wilding met next morning and before noon the tale of it had run through bridgwater that wild wilding was at his tricks again it made a pretty story how twice he had disarmed and each time spared the london beau who still insistedeach time more furiouslyupon renewing the encounter till mr wilding had been forced to run him through the swordarm and thus put him out of all case of continuing it was a story that heaped ridicule upon sir rowland and did credit to mr wilding  richard heard it and trembled enraged and impotent ruth heard it and was stirred despite herself to a feeling of gratitude towards wilding for the patience and toleration he had displayed  there for a while the matter rested and the days passed slowly but sir rowlands naturemean at bottomwas spurred to find him some other way of wiping out the score that lay twixt him and mr wilding a score mightily increased by the shame that mr wilding had put upon him in that encounter from whichwhatever the issuehe had looked to cull great credit in ruths eyes  he had been thinking constantly of the incautious words that richard had let fall thinking of them in conjunction with the startling rumours that were now the talk of the whole countryside he laid two and two together and the four he found them make afforded him some hope then he realizedas he might have realized before had he been shrewderthat richards mood was one that made him ripe for any villainy he thought that he was much in error if a treachery existed so black that richard would quail before it if it but afforded him the means of ridding himself and the world of mr wilding he was considering how best to approach the subject when it happened that one night when richard sat at play with him in his own lodging the boy grew talkative through excess of wine it happened naturally enough that richard sought an ally in blake just as blake sought an ally in richard indeed their fortunesso far as ruth was concernedwere bound up together the baronet saw that richard halffuddled was ripe for any confidences that might aim at the destruction of his enemy he questioned him adroitly and drew from him the story of the rising that was being planned and of the share that mr wildingone of the duke of monmouths chief movementmenbore in the business that was toward  when towards midnight richard westmacott went home he left in sir rowlands hands an instrument which the latter accounted potential not only for the destruction of anthony wilding but perhaps also for laying the foundations to the building of his own fortunes anew    chapter vii the nuptials of ruth westmacott   here was sir rowland blake in high fettle at knowing himself armed with a portentous weapon for the destruction of anthony wilding upon closer inspection of it however he came to realizeas richard had realized earlierthat it was doubleedged and that the wielding of it must be fraught with as much danger for richard as for their common enemy for to betray mr wilding and the plot would scarce be possible without betraying young westmacott and that was unthinkable since to ruin richarda thing he would have done with a light heart so far as richard was himself concernedwould be to ruin his own hopes of winning ruth  therefore during the days that followed sir rowland was forced to fret in idleness what time his wound was healing but if his arm was invalided his eyes and ears were sound and he remained watchful for an opportunity to apply the knowledge he had gained richard mentioned the subject no more so that blake almost came to wonder whether the boy remembered what in his cups he had betrayed  meanwhile mr wilding moved serene and smiling on his way daily there were great armfuls of flowers deposited at lupton househis lovers offering to his mistressand no day went by but that some richer gift accompanied them now it was a collar of brilliants anon a rope of pearls again a priceless ring that had been mr wildings mothers ruth received with reluctance these pledges of his undesired affection it were idle to reject them considering that she was to marry him yet it hurt her sorely to retain them on her side she made no dispositions for the marriage but went about her daily tasks as though she were to remain a maid at lupton house for a time as yet indefinite  in diana wilding hadthough he was far from guessing itan entirely exceptional ally lady horton too was favourably disposed towards him a foolish worldly woman who never probed beneath lifes surface nor indeed dreamed that anything existed in life beyond that to which her five senses testified she was content placidly to contemplate the advantages that must accrue to her niece from this alliance  and so mother and daughter in mr wildings absence pleaded his cause with his refractory brideelect but they pleaded it to little real purpose something perhaps they achieved in that ruth grew more or less resigned to the fate that awaited her by repeating to herself the arguments she had employed to richardthat she must wed some day and that mr wilding would prove no doubt as good a husband as anothershe came in a measure to believe them  richard meanwhile appeared to avoid her lacking the courage to adopt the heroic measures which at first he had promised yet had he grace enough to take shame at his inaction but if he was idle so far as mr wilding was concerned there was no lack of work for him in other connections the clouds of war were gathering in that summer sky and about to loose the storm gestating in them upon that fair country of the west and young westmacott committed as he stood to the duke of monmouths party was forced to take his share in the surreptitious bustle that was toward he was away two days in that week having been summoned to a meeting of the leading gentlemen of the party at white lackington where he was forced into the unwelcome company of his future brotherinlaw to meet with courteous deferential treatment from that imperturbable gentleman  wilding indeed seemed to have forgotten that any quarrel had ever existed between them for the rest he came and went supremely calm as if he were and knew himself to be most welcome at lupton house thrice in the course of that week of waiting he rode over from zoyland chase to pay his duty to mistress westmacott and ruth was persuaded on each occasion by her aunt and cousin to receive him indeed how could she well refuse  his manner was ever all that could be desired gallant affectionate deferential he was in word and look and tone ruths most obedient servant had she been less prejudiced she must have admired the admirable restraint with which he kept all exultation from his manner for after all it is difficult to force a victory as he had forced his and not to triumph       it is to be feared that during that week he neglected a good deal of his duty to the duke leaving trenchard to supply his place and undertake tasks of a seditious nature that should have been his own  at heart however in spite of the stories current and the militia at taunton wilding remained convincedas did most of the other leading partisans of the protestant causethat no such madness as this premature landing could be in contemplation by the duke besides were it so they must unfailingly have definite word of it and they had none  trenchard was less assured but wilding laughed at the old rakes forebodings and serenely went about the business of his marriage  on the eve of the wedding he paid ruth his last visit in the quality of a lover and was received by her in the garden he found her looking paler than her wont and there was a cloud of sadness on her brow a haunting sadness in her eyes it touched him to the soul and for a moment he wavered in his purpose he stood beside hershe seated on the old lichened seatand a silence fell between them during which mr wildings conscience wrestled with his stronger passion it was his habit to be glib talking incessantly what time he was in her company and seeing to it that his talk was shallow and touched at nothing belonging to the deeps of human life thus was it perhaps that this sudden and enduring silence affected her most oddly it was as if she had absorbed some notion of what was passing in his mind she looked up suddenly into his face so white and so composed their eyes met and he stooped to her suddenly his long brown ringlets tumbling forward she feared his kiss yet never moved staring up with fixed dilated eyes as if fascinated by his dark brooding gaze he paused hovering above her upturned face as hovers the hawk above the dove  child he said at last and his voice was soft and winning from very sadness child why do you fear me  the truth of it went home to her she feared him she feared the strength that lay behind that calm she feared the masterfulness of his wild but inscrutably hidden nature she was afraid to surrender to such a man as this afraid that in the hot crucible of his love her own nature would be dissolved transmuted and rendered part of his yet though the truth was now made plain to her she thrust it from her  i do not fear you said she and her voice at least rang fearlessly  do you hate me then he asked her glance grew troubled and fell away from his it sought the calm of the river gleaming golden in the sunset there was a pause wilding sighed heavily and straightened himself from his bending posture  you should not have sought thus to compel me she said presently  i own it he answered a thought bitterly i own it yet what hope had i but in compulsion she returned him no answer you see he said with increasing bitterness you see that had i not seized the chance that was mine to win you by compulsion i had not won you at all  it might said she have been better so for both of us  better for neither he replied ah think it not in time i swear you shall not think it for you shall come to love me ruth he added with a note of such assurance that she turned to meet again his gaze he answered the wordless question of her eyes there is said he no love of man for woman so that the man be not wholly unworthy so that his passion be sincere and strong that can fail in time to arouse response she smiled a little pitiful smile of unbelief were i a boy he rejoined his earnestness vibrating now in a voice that was usually so calm and level offering you protestations of a callow worship you might have cause to doubt me but i am a man rutha tried and haply a sinful man alasa man who needs you and who will have you at all costs  at all costs she echoed and her lip took on a curl and you call this egotism by the name of love no doubt you are right she continued with an irony that stung him for love it islove of yourself  and is not all love of another founded upon the love of self he asked her startling her with a question that revealed to her clearsighted mind a truth undreamed of when some dayplease heaveni come to find favour in your eyes and you come to love me what will it mean but that you have come to find me necessary to yourself and to your happiness would you deny me now your love if you felt that you had need of mine i love you because i love myself you say i grant it you but youll confess that if you do not love me yet it is for the same reason and that when you do come to love me the reason will be still the same  you are very sure that i shall come to love you said she shifting womanlike the ground of argument now that she found insecure the place on which at first she had taken her stand  were i not think you i should compel you to the church tomorrow  she trembled at his calm assurance it was as if she almost feared that what he said might come to pass  since you bear such faith in your heart said she were it not nobler more generous that you should set yourself to win me first and wed me afterwards  it is the course i should myself prefer he answered quietly but it is a course denied me i was viewed here with disfavour almost denied your house what chance had i whilst i might not come near you whilst your mind was poisoned against me by the idle vicious prattle that goes round and round the countryside increasing ever in bulk from constant repetition  do you say that these tales are groundless she asked with a sudden lifting of the eyes a sudden keen eagerness that did not escape him  i would to god i could he cried since from your manner i see that would improve me in your sight but there is just sufficient truth in them to forbid me as i am i hope a gentleman from giving them a full denial yet in what am i worse than my fellows are you of those who think a husband should come to them as one whose youth has been the youth of cloistered nun heaven knows i am not one to draw parallels twixt myself and any other yet you compel me whilst you deny me you receive this fellow blakea london nightscourer a broken gamester who has given his creditors legbail and who woos you that with your fortune he may close the doors of the debtors gaol thats open to receive him  this is unworthy in you she exclaimed her tone indignantso indignant that he experienced his first pang of jealousy  it would be were i his rival he answered quietly but i am not i have saved you from becoming the prey of such as he by forcing you to marry me  that i may become the prey of such as you instead was her retort  he looked at her a moment smiling sadly then with pardonable selfesteem when we think of what manner of man it was with whom he now compared himself surely said he it is better to become the prey of the lion than the jackal  to the victim it can matter little she answered and he saw the tears gathering in her eyes  compassion moved him it rose in arms to batter down his will and in a weaker man had triumphed mr wilding bent his knee and went down beside her  i swear he said impassionedly that as my wife you shall never count yourself a victim you shall be honoured by all men but by none more deeply than by him who will ever strive to be worthy of the proud title of your husband he took her hand and kissed it reverentially he rose and looked at her tomorrow he said and bowing low before her went his way leaving her with emotions that found their vent in tears but defied her maiden mind to understand them  the morrow came her weddingdaya sunny day of early june and ruthassisted by diana and lady hortonmade preparation for her marriage as spirited women have made preparation for the scaffold determined to show the world a brave serene exterior the sacrifice was necessary for richards sake that was a thing long since determined yet it would have been some comfort to her to have had richard at her side it would have lent her strength to have had his kiss of thanks for the holocaust which for him she was making of all that a woman holds most dear and sacred but richard was awayhe had been absent since yesterday and none could tell her where he tarried  with lady horton and diana she took her way to saint marys church at noon and there she found mr wildingvery fine in a suit of skyblue satin laced with silverawaiting her and with him was old lord gervase scoresby his friend and cousin the very incarnation of benignity and ruddy health  for a wonder nick trenchard was not at mr wildings side but nick had definitely refused to be of the party emphasizing his refusal by certain choice reflections wholly unflattering to the married state  some idlers of the town were the only witnessesand little did they guess the extent of the tragedy they were witnessing there was no music and the ceremony was brief and soon at an end the only touch of joy of festiveness was that afforded by the choice blooms with which mr wilding had smothered nave and choir and altarrails their perfume hung heavy as incense in the temple  who giveth this woman to be married to this man droned the parsons voice and wilding smiled defiantly a smile which seemed to answer him no man i have taken her for myself  lord gervase stood forward as her sponsor and as in a dream ruth felt her hand lying in mr wildings cool firm grasp  the ecclesiastics voice droned on his voice hanging like the hum of some great insect upon the scented air it was accomplished and they were welded each to the other until death should part them  down the festooned nave she came on his arm her step unfaltering her face calm black misery in her heart behind followed her aunt and cousin and lord gervase on mr wildings aquiline face a pale smile glimmered like a beam of moonlight upon tranquil waters and it abode there until they reached the porch and were suddenly confronted by nick trenchard red of face for once perspiring excited and duststained from head to foot  he had arrived that very instant and urged by the fearful news that brought him he had come resolved to pluck wilding from the altar be the ceremony done or not but in that he reckoned without mr wildingfor he should have known him better than to have hoped to succeed he stepped forward now and gripped him with his dusty glove by the sleeve of his shimmering bridegrooms coat his voice came harsh with excitement and smouldering rage  a word with you anthony   mr wilding turned placidly to regard him what now he asked his brides hand retained in the crook of his elbow  treachery snapped trenchard in a whisper hell and damnation step aside man  mr wilding turned to lord gervase and begged of him to take charge of mistress wilding i deplore this interruption he told her no whit ruffled by what he had heard but i shall rejoin you soon meanwhile his lordship will do the honours for me this last he said with his eyes moving to lady horton and her daughter  lord gervase in some surprise but overruled by his cousins calm took the bride on his arm and led her from the churchyard to the waiting carriage to this he handed her and after her her aunt and cousin then mounting himself they drove away leaving wilding and trenchard among the tombstones whither the messenger of evil had meanwhile led his friend trenchard rapped out his story briefly  shenke said he who was riding from lyme with letters for you from the duke was robbed of his dispatches late last night a mile or so this side taunton  highwaymen inquired mr wilding his tone calm though his glance had hardened  highwaymen no government agents belike there were two of them he saysfor i have the tale from himselfand they met him at the hare and hounds at taunton where he stayed to sup last night one of them gave him the password and he conceived him to be a friend but afterwards growing suspicious he refused to tell them too much they followed him it appears and on the road they overtook and fell upon him they knocked him from his horse possessed themselves of the contents of his wallet and left him for deadwith his head broken  mr wilding drew a sharp breath his wits worked quickly he was he realized in deadly peril one thought he gave to ruth if the worst came to pass here was one who would rejoice in her freedom the reflection cut through him like a sword he would be loath to die until he had taught her to regret him then his mind returned to what trenchard had told him  you said a government agent he mused slowly how would a government agent know the password  trenchards mouth fell open i had not thought he began then ended with an oath tis a traitor from inside  wilding nodded it must be one of those who met at white lackington three nights ago he answered  idlersthe witnesses of the weddingwere watching them with interest from the path and others from over the low wall of the churchyard as well they might for mr wildings behaviour was for a bridegroom extraordinary trenchard did not relish the audience  we had best away said he indeed he added we had best out of england altogether before the hue and cry is raised the bubbles pricked  wildings hand fell on his arm and its grasp was steady wildings eyes met his and their gaze was calm  where have you bestowed this messenger quoth he  he is here in bridgwater in bed at the bell inn whence he sent for you to zoyland chase suspecting trouble i rode to him at once myself  come then said wilding well go talk with him this matter needs probing ere we decide on flight you do not seem to have sought to discover who were the thieves nor other matters that it may be of use to know  rat me swore trenchard i was in haste to bring you news of it besides there were other things to talk of there is news that albemarle has gone to exeter and that sir edward phelips and colonel luttrell have been ordered to taunton by the king  mr wilding stared at him with sudden dismay  odso he exclaimed is king james taking fright at last then he shrugged his shoulders and laughed pshaw he cried they are starting at a shadow  heaven send prayed trenchard that the shadow does not prove to have a substance immediately behind it  folly said wilding when monmouth comes indeed we shall not lack forewarning come he added briskly well see this messenger and endeavour to discover who were these fellows that beset him and he drew trenchard from among the tombstones to the open path and thus from the churchyard and the eyes of the gaping onlookers    chapter viii bride and groom   and so the bridegroom in all his wedding finery made his way with trenchard to the bell inn in the high street whilst his bride escorted by lord gervase was being driven to zoyland chase of which she was now the mistress  but she was not destined just yet to cross its threshold for scarcely were they over the river when a horseman barred their way and called upon the driver to pull up lady horton in a panic huddled herself in the great coach and spoke of tobymen whilst lord gervase thrust his head from the window to discover that the rider who stayed their progress was richard westmacott his lordship hailed the boy who thereupon walked his horse to the carriage door  lord gervase said he will you bid the coachman put about and drive to lupton house  lord gervase stared at him in hopeless bewilderment drive to lupton house he echoed the more he saw of this odd wedding the less he understood of it it seemed to the placid old gentleman that he was fallen among a parcel of bedlamites surely sir it is for mistress wilding to say whither she will be driven and he drew in his head and turned to ruth for her commands but bewildered herself she had none to give him it was her turn to lean from the carriage window to ask her brother what he meant       i mean you are to drive home again said he there is something i must tell you when you have heard me it shall be yours to decide whether you will proceed or not to zoyland chase  hers to decide how was that possible what could he mean she pressed him with some such questions  it means in short he answered impatiently that i hold your salvation in my hands for the rest this is not the time or place to tell you more bid the fellow put about  ruth sat back and looked once more at her companions but from none did she receive the least helpful suggestion lady horton made great prattle to little purpose lord gervase followed her example whilst diana whose alert if trivial mind was the one that might have offered assistance sat silent ruth pondered she bethought her of trenchards sudden arrival at saint marys his duststained person and excited manner and of how he had drawn mr wilding aside with news that seemed of moment and now her brother spoke of saving her it was a little late for that she thought outside the coach his voice still urged her and it grew peevish and angry as was usual when he was crossed in the end she consented to do his will if she were to fathom this mystery that was thickening about her there seemed to be no other course she turned to lord gervase  will you do as richard says she begged him  his lordship blew out his chubby cheeks in his astonishment he hesitated a moment thinking of his cousin wilding then with a shrug he leaned from the window and gave the order she desired the carriage turned about and with richard following lumbered back across the bridge and through the town to lupton house at the door lord gervase took his leave of them he had acted as ruth had bidden him but he had no wish to be further involved in this affair whatever it might portend rather was it his duty at once to go acquaint mr wildingif he could find himwith what was taking place and leave it to mr wilding to take what measures might seem best to him he told them so and having told them left them  richard begged to be alone with his sister and alone they passed together into the library his manner was restless he trembled with excitement and his eyes glittered almost feverishly  you may have thought ruth that i was resigned to your marriage with this fellow wilding he began or that for other reasons i thought it wiser not to interfere if you thought that you wronged me iblake and ihave been at work for you during these last days and i rejoice to say our labours have not been idle his manner grew assertive boastful as he proceeded  you know of course said she that i am married  he made a gesture of disdain no matter said he exultantly  it matters something i think she answered o richard richard why did you not come to me sooner if you possessed the means of sparing me this thing  he shrugged impatiently her remonstrance seemed to throw him out of temper oons he cried i came as soon as was ever possible and depend upon it i am not come too late indeed i think i am come in the very nick of time he drew a sheet of paper from an inside pocket of his coat and slapped it down upon the table there is the wherewithal to hang your fine husband he announced in triumph  she recoiled to hang him she echoed with all her aversion to mr wilding it was plain she did not wish him hanged  aye to hang him richard repeated and drew himself to the full height of his short stature in pride at the thing he had achieved read it  she took the paper almost mechanically and for some moments she studied the crabbed signature before realizing whose it was then she started  from the duke of monmouth she exclaimed  he laughed read it he bade her again though there was no need for the injunction for already she was deciphering the crabbed hand and the atrocious spellingfor his grace of monmouths education had been notoriously neglected the letter which was dated from the hague was addressed to my good friend w at bridgwater it began sir spoke of the imminent arrival of his grace in the west and gave certain instructions for the collection of arms and the work of preparing men for enlistment in his cause ending with protestations of his graces friendship and esteem  ruth read the epistle twice before its treasonable nature was made clear to her before she understood the thing that was foreshadowed then she raised troubled eyes to her brothers face and in answer to the question of her glance he made clear to her the shrewd means by which they had become possessed of this weapon that should destroy their enemy mr wilding  blake and he forewarnedhe said not howof the coming of this messenger had lain in wait for him at the hare and hounds at taunton they had sought at first to become possessed of the letter without violence but having failed in this through having aroused the messengers suspicions they had been forced to follow and attack him on a lonely stretch of road where they had robbed him of the contents of his wallet richard added that the letter was no doubt one of several sent over by monmouth to some friend at lyme for distribution among his principal agents in the west it was regrettable that they should have endeavoured to take gentle measures with the courier as this had forewarned him and he had apparently been led to remove the letters outer wrapperwhich no doubt bore wildings full name and addressagainst the chance of such an attack as they had made upon him nevertheless as it was that letter to my good friend w backed by richards and blakes evidence of the destination intended for it would be more than enough to lay mr wilding safely by the heels  i would to heaven he repeated in conclusion i could have come in time to save you from becoming his wife but at least it is in my power to make you very speedily his widow  that said ruth still retaining the letter is what you propose to do  what else  she shook her head it must not be richard she said ill not consent to it  taken aback he stared at her then laughed unpleasantly odds my life are you in love with the man have you been fooling us  no she answered but ill be no party to his murder  murder quotha who talks of murder her shrewd eyes searched his face how came you by your knowledge that this courier rode to mr wilding she asked him suddenly and the swift change that overspread his countenance showed her that she had touched him in a tender spot assured her of the thing she had suddenly come to suspecta suspicion which at the same time started from and explained much that had been mysterious in richards ways of late you had knowledge of this conspiracy she pursued answering her own question before he had time to speak because you were one of the conspirators  at least i am so no longer he blurted out i thank heaven for that richard for your life is very dear to me but it would ill become you to make such use as this of the knowledge you came by in that manner it were a judass act he would have interrupted her but her manner dominated him you will leave this letter with me richard she continued  damn me no he began  ah yes richard she insisted you will give it to me and i shall thank you for the gift it shall prove a weapon for my salvation never fear  it shall indeed he cried with an ugly laugh when i have ridden to exeter to lay it before albemarle  not so she answered him it shall be a weapon of defencenot of offence it shall stand as a buckler between me and mr wilding trust me i shall know how to use it  but there is blake to consider he expostulated growing angry i am pledged to him  your first duty is to me  tut he interrupted blake feels that he owes it to his loyalty to lay this letter before the lordlieutenant and for that matter so do i  sir rowland would not cross my wishes in this she answered him  folly he cried now thoroughly aroused give me that letter  nay richard she answered and waved him back  but he advanced nevertheless   give it me he bade her waxing fierce  gad it was folly to have told you of it i had not done so but that i never thought you such a fool as to oppose yourself to the thing we intend  listen richard she besought him  but he was grown insensible to pleadings  give me that letter he insisted and caught her wrist her other hand howeverthe one that held the sheetwas already behind her back  the door was suddenly thrust open and diana appeared ruth she announced mr wilding is here  at the mention of that name richard let her free wilding he ejaculated his fierceness all blown out of him he had imagined that already mr wilding would be in full flight was the fellow mad  he is following me said diana and indeed a step could be heard in the passage  the letter growled richard in a frenzy between fear and anger now give it me give it me do you hear  sh youll betray yourself she cried he is here  and at that same moment mr wildings tall figure still arrayed in his bridegrooms finery of skyblue satin loomed in the doorway he was serene and calm as ever neither the discovery of the plot by the abstraction of the messengers letter nor ruths strange conductof which he had heard from lord gervasehad sufficed to ruffle outwardly at least the inscrutable serenity of his air and manner he paused to make his bow then advanced into the room with a passing glance at richard still spurred and booted and all duststained  you appear to have ridden far dick said he smiling and richard shivered in spite of himself at the mocking note that seemed to ring faintly at the words i saw your friend sir rowland in the garden he added i think he waits for you  though richard could not fail to apprehend the implied dismissal he was minded at first to disregard it but mr wilding turning held the door addressing diana  mistress horton said he will you give us leave  diana curtsied and passed out and mr wildings eye falling upon the lingering richard at that moment richard thought it best to follow her example but he went with rage in his heart at being forced to leave that precious document behind him  as mr wilding his back to her a moment closed the door ruth slipped the paper hurriedly into the bosom of her lownecked gown he turned to her calm but very grave and his dark eyes seemed to reproach her  this is ill done ruth said he  ill done or well done she answered him done it is and shall so remain  he raised his brows ah said he i appear then to have misapprehended the situation from what gervase told me i understood it was your brother forced you to return  not forced sir she answered him  induced then said he it but remains me to induce you to repair what i think was a mistake  she shook her head i have returned home for good said she  youll pardon me said he that i am so egotistical as to prefer zoyland chase to lupton house despite the manifold attractions of the latter i do not intend to take up my abode here  you are not asked to  what then  she hated him for the smile for his masterful air which seemed to imply that he humoured her because he scorned to use authority but that when he did use it hers must it be to obey him again she felt that everlasting calm arguing such latent forces was the thing she hated most in him  i think i had best be plain with you said she i have fulfilled my part of the bargain that we made i intend to do no more i promised that if you spared my brother i would go to the altar with you today i have carried out my contract to the letter it is at an end  indeed said he i think it has not yet begun he advanced towards her and took her hand she yielded it unwilling though she was this is unworthy of you madam said he his tone grave and deferential you think to escape fulfilling the spirit of your bargain by adhering to the letter of it not so he ended and shook his head smiling gently the carriage is still at your door you return with me to zoyland chase to take possession of your home  you mistake said she and tore her hand from his you say that what i have done is unworthy i admit it but it is with unworthiness that we must combat unworthiness was your attitude towards me less unworthy  ill make amends for it if youll come home said he  my home is here you cannot compel me  i should be loath to he admitted sighing  you cannot she insisted  i think i can said he there is a law  a law that will hang you if you invoke it she cut in quickly this much can i safely promise you  she had need to say no more to tell him everything at all times half a word was as much to mr wilding as a whole sentence to another she saw the tightening of his lips the hardening of his eyes beyond which he gave no other sign that she had hit him  i see said he it is another bargain that you make i do suspect there is some traders blood in the westmacott veins let us be clear you hold the wherewithal to ruin me and you will use it if i insist upon my husbands rights is it not so  she nodded in silence surprised at the rapidity with which he had read the situation  i admit said he that you have me between sword and wall he laughed shortly let me know more he begged her am i to understand that so long as i leave you in peaceso long as i do not insist upon your becoming my wife in more than nameyou will not wield the weapon that you hold  you are to understand so she answered  he took a turn in the room very thoughtful not of himself was he thinking now but of the duke of monmouth trenchard had told him some ugly truths that morning of how in his lovemaking he appeared to have shipwrecked the cause ere it was well launched if this letter got to whitehall there was no gaugingignorant as he was of what was in itthe ruin that might follow but they had reason to fear the worst he saw his duty to the duke most clearly and he breathed a prayer of thanks that richard had chosen to put that letter to such a use as this he knew himself checkmated but he was a man who knew how to bear defeat in a becoming manner he turned suddenly  the letter is in your hands he inquired  it is she answered  may i see it he asked  she shook her headnot daring to show it or betray its whereabouts lest he should use force to become possessed of ita thing indeed that was very far from his purpose  he considered a moment his mind intent now rather upon the dukes interest than his own  you know quoth he the desperate enterprise to which i stand committed but it is a bargain between us that you do not betray me nor that enterprise so long as i leave you rid of my presence  that is the bargain i propose said she  he looked at her a moment with hungry eyes and she found his glance almost more than she could bear so strong was its appeal besides it may be that she was a thought beglamoured by the danger in which he stood which seemed to invest him with a certain heroic dignity  ruth he said at length it may well be that that which you desire may speedily come to pass it may well be that in the course of this rebellion that is hatching you may be widowed but at least i know that if my head falls it will not be my wife who has betrayed me to the axe for that much believe me i am supremely grateful  he advanced he took her unresisting hand again and bore it to his lips bowing low before her then erect and graceful he turned on his heel and left her    chapter ix mr trenchards counterstroke   now however much it might satisfy mr wilding to have ruths word for it that so long as he left her in peace neither he nor the cause had any betrayal to fear from her mr trenchard was of a very different mind  he fumed and swore and worked himself into a very passion zoons man he cried it would mean utter ruin to you if that letter reached whitehall  i realize it but my mind is easy i have her promise  a womans promise snorted trenchard and proceeded with great circumstance of expletives to damn everything that daggled a petticoat  your fears are idle wilding assured him what she says she will do  and her brother quoth trenchard have you bethought you of that canarybird hell know the letters whereabouts he has cause to fear you more than ever now are you sure hell not be making use of it to lay you by the heels  mr wilding smiled upon the fury provoked by trenchards concern and love for him she has promised he said with an insistent faith that was fuel to trenchards anger and i can depend her word  so cannot i snapped his friend  the thing that plagues me most said wilding ignoring the remark is that we are kept in ignorance of the letters contents at a time when we most long for news not a doubt but it would have enabled us to set our minds at ease on the score of these foolish rumours  ayeor else confirmed them said pessimistic trenchard he wagged his head they say the duke has put to sea already  folly wilding protested  whitehall thinks otherwise what of the troops at taunton  more folly  welli would you had that letter  at least said wilding i have the superscription and we know from shenke that no name was mentioned in the letter itself  theres evidence enough without it trenchard reminded him and fell soon after into abstraction turning over in his mind a notion with which he had suddenly been inspired that notion kept trenchard secretly occupied for a couple of days but in the end he succeeded in perfecting it  now it befell that towards dusk one evening early in the week richard westmacott went abroad alone as was commonly his habit his goal being the saracens head where he and sir rowland spent many a night over wine and cardsto sir rowlands moderate profit for he had not played the pigeon in town so long without having acquired sufficient knowledge to enable him to play the rook in the country as westmacott was passing up the high street a black shadow fell athwart the light that streamed from the door of the bell inn and out through the doorway lurched mr trenchard a thought unsteadily to hurtle so violently against richard that he broke the long stem of the white clay pipe he was carrying now richard was not to know that mr trenchardhaving informed himself of mr westmacotts evening habitshad been waiting for the past halfhour in that doorway hoping that mr westmacott would not depart this evening from his usual custom another thing that mr westmacott was not to knowconsidering his youthwas the singular histrionic ability which this old rake had displayed in those younger days of his when he had been a player and the further circumstance that he had excelled in those parts in which ebriety was to be counterfeited indeed we have it on the word of no less an authority on theatrical matters than mr pepys that mr nicholas trenchards appearance as pistol in henry iv in the year of the blessed restoration was the talk alike of town and court  mr trenchard steadied himself from the impact and swearing a round and awful elizabethan oath accused the other of being drunk then struck an attitude to demand with truculence would ye take the wall o me sir  richard hastened to make himself known to this turbulent roysterer who straightway forgot his grievance to take westmacott affectionately by the hand and overwhelm him with apologies and that done trenchardwho affected the condition known as maudlin drunkmust needs protest almost in tears how profound was his love for richard and insist that the boy return with him to the bell inn that they might pledge each other  richard himself sober was contemptuous of trenchard so obviously obfuscated at first it was his impulse to excuse himself as possibly blake might be already waiting for him but on second thoughts remembering that trenchard was mr wildings most intimate famulus it occurred to him that by a little crafty questioning he might succeed in smoking mr wildings intentions in the matter of that letterfor from his sister he had failed to get satisfaction so he permitted himself to be led indoors to a table by the window which stood vacant there were at the time a dozen guests or so in the commonroom trenchard bawled for wine and brandy and for all that he babbled in an irresponsible foolish manner of all things that were of no matter yet not the most adroit of pumping could elicit from him any such information as richard sought perforce young westmacott must remain plying him with more and more drinkand being plied in his turnto the end that he might not waste the occasion  an hour later found richard much the worse for wear and trenchard certainly no better richard forgot his purpose forgot that blake waited for him at the saracens head and now trenchard seemed to be pulling himself together  i want to talk to you richard said he and although thick there was in his voice a certain impressive quality that had been absent hitherto s a rumour current he lowered his voice to a whisper almost and leaning across took his companion by the arm he hiccoughed noisily then began again s a rumour current sweetheart that youre disaffected  richard started and his mind flapped and struggled like a trapped bird to escape the meshes of the wine to the end that he might convincingly defend himself from such an imputationso dangerously true  s a lie he gasped  trenchard shut one eye and owlishly surveyed his companion with the other they say he added that youre for forsaking dukes party  villainous richard protested ill sli throat of any man t says so and draining the pewter at his elbow he smashed it down on the table to emphasize his seriousness  trenchard replenished it with the utmost promptness then sat back in his tall chair and pulled a moment at the fresh pipe with which he had equipped himself  i think i espy he quoted presently virtue and valour crouched in thine eye and yet and yet if i had cause to think it true id id run you through the vitalsjus so and he prodded richards waistcoat with the point of his pipestem his swarthy face darkened his eyes glittered fiercely are ye sure yere norrer foul traitor he demanded suddenly are y sure for if yere not  he left the terrible menace unuttered but it was none the less understood it penetrated the vinous fog that beset the brain of richard and startled him  swear im not he cried swear mos solemnly im not  swear echoed trenchard and his scowl grew darker still swear a man may swear and yet liea man may smile and smile and be a villain ill have proof of your loyalty to us ill have proof or as theres a heaven above and a hell below ill rip you up  his mien was terrific and his voice the more threatening in that it was not raised above a whisper  richard sat back appalled afraid  wha what proofll satisfy you he asked  trenchard considered it pulling at his pipe again pledge me the duke said he at length thers truth n wine pledge me the duke and confusion to his majesty the goldfinch richard reached for his pewter glad that the test was to be so light up on your feet man grumbled trenchard on your feet and see that your words have a ring of truth in them  richard did as he was bidden the little reason left him being concentrated wholly on the convincing of his fellow tippler he rose to his feet so unsteadily that his chair fell over with a bang he never heeded it but others in the room turned at the sound and a hush fell in the chamber dominating this came richards voice strident with intensity if thick of utterance  down with popery and god save the protestant duke he cried down with popery and he looked at trenchard for applause and assurance that trenchard no longer thought there was cause to quarrel with him  behind him there was a stir in the room that went unheeded by the boy men nudged their neighbours some looked frightened and some grinned at the treasonable words  a swift change came over trenchard his drunkenness fell from him like a discarded mantle he sat like a man amazed then he heaved himself to his feet in a fury and smashed down his pipestem on the wooden table sending its fragments flying  damn me he roared have i sat at table with a traitor and he thrust at richard with his open palm lightly yet with sufficient force to throw richard off his precarious balance and send him sprawling on the sanded floor men rose from the tables about and approached them some few amused but the majority very grave dodsley the landlord came hurrying to assist richard to his feet  mr westmacott he whispered in the rash fools ear you were best away  richard stood up leaning his full weight upon the arm the landlord had about his waist he passed a hand over his brow as if to brush aside the veil that obscured his wits what had happened what had he said what had trenchard done why did these fellows stand and gape at him he heard his companions voice raised to address the company  gentlemen he heard him say i trust there is none present will impute to me any share in such treasonable sentiments as mr westmacott has expressed but if there is any who questions my loyalty i have a convincing argument for himin my scabbard and he struck his swordhilt with his fist  then he clapped on his hat aslant over the locks of his golden wig and taking up his whip he moved with leisurely dignity towards the door he looked back with a sardonic smile at the ado he was leaving behind him listened a moment to the voices that already were being raised in excitement then closed the door and made his way briskly to the stableyard where he called for his horse he rode out of bridgwater ten minutes later and took the road to taunton as the moon was rising big and yellow over the hills on his left he reached taunton towards ten oclock that night having ridden helltoleather his first visit was to the hare and hounds where blake and westmacott had overtaken the courier his next to the house where sir edward phelips and colonel luttrellthe gentlemen lately ordered to taunton by his majestyhad their lodging  the fruits of mr trenchards extraordinary behaviour that night were to be seen at an early hour on the following day when a constable and three tythingmen came with a lordlieutenants warrant to arrest mr richard westmacott on a charge of high treason they found the young man still abed and most guilty was his panic when they bade him rise and dress himselfthough little did he dream of the full extent to which mr trenchard had enmeshed him or indeed that mr trenchard had any hand at all in this affair what time he was getting into his clothes with a tythingman outside his door and another on guard under his window the constable and his third myrmidon made an exhaustive search of the house all they found of interest was a letter signed monmouth which they took from the secret drawer of a secretary in the library but that it seemed was all they sought for having found it they proceeded no further with their reckless and destructive ransacking  with that letter and the person of richard westmacott the constable and his men took their departure and rode back to taunton leaving alarm and sore distress at lupton house in her despair poor ruth was all for following her brother in the hope that at least by giving evidence of how that letter came into his possession she might do something to assist him but knowing as she did that he had had his share in the treason that was hatching she had cause to fear that his guilt would not lack for other proofs it was diana who urged her to repair instead to the only man upon whose resource she might depend provided he were willing to exert it that man was anthony wilding and whether diana urged it from motives of her own or out of concern for richard it would be difficult to say with certainty  the very thought of going to him for aid after all that had passed was repugnant to ruth and yet what choice had she convinced by her cousin and urged by her affection and duty to richard she repressed her aversion and calling for a horse rode out to zoyland chase attended by a groom wilding by good fortune was at home hard at work upon a mass of documents in that same library where she had talked with him on the occasion of her first visit to his hometo the home of which she remembered that she was now herself the mistress he was preparing for circulation in the west a mass of libels and incendiary pamphlets calculated to forward the cause of the protestant duke  dissembling his surprise he bade old walterswho left her waiting in the hall whilst he went to announce herto admit her instantly and he advanced to the door to receive and welcome her  ruth said he and his face was oddly alight you have come at last  she smiled a wan smile of selfpity i have been constrained said she and told him what had happened that her brother had been arrested for high treason and that the constable in searching the house had come upon the monmouth letter she had locked away in her desk  and not a doubt she ended but it will be believed that it was to richard the letter was indited by the duke you will remember that its only address was to my good friend w and that will stand for westmacott as well as wilding  mr wilding was fain to laugh at the irony of this surprising turn of things of which she brought him news for he had neither knowledge nor suspicion of the machinations of his friend trenchard to which these events were due but noting and respecting her anxiety for her brother he curbed his natural amusement  it is a judgment upon you said he nevertheless  do you exult she asked indignantly  no but i cannot repress my admiration for the ways of divine justice if you are come to me for advice i can but suggest that you should follow your brothers captors to taunton and inform the lieutenants of how the letter came into your power  she looked at him in anger almost at what seemed a callousness would he believe me think you  belike he would not said mr wilding you can but try  if i told them it was addressed to you she said eyeing him sternly does it not occur to you that they would send for you to question you and that if they did so as you are a gentleman you could not lie away my brothers life  why yes said he quite calmly it does occur to me but does it not occur to you that by the time they came here they would find me gone he laughed at her dismay i thank you madam for this warning he added i think ill bid them saddle for me without delay too long already have i tarried  and must richard hang she asked him fiercely  mr wilding produced a snuffbox of tortoise shell and gold he opened it deliberately if he does youll admit that he will hang on the gallows that he has built himselfalthough intended for another ifaith hes not the first booby to be caught in his own springe there is in this a measure of poetic justice poetry and justice do you know ruth they are two things i have ever loved and he took a pinch of choice bergamot  will you be serious she demanded  trenchard would tell you that it were to make an exception from the rule of my life he assured her smiling yet even that might i do at your bidding  but this is a serious matter she told him angrily for richard he acknowledged closing his snuffbox with a snap tell me what would you have me do  since he asked her thus she answered him in two words save him  at the cost of my own neck quoth he the price is high he reminded her do you think that richard is quite worth it  and are you to save yourself at the cost of his she counterquestioned are you capable of such a baseness  he looked at her thoughtfully a moment you have not reflected said he slowly that in this affair is involved more than mine or richards life there is a great cause weighing in the balance against all personal considerations if i accounted richard of more value to monmouth than i am myself i should not hesitate in riding to set him free by taking his place as it is however i think i am of the greatest conceivable importance to his grace whilst if twenty richards perishedfranklytheir loss would be something of a gain for richard has played a traitors part already that is with me the first of all considerations  am i of no consideration to you she asked him and in an agony of terror for her brother she now approached him and obeying a sudden impulse cast herself upon her knees before him listen she cried  not thus said he a frown between his eyes he took her by the elbows and gently but very firmly brought her to her feet again it is not fitting you should kneel save at your prayers  she was standing now and very close to him his hands still held her elbows though their touch was so light that she scarce felt it to release them was easy and the next second her hands were on his shoulders her brave eyes raised to him  mr wilding she implored him youll not let richard be destroyed  he looked down at her with kindling glance his arms slipped round her lissom waist it is hard to deny you ruth said he yet not my love of my own life compels me but my duty my loyalty to the cause to which i am pledged i were a traitor were i now to place myself in peril  she pressed against him her face so close to his that her breath fanned his cheek whither a faint colour crept in quick response despite herself almost instinctively unconsciously she exerted the weapons of her sex to bend him to her will  you say you love me she whispered prove it me now and i will believe you  ah he sighed and believing me what then  he had himself grimly in hand yet feared he should not prove strong enough to hold himself for long  you you shall find me your dutiful wife she faltered crimsoning  his arms tightened about her he crushed her to him he bent his head to hers and his lips burnt the lips she yielded to him as though they had been living fire  anon she was to weep in shamein shame and in astonishmentat that instant of surrender but for the moment she had no thought save for her brother exultation filled her she accounted that she had conquered and she gloried in the power her beauty gave her a power that had sufficed to melt to water the hardfrozen purposes of this selfwilled man the next instant however she was cold again with dismay and newborn terror he unclasped her arms he drew back shaking off the hands she had rested upon his shoulders his white facethe flush had faded from it againsmiled a thought disdainfully  you bargain with me he said but i have some knowledge of your ways of trading they are overshrewd for an honest gentleman  you mean she gasped her hand pressed to her heart her face a deathly white you mean that youll not save him  i mean said he that i will have no further bargains with you  there was such hard finality in his tone that she recoiled beaten and without power to return to the assault she had played and lost she had yielded her lips to his kisses andhusband though he might be in nameshame was her only guerdon  one look she gave him from out of that face so white and pitiful then with a shudder turned from him and fled his presence he sprang after her as the door closed then checked and stood in thought very grim for one who professed to bestow no seriousness on the affairs of life then he returned slowly to his writingtable and rummaged there among the papers with which it was encumbered seeking something of which he now had need through the open window he heard the retreating beat of her horses hoofs he sighed and sat down heavily to take his long square chin in his hand and stare before him at the sunlight on the lawn outside  and whilst he sat thus ruth made all haste back to lupton house to tell of the failure that had attended her there was nothing left her now but to embark upon the forlorn hope of following richard to taunton to offer her evidence of how the incriminating letter had come to be locked in the drawer in which the constable had discovered it diana met her with a face as white as her own and infinitely more startled she had just learnt that sir rowland blake had been arrested also and that he had been carried to taunton together with richard and as a consequence she was as eager now that ruth should repair to albemarle as she had erstwhile been earnest in urging her to seek out mr wilding indeed diana went so far as to offer to accompany her an offer that ruth gladly gratefully accepted  within an hour ruth and dianain spite of all that poor docile lady horton had said to stay themwere riding to taunton attended by the same groom who had so lately accompanied his mistress to zoyland chase    chapter x their own petard   in a lofty spacious room of the town hall at taunton sat sir edward phelips and colonel luttrell to dispense justice and with them flanked by one of them on either side of him sat christopher monk duke of albemarle lordlieutenant of devonshire who had been summoned in all haste from exeter that he might be present at an examination which promised to be of so vast importance the three sat at a long table at the rooms end attended by two secretaries  before them guarded by constable and tythingmen weaponless their hands pinioned behind themblakes arm was healed by nowstood mr westmacott and his friend sir rowland to answer this grave charge  richard not knowing who might have betrayed him and to what extent was very fearfulhaving through his connection with the cause every reason so to be blake on the other hand conscious of his innocence of any plotting was impatient of his position and a thought contemptuous it was he who upon being ushered by the constable and his men into the august presence of the lordlieutenant clamoured to know precisely of what he was accused that he might straightway clear himself  albemarle reared his great massive head smothered in a mighty black peruke and scowled upon the florid london beau a blackvisaged gentleman was christopher monk his pendulous cheeks it is true were of a sallow pallor but what with his black wig black eyebrows dark eyes and the blueblack tint of shaven beard on his great jaw and upper lip he presented an appearance sombrely sinister his netherlip was thick and very prominent deep creases ran from the corners of his mouth adown his heavy chin his eyes were dull and lacklustre with great pouches under them in the main the air of this son of the great parliamentarian general was stupid dull unprepossessing  the creases of his mouth deepened as blake protested against what he termed this outrage that had been done him he sneered ponderously thrusting further forward his heavily undershot jowl  we are informed sir of your antecedents he staggered blake by answering we have learnt the reason why you left london and your creditors and in all my life sir i have never known a man more ready to turn his hand to treason than a broken gamester your kind turns by instinct to such work as this as a last resource for the mending of battered fortunes  blake crimsoned from chin to brow im forejudged it seems he made answer haughtily tossing his fair locks his blue eyes glaring upon his judges may i at least know the name of my accuser  you shall receive impartial justice at our hands put in phelips whose manner was of a dangerous mildness depend on that not only shall you know the name of your accuser but you shall be confronted by him meanwhile sirsand his glance strayed from blakes flushed and angry countenance to richards pale and timidmeanwhile are we to understand that you deny the charge  i have heard none as yet said sir rowland insolently  albemarle turned to one of the secretaries read them the indictment said he and sank back in his chair his dull glance upon the prisoners whilst the clerk in a droning voice read from a document which he took up it impeached sir rowland blake and mr richard westmacott of holding treasonable communication with james scott duke of monmouth and of plotting against his majestys life and throne and the peace of his majestys realms  blake listened with unconcealed impatience to the farrago of legal phrases and snorted contemptuously when the reading came to an end  albemarle looked at him darkly i do thank god said he that through mr westmacotts folly has this hideous plot this black and damnable treason been brought to light in time to enable us to stamp out this fire ere it is well kindled have you aught to say sir  i have to say that the whole charge a foul and unfounded lie said sir rowland bluntly i never plotted in my life against anything but my own prosperity nor against any man but myself  albemarle smiled coldly at his colleagues then turned to westmacott and you sir he said are you as stubborn as your friend  i incontinently deny the charge said richard and he contrived that his voice should ring bold and resolute  a charge built on air sneered blake which the first breath of truth should utterly dispel we have heard the impeachment will your grace with the same consideration permit us to see the proofs that we may lay bare their falseness it should not be difficult  do you say there is no such plot as is here alleged quoth the duke and smote a paper sharply  blake shrugged his shoulders how should i know he asked i say i have no share in any that i am acquainted with none  call mr trenchard said the duke quietly and an usher who had stood tamely by the door at the far end of the room departed on the errand  richard started at the mention of that name he had a singular dread of mr trenchard  colonel luttrelllean and wirynow addressed the prisoners blake more particularly still said he you will admit that such a plot may indeed exist  it may indeed for aught i knowor care he added incautiously  albemarle smote the table with a heavy hand by god he cried in that deep booming voice of his there spoke a traitor you do not care you say what plots may be hatched against his majestys life and crown yet you ask me to believe you a true and loyal subject  blake was angered he was at best a shorttempered man deliberately he floundered further into the mire  i have not asked your grace to believe me anything he answered hotly it is all one to me what your grace believes me i take it i have not been fetched hither to be confronted with what your grace believes you have preferred a lying charge against me i ask for proofs not your graces beliefs and opinions  by god sir you are a daring rogue cried albemarle  sir rowlands eyes blazed anon your grace when having failed of your proofs you shall be constrained to restore me to liberty i shall ask your grace to unsay that word  albemarle stared confounded and in that moment the door opened and trenchard sauntered in cane in hand his hat under his arm a wicked smile on his wizened face  leaving blakes veiled threat unanswered the duke turned to the old rake these rogues said he pointing to the prisoners demand proofs ere they will admit the truth of the impeachment  those proofs said trenchard are already in your graces hands  aye but they have asked to be confronted with their accuser  trenchard bowed is it your wish then that i recite for them the counts on which i have based the accusation i laid before your grace  if you will condescend so far said albemarle  blister me roared blake when the duke interrupted him  by god sir he cried ill have no such disrespectful language here youll observe the decency of speech and forbear from profanities you damned rogue or by god ill commit you forthwith  i will endeavour said blake with a sarcasm lost on albemarle to follow your graces lofty example  you will do well sir said the duke and was shocked that trenchard should laugh at such a moment  i was about to protest sir said blake that it is monstrous i should be accused by mr trenchard he has but the slightest acquaintance with me   trenchard bowed to him across the chamber admitted sir said he what should i be doing in bad company an answer this that set albemarle bawling with laughter trenchard turned to the duke i will begin an it please your grace with the expressions used last night in my presence at the bell inn at bridgwater by mr richard westmacott and i will confine myself strictly to those matters on which my testimony can be corroborated by that of other witnesses  colonel luttrell interrupted him to turn to richard do you recall those expressions sir he asked him  richard winced under the question nevertheless he braced himself to make the best defence he could i have not yet heard said he what those expressions were nor when i hear them must it follow that i recognize them as my own i must admit to having taken more wine perhaps than than whilst he sought the expression that he needed trenchard cut in with a laugh in vino veritas gentlemen and his grace and sir edward nodded sagely luttrell preserved a stolid exterior he seemed less prone than his colleagues to forejudging  will you repeat the expressions used by mr westmacott sir edward begged  i will repeat the one that to my mind matters most mr westmacott getting to his feet and in a loud voice exclaimed god save the protestant duke  do you admit it sir thundered albemarle his eyes glowering upon richard hesitated a moment pale and trembling  you will waste breath in denying it said trenchard suavely for i have a drawer from the bell inn and two gentlemen who overheard you waiting outside  ifaith sir cried blake what treason was therein that if he  silence thundered albemarle let mr westmacott speak for himself  richard inspired by the defence blake had begun took the same line of argument i admit that in the heat of wine i may have used such words said he but i deny their intent to be treasonable there are many men who drink to the prosperity of the late kingss son  natural son sir natural son albemarle amended it is treason to speak of him otherwise  it will be a treason presently to draw breath sneered blake  if it be said trenchard it is a treason youll not be long committing  faith you are right mr trenchard said the duke with a laugh indeed he found mr trenchard a most pleasant and facetious gentleman  still insisted richard endeavouring in spite of these irrelevancies to make good his point there be many men who drink daily to the prosperity of the late kings natural son  aye sir answered albemarle but not his prosperity in horrid plots against the life of our beloved sovereign  true your grace very true purred sir edward it was not so i meant to toast him cried richard albemarle made an impatient gesture and took up a sheet of paper how then he asked comes this letterthis letter which makes plain the treason upon which the duke of monmouth is embarked just as it makes plain your participation in ithow comes this letter to be found in your possession and he waved the letter in the air  richard went the colour of ashes he faltered a moment then took refuge in the truth for all that he knew beforehand that the truth was bound to ring more false than any lie he could invent  that letter was not addressed to me he stammered  albemarle read the subscription to my good friend w at bridgwater he looked up a heavy sneer thrusting his heavy lip still further out what do you say to that does not w stand for westmacott  it does not  of course not said albemarle with heavy sarcasm it stands for wilkins or williams oror whatnot  indeed i can bear witness that it does not exclaimed sir rowland  be silent sir i tell you bawled the duke at him again you shall bear witness soon enough i promise you to whom then he resumed turning again to richard do you say that this letter was addressed  to mr wildingmr anthony wilding richard answered  i would have your grace to observe put in trench ard quietly that mr wilding properly speaking does not reside in bridgwater  tush cried albemarle the rogue but mentions the first name with a w that occurs to him hes not even an ingenious liar and how sir he asked richard does it come to be in your possession having been addressed as you say to mr wilding  aye sir said sir edward blinking his weak eyes tell us that  richard hesitated again and looked at blake blake who by now had come to realize that his friends affairs were not mended by his interruptions moodily shrugged his shoulders scowling  come sir said colonel luttrell engagingly answer the question  aye roared albemarle let your invention have free rein  again poor richard sought refuge in the truth wesir rowland here and ihad reason to suspect that he was awaiting such a letter  tell us your reasons sir if we are to credit you said the duke and it was plain he mocked the prisoner it was moreover a request that staggered richard still he sought to find a reason that should sound plausible  we inferred it from certain remarks that mr wilding let fall in our presence  tell us the remarks sir the duke insisted  indeed i do not call his precise words to mind your grace but they were such that we suspicioned him  and you would have me believe that hearing words which awoke in you such grave suspicions you kept your suspicions and straightway forgot the words youre but an indifferent liar  trenchard who was standing by the long table leaned forward now  it might be well an it please your grace said he to waive the point and let us come to those matters which are of greater moment let him tell your grace how he came by the letter  aye said albemarle we do but waste time tell us then how came the letter into your hands  with sir rowland here i robbed the courier as he was riding from taunton to bridgwater  albemarle laughed and sir edward smiled you robbed him eh said his grace very well but how did it happen that you knew he had the letter upon him or was it that you were playing the hightobymen and that in robbing him you hoped to find other matters  not so sir answered richard i sought but the letter  and how knew you that he carried it did you learn that too from mr wildings indiscretion  your grace has said it  slife what an impudent rogue have we here cried the angry duke who conceived that richard was purposely dealing in effrontery mr trenchard i do think we are wasting time be so good as to confound them both with the truth of this matter  that letter said trenchard was delivered to them at the hare and hounds here at taunton by a gentleman who put up at the inn and was there joined by mr westmacott and sir rowland blake they opened the conversation with certain cant phrases very clearly intended as passwords thus the prisoners said to the messenger as they seated themselves at the table he occupied you have the air sir of being from overseas to which the courier answered indeed yes i am from holland from the land of orange says one of the prisoners aye and other things replies the messenger there is a fair wind blowing he adds to which one of the prisoners i believe it was sir rowland makes answer mayit prosper the protestant duke and blow popery to hell thereupon the landlord caught some mention of a letter but these plotters perceiving that they were perhaps being overheard sent him away to fetch them wine a halfhour later the messenger took his leave and the prisoners followed a very few minutes afterwards  albemarle turned to the prisoners you have heard mr trenchards story how do you sayis it true or untrue  you will waste breath in denying it trenchard took it again upon himself to admonish them for i have with me the landlord of the hare and hounds who will corroborate upon oath what i have said  we do not deny it put in blake but we submit that the matter is susceptible to explanation  you can keep your explanations till your trial then snapped albemarle i have heard more than enough to commit the pair of you to gaol  but your grace cried sir rowland so fiercely that one of the tythingmen set a restraining hand upon his shoulder i am ready to swear that what i did and what my friend mr westmacott did was done in the interests of his majesty we were working to discover this plot  which no doubt put in trenchard slyly is the reason why having got the letter your friend mr westmacott locked it in a desk and you kept silence on the matter  you see exclaimed albemarle how your lies do but serve further to bind you in the toils it is ever thus with traitors  i do think you are a damned traitor trenchard began blake a foul  but what more he would have said was checked by albemarle who thundered forth an order for their removal and then scarce were the words uttered than the door at the far end of the hall was opened and through it came a sound of womens voices richard started for one was the voice of ruth  an usher advanced may it please your grace there are two ladies here beg that you will hear their evidence in the matter of mr westmacott and sir rowland blake  albemarle considered a moment trenchard stood very thoughtful  indeed said the duke at last i have heard as much as i need hear and sir phelips nodded in token of concurrence  not so however colonel luttrell still said he in the interests of his majesty perhaps we should be doing well to receive them  albemarle blew out his cheeks like a man wearied and stared an instant at luttrell then he shrugged his shoulders  admit them then he commanded almost peevishly and ruth and diana were ushered into the hall both were pale but whilst diana was fluttered with excitement ruth was calm and cool and it was she who spoke in answer to the dukes invitation the burden of her speech was a clear succinct recitationin which she spared neither wilding nor herselfof how the letter came to have remained in her hands and silence to have been preserved regarding it albemarle heard her very patiently  if what you say is true mistress said he and god forbid that i should be so ungallant as to throw doubt upon a ladys word it certainly explainsalthough most strangelyhow the letter was not brought to us at once by your brother and his friend sir rowland you are prepared to swear that this letter was intended for mr wilding  i am prepared to swear it she replied  this is very serious said the duke  very serious assented sir edward phelips  albemarle a little flustered turned to his colleagues what do you say to this were it perhaps well to order mr wildings apprehension and to have him brought hither  it were to give yourselves useless trouble gentlemen said trenchard with so much assurance that it was plain albemarle hesitated  beware of mr trenchard your grace cried ruth he is mr wildings friend and if there is a plot he is sure to be in it  albemarle startled looked at trenchard had the accusation come from either of the men the duke would have silenced him and abused him but coming from a woman and so comely a woman it seemed to his grace worthy at least of consideration but nimble mr trenchard was easily master of the situation  which of course he answered with fine sarcasm is the reason why i have been at work for the past fourandtwenty hours to lay proofs of this plot before your grace  albemarle was ashamed of his momentary hesitation       for the rest said trenchard it is perfectly true that i am mr wildings friend but the lady is even more intimately connected with him it happens that she is his wife  his his wife gasped the duke whilst phelips chuckled and colonel luttrells face grew dark  trenchards wicked smile flickered upon his mobile features there are rumours current of court paid her by sir rowland there who knows he questioned most suggestively arching his brows and tightening his lips wives are strange kittlekattle and husbands have been known before to grow inconvenient upon reflection your grace will no doubt discern the precise degree of faith to attach to what this lady may tell you against mr wilding  oh exclaimed ruth her cheeks flaming crimson but this is monstrous  tis how i should myself describe it answered trenchard without shame  spurred to it thus ruth poured out the entire story of her marriage and so clear and lucid was her statement that it threw upon the affair a flood of light whilst so frank and truthful was her tone her narrative hung so well together that the bench began to recover from the shock to its faith and was again in danger of believing her trenchard saw this and trembled to save wilding for the cause he had resorted to this desperate expedient of betraying that cause it must be observed however that he had not done so save under the conviction that betrayed it was bound to be and that since that was inevitable the thing had better come from himfor wildings sakethan from richard westmacott he had taken the bull by the horns in a most desperate fashion when he had determined to hoist richard and blake with their own petard hoping that after all the harm would reach no further than the destruction of these twoa purely defensive measure but now this girl threatened to wreck his scheme just as it was being safely steered to harbour suddenly he swung round interrupting her  lies lies lies he clamoured and his interruption coming at such a time served to impress the duke most unfavourablyas well it might  it is our wish to hear this lady out mr trenchard the duke reproved him  but mr trenchard was undismayed indeed he had just discovered a hitherto neglected card which should put an end to this dangerous game  i do abhor to hear your graces patience thus abused he exclaimed with some show of heat this lady makes a mock of you if youll allow me to ask two questionsor perhaps threeill promise finally to prick this bubble for you have i your graces leave  well well said albemarle let us hear your questions and his colleagues nodded  trenchard turned airily to ruth behind her diana satan attendant had fetched a chair for herin fear and wonder at what she saw and heard her eyes ever and anon straying to sir rowlands back which was towards her  this letter madam said he for the possession of which you have accounted in so so picturesque a manner was intended for and addressed to mr wilding you say and you are prepared to swear to it  ruth turned indignantly to the bench must i answer this mans questions she demanded  i think perhaps it were best you did said the duke still showing her all deference  she turned to trenchard her head high her eyes full upon his wrinkled cynical face i swear then she began but heconsummate actor that he was and versed in tricks that impress an audienceinterrupted her raising one of his gnarled yellow hands  nay nay said he i would not have perjury proved against you i do not ask you to swear it will be sufficient if you pronounce yourself prepared to swear  she pouted her lip a trifle her whole expression manifesting her contempt of him i am in no fear of perjuring myself she answered fearlessly and i swear that the letter in question was addressed to mr wilding  as you will said trenchard and was careful not to ask her how she came by her knowledge the letter no doubt was in an outer wrapper on which there would be a superscriptionthe name of the person to whom the letter was addressed he half questioned and luttrell who saw the drift of the question nodded gravely  no doubt said ruth  now you will acknowledge i am sure madam that such a wrapper would be a document of the greatest importance as important indeed as the letter itself since we could depend upon it finally to clear up this point on which we differ you will admit so much i think  why yes she answered but her voice faltered a little and her glance was not quite so fearless she too saw at last the pit he had dug for her he leaned forward smiling quietly his voice impressively subdued and launched the bolt that was to annihilate the credibility of the story she had told  can you then explain how it comes that that wrapper has been suppressed can you tell us howthe matter being as you state itin very selfdefence against the dangers of keeping such a letter your brother did not also keep that wrapper  her eyes fell away from his face they turned to albemarle who sat scowling again and from him they flickered unsteadily to phelips and luttrell and lastly to richard who very white and with set teeth stood listening to the working of his ruin  i i do not know she faltered at last  ah said trenchard drawing a deep breath he turned to the bench need i suggest what was the needthe urgent needfor suppressing that wrapper quoth he need i say what name was inscribed upon it i think not your graces keen insight and yours gentlemen will determine what was probable  sir rowland now stood forward addressing albemarle will your grace permit me to offer my explanation of this  albemarle banged the table his patience was at an end since he came now to believeas trenchard had earlier suggestedthat he had been played upon by ruth  too many explanations have i heard already sir he answered he turned to one of his secretaries in his sudden access of choler he forgot his colleagues altogether the prisoners are committed for trial said he harshly and trenchard breathed freely at last but the next instant he caught his breath again for a ringing voice was heard without demanding to see his grace of albemarle at once and the voice was the voice of anthony wilding    chapter xi the marplot   mr wildings appearance produced as many different emotions as there were individuals present he made the company a sweeping bow on his admission by albemarles orders a bow which was returned by a stare from one and all diana eyed him in amazement ruth in hope richard averted his glance from that of his brotherinlaw whilst sir rowland met it with a scowl of enmitythey had not come face to face since the occasion of that encounter in which sir rowlands selflove had been so rudely handled albemarles face expressed a sort of satisfaction which was reflected on the countenances of phelips and luttrell whilst trenchard never thought of attempting to dissemble his profound dismay and this dismay was shared though not in so deep a measure by wilding himself trenchards presence gave him pause for he had been far indeed from dreaming that his friend had a hand in this affair at sight of him all was made clear to mr wilding at once he saw the role which trenchard had assumed on this occasion saw to the bottom of the motives that had inspired him to take the bull by the horns and level against richard and blake this accusation before they had leisure to level it against himself  his quick wits having fathomed trenchards motive mr wilding was deeply touched by this proof of friendship and for a second as deeply nonplussed at loss now how to discharge the task on which he came   you are very choicely come mr wilding said albemarle you will be able to resolve me certain doubts which have been set on foot by these traitors  that said mr wilding is the purpose for which i am here news reached me of the arrest that had been made may i beg that your grace will place me in possession of the facts that have so far transpired  it was one of his secretaries who at albemarles bidding gave wilding the information that he craved he listened gravely then before albemarle had time to question him on the score of the name that might have been upon the enfolding wrapper of the letter he begged that he might confer apart a moment with mr trenchard  but mr wilding said colonel luttrell surprised not to hear the immediate denial of the imputation they had expected we should first like to hear  by your leave sirs wilding interrupted i should prefer that you ask me nothing until i have consulted with mr trenchard he saw luttrells frown observed sir edward shift his wig to scratch his head in sheer perplexity and caught the foreshadowing of denial on the dukes face so without giving any of them time to say him nay he added quickly and very seriously i am begging this in the interests of justice your grace has told me that some lingering doubt still haunts your mind upon the subject of this letterthe other charges can matter little apart from that treasonable document it lies within my power to resolve such doubts most clearly and finally but i warn you sirs that not one word will i utter in this connection until i have had speech with mr trenchard  there was about his mien and voice a firmness that forewarned albemarle that to insist would be worse than idle a slight pause followed his words and luttrell leaned across to whisper in his graces ear from the dukes other side sir edward bent his head forward till it almost touched those of his companions blake watched and was most foolishly impatient  your grace will never allow this he cried  eh said albemarle scowling at him  if you allow those two villains to consort together we are all undone the baronet protested and ruined what chance there was of albemarles not consenting  it was the one thing needed to determine albemarle like the stubborn man he was there was naught he detested so much as to have his course dictated to him more than that in sir rowlands anxiety that wilding and trenchard should not be allowed to confer apart he smoked a fear on sir rowlands part based upon the baronets consciousness of his own guilt he turned from him with a sneering smile and without so much as consulting his associates he glanced at wilding and waved his hand towards the door  pray do as you suggest mr wilding said he but i depend upon you not to tax our patience  i shall not keep mr trenchard a moment longer than is necessary said wilding giving no hint of the second meaning in his words  he stepped to the door opened it himself and signed to trenchard to pass out the old player obeyed him readily if in silence an usher closed the door after them and in silence they walked together to the end of the passage  where is your horse nick quoth wilding abruptly  what a plague do you mean where is my horse flashed trenchard what midsummer frenzy is this damn you for a marplot anthony what a pox are you thinking of to thrust yourself in here at such a time  i had no knowledge you were in the affair said wilding you should have told me his manner was brisk to the point of dryness however there is still time to get you out of it where is your horse  damn my horse answered tren chard in a passion you have spoiled everything  on the contrary said mr wilding tartly it seems you had done that very thoroughly before i arrived whilst i am touched by the regard for me which has misled you into turning the tables on blake and westmacott yet i do blame you for this betrayal of the cause  there was no help for it  why no and that is why you should have left matters where they stood  trenchard stamped his foot indeed he almost danced in the excess of his vexation left them where they stood he echoed body o me where are your wits left them where they stood and at any moment you might have been taken unawares as a consequence of this accusation being lodged against you by richard or by blake then the cause would have been betrayed indeed  not more so than it is now  not less at least snapped the player you give me credit for no more wit than yourself do you think that i am the man to do things by halves i have betrayed the plot to albemarle but do you imagine i have made no provision for what must follow  provision echoed wilding staring  aye provision god lack what do you suppose albemarle will do  dispatch a messenger to whitehall with the letter within an hour  you perceive it do you and where the plague do you think nick trenchardll be what time that messenger rides  mr wilding understood aye you may stare sneered trenchard a letter that has once been stolen may be stolen again the courier must go by way of walford i had in my mind arranged the spot close by the ford where i should fall upon him rob him of his dispatches and take himbound hand and foot if necessaryto vallanceys who lives close by and there id leave him until word came that the duke had landed  that the duke had landed cried wilding you talk as though the thing were imminent  and imminent it is for aught we know he may be in england already  mr wilding laughed impatiently you must forever be building on these crackbrained rumours nick said he  rumours roared the other rumours ha he checked his wild scorn and proceeded in a different key i was forgetting you do not know the contents of that stolen letter  wilding started underlying his disbelief in the talk of the countryside and even in the military measures which by the kings orders were being taken in the west was an uneasy dread lest they should prove to be well founded lest argyles operations in scotland should be but the forerunner of a rash and premature invasion by monmouth he knew the duke was surrounded by such reckless foolhardy counsellors as grey and fergusonand yet he could not think the duke would ruin all by coming before he had definite word that his friends were ready he looked at trenchard now with anxious eyes  have you seen the letter nick he asked and almost dreaded the reply  albemarle showed it me an hour ago said trenchard  and it contains  the news we fear it is in the dukes own hand and intimates that he will follow it in a few daysin a few days man in person  mr wilding clenched teeth and hands god help us all then he muttered grimly  meanwhile quoth trenchard bringing him back to the point there is this precious business here i had as choice a plan as could have been devised and it must have succeeded had you not come blundering into it to mar it all at the last moment that fat fool albemarle had swallowed my impeachment like a draught of muscadine do you hear me he ended sharply for mr wilding stood bemused his thoughts plainly wandering  he let his hand fall upon trenchards shoulder no said he i wasnt listening no matter for even had i known the full extent of your scheme i still must have interfered  for the sake of mistress westmacotts blue eyes no doubt sneered trenchard pah wherever theres a woman theres the loss of a man  for the sake of mistress wildings blue eyes his friend corrected him ill allow no brother of hers to hang in my place  it will be interesting to see how you will rescue him  by telling the truth to albemarle  hell not believe it  i shall prove it said wilding quietly trenchard swung round upon him in mingled anger and alarm for him you shall not do it he snarled it is nothing short of treason to the duke to get yourself laid by the heels at such a time as this  i hope to avoid it answered wilding confidently  avoid it how not by staying longer here in talk that will ruin all away with you trenchard  by my soul no answered trenchard ill not leave you if i have got you into this ill help to get you out again or stay in it with you  bethink you of monmouth wilding admonished him  damn monmouth was the vicious answer i am here and here i stay  get to horse you fool and ride to walford as you proposed there to ambush the messenger the letter will go to whitehall none the less in spite of what i shall tell albemarle if things go well with me i shall join you at vallanceys before long  why if that is your intention said trenchard i had better stay and we can ride together it will make it less uncertain for you  but less certain for you  the more reason why i should remain  the door of the hall was suddenly flung open at the far end of the corridor and albemarles booming voice impatiently raised reached them where they stood  in any case added trenchard it seems there is no help for it now  mr wilding shrugged his shoulders but otherwise dissembled his vexation up the passage floated the constables voice calling them  side by side they moved down and side by side they stepped once more into the presence of christopher monk and his associates  sirs you have not been in haste was the dukes illhumoured greeting  we have tarried a little that we might make an end the sooner answered trenchard dryly and this was the first indication he gave mr wilding of how naturallylike the inimitable actor that he washe had slipped into his new role  albemarle waved the frivolous rejoinder aside come mr wilding said he let us hear what you may have to say you are not i take it about to urge any reasons why these rogues should not be committed  indeed your grace said wilding that is what i am about to urge  blake and richard looked at him suddenly and from him to trenchard but it was only ruth whose eyes were shrewd enough to observe the altered demeanour of the latter her hopes rose founded upon this oddly assorted pair already in anticipation she was stirred by gratitude towards wilding and it was in impatient and almost wondering awe that she waited for him to proceed  i take it sir he said without waiting for albemarle to express any of the fresh astonishment his countenance manifested that the accusation against these gentlemen rests entirely upon the letter which you have been led to believe was addressed to mr westmacott  the duke scowled a moment before replying why said he if it could be shownirrefutably shownthat the letter was not addressed to either of them that would no doubt establish the truth of what they saythat they possessed themselves of the letter in the interests of his majesty he turned to luttrell and phelips and they nodded their concurrence with his view of the matter but he continued if you are proposing to prove any such thing i think you will find it difficult  mr wilding drew a crumpled paper from his pocket when the courier whom they robbed as they have correctly informed you said he quietly suspected their design upon the contents of his wallet he bethought him of removing the wrapper from the letter so that in case the letter were seized by them it should prove nothing against any man in particular he stuffed the wrapper into the lining of his hat preserving it as a proof of his good faith against the time when he should bring the letter to its destination or come to confess that it had been taken from him that wrapper the courier brought to me and i have it here the evidence it will give should be more than sufficient to warrant your restoring these unjustly accused gentlemen their liberty  the courier took it to you echoed albemarle stupefaction in his glance but why to you  because said wilding and with his left hand he placed the wrapper before albemarle whilst his right dropped again to his pocket the letter as you may see was addressed to me  the quiet manner in which he made the announcement conveyed almost as great a shock as the announcement itself  albemarle took up the wrapper luttrell and phelips craned forward to join him in his scrutiny of it they compared the two paper with paper writing with writing then monk flung one and the other down in front of him  what lies have i been hearing then he demanded furiously of trenchard slife ill make an example of you arrest me that roguearrest them both and he half rose from his seat his trembling hand pointing to wilding and trenchard  two of the tythingmen stirred to do his bidding but in the same instant albemarle found himself looking into the round nozzle of a pistol  if said mr wilding a finger is laid upon mr trenchard or me i shall have the extreme mortification of being compelled to shoot your grace  his pleasantly modulated voice was as deliberate and calm as if he were offering the bench a pinch of snuff albemarles dark visage crimsoned his eyes became at once wicked and afraid sir edwards cheeks turned pale his glance grew startled luttrell alone vigilant and dangerous preserved his calm but the situation baffled even him  behind the two friends the tythingmen had come to a terrorstricken halt diana had risen from her chair in the excitement of the moment and had drawn close to ruth who looked on with parted lips and bosom that rose and fell even blake could not stifle his admiration of mr wildings coolness and address richard on the other hand was concerned only with thoughts for himself wondering how it would fare with him if wilding and trenchard succeeded in getting away  nick said mr wilding will you desire those catchpolls behind us to stand aside if your grace raises your voice to call for help if indeed any measures are taken calculated to lead to our capture i can promise your gracenotwithstanding my profound reluctance to use violencethat they will be the last measures you will take in life be good enough to open the door nick and to see that the key is on the outside  trenchard who was by way of enjoying himself now stepped briskly down the hall to do as his friend bade him with a wary eye on the tythingmen but never so much as a finger did they dare to lift mr wildings calm was too deadly they had seen a man in earnest before this and they knew his appearance now from the doorway trenchard called mr wilding  i must be going your grace said the latter very courteously but i shall not be so wanting in deference to his majestys august representatives as to turn my back upon you saying which he walked backwards holding his pistol level until he had reached trenchard and the door there he paused and made them a deep bow his manner the more mocking in that there was no tinge of mockery perceptible your very obedient servant said he and stepped outside trenchard turned the key withdrew it from the lock and standing on tiptoe thrust it upon the ledge of the lintel  instantly a clamour arose within the chamber but the two friends never stayed to listen down the passage they sped at the double and out into the courtyard here ruths groom mounted himself was walking his mistresss and dianas horses up and down whilst he waited yonder one of sir edwards stableboys was holding mr wildings roan two or three men of the somerset militia in their red and yellow liveries lounged by the gates and turned uninterested eyes upon these newcomers  wilding approached his wifes groom get down he said i need your horseon the kings business get down i say he added impatiently upon noting the fellows stare and seizing his leg he helped him to dismount by almost dragging him from the saddle up with you nick said he and nick very promptly mounted your mistress will be here presently wilding told the groom and turning on his heel strode to his own mare a moment later trenchard and he vanished through the gateway with a tremendous clatter just as the lordlieutenant colonel luttrell sir edward phelips the constable the tythingmen sir rowland richard and the ladies made their appearance  ruth pushed her way quickly to the front she feared lest her horse and her cousins being at hand might be used for the pursuit so urging diana to do the same she snatched her reins from the hands of the dumbfounded groom and leapt nimbly to the saddle  after them roared albemarle and the constable with two of his men made a dash for the gateway to raise the hue and cry whilst the militiamen watched them in stupid inactive wonder damnation mistress thundered the duke in everincreasing passion hold your nag hold your nag woman for ruths horse had become unmanageable and was caracoling about the yard between the men and the gateway in such a manner that they dared not attempt to win past her  you have scared him with your bellowing she panted tugging at the bridle and all but backed into the constable who had been endeavouring to get round behind her the beast continued its wild prancing and the duke abated nothing in his furious profanity until suddenly the groom having relinquished to diana the reins of the other horse sprang to ruths assistance and caught her bridle in a firm grasp which brought the animal to a standstill  you fool she hissed at him and half raised her whip to strike but checked on the impulse bethinking her in time that after all what the poor lad had done he had done thinking her distressed  the constable and a couple of his fellows won through others were rousing the stable and getting to horse and in the courtyard all was bustle and commotion meanwhile however mr wilding and trenchard had made the most of their start and were thundering through the town    chapter xii at the ford   as mr wilding and nick trenchard rode helltoleather through taunton streets they never noticed a horseman at the door of the red lion inn but the horseman noticed them he looked up at the sound of their wild approach started upon recognizing them and turned in his saddle as they swept past him to call upon them excitedly to stop  hi he shouted nick trenchard hi wilding then seeing that they either did not hear or did not heed him he loosed a volley of oaths wheeled his horse about drove home the spurs and started in pursuit out of the town he followed them and along the road towards walford shouting and clamouring at first afterwards in a grim and angry silence  now despite their natural anxiety for their own safety wilding and trenchard had by no means abandoned their project of taking cover by the ford to await the messenger whom albemarle and the others would no doubt be sending to whitehall and this mad fellow thundering after them seemed in a fair way to mar their plan as they reluctantly passed the spot they had marked out for their ambush splashed through the ford and breasted the rising ground beyond they took counsel they determined to stand and meet this rash pursuer trenchard calmly opined that if necessary they must shoot him he was i fear a bloodyminded fellow at bottom although it is true he justified himself now by pointing out that this was no time to hesitate at trifles partly because they talked and partly because the gradient was steep and their horses needed breathing they slackened rein and the horseman behind them came tearing through the water of the ford and lessened the distance considerably in the next few minutes  he bethought him of using his lungs once more hi wilding hold damn you  he curses you in a most intimate manner quoth trenchard  wilding reined in and turned in the saddle his voice has a familiar sound said he he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked down the slope at the pursuer who came on crouching low upon the withers of his goaded beast  wait the fellow shouted i have newsnews for you  its vallancey cried wilding suddenly trenchard too had drawn rein and was looking behind him instead of expressing relief at the discovery that this was not an enemy he swore at the trouble to which they had so needlessly put themselves and he was still at his vituperations when vallancey came up with them red in the face and very angry cursing them roundly for the folly of their mad career and for not having stopped when he bade them  it was no doubt discourteous said mr wilding but we took you for some friend of the lordlieutenants  are they after you quoth vallancey his face of a sudden very startled  like enough said trenchard if they have found their horses yet  forward then vallancey urged them in excitement and he picked up his reins again you shall hear my news as we ride  not so said trenchard we have business here down yonder at the ford  business what business  they told him and scarce had they got the words out than he cut in impatiently thats no matter now  not yet perhaps said mr wilding but it will be if that letter gets to whitehall  odso was the impatient retort theres other news travelling to whitehall that will make smallbeer of thisand belike its well on its way there already  what news is that asked trenchard vallancey told them the duke has landedhe came ashore this morning at lyme  the duke quoth mr wilding whilst trenchard merely stared what duke  what duke lord you weary me what dukes be there the duke of monmouth man  monmouth they uttered the name in a breath but is this really true asked wilding or is it but another rumour  remember the letter your friends intercepted trenchard bade him  i am not forgetting it said wilding  its no rumour vallancey assured them i was at white lackington three hours ago when the news came to george speke and i was riding to carry it to you going by way of taunton that i might drop word of it for our friends at the red lion  trenchard needed no further convincing he looked accordingly dismayed but wilding found it still almost impossiblein spite of what already he had learntto credit this amazing news it was hard to believe the duke of monmouth mad enough to spoil all by this sudden and unheralded precipitation  you heard the news at whitp lackington said he slowly who carried it thither  there were two messengers answered vallancey with restrained impatience and they were heywood darewho has been appointed paymaster to the dukes forcesand mr chamberlain  mr wilding was observed for once to change colour he gripped vallancey by the wrist you saw them he demanded and his voice had a husky unusual sound you saw them  with these two eyes answered vallancey and i spoke with them  it was true then there was no room for further doubt  wilding looked at trenchard who shrugged his shoulders and made a wry face i never thought but that we were working in the service of a hairbrain said he contemptuously  vallancey proceeded to details dare and chamberlain he informed them came off the dukes own frigate at daybreak today they were put ashore at seatown and they rode straight to mr spekes with the news returning afterwards to lyme  what men has the duke with him did you learn asked wilding  not more than a hundred or so from what dare told us  a hundred god help us all and is england to be conquered with a hundred men oh this is midsummer frenzy  he counts on all true protestants to flock to his banner put in trenchard and it was not plain whether he expressed a fact or sneered at one  does he bring money and arms at least asked wilding  i did not ask answered vallancey but dare told us that three vessels had come over so that it is to be supposed he brings some manner of provision with him  it is to be hoped so vallancey but hardly to be supposed quoth trenchard and then he touched wilding on the arm and pointed with his whip across the fields towards taunton a cloud of dust was rising from between tall hedges where ran the road i think it were wise to be moving at least this sudden landing of james scott relieves my mind in the matter of that letter  wilding having taken a look at the floating dust that announced the oncoming of their pursuers was now lost in thought vallancey who beyond excitement at the news of which he was the bearer seemed to have no opinion of his own as to the wisdom or folly of the dukes sudden arrival looked from one to the other of these two men whom he had known as the prime secret agents in the west and waited trenchard moved his horse a few paces nearer the hedge whence he whither now anthony he asked suddenly  you may ask indeed exclaimed wilding and his voice was as bitter as ever trenchard had heard it s heart we are in it now we had best make for lymeif only that we may attempt to persuade this crackbrained boy to ship back to holland again and ship ourselves with him  theres sense in you at last grumbled trenchard but i misdoubt me hell turn back after having come so far have you any money he asked he could be very practical at times  a guinea or two but i can get money at ilminster  and how do you propose to reach ilminster with these gentlemen by way of cutting us off  well double back as far as the crossroads said wilding promptly and strike south over swell hill for hatch if we ride hard we can do it easily and have little fear of being followed theyll naturally take it we have made for bridgwater  they acted on the suggestion there and then vallancey going with them for his task was now accomplished and he was all eager to get to lyme to kiss the hand of the protestant duke they rode hard as wilding had said they must and they reached the junction of the roads before their pursuers hove in sight here wilding suddenly detained them again the road ahead of them ran straight for almost a mile so that if they took it now they were almost sure to be seen presently by the messengers on their right a thickly grown coppice stretched from the road to the stream that babbled in the hollow he gave it as his advice that they should lie hidden there until those who hunted them should have gone by obviously that was the only plan and his companions instantly adopted it they found a way through a gate into an adjacent field and from this they gained the shelter of the trees trenchard neglectful of his finery and oblivious of the ubiquitous brambles left his horse in vallanceys care and crept to the edge of the thicket that he might take a peep at the pursuers  they came up very soon six militiamen in lobster coats with yellow facings and a sergeant which was what mr trenchard might have expected there was however something else that mr trenchard did not expect something that afforded him considerable surprise at the head of the party rode sir rowland blakeobviously leading itand with him was richard westmacott amongst them went a man in grey clothes whom mr trenchard rightly conjectured to be the messenger riding for whitehall he thought with a smile of what a handful he and wilding would have had had they waited to rob that messenger of the incriminating letter that he bore then he checked his smile to consider again how sir rowland blake came to head that party he abandoned the problem as the little troop swept unhesitatingly round to the left and went pounding along the road that led northwards to bridgwater clearly never doubting which way their quarry had sped  as for sir rowland blakes connection with this pursuit the town gallant had by his earnestness not only convinced colonel luttrell of his loyalty and devotion to king james but had actually gone so far as to beg that he might be allowed to prove that same loyalty by leading the soldiers to the capture of those selfconfessed traitors mr wilding and mr trenchard from his knowledge of their haunts he was confident he assured colonel luttrell that he could be of service to the king in this matter the fierce sincerity of his purpose shone through his words luttrell caught the accent of hate in sir rowlands tense voice and being a shrewd man he saw that if mr wilding was to be taken an enemy would surely be the best pursuer to accomplish it so he prevailed and gave him the trust he sought in spite of albemarles expressed reluctance and never did bloodhound set out more relentlessly purposeful upon a scent than did sir rowland follow now in what he believed to be the track of this man who stood between him and ruth westmacott until ruth was widowed sir rowlands hopes of her must lie fallow and so it was with a zest that he flung himself into the task of widowing her  as the party passed out of view round the angle of the white road trenchard made his way back to wilding to tell him what he had seen and to lay before him for his enucleation the problem of blakes being the leader of it but wilding thought little of blake and cared little of what he might be the leader  well stay here said he until they have passed the crest of the hill  this trenchard told him was his own purpose for to leave their concealment earlier would be to reveal themselves to any of the troopers who might happen to glance over his shoulder  and so they waited some ten minutes or so and then walked their horses slowly and carefully forward through the trees towards the road wilding was alongside and slightly ahead of trenchard vallancey followed close upon their tails suddenly as wilding was about to put his mare at the low stone wall trenchard leaned forward and caught his bridle  ss he hissed horses  and now that they halted they heard the hoofbeats clear and close at hand the crackling of undergrowth and the rustle of the leaves through which they had thrust their passage had deafened their ears to other sounds until this moment they checked and waited where they stood barely screened by the few boughs that still might intervene between them and the open not daring to advance and not daring to retreat lest their movements should draw attention to themselves they remained absolutely still scarcely breathing their only hope being that if these who came should chance to be enemies they might ride on without looking to right or left it was so slender a hope that wilding looked to the priming of his pistols whilst trenchard who had none loosened his sword in its scabbard nearer came the riders  there are not more than three whispered trenchard who had been listening intently and mr wilding nodded but said nothing  another moment and the little party was abreast of those watchers a dark brown ridinghabit flashed into their line of vision and a blue one laced with gold at sight of the first mr wildings eyelids flickered he had recognized it for ruths with whom rode diana whilst some twenty paces or so behind came jerry the groom they were returning to bridgwater  they came along looking neither to right nor to left as the three men had hoped they would and they were all but past when suddenly wilding gave his roan a touch of the spur and bounded forward dianas horse swerved so that it nearly threw her ruth slightly ahead reined in at once so too did the groom in the rear and so violently in his sudden fear of highwaymen that he brought his horse on to its hind legs and had it prancing and rearing madly about the road so that he was hard put to it to keep his seat  ruth looked round as mr wildings voice greeted her  mistress wilding he called to her a moment if i may detain you  you have eluded them she cried entirely off her guard in her surprise at seeing him and there echoed through her words a note of genuine gladness that almost disconcerted her husband for a moment the next instant a crimson flush overspread her pale face and her eyes were veiled from him vexation in her heart at having betrayed the lively satisfaction it afforded her to see him safe when she feared him captured already or at least upon the point of capture  she had admired him almost unconsciously for his daring at the town hall that day when his strong calm had stood out in such sharp contrast to the fluster and excitement of the men about him of them all indeed it had seemed to her in those stressful moments that he was the only man and she wasalthough she did not realize itin danger of being proud of him then again the thing he had done he had come deliberately to thrust his head into the lions maw that he might save her brother it was possible that he had done it in answer to the entreaties which she had earlier feared she had poured into deaf ears or it was possible that he had done it spurred by his sense of right and justice which would not permit him to allow another to suffer in his steadhowever much that other might be caught in the very toils that he had prepared for mr wilding himself her admiration then was swelled by gratitude and it was a compound of these that had urged her to hinder the tythingmen from winning past her until he and trenchard should have got well away  afterwards when with diana and her groomon a horse which sir edward phelips insisted upon lending themshe rode homeward from taunton there was diana to keep alive the spark of kindness that glowed at last for wilding in ruths breast miss horton extolled his bravery his chivalry his nobility and ended by expressing her envy of ruth that she should have won such a man amongst men for her husband and wondered what it might be that kept ruth from claiming him for her own as was her right ruth had answered little but she had ridden very thoughtful there was that in the past she found it hard to forgive wilding and yet she would now have welcomed an opportunity of thanking him for what he had done of expressing to him something of the respect he had won in her eyes by his act of selfdenunciation to save her brother this chance it seemed was given her for there he stood with head bared before her and already she thought no longer of seizing the chance vexed as she was at having been surprised into a betrayal of feelings whose warmth she had until that moment scarce estimated  in answer to her cry of you have eluded them he waved a hand towards the rising ground and the road to bridgwater  they passed that way but a few moments since said he and by the rate at which they were travelling they should be nearing newton by now in their great haste to catch me they could not pause to look for me so close at hand he added with a smile and for that i am thankful  she sat her horse and answered nothing which threw her cousin out of all patience with her come jerry diana called to the groom we will walk our horses up the hill  you are very good madam said mr wilding and he bowed to the withers of his roan  ruth said nothing expressed neither approval nor disapproval of dianas withdrawal and the latter with a word of greeting to wilding went ahead followed by jerry who had regained control by now of the beast he bestrode wilding watched them until they turned the corner then he walked his mare slowly forward until he was alongside ruth  before i go said he there is something i should like to say his dark eyes were sombre his manner betrayed some hesitation  the diffidence of his tone proved startling to her by virtue of its unusualness what might it portend she wondered and sought with grave eyes to read his baffling countenance and then a wild alarm swept into her and shook her spirit in its grip there was something of which until this moment she had not thoughtsomething connected with the fateful matter of that letter it had stood as a barrier between them her buckler her sole defence against him it had been to her what its sting is to the beea thing which if once used in selfdefence is selfdestructive not indeed that she had used it as her sting it had been forced from her by the machinations of trenchard but used it had been and was done with she had it no longer that with it she might hold him in defiance and it did not occur to her that he was no longer in case to invoke the law  her face grew stony a dry glitter came to her blue eyes she cast a glance over her shoulder at diana and her servant wilding observed it and read what was passing in her mind indeed it was not to be mistaken no more than what is passing in the mind of the recruit who looks behind him in the act of charging his lips half smiled  of what are you afraid he asked her  i am not afraid she answered in husky accents that belied her  perhaps to reassure her perhaps because he thought of his companions lurking in the thicket and cared not to have them for his audience he suggested they should go a little way in the direction her cousin had taken she wheeled her horse and side by side they ambled up the dusty road  the thing i have to tell you said he presently concerns myself  does it concern me she asked him coldly and her coolness was urged partly by her newborn fears partly to counterbalance such impression as her illjudged show of gladness at his safety might have made upon his mind he flashed her a sidelong glance the long white fingers of his right hand toying thoughtfully with a ringlet of the dark brown hair that fell upon the shoulders of his scarlet coat   surely madam he answered dryly what concerns a man may well concern his wife  she bowed her head her eyes upon the road before her true said she her voice expressionless i had forgot  he reined in and turned to look at her her horse moved on a pace or two then came to a halt apparently of its own accord  i do protest said he you treat me less kindly than i deserve he urged his mare forward until he had come up with her again and then drew rein once more i think that i may lay some claim toat leastyour gratitude for what i did today  it is my inclination to be grateful said she she was very wary of him forgive me if i am still mistrustful  but of what he cried a thought impatiently  of you what ends did you seek to serve was it to save richard that you came  unless you think that it was to save blake he said ironically what other ends do you conceive i could have served she made him no answer and so he resumed after a pause i rode to taunton to serve you for two reasons because you asked me and because i would have no innocent men suffer in my steadnot even though as these men they were but caught in their own toils hoist with the petard they had charged for me beyond these two motives i had no other thought in ruining myself  ruining yourself she cried yes it was true but she had not thought of it until this moment there had been so much to think of  is it not ruin to be outlawed to have a price set upon your head as will no doubt a price be set on mine when albemarles messenger shall have reached whitehall is it not ruin to have my lands and all i own made forfeit to the state to find myself a beggar hunted and proscribed forgive me that i harass you with this catalogue of my misfortunes youll say no doubt that i have brought them upon myself by compelling you against your will to marry me  ill not deny that it is in my mind said she and of set purpose stifled pity  he sighed and looked at her again but she would not meet his eye else its whimsical expression might have intrigued her can you deny my magnanimity i wonder said he and spoke almost as one amused all i had i sacrificed to do your will to save your brother from the snare of his own contriving against me i wonder do you yet realize how much i sacrificed today at taunton i wonder and he paused looking at her and waiting for some word from her but she had none for him  clearly you do not else i think you would show me if only a pretence of kindness she was looking at him at last her eyes less hard they seemed to ask him to explain when you came this morning with the tale of how the tables had been turned upon your brother of how he was caught in his own springe and the letter found in his keeping was before the kings folk at taunton with every appearance of having been addressed to him and not a tittle of evidence to show that it had been meant for me do you know what news it was you brought me he paused a second looking at her from narrowing eyes then he answered his own question you brought me the news that you were mine to take whensoeer i pleased whilst that letter was in your hands it gave you the power to make me your obedient slave you might blow upon me as you listed whilst you held it and i was a vane that must turn to your blowing for my honours sake and for the sake of the cause in which i worked through no rashness of mine must that letter come into the hands of the kings friends else was i dishonoured it was an effective barrier between us so long as you possessed that letter you might pipe as you pleased and i must dance to the tune you set and then this morning what you came to tell me was that things were changed that it was mine to call the tune had i had the strength to be a villain you had been mine now and your brother and sir rowland might have hanged on the rope of their own weaving  she looked at him in a startled almost shamefaced manner this was an aspect of the case she had not considered  you realize it i see he said and smiled wistfully then perhaps you realize why you found me so unwilling to do the thing you craved having treated me ungenerously you came to cast yourself upon my generosity asking methough i scarcely think you understoodto beggar myself of life itself with all it held for me god knows i make no pretence to virtue and yet i think i had been something more than human had i not refused you and the bargain you offereda bargain that you would never be called upon to fulfil if i did the thing you asked  at last she interrupted him she could bear it no longer  i had not thought of it she cried it was a piteous wail that broke from her i swear i had not thought of that i was all distraught for poor richards sake oh mr wilding she turned to him holding out a hand her eyes shone filmed with moisture i shall have a kindness for you all my days for your generosity today it was lamentably weak far from the hot expressions which she forced it to replace  yes i was generous he admitted we will move on as far as the crossroads again they ambled gently forward up the slope from the ford diana and jerry were slowly climbing not another human being was in sight ahead or behind them after you left me he continued your memory and your entreaties lingered with me i gave the matter of our position thought and it seemed to me that all was monstrously illdone i loved you ruth i needed you and you disdained me my love was aster of me but neath your disdain it was transmuted oddly he checked the passion that was vibrating in his voice and resumed after a pause in the calm slow tones soft and musical that were his own there is scarce the need for so much recapitulation when the power was mine i bent you unfairly to my will you did as much by me when the power suddenly became yours it was a strange war between us and i accepted its conditions today when the power was mine again mine to bring you at last to subjection behold i have capitulated at your bidding and all that i heldincluding your own selfhave i relinquished it is perhaps fitting haply i am punished for having wed you before i had wooed you again his tone changed it grew more cold more matteroffact i rode this way a little while ago a hunted man my only hope to reach home and collect what moneys and valuables i could carry and make for the coast to find a vessel bound for holland i have been engaged as you know in stirring up rebellion to check the iniquities and persecutions that are toward in a land i love ill not weary you with details time was needed for this as for all things and by next spring perhaps had matters gone well this vineyard that so carefully and secretly i have been tending would have been maybe in condition to bear fruit even now in the hour of my flight i learn that others have come to force this delicate growth into sudden maturity there soon ripe soon rotten the duke of monmouth has landed at lyme this morning i am riding to him  to what end she cried and he saw in her face a dismay that amounted almost to fear and he wondered was it for him  to place my sword at his service were i not encompassed by this ruin i should not have stirred a foot in that directionso rash so foredoomed to failure is this invasion as it ishe shrugged and laughedit is the only hopeall forlorn though it may befor me  the trammels she had imposed upon her soul fell away at that like bonds of cobweb she laid her hand upon his wrists tears stood in her eyes her lips quivered  anthony forgive me she besought him he trembled under her touch under the caress of her voice and at the sound of his name for the first time upon her lips  what have i to forgive he asked  the thing that i did in the matter of that letter  you poor child said he smiling gently upon her you did it in selfdefence  yet say that you forgive mesay it before you go she begged him  he considered her gravely a moment to what end he asked do you imagine that i have talked so much to the end that i might show you that however i may have wronged you i have at the last made some amends and that for the sake of this the truest proof of penitence i may have your forgiveness ere i go  she was weeping softly it was an ill day on which we met she sighed  for youaye  nayfor you  well say for both of us then he compromised see ruth your cousin grows weary and i have a couple of comrades who are no doubt impatient to be gone it may not be good for us to tarry in these parts some amends i have made but there is one crowning wrong which i have done you for which there is but one amend to make he paused he steadied himself before continuing in his attempt to render his voice cold and commonplace he went near to achieving harshness it may be that this crackbrained rebellion of which the torch is already alight will if it does no other good in england at least make a widow of you when that has come to pass when i have thus repaired the wrong i did you i hope youll bear me as kindly as may be in your thought goodbye my ruth i would you might have loved me i sought to force it he smiled ever so wanly perhaps that was my mistake it is an ill thing to eat ones hay while it is grass he raised to his lips the little gloved hand that still rested on his wrist god keep you ruth he murmured  she sought to answer him but something choked her a sob was all she achieved had he caught her to him in that moment there is little doubt but that she had yielded perhaps he knew it and knowing it kept the tighter rein upon desire she was as metal molten in the crucible to be moulded by his craftsmans hands into any pattern that he chose but the crucible was the crucible of pity not of love that too he knew and knowing it forbore  he dropped her hand doffed his hat and wheeling his horse about touched it with the spur and rode back towards the thicket where his friends awaited him as he left her she too wheeled about as if to follow him she strove to command her voice that she might recall him but at that same moment trenchard hearing his returning hoofs thrust out into the road with vallancey following at his heels the old players harsh voice reached her where she stood and it was querulous with impatience  what a plague do you mean dallying here at such a time anthony he cried to which vallancey added in gods name let us push on  at that she checked her impulseit may even be that she mistrusted it she paused lingering undecided for an instant then turning her horse once more she ambled up the slope to rejoin diana    chapter xiii pro religione et libertate   the evening was far advanced when mr wilding and his two companions descended to uplyme common from the heights whence as they rode they had commanded a clear view of the fair valley of the axe lying now under a thin opalescent veil of evening mist  they had paused at ilminster for fresh horses and there wilding had paid a visit to one of his agents from whom he had procured a hundred guineas thence they had come south at a sharp pace and with little said wilding was moody and thoughtful filled with chagrin at this unconscionable rashness of the man upon whom all his hopes were centred as they cantered briskly across uplyme common in the twilight they passed several bodies of countrymen all heading for the town and one group sent up a shout of god save the protestant duke as they rode past him  amen to that muttered mr wilding grimly for i am afraid that no man can  in the narrow lane by hay farm a horseman going in the opposite direction passed them at the gallop but they had met several such since leaving ilminster for indeed the news was spreading fast and the whole countryside was alive with messengers some on foot and some on horseback but all hurrying as if their lives depended on their haste  they made their way to the marketplace where monmouths declarationthat remarkable manifesto from the pen of fergusonhad been read some hours before thence having ascertained where his grace was lodged they made their way to the george inn  in coombe street they found the crowd so dense that they could but with difficulty open out a way for their horses through the human press not a window but was open and thronged with sightseersmostly women indeed for the men were in the press below on every hand resounded the cries of a monmouth a monmouth the protestant religion religion and liberty which latter were the words inscribed on the standard monmouth had set up that evening on the church cliffs  in truth wilding was amazed at what he saw and said as much to trenchard so pessimistic had been his outlook that he had almost expected to find the rebellion snuffed out by the time they reached lymeoftheking what had the authorities been about that they had permitted monmouth to come ashore or had vallanceys information been wrong in the matter of the numbers that accompanied the protestant champion wildings red coat attracted some attention in the dusk its colour was almost all that could be discerned of it  heres a militia captain for the duke cried one and others took up the cry and if it did nothing else it opened a way for them through that solid human mass and permitted them to win through to the yard of the george inn they found the spacious quadrangle thronged with men armed and unarmed and on the steps stood a tall wellknit soldierly man his hat rakishly cocked about whom a crowd of townsmen and country fellows were pressing with insistence at a glance mr wilding recognized captain vennerraised to the rank of colonel by monmouth on the way from holland  trenchard dismounted and taking a distracted stableboy by the arm bade him see to their horses the fellow endeavoured to swing himself free of the others tenacious grasp  let me go he cried i am for the duke  and so are we my fine rebel answered trenchard holding fast  let me go the lout insisted i am going to enlist  and so you shall when you have stabled our nags see to him vallancey he is brainsick with the fumes of war  the fellow protested but trenchards way was brisk and short and so protesting still he led away their cattle in the end vallancey going with him to see that he performed this last duty as a stableboy ere he too became a champion militant of the protestant cause trenchard sped after wilding who was elbowing his way through the yokels about the steps the glare of a newly lighted lamp from the doorway fell full upon his long white face as he advanced and venner espied and recognized him  mr wilding he cried and there was a glad ring in his voice for though cobblers tailors deserters from the militia potboys stableboys and shuffling yokels had been coming in in numbers during the past few hours since the declaration had been read this was the first gentleman that arrived to welcome monmouth the soldier stretched out a hand to grasp the newcomers his grace will see you this instant not a doubt of it he turned and called down the passage cragg a young man in a buff coat came forward and to him venner delivered wilding and trenchard that he might announce them to his grace  in the room that had been set apart for him abovestairs monmouth still sat at table he had just supped with but an indifferent appetite so fevered was he by the events of his landing he was excited with hopeinspired by the readiness with which the men of lyme and its neighbourhood had flocked to his bannerand fretted by anxiety that none of the gentry of the vicinity should yet have followed the example of the meaner folk in answer to the messages dispatched at dawn from seaton the board at which he sat was still cumbered with some glasses and platters and vestiges of his repast below him on his right sat fergusonthat prince of plottersvery busy with pen and ink his keen face almost hidden by his great periwig opposite were lord grey of werke and andrew fletcher of saltoun whilst standing at the foot of the table barely within the circle of candlelight from the branch on the polished oak was nathaniel wade the lawyer who had fled to holland on account of his alleged complicity in the rye house plot and was now returned a major in the dukes service erect and soldierly of figure girt with a great sword and with the butt of a pistol protruding from his belt he had little the air of a man whose methods of contention were forensic  you understand then major wade his grace was saying his voice pleasant and musical it is decided that the guns had best be got ashore forthwith and mounted  wade bowed i shall set about it at once your grace i shall not want for help have i your graces leave to go  monmouth nodded and as wade passed out ensign cragg entered to announce mr wilding and mr trenchard the duke rose to his feet his glance suddenly brightening fletcher and grey rose with him ferguson paid no heed absorbed in his task which he industriously continued  at last exclaimed the duke admit them sir  when they entered wilding coming first his hat under his arm the duke sprang to meet him a tall young figure lithe and slender as a blade of steel and of a steely strength for all his slimness he was dressed in a suit of purple that became him marvellously well and on his breast a star of diamonds flashed and smouldered like a thing of fire he was of an exceeding beauty of face wherein he mainly favoured that bold handsome woman that was his mother without however any of his mothers insipidity fine eyes a good nose straight and slender and a mouth which if sensual and indicating a lack of strength was beautifully shaped his chin was slightly cleft the shape of his face a delicate oval framed now in the waving masses of his brown wig some likeness to his late majesty was also discernible in spite of the wart out of which his uncle james made so much capital  there was a slight flush on his cheeks an added lustre in his eye as he took wildings hand and shook it heartily before wilding had time to kiss his graces  you are late he said but there was no reproach in his voice we had looked to find you here when we came ashore you had my letter  i had not your grace answered wilding very grave it was stolen  stolen cried the duke and behind him grey pressed forward whilst even ferguson paused in his writing to raise his piercing eyes and listen  it is no matter wilding reassured him although stolen it has but gone to whitehall today when it can add little to the news that is already on its way there  the duke laughed softly with a flash of white teeth and looked past wilding at trenchard some of the light faded out of his eyes they told me mr trenchard he began when wilding half turning to his friend explained  this is mr nicholas trenchardjohn trenchards cousin  i bid you welcome sir said the duke very agreeably and i trust your cousin follows you  alas said trenchard my cousin is in france and in a few brief words he related the matter of john trenchards homecoming on his acquittal and the trouble there had been connected with it  the duke received the news in silence he had expected good support from old spekes soninlaw indeed there was a promise that when he came john trenchard would bring fifteen hundred men from taunton he took a turn in the room deep in thought and there was a pause until ferguson rubbing his great roman nose asked suddenly had mr wilding seen the declaration mr wilding had not and thereupon the plotting parson who was proud of his composition would have read it to him there and then but that grey sourly told him the matter would keep and that they had other things to discuss with mr wilding  this the duke himself confirmed stating that there were matters on which he would be glad to have their opinion  he invited the newcomers to draw chairs to the table glasses were called for and a couple of fresh bottles of canary went round the board the talk was desultory for a few moments whilst wilding and trenchard washed the dust from their throats then monmouth broke the ice by asking them bluntly what they thought of his coming thus earlier than was at first agreed  wilding never hesitated in his reply frankly your grace said he i like it not at all  fletcher looked up sharply his clear intelligent eyes full upon wildings calm face his countenance expressing as little as did wildings ferguson seemed slightly taken aback greys thick lips were twisted in a sneering smile  faith said the latter with elaborate sarcasm in that case it only remains for us to ship again heave anchor and back to holland  it is what i should advise said wilding slowly and quietly if i thought there was a chance of my advice being taken he had a calm almost apathetic way of uttering startling things which rendered them doubly startling the sneer seemed to freeze on lord greys lips fletcher continued to stare but his eyes had grown more round ferguson scowled darkly the dukes boyish faceit was still very youthful despite his sixandthirty yearsexpressed a wondering consternation he looked at wilding and from wilding to the others and his glance seemed to entreat them to suggest an answer to him it was grey at last who took the matter up  you shall explain your meaning sir or we must hold you a traitor he exclaimed  king james does that already answered wilding with a quiet smile  dye mean the duke of york rumbled fergusons scottish accent with startling suddenness and monmouth nodded approval of the correction if ye mean that bloody papist and fratricide it were well so to speak of him had ye read the declaration  but fletcher cropped his speech in midgrowth he was ever a shorttempered man intolerant of irrelevancies  it were well perhaps said he his accent abundantly proclaiming him a fellow countryman of fergusons to keep to the matter before us mr wilding no doubt will state the reasons that exist or that he fancies may exist for giving advice which is hardly worthy of the cause to which he stands committed  aye fletcher said monmouth there is sense in you tell us what is in your mind mr wilding  it is in my mind your grace that this invasion is rash premature and illadvised  odds life cried grey and he swung angrily round fully to face the duke the nostrils of his heavy nose dilating are we to listen to this milksop prattle  nick trenchard who had hitherto been silent cleared his throat so noisily that he drew all eyes to himself  your grace mr wilding pursued his air calm and dignified and gathering more dignity from the circumstance that he proceeded as if there had been no interruption when i had the honour of conferring with you at the hague two months ago it was agreed that you should spend the summer in swedenaway from politics and scheming leaving the work of preparation to your accredited agents here that work i have been slowly but surely pushing forward it was not to be hurried men of position are not to be won over in a day men with anything to lose need some guarantee that they are not wantonly casting their possessions to the winds by next spring as was agreed all would have been ready delay could not have hurt you indeed with every day by which you delayed your coming you did good service to your cause you strengthened its prospects of success for every day the peoples burden of oppression and persecution grows more heavy and the peoples temper more short every day by the methods that he is pursuing king james brings himself into deeper hatred this hatred is spreading it was the business of myself and those others to help it on until from the cottage of the ploughman the infection of anger should have spread to the mansion of the squire had your grace but given me time as i entreated you and as you promised me you might have marched to whitehall with scarce the shedding of a drop of blood had your grace but waited until we were ready england would have so trembled at your landing that your uncles throne would have toppled over neath the shock as it is he shrugged his shoulders sighed and spread his hands leaving his sentence uncompleted  monmouth sat sobered by these sober words the intoxication that had come to him from the little measure of success that had attended the opening of the listing on church cliffs deserted him now he saw the thing stark and in its true proportions and not even the shouting of the folk in the streets below crying his name and acclaiming him their champion served to lighten the gloom that wildings words cast like a cloud over his volatile heart alas poor monmouth he was ever a weathercock and even as wildings words seemed to strike the courage out of him so did greys short contemptuous answer restore it  as it is well thrust that throne over with our hands said he after a moments pause  aye cried monmouth well do it god helping us  our dependence and trust is in the lord of hosts in whose name we go forth boomed the voice of ferguson quoting from his precious declaration the lord will do that which seemeth good unto him  an unanswerable argument said wilding smiling but the lord i am told by the gentlemen of your cloth works in his own good time and my fears are all lest finding us unprepared of ourselves the lords good time be not yet  out on ye sir cried ferguson ye want for reverence  common sense will serve us better at the moment answered wilding with a touch of sharpness he turned to the frowning and perplexed dukewhose mind was being tossed this way and that like a shuttlecock upon the battledore of these mens words your grace he said forgive me that i speak it if hear it you will or forbid me to say it if your resolve is unalterable in this matter  it is unalterable answered grey for the duke  but monmouth gently overruled him for once  nevertheless speak by all means mr wilding whatever you may say you need have no fear that any of us can doubt your good intentions to ourselves  i thank your grace what i have to say is but a repetition of the first words i uttered at this table i would urge your grace even now to retreat  what are you mad it was lord grey who asked the impatient question  i doubt its overlate for that said fletcher slowly  i am not so sure answered wilding but i am sure that to attempt it were the safer coursethe surer in the end i myself may not linger to push forward the task of stirring up the people for i am already something more than under suspicion but there are others who will remain to carry on the work after i have departed with your grace if your grace thinks well from the continent by correspondence we can mature our plans in a twelvemonth things will be very different and we can return with confidence  grey shrugged and turned his shoulder upon wilding but said no word there was silence of some few moments andrew fletcher leaned his elbow on the table and took his brow in his great bony hand wildings words seemed an echo of those he himself had spoken a week or two ago only to be overruled by grey who swayed the duke more than did any otherand that he did not do so of fell purpose and seeking deliberately to work monmouths ruin no man will ever be able to say with certainty  ferguson rose a tall spare stooping figure and smote the board with his fist it is a good cause he cried and god will not leave us unless we leave him  henry the seventh landed with fewer men than did your grace said grey and he succeeded  true put in fletcher but henry the seventh was sure of the support of not a few of the nobility which does not seem to be our case  ferguson and grey stared at him in horror monmouth sat biting his lip more bewildered than thoughtful  o man of little faith roared ferguson in a passion are ye to be swayed like a straw in the wind  i am no swayed ye ken this was ever my own view i feel in my heart that what mr wilding says is right it is but what i said myself and captain matthews with me before we embarked upon this expedition we were in danger of ruining all by a needless precipitancy nay man never stare so he said to grey i am in it now and i am no the man to draw back nor do i go so far as mr wilding in counselling such a course weve set our hands to the plough let us go forward in gods name yet i would remind you that what mr wilding says is true had we waited until next year we had found the usurpers throne tottering under him and on our landing it would have toppled oer of itself  i have said already that well overset it with our hands grey answered  how many hands have you asked a new voice a crisp discordant voice much steeped in mockery it was nick trenchards  have we another here of mr wildings mind cried grey staring at him  i am seldom of any other answered trenchard we shall no want for hands ferguson assured him had ye arrived earlier ye might have seen how readily men enlisted he had risen and approached the window as he spoke he pulled it open to let in the full volume of sound that rose from the street below  a monmouth a monmouth voices shouted  ferguson struck a theatrical posture one long lean arm stretched outward from the shoulder  ye hear them sirs he cried and there was a gleam of triumph in his eye that is answer enough to those who want for faith to the feckless ones that think the lord will abandon those that have set out to serve him and his glance comprehended fletcher trenchard and wilding  the duke stirred in his chair stretched a hand for the bottle and filled a glass his mercurial spirits were rising again he smiled at wilding  i think you are answered sir said he and i hope that like fletcher there who shared your doubts you will come to agree that since we have set our hands to the plough we must go forward  i have said that which i had it on my conscience to say your grace may have found me overready with my counsel at least you shall find me no less ready with my sword  odso that is better grey applauded and his manner was almost pleasant  i never doubted it mr wilding his grace replied but i should like to hear you say that you are convincedat least in part and he waved his hand towards the window it was almost as if he pleaded for encouragement in common with most men who came in contact with wilding he had felt the latent force of this mans nature the strength that was hidden under that calm surface and the acuteness of the judgment that must be wedded to it he longed to have the word of such a man that his enterprise was not as desperate as wilding had seemed at first to paint it but wilding made no concession to hopes or desires when he dealt with facts  men will flock to you no doubt persecution has wearied many of the countryfolk and they are ready for revolt but they are all untrained in arms they are rustics not soldiers if any of the men of position were to rally round your standard they would bring the militia and others in their train they would bring arms horses and money all of which your grace must be sorely needing  they will come answered the duke  some no doubt wilding agreed but had it been next year i would have answered for it that it would have been no handful had ridden in to welcome you scarce a gentleman of devon or somerset of dorset or hampshire of wiltshire or cheshire but would have hastened to your side  they will come as it is the duke repeated with an almost womanish insistence persisting in believing what he hoped all evidence apart  the door opened and ensign cragg made his appearance may it please your grace he announced mr battiscomb has just arrived and asks will your grace receive him tonight  battiscomb cried the duke again his cheek flushed and his eye sparkled aye in heavens name show him up  and may the lord refresh us with good tidings prayed ferguson devoutly  monmouth turned to wilding it is the agent i sent ahead of me from holland to stir up the gentry from here to the mersey  i know said wilding we conferred together some weeks since  now you shall see how idle are your fears the duke promised him  and wilding who was better informed on that score kept silence    chapter xiv his grace in counsel   mr christopher battiscomb that mildmannered dorchester gentleman who like wade was by vocation a lawyer was ushered into the dukes presence he was dressed in black and like ferguson was almost smothered in a great periwig which he may have adopted for purposes of disguise rather than adornment certainly he had none of that air of the soldier of fortune which distinguished his brother of the robe he advanced hat in hand towards the table greeting the company about it and wilding observed that he wore silk stockings and shoes upon which there rested not a speck of dust mr battiscomb was plainly a man who loved his ease since on such a day he had travelled to lyme in a coach the lawyer bent low to kiss the dukes hand and scarce was that formal homage paid than questions poured upon him from grey from fletcher and from ferguson  gentlemen gentlemen the duke entreated them smiling and remembering their manners they fell silent  as wilding afterwards told trenchard they reminded him of a parcel of saucy lacqueys who take liberties with an upstart master for whom they are wanting in respect  i am glad to see you battiscomb said monmouth when quiet was restored and i trust i behold in you a bearer of good tidings  the lawyers full face was usually pale tonight it was in addition solemn and the smile that haunted his lips was a courtesy smile that expressed neither mirth nor satisfaction he cleared his throat as if nervous he avoided the dukes question as to the quality of the news he brought by answering that he had made all haste to come to lyme upon hearing of his graces landing he was surprised he said as well he might be for the arrangement was that having done his work he was to return to holland and report to monmouth upon the feeling of the gentry  but your news battiscomb the duke insisted aye put in grey in heavens name let us hear that  again there was the little nervous cough from battiscomb i have scarce had time to complete my round of visits he temporized your grace has taken us so by surprise i i was with sir walter young at colyton when the news of your landing came some few hours ago his voice faltered and seemed to die away  well cried the duke his brows were drawn together already he realized that battiscombs tidings were not good else would he be hesitating less in uttering them is sir walter with you at least  i grieve to say that he is not  not it was grey who spoke and he followed the ejaculation by an oath why not  he is following no doubt suggested fletcher  we may hope sirs answered battiscomb that in a few dayswhen he shall have seen the zeal of the countrysidehe will be cured of his present lukewarmness thus discreetly did the man of law break the bad news he bore  monmouth sank back into his chair like one who has lost some of his strength lukewarmness he repeated dully sir walter young lukewarm  even so your gracealas and battiscomb sighed audibly  fergusons voice boomed forth again to startle them the ox knoweth his owner he cried the ass his masters crib but israel doth not know my people doth not consider  grey pushed the bottle contemptuously across the table to the parson drink man and get sense said he and turned aside to question battiscomb touching others of the neighbourhood upon whom they had depended  what of sir francis rolles he inquired  battiscomb answered the question addressing himself to the duke  alas sir francis no doubt would have been faithful to your grace but unfortunately sir francis is in prison already  deeper grew monmouths frown his fingers drummed the table absently fletcher poured himself wine his face inscrutable grey threw one leg over the other and in a voice that was carefully careless he inquired and what of sidney clifford  he is considering said battiscomb i was to have seen him again at the end of the month meanwhile he would take no resolve  lord gervase scoresby questioned grey less carelessly  battiscomb half turned to him then faced the duke again as he made answer mr wilding there can tell you more concerning lord gervase  all eyes swept round to wilding who sat in silence listening monmouths were laden with inquiry and some anxiety wilding shook his head slowly sadly you must not depend upon him he answered lord gervase was not yet ripe a little longer and i think i must have won him for your grace  heaven help us exclaimed the duke in petulant vexation is no one coming in  ferguson swung a hand towards the still open window drawing attention to the sounds without  does your grace not hear that ye can ask he cried almost reproachfully but they scarce heeded him for grey was inquiring if mr strode might be depended upon to join and that was a matter that claimed the greater attention  i think said battiscomb that he might have been depended upon  might have been questioned fletcher speaking now for the first time since battiscombs arrival  like sir francis rolles he is in prison the lawyer explained  monmouth leaned forward and his young face looked careworn now he thrust a slender hand under the brown curls upon his brow will you tell us mr battiscomb upon what friends you think that we may count he said  battiscomb pursed his lips a second pondering i think said he that you may count upon mr legge and mr hooper and possibly upon colonel churchill though i cannot say what following they will bring if any mr trenchard upon whom we counted for fifteen hundred men of taunton has been obliged to fly the country to escape arrest  we have heard that from mr trenchards cousin answered the duke what of prideaux of ford is he lukewarm  i was unable to elicit a definite promise from him but he was favourably disposed to your grace  his grace made a gesture that seemed to dismiss prideaux from their calculations and mr hucker of taunton  battiscombs manner grew yet more ill at ease mr hucker himself i am sure would place his sword at your disposal but his brother is a redhot tory  well well sighed the duke i take it we must not make certain of mr hucker are there any others besides legge and hooper upon whom you think that we may reckon  lord wiltshire perhaps said battiscomb but with a lack of assurance  a plague on perhaps exclaimed monmouth growing irritable i want you to name the men of whom you are certain  battiscomb stood silent for a moment pondering he looked almost foolish like a schoolboy who hesitates to confess his ignorance of the answer to a question set him  fletcher swung round his grey eyes flashing angrily his accent more scottish than ever  is it that yere certain o none mr battiscomb he exclaimed  indeed said battiscomb i think we may be fairly certain of mr legge and mr hooper  and of none besides questioned fletcher again be these the only representatives of the flower of englands nobility that is to flock to the banner of the cause of englands freedom and religion scorn was stamped on every word of his question  battiscomb spread his hands raised his brows and said nothing  the lord knows i do not say it exulting said fletcher but i told your grace yours was hardly the case of henry the seventh as my lord grey would have you believe  we shall see snapped grey scowling at the scot the people are coming in hundredsaye in thousandsthe gentry will follow they must  make not too sure your graceoh make not too sure wilding besought the duke as i have said these hinds have nothing to lose but their lives  faith can a man lose more asked grey contemptuously he disliked wilding by instinct which was but a reciprocation of the feeling with which wilding was inspired by him  i think he can said mr wilding quietly a man may lose honour he may plunge his family into ruin these are things of more weight with a gentleman than life  odds death blazed grey giving a free rein to his dislike of this calm gentleman do you suggest that a mans honour is imperilled in his graces service  i suggest nothing answered wilding unmoved what i think i state if i thought a mans honour imperilled in this service you would not see me at this table now i can make you no more convincing answer  grey laughed unpleasantly and wilding a faint tinge on his cheekbones measured him with a stern intrepid look before which his lordships shifty glance was observed to fall wildings eye having achieved that much passed from him to the duke and its expression softened  your grace sees said he how well founded were the fears i expressed that your coming has been premature  in gods name what would you have me do cried the duke and petulance made his voice unsteady  mr wilding rose moved out of his habitual calm by the earnestness that pervaded him it is not for me to say again what i would have your grace do your grace has heard my views and those of these gentlemen it is for your grace to decide  you mean whether i will go forward with this thing what alternative have i  no alternative put in grey with finality nor is alternative needed well carry this through in spite of timorous folk and birds of illomen that croak to aifright us  our service is the service of the lord cried ferguson returning from the window in the embrasure of which he had been standing the lord cannot but destine it to prevail  ye said so before quoth fletcher testily we need here men money and weaponsnot divinity  you are plainly infected with mr wildings disease sneered grey  ford cried the duke who saw wildings eyes flash fire you go too fast mr wilding you will not heed his lordship  i should not be likely to do so your grace answered wilding who had resumed his seat  what shall that mean quoth grey leaping to his feet  make it quite clear to him tony whispered trenchard coaxingly but mr wilding was not as lost as were these immediate followers of the dukes to all sense of the respect due to his grace  i think said wilding quietly that you have forgotten something  forgotten what bawled grey  his graces presence  his lordship turned crimson his anger swelled to think that the very terms of the rebuke precluded his allowing his feelings a free rein  monmouth leaned forward sit down he said to grey and grey so lately called to the respect he owed his grace obeyed him you will both promise me that this affair shall go no further i know you will do it if i ask you particularly when you remember how few are the followers upon whom i may depend i am not in case to lose either of you through foolish words uttered in a heat which in both your hearts is born i know of your loyalty to me  greys coarse elderly face took on a sulky look his heavy lips were pouted his glance sullen mr wilding on the contrary smiled across the table  for my part i very gladly give your grace the undertaking said he and took care not to observe the sneer that altered the line of lord greys lips his lordship too was forced to give the same pledge and he followed it up by inveighing sturdily against the suggestion that they should retreat  i do protest he exclaimed that those who advise your grace to do anything but go forward boldly now are evil counsellors if you put back to holland you may leave every hope behind there will be no second coming for you your influence will have been dissipated men will not trust you another time i do not think that even mr wilding can deny the truth of this  i am by no means sure said wilding and fletcher looked at him with eyes that were full of understanding this sturdy scot the only soldier worthy of the name in the dukes following who ever since the project had first been mooted had held out against it counselling delay was in sympathy with mr wilding  monmouth rose his face anxious his voice fretful there can be no retreat for me gentlemen though many that we depended upon are not here to join us yet let us remember that heaven is on our side and that we are come to fight in the sacred cause of religion and a nations emancipation from the thraldom of popery oppression and superstition let this dispel such doubts as yet may linger in our minds  his words had a brave sound but when analysed they but formed a paraphrase of what grey and ferguson had said it was his destiny to be a mere echo of the minds of other men just as he was now the tool of these two one of whom plotted seemingly because plotting was a disease that had got into his blood the other for reasons that may have been of ambition or of revengeno man will ever know for certain  in the chamber they shared trenchard and mr wilding reviewed that night the scene so lately enacted in which one had taken an active part the other been little more than a spectator trenchard had come from the dukes presence entirely out of conceit with monmouth and his cause contemptuous of ferguson angry with grey and indifferent towards fletcher  i am committed and ill not draw back said he but i tell you anthony my heart is not confederate with my hand in this bah he railed we serve a man of straw a perkin a very pope of a fellow  mr wilding sighed hes scarce the man for such an undertaking said he i fear we have been misled  trenchard was drawing off his boots he paused in the act aye said he misled by our blindness what else after all should we have expected of him he cried contemptuously the cause is good but its leaderpshaw would you have such a puppet as that on the throne of england  he does not aim so high  be not so sure we shall hear more of the black box anon and of the marriage certificate it contains twould not surprise me if they were to produce forgeries of the one and the other to prove his fathers marriage to lucy walters anthony anthony to what a business are we wedded  mr wilding already abed turned impatiently things cried aloud to be redressed a leader was necessary and none other offered that is the whole story but our chance is slender and it might have been great  that rakehell ford lord grey has made it so grumbled trenchard busy with his stockings this sudden coming is his work you heard what fletcher saidhow he opposed it when first it was urged he paused and looked up suddenly blister me he cried is it his lordships purpose think you to work the ruin of monmouth  what are you saying nick  there are certain rumours current touching his grace and lady grey a man like grey might well resort to some such scheme of vengeance  get to sleep nick said wilding yawning you are dreaming already such a plan would be over elaborate for his lordships mind it would ask a villainy parallel with your own  trenchard climbed into bed and settled himself under the coverlet  maybe said he and maybe not but i think that were it not for that cursed business of the letter richard westmacott stole from us i should be going my ways tomorrow and leaving his grace of monmouth to go his  aye and id go with you answered wilding ive little taste for suicide but we are in it now  twas a sad pity you meddled this morning in that affair at taunton mused trenchard wistfully a sadder pity you were bitten with a taste for matrimony he added thoughtfully and blew out the rushlight    chapter xv lyme of the king   on the next day which was friday the country folk continued to come in and by evening monmouths forces amounted to a thousand foot and a hundred and fifty horse the men were armed as fast as they were enrolled and scarce a field or quiet avenue in the district but resounded to the tramp of feet the rattle of weapons and the sharp orders of the officers who by drilling were converting this raw material into soldiers on the saturday the rally of the dukes standard was such that monmouth threw off at last the gloomy forebodings that had burdened his soul since that meeting on thursday night wade holmes foulkes and fox were able to set about forming the first four regimentsthe dukes and the green the white and the yellow monmouths spirits continued to rise for he had been joined by now by legge and hooperthe two upon whom battiscomb had countedand by colonel joshua churchill of whom battiscomb had been less certain captain matthews brought news that lord wiltshire and the gentlemen of hampshire might be expected if they could force their way through albemarles militia which was already closing round lyme  long before evening willing fellows were being turned away in hundreds for lack of weapons in spite of monmouths big talk on landing and of the rumour that had gone out that he could arm thirty thousand men his stock of arms was exhausted by a mere fifteen hundred trenchard who now held a majors rank in the horse attached to the dukes own regiment was loud in his scorn of this state of things mr wilding was sad and his depression again spread to the duke after a few words had passed between them towards evening fletcher was for heroic measures he looked only ahead now like the good soldier that he was and already he began to suggest a bold dash for exeter for weapons horses and possibly the militia as well for they had ample evidence that the men composing it might easily be induced to desert to the dukes side  the suggestion was one that instantly received mr wildings heartiest approval it seemed to fill him suddenly with hope and he spoke of it indeed as an inspiration which if acted upon might yet save the situation the duke was undecided as ever he was too much troubled weighing the chances for and against and he would decide upon nothing until he had consulted grey and the others he would summon a council that night he promised and the matter should be considered  but that council was never to be called for andrew fletchers association with the rebellion was drawing rapidly to its close and there was that to happen in the next few hours which should counteract all the encouragement with which the duke had been fortified that day towards evening little heywood dare the taunton goldsmith who had landed at seatown and gone out with the news of the dukes arrival rode into lyme with forty horse mounted himself upon a beautiful charger which was destined to be the undoing of him  news came too that the dorset militia were at bridport eight miles away whereupon wilding and fletcher postponed all further suggestion of the dash for exeter proposing that in the mean time a night attack upon bridport might result well for once lord grey was in agreement with them and so the matter was decided fletcher went down to arm and mount and all the world knows the story of the foolish illfated quarrel which robbed monmouth of two of his most valued adherents by illluck the scots eyes lighted upon the fine horse that dare had brought from ford abbey it occurred to him that nothing could be more fitting than that the best man should sit upon the best horse and he forthwith led the beast from the stables and was about to mount when dare came forth to catch him in the very act the goldsmith was a rude peppery fellow who did not mince his words  what a plague are you doing with that horse he cried  fletcher paused one foot in the stirrup and looked the fellow up and down i am mounting it said he and proceeded to do as he said  but dare caught him by the tails of his coat and brought him back to earth  you are making a mistake mr fletcher he cried angrily that horse is mine  fletcher whose temper was by no means of the most peaceful kept himself with difficulty in hand at the indignity dare offered him  yours quoth he  aye mine i brought it from ford abbey myself  for the dukes service fletcher reminded him for my own sir for my own i would have you know and brushing the scot aside he caught the bridle and sought to wrench it from fletchers hand  but fletcher maintained his hold softly mr dare said he yere a trifle oer true to your name as you once told his late majesty yourself  take your hands from my horse dare shouted very angry  several loiterers in the yard gathered round to watch the scene culling diversion from it and speculating upon the conclusion it might have one rash young fellow offered audibly to lay ten to one that paymaster dare would have the best of the argument  dare overheard and was spurred on  i will by god he answered come mr fletcher and he shook the bridle again  there was a dull flush showing through the tan of fletchers skin mr dare said he this horse is no more yours than mine it is the dukes and i as one o the leaders claim it in the dukes service  aye sir cried an onlooker encouraging fletcher and did the mischief it so goaded dare to have his antagonist in this trifling matter supported that he utterly lost his head  i have said the horse is mine and i repeat it let go the bridlelet it go still fletcher striving hard to keep his calm clung to the reins let it go you damned thieving scot screamed dare in a fury and struck fletcher with his whip  it was unfortunate for them both that he should have had that switch in his hand at such a time but more unfortunate still was it that fletcher should have had a pistol in his belt the scot dropped the bridle at last dropped it to pluck forth the weapon  hi i did not began dare who had stood appalled by what he had done in the second or two that had passed since he had delivered the blow the rest of his sentence was drowned in the report of fletchers pistol and dare dropped dead on the rough cobbles of the yard  ferguson has left it on recordand presumably he had fletchers word for itthat it was no part of the scots intent to do mr dare a mischief he had but drawn the pistol to intimidate him into better manners but in his haste he accidentally pulled the trigger  however that may be there was dare as dead as the stones on which he lay and fletcher with a smoking pistol in his hand  after that all was confusion fletcher was seized by those who had witnessed the deed there was none thought it an accident indeed they were all ready enough to say that fletcher had received excessive provocation he was haled to the presence of the duke with whom were grey and wilding at the time and old dares sonan ensign in goodenoughs companycame clamouring for vengeance backed by such goodly numbers that the distraught duke was forced to show at least the outward seeming of it  wilding who knew the value of this scottish soldier of fortune who had seen so much service strenuously urged his enlargement it was not a time to let the fortunes of a cause suffer through such an act as this deplorable though it might be the evidence showed that fletcher had been provoked he had been struck a thing that might well justify the anger in the heat of which he had done this thing grey was stolid and silent saying nothing either for or against the man who had divided with him under the duke the honours of the supreme command  monmouth white and horrorstricken sat and listened first to wilding then to dare and lastly to fletcher himself but it was young daredare and his followers who prevailed they were too numerous and turbulent and they must at all costs be conciliated or there was no telling to what extremes they might not go and so there was an end to the share of andrew fletcher of saltoun in this undertakingthe end of the only man who was of any capacity to pilot it through the troubled waters that lay before it monmouth placed him under arrest and sent him aboard the frigate again ordering her captain to sail at once that was the utmost monmouth could do to save him  wilding continued to plead with the duke after fletchers removal and to such good purpose that at last monmouth determined that fletcher should rejoin them later when the affair should have blown over and he sent word accordingly to the scot even in this there were manifestations of antagonism between mr wilding and lord grey and it almost seemed enough that wilding should suggest a course for lord grey instantly to oppose it  the effects of fletchers removal were not long in following on the morrow came the bridport affair and greys shameful conduct when had he stood his ground victory must have been assured the dukes forces instead of just that honourable retreat by which colonel wade so gallantly saved the situation mr wilding did not mince his words in putting it that grey had run away  in his room at the george inn monmouth deeply distressed asked wilding and colonel matthews what action he should take in the matterhow deal with grey  there is no other general in europe would ask that your grace answered matthews gravely and mr wilding added without an instants hesitation that his graces course was plain  it would be an unwise thing to expose the troops to the chance of more such happenings  monmouth dismissed them and sent for grey and he seemed resolved to deal with him as he deserved yet an hour later when wilding matthews wade and the others were ordered to attend the duke in council there was his lordship seemingly on as good terms as ever with his grace  they were assembled to discuss the next step which it might be advisable to take for the militia was closing in around them and to remain longer in lyme would be to be caught there as in a trap it was grey who advanced the first suggestion his assurance no whit abated by the shameful thing that had befallen by the cowardice which he had betrayed  that we must quit lyme we are all agreed said he i would propose that your grace march north to gloucester where our cheshire friends will assemble to meet us  colonel matthews reminded the duke of andrew fletchers proposal that they should make a raid upon exeter with a view to seizing arms of which they stood so sorely in need  this mr wilding was quick to support not only that your grace he said but i am confident that with very little inducement the greater portion of the militia will desert to us as soon as we appear  what assurance can you give of that asked grey his heavy lip protruded  i take it said mr wilding that in such matters no man can give an assurance of anything i speak with knowledge of the country and the folk from which the militia is enlisted i offer it as my opinion that the militia is favourably disposed to your grace i can do no more  if mr wilding says so your grace put in matthews i have no doubt he has sound reasons upon which to base his opinion  no doubt said monmouth indeed i had already thought of the step that you suggest colonel matthews and what mr wilding says causes me to look upon it still more favourably  grey frowned consider your grace he said earnestly that you are in no case to fight at present  what fighting do you suggest there would be asked the duke  there is albemarle between us and exeter  but with the militia wilding reminded him and if the militia deserts him for your grace in what case will albemarle find himself  and if the militia does not desert if you should be proven wrong sir what then what then asked grey  ayetruewhat then mr wilding quoth the duke already wavering  wilding considered a moment all eyes upon him even then said he presently i do maintain that in this dash for exeter lies your graces greatest chance of success we can deliver battle if need be already we are three thousand strong  grey interrupted him rudely nay he insisted you must not presume upon that we are not yet fit to fight it is his graces business at present to drill and discipline his troops and induce more friends to join him  already we are turning men away because we have no weapons to put into their hands wilding reminded them and a murmur of approval ran round which but served to anger grey the more to render more obstinate his opposition  but all that come in are not unprovided was his lordships retort there are the hampshire gentry and their friends they will come armed and so will others if we have patience  aye said wilding and if you have patience enough there will be troops the parliament will send against us they too will be armed i can assure your lordship  in gods name let us keep from wrangling the duke besought them it is difficult enough to determine for the best if the dash to exeter were successful  it cannot be grey interrupted again  the liberties he took with monmouth and which monmouth permitted him might well be a source of wonder to all who heard them monmouth paused now in his interrupted speech and looked about him a trifle wearily  it seems idle to insist said mr wilding such is the temper of your graces counsellors that we get no further than contradictions greys bold eyes were upon wilding as he spoke i would remind your grace and i am sure that many present will agree with me that in a desperate enterprise a sudden unexpected movement will often strike terror  that is true said monmouth but apparently without enthusiasm and having approved what was urged on one side he looked at grey as if waiting to hear what might be said on the other his indecision was pitifultragical indeed in the leader of so bold an enterprise  we should do better i think said grey to deal with the facts as we know them  it is what i am endeavouring to do your grace protested wilding a note of despair in his voice perhaps some other gentleman will put forward better counsel than mine  aye in heavens name let us hope so snorted grey and monmouth catching the sudden flash of mr wildings eye set a hand upon his lordships arm as if to urge him to be gentler but he continued when men talk of striking terror by sudden movements they build on air  i had hardly thought to hear that from your lordship said mr wilding and he permitted himself that tightlipped smile that gave his face so wicked a look  and why not asked grey stupidly unsuspicious  because i had thought you might have concluded otherwise from your own experience at bridport this morning  grey got angrily to his feet rage and shame flushing his face and it needed ferguson and the duke to restore him to some semblance of calm indeed it may well be that it was to complete this that his grace decided there and then that they should follow greys advice and go by way of taunton bridgwater and bristol to gloucester he was like all weak men of conspicuous mental shortsightedness the matter of the moment was ever of greater importance to him than any result that might attend it in the future  he insisted that wilding and grey should shake hands before the breaking up of that most astounding council and as he had done last night he now again imposed upon them his commands that they must not allow this matter to go further  mr wilding paved the way for peace by making an apology within limitations  if in my zeal to serve your grace to the best of my ability i have said that which lord grey thinks fit to resent i would bid him consider my motive rather than my actual words  but when all had gone save ferguson the chaplain approached the preoccupied and distressed duke with counsel that mr wilding should be sent away from the army  else therell be trouble twixt him and grey the plotting parson foretold well be having a repetition of the unfortunate fletcher and dare affair and i think that has cost your grace enough already  do you suggest that i dismiss wilding cried the duke you know his influence and the bad impression his removal would leave  ferguson stroked his long lean jaw no no said he all i suggest is that you find mr wilding work to do elsewhere  elsewhere the duke questioned where else  i have thought of that too send him to london to see danvers and to stir up your friends there and he added lowering his voice give him discretion to see sunderland if he thinks well  the proposition pleased monmouth and it seemed to please mr wilding no less when having sent for him the duke communicated it to him in fergusons presence  upon this mission mr wilding set out that very night leaving nick trenchard in despair at being separated from him at a time when there seemed to be every chance that such a separation might be eternal  monmouth and ferguson may have conceived they did a wise thing in removing a man who was instinctively spoiling for a little swordplay with my lord grey it is odds that had he remained the brewing storm between the pair would have come to a head had it done so it is more than likely from what we know of mr wildings accomplishments that he had given lord grey his quietus and had that happened it is to be inferred from history that it is possible the duke of monmouths rebellion might have had a less disastrous issue    chapter xvi plots and plotters   mr wilding left monmouths army at lyme on sunday the 14th of june and rejoined it at bridgwater exactly three weeks later in the meanwhile a good deal had happened yet the happenings on every hand had fallen far short of the expectations aroused in mr wildings mind now by one circumstance now by another in reaching london he had experienced no difficulty men travelling in that direction were not subjected to the scrutiny that fell to the share of those travelling from it towards the west or rather to the scrutiny ordained by the government for wilding had more than one opportunity of observing how very lax and indifferent were the constables and tythingmenparticularly in somerset and wiltshirein the performance of this duty wayfarers were questioned as a matter of form but in no case did wilding hear of any one being detained upon suspicion this was calculated to raise his drooping hopes pointing as it did to the general favouring of monmouth that was toward he grew less despondent on the score of the dukes possible ultimate success and he came to hope that the efforts he went to exert would not be fruitless  but rude were the disappointments that awaited him in town london like the rest of the country was not ready there were not wanting men who favoured monmouth but no rising had been organized and the dukes partisans were not disposed to rashness  wilding lodged at covent garden in a house recommended to him by colonel danvers and therean outlaw himselfhe threw himself with a will into his task he heard of the burning of monmouths declaration by the common hangman at the royal exchange and of the bill passed by the commons to make it treason for any to assert that lucy walters was married to the late king he attended meetings at the bulls head in bishopsgate where he met disney and danvers payton and lock but though they talked and argued at prodigious length they did naught besides danvers who was their hope in town definitely refused to have a hand in anything that was not properly organized and in common with the others urged that they should wait until cheshire had risen as was reported that it must  meanwhile troops had gone west under kirke and churchill and the parliament had voted nearly half a million for the putting down of the rebellion london was flung into a fever of excitement by the news that was reaching it the position was not quite as monmouths advisersbefore coming over from hollandhad represented that it would be they had thought that out of fear of tumults about his own person king james would have been compelled to keep near him what troops he had sparing none to be sent against monmouth this king james had not done he had all but emptied london of soldiery and considering the general disaffection no moment could have been more favourable than this for a rising in london itself the confusion that must have resulted from the recalling of troops would have given monmouth not only a mighty grip of the west but would have heartened those wholike sunderland himselfwere sitting on the wall to declare themselves for the protestant champion this wilding saw and almost frenziedly did he urge it upon danvers that all london needed at the moment was a resolute leader but the colonel still held back indeed he had neither truth nor valour he was timid and used deceit to mask his timidity he urged frivolous reasons for inaction and when wilding waxed impatient with him he suggested that wilding himself should head the rising if he were so confident of its success and wilding would have done it but that being unknown in london he had no reason to suppose that men would flock to him if he raised the dukes banner  later when the excitement grew and rumours ran through town that monmouth had now a following of twenty thousand men and that the kings forces were falling back before him and discontent was rife at the commissioning of catholic lords to levy troops wilding again pressed the matter upon danvers surely no moment could be more propitious but again he received the same answer that danvers had lacked time to organize matters sufficiently that the dukes coming had taken him by surprise  lastly came the news that monmouth had been crowned at taunton amid the wildest enthusiasm and that there were now in england two men each of whom called himself king james the second this was the excuse that danvers needed to be rid of a business he had not the courage to transact to a finish he swore that he washed his hands of monmouths affairs that the latter had broken faith with him and the promise he had made him in having himself proclaimed king he protested that monmouth had done ill and prophesied that his act would alienate from him the numerous republicans who like danvers had hitherto looked to him for the countrys salvation wilding himself was appalled at the news for monmouth was indeed going further than men had been given to understand nevertheless for his own sake in very selfdefence now if out of no motives of loyalty to the duke he must urge forward the fortunes of this man he had high words with danvers and the two might have quarrelled before long but for the sudden arrest of disney which threw danvers into such a panic that he fled incontinently abandoning in body as he already appeared to have abandoned in spirit the monmouth cause  the arrest of disney struck a chill into wilding from his lodging at covent garden he had communicated cautiously with sunderland a few days after his arrival building upon certain information he had received from the duke at parting as to sunderlands attachment to the cause he had carefully chosen his moment for making this communication having a certain innate mistrust of a man who so obviously as sunderland was running with the hare and hunting with the hounds he had sent a letter to the secretary of state when london was agog with the axminster affair and the taleof which sir edward phelips wrote to colonel berkeley as the shamefullest story that you ever heardof how albemarles forces and the somerset militia had run before monmouth in spite of their own overwhelming numbers this promised ill for james particularly when it was perceived as perceived it wasthat this running away was not all cowardice not all the shamefullest story that phelips accounted it it was an expression of goodwill towards monmouth on the part of the militia of the west and it was confidently expected that the next news would be that these men who had decamped before him would presently be found to have ranged themselves under his banner  sunderland had given no sign that he had received wildings communication and wilding drew his own contemptuous conclusions of the secretary of states cautious policy it was a fortnight laterwhen london was settling down again from the diversion of excitement created by the news of argyles defeat in scotlandbefore mr wilding attempted to approach sunderland again he awaited a favourable opportunity and this he had when london was thrown into consternation by the alarming news of the duke of somersets urgent demand for reinforcements unless he had them he declared the whole country was lost as he could not get the militia to stand whilst lord stawells regiment were all fled and mostly gone over to the rebels at bridgwater  this was grave news but it was followed in a few days by graver the affair at philips norton was exaggerated by report into a wholesale defeat of the loyal army and it was reportedon apparently such good authority that it received credence in quarters that might have waited for official newsthat the duke of albemarle had been slain by the militia which had mutinied and deserted to monmouth  it was while this news was going round that sunderlandin a moment of panicat last vouchsafed an answer to mr wildings letters and he vouchsafed it in person just as wildingparticularly since disneys arrestwas beginning to lose all hope he came one evening to mr wildings lodgings in covent garden unattended and closely muffled and he remained closeted with the dukes ambassador for nigh upon an hour at the end of which he entrusted mr wilding with a letter for the duke very brief but entirely to the point which expressed him monmouths most devoted servant  you may well judge sir he had said at parting that this is not such a letter as i should entrust to any man  mr wilding had bowed gravely and gravely he had expressed himself sensible of the exceptional honour his lordship did him by such a trust  and i depend upon you sir as you are a man of honour to take such measures as will ensure against its falling into any but the hands for which it is intended  as i am a man of honour you may depend upon me mr wilding solemnly promised will your lordship give me three lines above your signature that will save me from molestation thus you will facilitate the preservation of this letter  i had already thought of that was sunderlands answer and he placed before mr wilding three lines of writing signed and sealed which enjoined all straitly in the kings name to suffer the bearer to pass and repass and to offer him no hindrance  on that they shook hands and parted sunderland to return to whitehall and his obedience to the king james whom he was ready to betray as soon as he saw profit for himself in the act mr wilding to return to somerset to the king james in whom his faith was scant indeed but with whom his fortunes were irrevocably bound up  meanwhile monmouth was back in bridgwater his second occupation of which town was not being looked upon with unmixed favour the inhabitants had suffered enough already from his first visit his return there after the philips norton affair of which such grossly exaggerated reports had reached london and which in point of fact had been little better than a drawn battlehad been looked upon with dread by some with disfavour by others and with dismay by not a few who viewed in this an augury of failure  now sir rowland blake who since his pursuit of mr wilding and trenchard on the occasion of their flight from taunton hadin spite of his failure on that occasionbeen more or less in the service of albemarle and the loyal army saw in this indisposition towards monmouth of so many of bridgwaters inhabitants great possibilities of profit to himself  he was at lupton house the guest of his friend richard westmacott and the open suitor of ruth entirely ignoring the circumstance that she was nominally the wife of mr wildingthis to the infinite chagrin of miss horton who saw all her scheming likely to go for nothing  in his heart of hearts it was a matter of not the slightest consequence to sir rowland whether james stuart or james scott occupied the throne of england his own affairs gave him more than enough to think of and these disturbances in the west were very welcome to him since they rendered difficult any attempt to trace him on the part of his london creditors it happens however very commonly that enmity to an individual will lead to enmity to the cause which that individual espouses thus may it have been with sir rowland his hatred of wilding and his keen desire to see wilding destroyed had made him a zealous partisan of the loyal cause richard westmacott easily swayed and overborne by the town rake whose vices made him seem to richard the embodiment of all that is splendid and enviable in man had become practically the baronets tool now that he had abandoned monmouths cause sir rowland had not considered it beneath the dignity of his name and station to discharge in bridgwater certain functions that made him more or less a spy and so reliable had been the information he had sent feversham and albemarle during monmouths first occupation of the town that he had won by now their complete confidence  the second occupation and its unpopularity with many of those who earlierif lukewarmhad been partisans of the duke swelled the number of loyally inclined people in bridgwater and suddenly inspired sir rowland with a scheme by which at a blow he might snuff out the rebellion  this scheme involved the capture of the duke and the reward of success should mean far more to blake than the five thousand pounds at which the value of the dukes head had already been fixed by parliament he needed a tool for this and he even thought of westmacott and lupton house but afterwards preferred a mr newlington who was in better case to assist him this newlington an exceedingly prosperous merchant and one of the richest men perhaps in the whole west of england looked with extreme disfavour upon monmouth whose advent had paralyzed his industries to an extent that was costing him a fine round sum of money weekly  he was now in alarm lest the town of bridgwater should be made to pay dearly for having harboured the protestant dukehe had no faith whatever in the protestant dukes ultimate prevailingand that he as one of the towns most prominent and prosperous citizens might be amongst the heaviest sufferers in spite of his neutrality this neutrality he observed because it was hardly safe in that disaffected town for a man to proclaim himself a loyalist  to him sir rowland expounded his audacious plan he sought out the merchant in his handsome mansion on the night of that friday which had witnessed monmouths return and the merchant honoured by the visit of this gallantignorant as he was of the gentlemans fame in townplaced himself entirely and instantly at his disposal though the hour was late sounding him carefully and finding the fellow most amenable to any scheme that should achieve the salvation of his purse and industries blake boldly laid his plan before him startled at first mr newlington upon considering it became so enthusiastic that he hailed sir rowland as his deliverer and heartily promised his cooperation indeed it was mr newlington who was himself to take the first step  well pleased with his evenings work sir rowland went home to lupton house and to bed in the morning he broached the matter to richard he had all the vanity of the inferior not only to lessen the appearance of his inferiority but to clothe himself in a mantle of importance and it was this vanity urged him to acquaint richard with his plans in the very presence of ruth  they had broken their fast and they still lingered in the diningroom the largest and most important room in lupton house it was cool and pleasant here in contrast to the heat of the july sun which following upon the late wet weather beat fiercely on the lawn the windowdoors to which stood open the cloth had been raised and diana and her mother had lately left the room ruth in the windowseat at a small oval table was arranging a cluster of roses in an old bronze bowl sir rowland his stiff short figure carefully dressed in a suit of brown camlet his fair wig very carefully curled occupied a tallbacked armchair near the empty fireplace richard perched on the tables edge swung his shapely legs idly backwards and forwards and cogitated upon a pretext to call for a morning draught of last octobers ale   ruth completed her task with the roses and turned her eyes upon her brother  you are not looking well richard she said which was true enough for much hard drinking was beginning to set its stamp on richard and young as he was his insipidly fair face began to display a bloatedness that was exceedingly unhealthy  oh i am well enough he answered almost peevishly for these allusions to his looks were becoming more frequent than he savoured  gad cried sir rowlands deep voice youll need to be well i have work for you tomorrow dick  dick did not appear to share his enthusiasm i am sick of the work you discover for us rowland he answered ungraciously  but blake showed no resentment maybe youll find the present task more to your taste if its deeds of derringdo you pine for i am the man to satisfy you he smiled grimly his bold grey eyes glancing across at ruth who was observing him listening  richard sneered but offered him no encouragement to proceed  i see said blake that i shall have to tell you the whole story before youll credit me shalt have it then but and he checked on the word his face growing serious his eye wandering to the door i would not have it overheardnot for a kings ransom which was more literally true than he may have intended it to be  richard looked over his shoulder carelessly at the door  we have no eavesdroppers he said and his voice bespoke his contempt of the gravity of this news of which sir rowland made so much in anticipation he was acquainted with sir rowlands ways and the importance of them what are you considering he inquired  to end the rebellion answered blake his voice cautiously lowered  richard laughed outright there are several others considering thatnotably his majesty king james the duke of albemarle and the earl of feversham yet they dont appear to achieve it  it is in that particular said blake complacently that i shall differ from them he turned to ruth eager to engage her in the conversation to flatter her by including her in the secret knowing the loyalist principles she entertained he had no reason to fear that his plans could other than meet her approval what do you say mistress ruth presuming upon his friendship with her brother he had taken to calling her by that name in preference to the other which he could not bring himself to give her is it not an object worthy of a gentlemans endeavour  if you can save so many poor people from encompassing their ruin by following that rash young man the duke of monmouth you will indeed be doing a worthy deed  blake rose and made her a leg madam said he had aught been wanting to cement my resolve your words would supply it to me my plan is simplicity itself i propose to capture monmouth and his principal agents and deliver them over to the king and that is all  a mere nothing croaked richard  could more be needed quoth blake once the rebel army is deprived of its leaders it will melt and dissolve of itself once the duke is in the hands of his enemies there will be nothing left to fight for is it not shrewd  you are telling us the object rather than the plan ruth reminded him if the plan is as good as the object  as good he echoed chuckling you shall judge and briefly he sketched for her the springe he was setting with the help of mr newlington newlington is rich the duke is in straits for money newlington goes today to offer him twenty thousand pounds and the duke is to do him the honour of supping at his house tomorrow night to fetch the money it is a reasonable request for mr newlington to make under the circumstances and the duke cannotdare not refuse it  but how will that advance your project ruth inquired for blake had paused again thinking that the rest must be obvious  in mr newlingtons orchard i propose to post a score or so of men well armed oh i shall run no risks of betrayal by engaging bridgwater folk ill get the fellows i need from general feversham we take monmouth at supper as quietly as may be with what gentlemen happen to have accompanied him we bind and gag the duke and we convey him with all speed and quiet out of bridgwater feversham shall send a troop to await me a mile or so from the town on the road to weston zoyland we shall join them with our captive and thus convey him to the royalist general could aught be simpler or more infallible  richard had slipped from the table he had changed his mind on the subject of the importance of the business blake had in view excited by it he clapped his friend on the back approvingly  a great plan he cried is it not ruth  it should be the means of saving hundreds perhaps thousands of lives said she and so it deserves to prosper but what of the officers who may be with the duke she inquired  there are not likely to be manyhalf a dozen say we shall have to make short work of them lest they should raise an alarm he saw her glance clouding that is the ugly part of the affair he was quick to add himself assuming a look of sadness he sighed what help is there he asked better that those few should suffer than that as you yourself have said there should be some thousands of lives lost before this rebellion is put down besides he continued monmouths officers are farseeing ambitious men who have entered into this affair to promote their own personal fortunes they are gamesters who have set their lives upon the board against a great prize and they know it but these other poor misguided people who have gone out to fight for liberty and religionit is these whom i am striving to rescue  his words sounded fervent his sentiments almost heroic ruth looked at him and wondered had she misjudged him in the past she sighed then she thought of wilding he was on the other side but where was he rumour ran that he was dead that he and grey had quarrelled at lyme and that wilding had been killed as a result had it not been for diana who strenuously bade her attach no credit to these reports she would readily have believed them as it was she waited wondering thinking of him always as she had seen him on that day at walford when he had taken his leave of her and more than once when she pondered the words he had said the look that had invested his drooping eyes she found herself with tears in her own they welled up now and she rose hastily to her feet  she looked a moment at blake who was watching her keenly speculating upon this emotion of which she betrayed some sign and wondering might not his heroism have touched her for as we have seen he had arrayed a deed of excessive meanness a deed worthy almost of the iscariot in the panoply of heroic achievement  i think she said that you are setting your hand to a very worthy and glorious enterprise and i hope nay i am sure that success must attend your efforts he was still bowing his thanks when she passed out through the open windowdoors into the sunshine of the garden  sir rowland swung round upon richard a great enterprise dick he cried i may count upon you for one  aye said dick who had found at last the pretext that he needed you may count on me pull the bell well drink to the success of the venture    chapter xvii mr wildings return   the preparations to be made for the momentous coup sir rowland meditated were considerable mr newlington was yet to be concerted with and advised and that done sir rowland had to face the difficulty of eluding the bridgwater guards and make his way to fevershams camp at somerton to enlist the generals cooperation to the extent that we have seen he looked for that done he was to return and ripen his preparations for the business he had undertaken nevertheless in spite of all that lay before him he did not find it possible to leave lupton house without stepping out into the garden in quest of ruth through the window whilst he and richard were at their ale he had watched her between whiles and had lingered waiting for diana was with her and it was not his wish to seek her whilst diana was at hand speak with her ere he went he must he was an opportunist and now he fondly imagined was his opportunity he had made that day at last a favourable impression upon richards sister he had revealed himself in an heroic light and egregiously misreading the emotion she had shown before withdrawing he was satisfied that did he strike now victory must attend him he sighed his satisfaction and pleasurable anticipation he had been wary and he had known how to wait and now it seemed to him he was to be rewarded for his patience then he frowned as another glance showed him that diana still lingered with her cousin he wished diana at the devil he had come to hate this fairhaired doll to whom he had once paid court she was too continually in his way a constant obstacle in his path ever ready to remind ruth of anthony wilding when sir rowland most desired anthony wilding to be forgotten and in dianas feelings towards himself such a change had been gradually wrought that she had come to reciprocate his sentimentsto hate him with all the bitter hatred into which love can be by scorn transmuted at first her object in keeping ruths thoughts on mr wilding in pleading his cause and seeking to present him in a favourable light to the lady whom he had constrained to become his wife had been that he might stand a barrier between ruth and sir rowland to the end that diana might hope to see revivedfaute de mieux since possible in no other waythe feelings that once sir rowland had professed for herself the situation was rich in humiliations for poor vain foolishly crafty diana and these humiliations were daily rendered more bitter by sir rowlands unwavering courtship of her cousin in despite of all that she could do  in the end the poison of them entered her soul corroded her sentiments towards him dissolved the love she had borne him and transformed it into venom she would not have him now if he did penitence for his disaffection by going in sackcloth and crawling after her on his knees for a full twelvemonth but neither should he have ruth if she could thwart his purpose on that she was resolved  had she but guessed that he watched them from the windows waiting for her to take her departure she had lingered all the morning and all the afternoon if need be at ruths side but being ignorant of the circumstancebelieving that he had already left the houseshe presently quitted ruth to go indoors and no sooner was she gone than there was blake replacing her at ruths elbow mistress wilding met him with unsmiling but not ungentle face  not yet gone sir rowland she asked him and a less sanguine man had been discouraged by the words  it may be forgiven me that i tarry at such a time said he when we consider that i go perhapsto return no more it was an inspiration on his part to assume the role of the hero going forth to a possible death it invested him with noble valiant pathos which could not he thought fail of its effect upon a womans mind but he looked in vain for a change of colour be it never so slight or a quickening of the breath he found neither though indeed her deep blue eyes seemed to soften as they observed him       there is danger in this thing that you are undertaking said she between question and assertion  it is not my wish to overstate it yet i leave you to imagine what the risk may be  it is a good cause said she thinking of the poor deluded humble folk that followed monmouths banner whom blakes fine action was to rescue from impending ruin and annihilation and surely heaven will be on your side  we must prevail cried blake with kindling eye and you had thought him a fanatic not a miserable earner of bloodmoney we must prevail though some of us may pay dearly for the victory i have a foreboding he paused sighed then laughed and flung back his head as if throwing off some weight that had oppressed him  it was admirably played nick trenchard had he observed it might have envied the performance and it took effect with her this adding of a prospective martyrs crown to the heros raiment he had earlier donned it was a mastertouch worthy of one who was deeply learnedfrom the school of foul experiencein the secret ways that lead to a womans favour in a pursuit of this kind there was no subterfuge too mean no treachery too base for sir rowland blake  will you walk mistress he said and she feeling that it were an unkindness not to do his will assented gravely they moved down the sloping lawn side by side sir rowland leaning on his cane bareheaded his feathered hat tucked under his arm before them the rivers smooth expanse swollen and yellow with the recent rains glowed like a sheet of copper so that it blurred the sight to look upon it long  a few steps they took with no word uttered then sir rowland spoke with this foreboding that is on me said he i could not go without seeing you without saying something that i may never have another chance of saying something thatwho knowsbut for the emprise to which i am now wedded you had never heard from me  he shot her a furtive sidelong glance from under his heavy beetling brows and now indeed he observed a change ripple over the composure of her face like a sudden breeze across a sheet of water the deep lace collar at her throat rose and fell and her fingers toyed nervously with a ribbon of her grey bodice she recovered in an instant and threw up entrenchments against the attack she saw he was about to make  you exaggerate i trust said she your forebodings will be proved groundless you will return safe and sound from this venture as indeed i hope you may  that was his cue you hope it he cried arresting his step turning and imprisoning her left hand in his right you hope it ah if you hope for my return return i will but unless i know that you will have some welcome for me such as i desire from you i think his voice quivered cleverly i think perhaps it were well if if my forebodings were not as groundless as you say they are tell me ruth  but she interrupted him it was high time she thought her face he saw was flushed her eyes had hardened somewhat calmly she disengaged her hand  what ist you mean she asked speak sir rowland speak plainly that i may give you a plain answer  it was a challenge in which another man had seen how hopeless was his case and accepting defeat had made as orderly a retreat as still was possible but sir rowland stricken in his vanity went headlong on to utter rout  since you ask me in such terms i will be plain indeed he answered her i mean he almost quailed before the look that met him from her intrepid eyes do you not see my meaning ruth  that which i see said she i do not believe and as i would not wrong you by any foolish imaginings i would have you plain with me  yet the egregious fool went on and why should you not believe your senses he asked her between anger and entreaty is it wonderful that i should love you is it  stop she drew back a pace from him there was a moments silence during which it seemed she gathered her forces to destroy him and in the spirit he bowed his head before the coming storm then with a sudden relaxing of the stiffness her lissom figure had assumed i think you had better leave me sir rowland she advised him she half turned and moved a step away he followed with lowering glance his upper lip lifting and laying bare his powerful teeth in a stride he was beside her  do you hate me ruth he asked her hoarsely  why should i hate you she counterquestioned sadly i do not even dislike you she continued in a more friendly tone adding as if by way of explaining this phenomenon you are my brothers friend but i am disappointed in you sir rowland you had i know no intention of offering me disrespect and yet it is what you have done  as how he asked  knowing me anothers wife  he broke in tempestuously a mock marriage if it is but that scruple stands between us  i think there is more she answered him you compel me to hurt you i do so as the surgeon doesthat i may heal you  why thanks for nothing he made answer unable to repress a sneer then checking himself and resuming the heromartyr posture i go mistress he told her sadly and if i lose my life tonight or tomorrow in this affair  i shall pray for you said she for she had found him out at last perceived the nature of the bow he sought to draw across her heartstrings and having perceived it contempt awoke in her he had attempted to move her by unfair insidious means  he fell back crimson from chin to brow he stifled the wrath that welled up threatening to choke him he was a shortnecked man of the sortas trenchard had once reminded himthat falls a prey to apoplexy and surely he was never nearer it than at that moment he made her a profound bow bending himself almost in two before her in a very irony of deference then drawing himself up again he turned and left her  the plot which with some pride he had hatched and the reward he looked to cull from it were now to his soul as ashes to his lips what could it profit him to destroy monmouth so that anthony wilding lived for whether she loved wilding or not she was wildings wife wilding nominally at least was master of that which sir rowland coveted not her heart indeed but her ample fortune wilding had been a stumblingblock to him since he had come to bridgwater but for wilding he might have run a smooth course he was still fool enough to hug that dear illusion to his soul somewhere in englandif not dead alreadythis wilding lurked an outlaw whom any might shoot down at sight sir rowland swore he would not rest until he knew that anthony wilding cumbered the earth no moreleastways not the surface of it  he went forth to seek newlington the merchant had sent his message to the rebel king and had word in answer that his majesty would be graciously pleased to sup at mr newlingtons at nine oclock on the following evening attended by a few gentlemen of his immediate following sir rowland received the news with satisfaction and sighed to think that mr wildingstill absent heaven knew wherewould not be of the party it was reported that on the monday monmouth was to march to gloucester hoping there to be joined by his cheshire friends so that it seemed sir rowland had not matured his plan a day too soon he got to horse and contriving to win out of bridgwater rode off to somerton to concert with lord feversham concerning the men he would need for his undertaking  that night richard made free talk of the undertaking to diana and to ruth loving as does the pusillanimous to show himself engaged in daring enterprises emulating his friend sir rowland he held forth with prolixity upon the great service he was to do the state and ruth listening to him was proud of his zeal the sincerity of which it never entered her mind to doubt  diana listened too but without illusions concerning master richard and she kept her conclusions to herself  during the afternoon of the morrow which was sunday sir rowland returned to bridgwater his mission to feversham entirely successful and all preparations made he completed his arrangements and towards eight oclock that night the twenty men sent by fevershamthey had slipped singly into the townbegan to muster in the orchard at the back of mr newlingtons house  it was just about that same hour that mr wilding saddleworn and dustclogged in every pore rode into bridgwater and made his way to the sign of the ship in the high street overlooking the cross where trenchard was lodged his friend was absentpossibly gone with his men to the sermon ferguson was preaching to the army in the castle fields having put up his horse mr wilding all dusty as he was repaired straight to the castle to report himself to monmouth  he was informed that his majesty was in council nevertheless urging that his news was of importance he begged to be instantly announced after a pause he was ushered into a lofty roomy chamber where in the fading daylight king monmouth sat in council with grey and wade matthews speke ferguson and others at the foot of the table stood a sturdy countryfellow unknown to wilding it was godfrey the spy who was to act as their guide across sedgemoor that night for the matter that was engaging them just then was the completion of their plans for the attack that was to be made that very night upon fevershams unprepared campa matter which had been resolved during the last few hours as an alternative preferable to the retreat towards gloucester that had at first been intended  wilding was shocked at the change that had been wrought in monmouths appearance during the few weeks since last he had seen him his face was thin pale and haggard his eyes were more sombre and beneath them there were heavy dark stains of sleeplessness and care his very voice when presently he spoke seemed to have lost the musical timbre that had earlier distinguished it it was grown harsh and rasping disappointment after disappointment set down to illluck but in reality the fruit of incompetence had served to sour him the climax had been reached in the serious desertions after the philips norton fight and the flight of paymaster goodenough with the funds for the campaign the company sat about the long oak table on which a map was spread and colonel wade was speaking when wilding entered  on his appearance wade ceased and every eye was turned upon the messenger from london ferguson fresh from his sermon sat with elbows resting on the table his long chin supported by his hands his eyes gleaming sharply under the shadow of his wig which was pulled down in front to the level of his eyebrows  it was the duke who addressed mr wilding and the latters keen ears were quick to catch the bitterness that underlay his words  we are glad to see you sir we had not looked to do so again  not looked to do so your gr majesty he echoed plainly not understanding and it was observed that he stumbled over the dukes new title  we had imagined that the pleasures of the town were claiming your entire attention  wilding looked from one to the other of the men before him and on the face of all he saw a gravity that amounted to disapproval of him  the pleasures of the town said he frowning and againthe pleasures of the town there is something in this that i fear i do not understand  do you bring us news that london has risen asked grey suddenly  i would i could said wilding smiling wistfully is it a laughing matter quoth grey angrily  a smiling matter my lord answered wilding nettled your lordship will observe that i did but smile  mr wilding said monmouth darkly we are not pleased with you  in that case returned wilding more and more irritated your majesty expected of me more than was possible to any man  you have wasted your time in london sir the duke explained we sent you thither counting upon your loyalty and devotion to ourselves what have you done  as much as a man could wilding began when grey again interrupted him  as little as a man could he answered were his grace not the most foolishly clement prince in christendom a halter would be your reward for the fine things you have done in london  mr wilding stiffened visibly his long white face grew set and his slanting eyes looked wicked he was not a man readily moved to anger but to be greeted in such words as these by one who constituted himself the mouthpiece of him for whom wilding had incurred ruin was more than he could bear with equanimity that the risks to which he had exposed himself in londonwhere indeed he had been in almost hourly expectation of arrest and such short shrift as poor disney hadshould be acknowledged in such terms as these was something that turned him almost sick with disgust to what manner of men had he leagued himself he looked grey steadily between the eyes  i mind me of an occasion on which such a charge of foolish clemency might indeedand with greater justicehave been levelled against his majesty said he and his calm was almost terrible  his lordship grew pale at the obvious allusion to monmouths mild treatment of him for his cowardice at bridport and his eyes were as baleful as wildings own at that moment but before he could speak monmouth had already answered mr wilding  you are wanting in respect to us sir he admonished him  mr wilding bowed to the rebuke in a submission that seemed ironical the blood mounted slowly to monmouths cheeks  perhaps put in wade who was anxious for peace mr wilding has some explanation to offer us of his failure  his failure they took too much for granted stitched in the lining of his boot was the letter from the secretary of state to have achieved that was surely to have achieved something  i thank you sir for supposing it answered wilding his voice hard with selfrestraint i have indeed an explanation  we will hear it said monmouth condescendingly and grey sneered thrusting out his bloated lips  i have to offer the explanation that your majesty is served in london by cowards selfsufficient and selfimportant cowards who have hindered me in my task instead of helping me i refer particularly to colonel danvers  grey interrupted him you have a rare effrontery siraye by god do you dare call danvers a coward  it is not i who so call him but the facts colonel danvers has run away  danvers gone cried ferguson voicing the consternation of all  wilding shrugged and smiled greys eye was offensively upon him he elected to answer the challenge of that glance he has followed the illustrious example set him by other of your majestys devoted followers said wilding  grey rose suddenly this was too much ill not endure it from this knave he cried appealing to monmouth  monmouth wearily waved him to a seat but grey disregarded the command  what have i said that should touch your lordship asked wilding and smiling sardonically he looked into greys eyes  it is not what you have said it is what you have inferred  and to call me knave said wilding in a mocking horror  the repression of his anger lent him a rare bitterness and an almost devilishly subtle manner of expressing wordlessly what was passing in his mind there was not one present but gathered from his utterance of those five words that he did not hold grey worthy the honour of being called to account for that offensive epithet he made just an exclamatory protest such as he might have made had a woman applied the term to him  grey turned from him slowly to monmouth it might be well said he in his turn controlling himself at last to place mr wilding under arrest  mr wildings manner quickened on the instant from passive to active anger  upon what charge sir he demanded sharply in truth it was the only thing wanting that after all that he had undergone he should be arrested his eyes were upon the dukes melancholy face and his anger was such that in that moment he vowed that if monmouth acted upon this suggestion of greys he should not have so much as the consolation of sunderlands letter  you have been wanting in respect to us sir the duke answered him he seemed able to do little more than repeat himself you return from london emptyhanded your task unaccomplished and instead of a becoming contrition you hector it here before us in this manner he shook his head we are not pleased with you mr wilding but your grace exclaimed wilding is it my fault that your london agents had failed to organize the rising that rising should have taken place and it would have taken place had your majesty been more ably represented there  you were there mr wilding said grey with heavy sarcasm  would it no be better to leave mr wildings affair until afterwards suggested ferguson at that moment it is already past eight your majesty and there be still some details of this attack to settle that your officers may prepare for it whilst mr newlington awaits your majesty to supper at nine  true said monmouth ever ready to take a solution offered by another we will confer with you again later mr wilding  wilding bowed accepting his dismissal before i go your majesty there are certain things i would report he began  you have heard sir grey broke in not now this is not the time  indeed no this is not the time mr wilding echoed the duke  wilding set his teeth in the intensity of his vexation  what i have to tell your majesty is of importance he exclaimed and monmouth seemed to waver whilst grey looked disdainful unbelief of the importance of any communication wilding might have to make  we have little time your majesty ferguson reminded monmouth  perhaps put in friendly wade your majesty might see mr wilding at mr newlingtons  is it really necessary quoth grey  this treatment of him inspired mr wilding with malice the mere mention of sunderlands letter would have changed their tone but he elected by no such word to urge the importance of his business it should be entirely as monmouth should elect or be constrained by these gentlemen about his counciltable  it would serve two purposes said wade whilst monmouth still considered your majesty will be none too well attended your officers having this other matter to prepare for mr wilding would form another to swell your escort of gentlemen  i think you are right colonel wade said monmouth we sup at mr newlingtons at nine oclock mr wilding we shall expect you to attend us there lieutenant cragg said his grace to the young officer who had admitted wilding and who had remained at attention by the door you may reconduct mr wilding  wilding bowed his lips tight to keep in the anger that craved expression then without another word spoken he turned and departed  an insolent overbearing knave was greys comment upon him after he had left the room  let us attend to this your lordship said speke tapping the map time presses and he invited wade to continue the matter that wildings advent had interrupted    chapter xviii betrayal   still smarting under the cavalier treatment he had received mr wilding came forth from the castle to find trenchard awaiting him among the crowd of officers and men that thronged the yard  nick linked his arm through his friends and led him away they quitted the place in silence and in silence took their way south towards the high street nick waiting for mr wilding to speak mr wildings mind still in turmoil at the things he had endured at last nick halted suddenly and looked keenly at his friend in the failing light  what a plague ails you tony said he sharply you are as silent as i am impatient for your news  wilding told him in brief disdainful terms of the reception they had given him at the castle and of how they had blamed him for the circumstance that london had failed to proclaim itself for monmouth  trenchard snarled viciously tis that mongrel grey said he oh anthony to what an affair have we set our hands naught can prosper with that fellow in it he laid his hand on wildings arm and lowered his voice as i have hinted before twould not surprise me if time proved him a traitor failure attends him everywhere and so unfailingly that one wonders is not failure invited by him and that fool monmouth pshaw see what it is to serve a weakling with another in his place and the country disaffected as it is we had been masters of england by now  two ladies passed them at that moment cloaked and hooded walking briskly one of them turned to look at trenchard who waving his arms in wild gesticulation was a conspicuous object she checked in her walk arresting her companion  mr wilding she exclaimed it was lady horton  mr wilding cried diana her companion  wilding doffed his hat and bowed trenchard following his example  we had scarce looked to see you in bridgwater again said the mother her mild pleasant countenance reflecting the satisfaction it gave her to behold him safe and sound  there have been moments answered wilding when myself i scarce expected to return your ladyships greeting shows me what i had lost had i not done so  you are but newly arrived quoth diana scanning him in the gloaming  from london an hour since  an hour she echoed and observed that he was still booted and duststained you will have been to lupton house  a shadow crossed his face his glance seemed to grow clouded all of which watchful diana did not fail to observe not yet said he  you are a laggard she laughed at him and he felt the blood driven back upon his heart what did she mean was it possible she suggested that he should be welcome that his wifes feelings towards him had undergone a change his last parting from her on the road near walford had been ever in his mind  i have had weighty business to transact he replied and trenchard snorted his mind flying back to the councilroom at the castle and what his friend had told him  but now that you have disposed of that you will sup with us said lady horton who was convinced that since ruth had gone to the altar with him he was ruths lover in spite of the odd things she had heard appearances with lady horton counted for everything and all that glittered was gold to her  i would he answered but that i am to sup at mr newlingtons with his majesty my visit must wait until tomorrow  let us hope said trenchard that it waits no longer he was already instructed touching the night attack on fevershams camp on sedgemoor and thought it likely wilding would accompany them  you are going to mr newlingtons said diana and trenchard thought she had turned singularly pale her hand was over her heart her eyes wide she seemed about to add something but checked herself she took her mothers arm we are detaining mr wilding mother said she and her voice quivered as if her whole being were shaken by some gusty agitation they spoke their farewells briefly and moved on a second later diana was back at their side again  where are you lodged mr wilding she inquired  with my friend trenchardat the sign of the ship by the cross   she briefly acknowledged the information rejoined her mother and hurried away with her  trenchard stood staring after them a moment odd said he did you mark that girls discomposure  but wildings thoughts were elsewhere come nick if i am to render myself fit to sit at table with monmouth well need to hasten  they went their way but not so fast as went diana urging with her her protesting and shortwinded mother  where is your mistress the girl asked excitedly of the first servant she met at lupton house  in her room madam the man replied and to ruths room went diana breathlessly leaving lady horton gaping after her and understanding nothing  ruth who was seated pensive by her window rose on dianas impetuous entrance and in the deepening twilight she looked almost ghostly in her gown of shimmering white satin sewn with pearls about the neck of the lowcut bodice  diana she cried you startled me  not so much as i am yet to do answered diana breathing excitement she threw back the wimple from her head and pulling away her cloak tossed it on to the bed mr wilding is in bridgwater she announced  there was a faint rustle from the stiff satin of ruths gown then her voice shook slightly then he is not dead she said more because she felt that she must say something than because her words fitted the occasion  not yet said diana grimly  not yet  he sups tonight at mr newlingtons miss horton exclaimed in a voice pregnant with meaning  ah it was a cry from ruth sharp as if she had been stabbed she sank back to her seat by the window smitten down by this sudden news  there was a pause which fretted diana who now craved knowledge of what might be passing in her cousins mind she advanced towards ruth and laid a trembling hand on her shoulder where the white gown met the ivory neck he must be warned she said  but but how stammered ruth to warn him were to betray sir rowland  sir rowland cried diana in high scorn  and and richard ruth continued  yes and mr newlington and all the other knaves that are engaged in this murderous business well she demanded will you do it or must i  do it ruths eyes sought her cousins white excited face in the quasidarkness but have you thought of what it will mean have you thought of the poor people that will perish unless the duke is taken and this rebellion brought to an end  thought of it repeated diana witheringly not i i have thought that mr wilding is here and like to have his throat cut before an hour is past  tell me are you sure of this asked ruth  i have it from your husbands own lips diana answered and told her in a few words of her meeting with mr wilding  ruth sat with hands folded in her lap her eyes on the dim violet afterglow in the west and her mind wrestling with this problem that diana had brought her  diana she cried at last what am i to do  do echoed diana is it not plain warn mr wilding  but richard  mr wilding saved richards life  i know i know my duty is to warn him  then why hesitate  my duty is also to keep faith with richard to think of those poor misguided folk who are to be saved by this cried ruth in an agony if mr wildin is warned they will all be ruined  diana stamped her foot impatiently had i thought to find you in this mind i had warned him myself said she  ah why did you not  that the chance of doing so might be yours that you might thus repay him the debt in which you stand  diana i cant the words broke from her in a sob  but whatever her interest in mr wilding for her own sake dianas prime intent was the thwarting sir rowland blake if wilding were warned of what manner of feast was spread at newlingtons sir rowland would be indeed undone  you think of richard she exclaimed and you know that richard is to have no active part in the affairthat he will run no risk they have assigned him but a sentry duty that he may warn blake and his followers if any danger threatens them  it is not of richards life i am thinking but of his honour of his trust in me to warn mr wilding were to commit an act of betrayal  and is mr wilding to be slaughtered with his friends diana asked her resolve me that time presses in half an hour it will be too late  that allusion to the shortness of the time brought ruth an inspiration suddenly she saw a way wilding should be saved and yet she would not break faith with richard nor ruin those others she would detain him and whilst warning him at the last moment in time for him to save himself not do so until it must be too late for him to warn the others thus she would do her duty by him and yet keep faith with richard and sir rowland she had resolved she thought the awful difficulty that had confronted her she rose suddenly heartened by the thought  give me your cloak and wimple she bade diana and diana flew to do her bidding where is mr wilding lodged she asked  at the sign of the shipoverlooking the cross with mr trenchard shall i come with you  no answered ruth without hesitation i will go alone she drew the wimple well over her head so that in its shadows her face might lie concealed and hid her shimmering white dress under dianas cloak  she hastened through the illlighted streets never heeding the rough cobbles that hurt her feet shod in light indoor wear never heeding the crowds that thronged her way all bridgwater was astir with monmouths presence moreover there had been great incursions from taunton and the surrounding country the womenfolk of the dukekings followers having come that day to bridgwater to say farewell to father and son husband and brother before the army marchedas was still believedto gloucester  the halfhour was striking from saint marysthe church in which she had been marriedas ruth reached the door of the sign of the ship she was about to knock when suddenly it opened and mr wilding himself with trenchard immediately behind him stood confronting her at sight of him a momentary weakness took her he had changed from his hardused ridinggarments into a suit of roughly corded black silk which threw into relief the steely litheness of his spare figure his dark brown hair was carefully dressed diamonds gleamed in the cravat of snowy lace at his throat he was uncovered his hat under his arm and he stood aside to make way for her imagining that she was some woman of the house  mr wilding said she her heart fluttering in her throat may i may i speak with you  he leaned forward seeking to pierce the shadows of her wimple he had thought he recognized the voice as his sudden start had shown and yet he disbelieved his ears she moved her head at that moment and the light streaming out from a lamp in the passage beat upon her white face  ruth he cried and came quickly forward trenchard behind him looked on and scowled with sudden impatience mr wildings philanderings with this lady had never had the old rakes approval too much trouble already had resulted from them  i must speak with you at once at once she urged him her tone fearful  are you in need of me he asked concernedly  in very urgent need said she  i thank god he answered without flippancy you shall find me at your service tell me  not here not here she answered him  where else said he shall we walk  no no her repetitions marked the deep excitement that possessed her i will go in with you and she signed with her head towards the door from which he was barely emerged  twere scarce fitting said he for being confused and full of speculation on the score of her need he had for the moment almost overlooked the relations in which they stood in spite of the ceremony through which they had gone together mr wilding still mostly thought of her as of a mistress very difficult to woo  fitting she echoed and then after a pause am i not your wife she asked him in a low voice her cheeks crimsoning  ha pon honour i had almost forgot said he and though the burden of his words seemed mocking their tone was sad  of the passersby that jostled them a couple had now paused to watch a scene that had an element of the unusual in it she pulled her wimple closer to her face took him by the arm and drew him with her into the house  close the door she bade him and trenchard who had stood aside that they might pass in forestalled him in obeying her now lead me to your room said she and wilding in amaze turned to trenchard as if asking his consent for the lodging after all was trenchards  ill wait here said nick and waved his hand towards an oak bench that stood in the passage you had best make haste he urged his friend you are late already that is unless you are of a mind to set the ladys affairs before king monmouths and were i in your place anthony faith id not scruple to do it for after all he added under his breath theres little choice in rotten apples  ruth waited for some answer from wilding that might suggest he was indifferent whether he went to newlingtons or not but he spoke no word as he turned to lead the way abovestairs to the indifferent parlour which with the adjoining bedroom constituted mr trenchards lodgingand his own for the time being  having assured herself that the curtains were closely drawn she put by her cloak and hood and stood revealed to him in the light of the three candles burning in a branch upon the bare oak table dazzlingly beautiful in her gown of ivorywhite  he stood apart cogitating her with glowing eyes the faintest smile between question and pleasure hovering about his thin mouth he had closed the door and stood in silence waiting for her to make known to him her pleasure  mr wilding she began and straightway he interrupted her  but a moment since you did remind me that i have the honour to be your husband he said with grave humour why seek now to overcloud that fact i mind me that the last time we met you called me by another name but it may be he added as an afterthought you are of opinion that i have broken faith with you  broken faith as how  so he said and sighed my words were of so little account that they have been i see forgotten yet so that i remember them that is what chiefly matters i promised thenor seemed to promisethat i would make a widow of you who had made a wife of you against your will it has not happened yet do not despair this monmouth quarrel is not yet fought out hope on my ruth  she looked at him with eyes wide openlustrous eyes of sapphire in a face of ivory a faint smile parted her lips the reflection of the thought in her mind that had she indeed been eager for his death she would not be with him at this moment had she desired it how easy would her course have been  you do me wrong to bid me hope for that she answered him her tones level i do not wish the death of any man unless she paused her truthfulness urged her too far  unless said he brows raised polite interest on his face  unless it be his grace of monmouth  he considered her with suddenly narrowed eyes you have not by chance sought me to talk politics said he or and he suddenly caught his breath his nostrils dilating with rage at the bare thought that leapt into his mind had monmouth the notorious libertine been to lupton house and persecuted her with his addresses is it that you are acquainted with his grace he asked  i have never spoken to him she answered with no suspicion of what was in his thoughts  in his relief he laughed remembering now that monmouths affairs were too absorbing just at present to leave him room for dalliance  but you are standing said he and he advanced a chair i deplore that i have no better hospitality to offer you i doubt if i ever shall again i am told that albemarle did me the honour to stable his knackers in my hall at zoyland  she took the chair he offered her sinking to it like one physically weary a thing he was quick to notice he watched her his body eager his soul trammelling it with a steely restraint tell me now said he in what you need me  she was silent a moment pondering hesitation and confusion seeming to envelop her a pink flush rose to colour the beautiful pillar of neck and overspread the delicate halfaverted face he watched it wondering  how long she asked him her whole intent at present being to delay him and gain time how long have you been in bridgwater  two hours at most said he  two hours and yet you never came to to me i heard of your presence and i feared you might intend to abstain from seeking me  he almost held his breath while she spoke caught in amazement he was standing close beside her chair his right hand rested upon its tall back  did you so intend she asked him  i told you even now he answered with hardwon calm that i had made you a sort of promise  i i would not have you keep it she murmured she heard his sharply indrawn breath felt him leaning over her and was filled with an unaccountable fear  was it to tell me this you came he asked her his voice reduced to a whisper  no yes she answered an agony in her mind which groped for some means to keep him by her side until his danger should be overpast that much she owed him in honour if in nothing else  noyes he echoed and he had drawn himself erect again what ist you mean ruth  i mean that it was that yet not quite only that  ah disappointment vibrated faintly in his clamation what else  i would have you abandon monmouths following she told him  he stared a moment moved away and round where he could confront her the flush had now faded from her face this he observed and the heave of her bosom in its low bodice he knit his brows perplexed here was surely more than at first might seem  why so he asked  for your own safetys sake she answered him  you are oddly concerned for that ruth  concernednot oddly she paused an instant swallowed hard and then continued i am concerned too for your honour and there is no honour in following his banner he has crowned himself king and so proved himself a selfseeker who came dissembled as the champion of a cause that he might delude poor ignorant folk into flocking to his standard and helping him to his ambitious ends  you are wondrously well schooled said he whose teachings do you recite me sir rowland blakes  at another time the sneer might have cut her at the moment she was too intent upon gaining time the means to it mattered little the more she talked to no purpose the more at random was their discourse the better would her ends be served  sir rowland blake she cried what is he to me  ah what let me set you the question rather  less than nothing she assured him and for some moments afterwards it was this sir rowland who served them as a topic for their odd interview on the overmantel the pulse of time beat on from a little wooden clock his eyes strayed to it it marked the threequarters he bethought him suddenly of his engagement trenchard belowstairs supremely indifferent whether wilding went to newlingtons or not smoked on entirely unconcerned by the flight of time  mistress said wilding suddenly you have not yet told me in what you seek my service indeed we seem to have talked to little purpose my time is very short  where are you going she asked him and fearfully she shot a sidelong glance at the timepiece it was still too soon by at least five minutes  he smiled but his smile was singular he began to suspect at last that her only purposeto what end he could not guesswas to detain him  tis a singularly sudden interest in my doings this said he quietly what ist you seek of me he reached for the hat he had cast upon the table when they had entered tell me briefly i may stay no longer  she rose her agitation suddenly increasing afraid that after all he would escape her where are you going she asked answer me that and i will tell you why i came  i am to sup at mr newlingtons in his majestys company  his majestys  king monmouths he explained impatiently come ruth already i am late  if i were to ask you not to go she said slowly and she held out her hands to him her glance most piteousand that was not actingas she raised it to meet his own would you not stay to pleasure me  he considered her from under frowning eyes ruth he said and he took her hands there is here something that i do not understand what ist you mean  promise me that you will not go to newlingtons and i will tell you  but what has newlington to do with nay i am pledged already to go  she drew closer to him her hands upon his shoulders yet if i ask youi your wife she pleaded and almost won him to her will  but suddenly he remembered another occasion on which for purposes of her own she had so pleaded he laughed softly mockingly  do you woo me ruth who when i wooed you would have none of me  she drew back from him crimsoning i think i had better go said she you have nothing but mockery for me it was ever so who knows she sighed as she took up her mantle had you but observed more gentle ways you you she paused needing to say no more goodnight she ended and made shift to leave he watched her deeply mystified she had gained the door when suddenly he moved  wait he cried she paused and turned to look over her shoulder her hand apparently upon the latch you shall not go until you have told me why you besought me to keep away from newlingtons what is it he asked and paused suddenly a flood of light breaking in upon his mind is there some treachery afoot he asked her and his eye went wildly to the clock a harsh grating sound rang through the room what are you doing he cried why have you locked the door she was tugging and fumbling desperately to extract the key her hands all clumsy in her nervous haste he leapt at her but in that moment the key came away in her hand she wheeled round to face him erect defiant almost  here is some devilry he cried give me that key  he had no need for further questions here was a proof more eloquent than words to his ready wit sir rowland or richard or both were in some plot for the dukes ruinperhaps assassination had not her very words shown that she herself was out of all sympathy with monmouth he was out of sympathy himself but not to the extent of standing by to see his throat cut she would have the plot succeedwhatever it might be and yet that he himself be spared there his thoughts paused but only for a moment he saw suddenly in this not a proof of concern born of love but of duty towards him who had imperilled himself onceand for all time indeedthat he might save her brother and sir rowland  he told her what had been so suddenly revealed to him taxing her with it she acknowledged it her wits battling to find some way by which she might yet gain a few moments more she would cling to the key and though he should offer her violence she would not let it go without a struggle and that struggle must consume the little time yet wanting to make it too late for him to save the duke andwhat imported morethus save herself from betraying her brothers trust another fear leapt at her suddenly if through deed of hers monmouth was spared that night blake in his despair and rage might slake his vengeance upon richard  give me that key he demanded his voice cold and quiet his face set  no no she cried setting her hand behind her you shall not go anthony you shall not go  i must he insisted still cold but oh so determined my honours in it now that i know  youll go to your death she reminded him  he sneered what signifies a day or so give me the key  i love you anthony she cried livid to the lips  lies he answered her contemptuously the key  no she answered and her firmness matched his own i will not have you slain  tis not my purposenot just yet but i must save the others god forgive me if i offer violence to a woman he added and lay rude hands upon her do not compel me to it he advanced upon her but she lithe and quick evaded him and sprang for the middle of the room he wheeled about his selfcontrol all slipping from him now suddenly she darted to the window and with the hand that clenched the key she smote a pane with all her might there was a smash of shivering glass followed an instant later by a faint tinkle on the stones below and the hand that she still held out covered itself all with blood  o god he cried the key and all else forgotten you are hurt  but you are saved she cried overwrought and staggered laughing and sobbing to a chair sinking her bleeding hand to her lap and smearing recklessly her spotless shimmering gown  he caught up a chair by its legs and at a single blow smashed down the doora frail barrier after all nick he roared nick he tossed the chair from him and vanished into the adjoining room to reappear a moment later carrying basin and ewer and a shirt of trenchardsthe first piece of linen he could find  she was half fainting and she let him have his swift masterful way he bathed her hand and was relieved to find that the injury was none so great as the flow of blood had made him fear he tore trenchards fine cambric shirt to shredsa matter on which trenchard afterwards commented in quotations from at least three famous elizabethan dramatists he bound up her hand just as nick made his appearance at the splintered door his mouth open his pipe gone out between his fingers he was followed by a startled servingwench the only other person in the house for every one was out of doors that night  into the womans care wilding delivered his wife and without a word to her he left the room dragging trenchard with him it was striking nine as they went down the stairs and the sound brought as much satisfaction to ruth above as dismay to wilding below    chapter xix the banquet   it was striking nine therefore ruth thought that she had achieved her object wilding imagined that all was lost it needed the more tranquil mind of nicholas trenchard to show him the fly in madams ointment after wilding in half a dozen words had made him acquainted with the situation  what are you going to do asked trenchard  run to newlingtons and warn the dukeif still in time  and thereby precipitate the catastrophe oh give it thought it is all it needs you are taking it for granted that nine oclock is the hour appointed for king monmouths butchery  what else asked wilding impatient to be off  they were standing in the street under the sign of the ship by which jonathan edney mr trenchards landlorddistinguished his premises and the chandlers trade he drove there trenchard set a detaining hand on mr wildings arm  nine oclock is the hour appointed for supper it is odds the duke will be a little late and it is more than odds that when he does arrive the assassins will wait until the company is safely at table and lulled by good eating and drinking you had overlooked that i see it asks an old head for wisdom after all look you anthony speed to colonel wade as fast as your legs can carry you and get a score of men then find some fellow to lead you to newlingtons orchard and if only you do not arrive too late you may take sir rowland and his cutthroats in the rear and destroy them to a man before they realize themselves attacked ill reconnoitre while you go and keep an eye on the front of the house away with you  ordinarily wilding was a man of a certain dignity but you had not thought it had you seen him running in silk stockings and silverbuckled shoes at a headlong pace through the narrow streets of bridgwater in the direction of the castle he overset more than one and oaths followed him from these and from others whom he rudely jostled out of his path wade was gone with monmouth but he came upon captain slape who had a company of scythes and musketeers incorporated in the dukes own regiment and to him wilding gasped out the news and his request for a score of men with what breath was left him  time was lostand never was time more preciousin convincing slape that this was no old wifes tale at last however he won his way and twenty musketeers but the quarterpast the hour had chimed ere they left the castle he led them forth at a sharp run with never a thought for the circumstance that they would need their breath anon perhaps for fighting and he bade the man who guided them take them by back streets that they might attract as little attention as possible  within a stonesthrow of the house he halted them and sent one forward to reconnoitre following himself with the others as quietly and noiselessly as possible mr newlingtons house was all alight but from the absence of uproarsounds there were in plenty from the main street where a dense throng had collected to see his majesty go inmr wilding inferred with supreme relief that they were still in time but the danger was not yet past already perhaps the assassins were penetratingor had penetratedto the house and at any moment such sounds might greet them as would announce the execution of their murderous design  meanwhile mr trenchard having relighted his pipe and set his hat rakishly atop his golden wig strolled up the high street swinging his long cane very much like a gentleman taking the air in quest of an appetite for supper he strolled past the cross and on until he came to the handsome mansionone of the few handsome houses in bridgwaterwhere opulent mr newlington had his residence a small crowd had congregated about the doors for word had gone forth that his majesty was to sup there trenchard moved slowly through the people seemingly uninterested but in fact scanning closely every face he encountered suddenly out of the corner of his eye he espied in the indifferent light mr richard westmacott  trenchard passed him jostling him as he went and strolled on some few paces then turned and came slowly back and observed that richard had also turned and was now watching him as he approached he was all but upon the boy when suddenly his wrinkled face lighted with recognition  mr westmacott he cried and there was surprise in his voice  richard conscious that trenchard must no doubt regard him as a turntippet flushed and stood aside to give passage to the other but mr trenchard was by no means minded to pass he clapped a hand on richards shoulder nay he cried between laughter and feigned resentment do you bear me illwill lad  richard was somewhat taken aback for what should i bear you illwill mr trenchard quoth he  trenchard laughed frankly and so uproariously that his hat overjauntily cocked was all but shaken from his head i mind me the last time we met i played you an unfair trick said he his tone bespoke the very highest goodhumour he slipped his arm through richards never bear an old man malice lad said he  i assure you that i bear you none said richard relieved to find that trenchard apparently knew nothing of his defection yet wishing that trenchard would go his ways for richards task was to stand sentry there  ill not believe you till you afford me proof trenchard replied you shall come and wash your resentment down in the best bottle of canary the white cow can furnish us  not now i thank you answered richard  you are thinking of the last occasion on which i drank with you said trenchard reproachfully  not so but but i am not thirsty  not thirsty echoed trenchard and is that a reason why lad it is the beast that drinks only when he thirsts and in that lies one of the main differences between beast and man come onand his arm effected a gentle pressure upon richards to move him thence but at that moment down the street with a great rumble of wheels cracking of whips and clatter of hoofs came a coach bearing to mr newlingtons king monmouth escorted by his forty lifeguards cheering broke from the crowd as the carriage drew up and the dukeking as he alighted turned his handsome face on which shone the ruddy glow of torches to acknowledge these loyal acclamations he passed up the steps at the top of which mr newlingtonfat and pale and monstrously overdressedstood bowing to welcome his royal visitor host and guest vanished followed by some six officers of monmouths among whom were grey and wade the sightseers flattened themselves against the walls as the great lumbering coach put about and went off again the way it had come the lifeguards following after  trenchard fancied that he caught a sigh of relief from richard but the street was noisy at the time and he may well have been mistaken  come said he renewing his invitation we shall both be the better for a little milk of the white cow       richard wavered almost by instinct  the white cow he knew was famous for its sack on the other hand he was pledged to sir rowland to stand guard in the narrow lane at the back where ran the wall of mr newlingtons garden under the gentle suasion of trenchards arm he moved a few steps up the street then halted his duty battling with his inclination  no no he muttered if you will excuse me  not i said trenchard drawing from his hesitation a shrewd inference as to richards business  to drink alone is an abomination ill not be guilty of  but began the irresolute richard  shalt urge me no excuses or well quarrel come and he moved on dragging richard with him  a few steps richard took unwillingly under the others soft compulsion then having given the matter thoughthe was always one to take the line of least resistancehe assured himself that his sentryship was entirely superfluous the matter of blakes affair was an entire secret shared only by those who had a hand in it blake was quite safe from all surprises trenchard was insistent and it was difficult to deny him and the sack at the white cow was no doubt the best in somerset he gave himself up to the inevitable and fell into step alongside his companion who babbled aimlessly of trivial matters trenchard felt the change from unwilling to willing companionship and approved it  they mounted the three steps and entered the common room of the inn it was well thronged at the time but they found places at the end of a long table and there they sat and discussed the landladys canary for the best part of a halfhour until a sudden spatter of musketry near at hand came to startle the whole room  there was a momentary stillness in the tavern succeeded by an excited clamouring a dash for the windows and a storm of questions to which none could return any answer richard had risen with a sudden exclamation very pale and scared of aspect trenchard tugged at his sleeve  sit down said he sit down it will be nothing  nothing echoed richard and his eyes were suddenly bent on trenchard in a look in which suspicion was now blent with terror  a second volley of musketry crackled forth at that moment and the next the whole street was in an uproar men were running and shots resounded on every side above all of which predominated the cry that his majesty was murdered  in an instant the common room of the white cow was emptied of every occupant save twotrenchard and westmacott neither of them felt the need to go forth in quest of news they knew how idle was the cry in the streets they knew what had taken place and knowing it trenchard smoked on placidly satisfied that wilding had been in time whilst richard stood stricken and petrified by dismay at realizing with even greater certainty that something had supervened to thwart perhaps to destroy sir rowland for he knew that blakes party had gone forth armed with pistols only and intent not to use even these save in the last extremity to avoid noise they were to keep to steel this knowledge gave richard positive assurance that the volleys they had heard must have been fired by some party that had fallen upon blakes men and taken them by surprise  and it was his fault he was the traitor to whom perhaps a score of men owed their deaths at that moment he had failed to keep watch as he had undertaken his fault it wasno not his but this villains who sat there smugly taking his ease and pulling at his pipe  at a blow richard dashed the thing from his companions mouth and fingers  trenchard looked up startled  what the devil he began  it is your fault your fault cried richard his eyes blazing his lips livid it was you who lured me hither  trenchard stared at him in bland surprise now what a plague ist youre saying he asked and brought richard to his senses by awaking in him the instinct of selfpreservation  how could he explain his meaning without betraying himselfand surely that were a folly now that the others were no doubt disposed of let him rather bethink him of his own safety trenchard looked at him keenly with wellassumed intent to read what might be passing in his mind then rose paid for the wine and expressed his intention of going forth to inquire into these strange matters that were happening in bridgwater  meanwhile those volleys fired in mr newlingtons orchard had causedas well may be conceivedan agitated interruption of the superb feast mr newlington had spread for his noble and distinguished guests the duke had for some days been going in fear of his life for already he had been fired at more than once by men anxious to earn the price at which his head was valued instantly he surmised that whatever that firing might mean it indicated some attempt to surprise him with the few gentlemen who attended him  the whole company came instantly to its feet and colonel wade stepped to a window that stood openfor the night was very warm the duke turned for explanation to his host the trader however professed himself entirely unable to offer any he was very pale and his limbs were visibly trembling but then his agitation was most natural his wife and daughter supervened at that moment in their alarm entering the room unceremoniously in spite of the august presence to inquire into the meaning of this firing and to reassure themselves that their father and his illustrious guests were safe   from the windows they could observe a stir in the gardens below black shadows of men flitted to and fro and a loud rich voice was heard calling to them to take cover that they were betrayed then a sheet of livid flame blazed along the summit of the low wall and a second volley of musketry rang out succeeded by cries and screams from the assailed and the shouts of the assailers who were now pouring into the garden through the battered doorway and over the wall for some moments steel rang on steel and pistolshots cracked here and there to the accompaniment of voices raised some in anger some in pain but it was soon over and a comparative stillness succeeded  a voice called up from the darkness under the windows to know if his majesty was safe there had been a plot to take him but the ambuscaders had been ambuscaded in their turn and not a man of them remainedwhich was hardly exact for under a laurel bush scarce daring to breathe lay sir rowland blake livid with fear and fury and bleeding from a rapier scratch in the cheek but otherwise unhurt  in the room above monmouth had sunk wearily into his chair upon hearing of the design there had been against his life a deep bitter melancholy enwrapped his spirit lord greys first thoughts flew to the man he most dislikedthe one man missing from those who had been bidden to accompany his majesty whose absence had already formed the subject of comment grey remembered this bearing before the council that same evening and his undisguised resentment of the reproaches levelled against him  where is mr wilding he asked suddenly his voice dominating the din of talk that filled the room do we hold the explanation of his absence  monmouth looked up quickly his beautiful eyes ineffably sad his weak mouth drooping at the corners wade turned to confront grey  your lordship does not suggest that mr wilding can have a hand in this  appearances would seem to point in that direction answered grey and in his wicked heart he almost hoped it might be so  then appearances speak truth for once came a bitter ringing voice they turned and there on the threshold stood mr wilding unheard he had come upon them he was bareheaded and carried his drawn sword there was blood upon it and there was blood on the lace that half concealed the hand that held it otherwiseand saving that his shoes and stockings were sodden with the dew from the long grass in the orchardhe was as spotless as when he had left ruth in trenchards lodging his face too was calm save for the mocking smile with which he eyed lord grey  monmouth rose on his appearance and put his hand to his sword in alarm grey whipped his own from the scabbard and placed himself slightly in front of his master as if to preserve him  you mistake sirs said wilding quietly the hand i have had in this affair has been to save your majesty from your enemies at the moment i should have joined you word was brought me of the plot that was laid of the trap that was set for you i hastened to the castle and obtained a score of musketeers of slapes company with those i surprised the murderers lurking in the garden there and made an end of them i greatly feared i should not come in time but it is plain that heaven preserves your majesty for better days  in the revulsion of feeling monmouths eyes shone moist grey sheathed his sword with an awkward laugh and a still more awkward word of apology to wilding the duke moved by a sudden impulse to make amends for his unworthy suspicions for his perhaps unworthy reception of wilding earlier that evening in the councilroom drew the sword on which his hand still rested he advanced a step  kneel mr wilding he said in a voice stirred by emotion but wildings stern spirit scorned this all too sudden friendliness of monmouths as much as he scorned the accolade at monmouths hands  there are more pressing matters to demand your majestys attention said mr wilding coldly advancing to the table as he spoke and taking up a napkin to wipe his blade than the reward of an unworthy servant  monmouth felt his sudden enthusiasm chilled by that tone and manner  mr newlington said mr wilding after the briefest of pauses and the fat sinful merchant started forward in alarm it was like a summons of doom his majesty came hither i am informed to receive at your hands a sum of moneytwenty thousand poundstowards the expenses of the campaign have you the money at hand and his eye glittering between cruelty and mockery fixed itself upon the merchants ashen face  it it shall be forthcoming by morning stammered newlington  by morning cried grey who with the others watched mr newlington what time they all wondered at mr wildings question and the manner of it  you knew that i march tonight monmouth reproached the merchant  and it was to receive the money that you invited his majesty to do you the honours of supping with you here put in wade frowning darkly  the merchants wife and daughter stood beside him watching him and plainly uneasy before he could make any reply mr wilding spoke again  the circumstance that he has not the money by him is a little oddor would be were it not for what has happened i would submit your majesty that you receive from mr newlington not twenty thousand pounds as he had promised you but thirty thousand and that you receive it not as a loan as was proposed but as a fine imposed upon him in consequence of his lack of care in the matter of his orchard  monmouth looked at the merchant very sternly you have heard mr wildings suggestion said he you may thank the god of traitors it was made else we might have thought of a harsher course you shall pay the money by ten oclock tomorrow to mr wilding whom i shall leave behind for the sole purpose of collecting it he turned from newlington in plain disgust i think sirs that here is no more to be done are the streets safe mr wilding  not only safe your majesty but the twenty men of slapes and your own lifeguards are waiting to escort you  then in gods name let us be going said monmouth sheathing his sword and moving towards the door not a second time did he offer to confer the honour of knighthood upon his saviour  mr wilding turned and went out to marshal his men the duke and his officers followed more leisurely as they reached the door a womans cry broke the silence behind them monmouth turned mr newlington purple of face and his eyes protruding horridly was beating the air with his hands suddenly he collapsed and crashed forward with arms flung out amid the glass and silver of the table all spread with the traitors banquet to which he had bidden his unsuspecting victim  his wife and daughter ran to him and called him by name monmouth pausing a moment to watch them from the doorway with eyes unmoved but mr newlington answered not their call for he was dead    chapter xx the reckoning   ruth had sped home through the streets unattended as she had come heedless of the rude jostlings and ruder greetings she met with from those she passed heedless too of the smarting of her injured hand for the agony of her soul was such that it whelmed all minor sufferings of the flesh  in the diningroom at lupton house she came upon diana and lady horton at supper and her appearanceher white and distraught face and bloodsmeared gownbrought both women to their feet in alarmed inquiry no less than it brought jasper the butler to her side with ready solicitude ruth answered him that there was no cause for fear that she was quite wellhad scratched her hand no more and with that dismissed him when she was alone with her aunt and cousin she sank into a chair and told them what had passed twixt her husband and herself and most of what she said was greek to lady horton  mr wilding has gone to warn the duke she ended and the despair of her tone was tragical i sought to detain him until it should be too latei thought i had done so but but oh i am afraid diana  afraid of what asked diana afraid of what  and she came to ruth and set an arm in comfort about her shoulders  afraid that mr wilding might reach the duke in time to be destroyed with him her cousin answered such a warning could but hasten on the blow  lady horton begged to be enlightened and was filled with horror whenfrom dianaenlightenment was hers her sympathies were all with the handsome monmouth for he was beautiful and should therefore be triumphant poor lady horton never got beyond externals that her nephew and sir rowland whom she had esteemed should be leagued in this dastardly undertaking against that lovely person horrified her beyond words she withdrew soon afterwards having warmly praised ruths action in warning mr wildingunable to understand that it should be no part of ruths design to save the dukeand went to her room to pray for the preservation of the late kings handsome son  left alone with her cousin ruth gave expression to the fears for richard by which she was being tortured diana poured wine for her and urged her to drink she sought to comfort and reassure her but as moments passed and grew to hours and still richard did not appear ruths fears that he had come to harm were changed to certainty there was a moment when but for dianas remonstrances she had gone forth in quest of news bad news were better than this horror of suspense what if wildings warning should have procured help and richard were slain in consequence oh it was unthinkable diana white of face listened to and shared her fears even her shallow nature was stirred by the tragedy of ruths position by dread lest richard should indeed have met his end that night in these moments of distress she forgot her hopes of triumphing over blake of punishing him for his indifference to herself  at last at something after midnight there came a fevered rapping at the outer door both women started up and with arms about each other in their sudden panic stood there waiting for the news that must be here at last  the door of the diningroom was flung open the women recoiled in their dread of what might come then richard entered jaspers startled countenance showing behind him  he closed the door shutting out the wondering servant and they saw that though his face was ashen and his limbs all atremble he showed no sign of any hurt or effort his dress was as meticulous as when last they had seen him ruth flew to him flung her arms about his neck and pressed him to her  oh richard richard she sobbed in the immensity of her relief thank god thank god  he wriggled peevishly in her embrace disengaged her arms and put her from him almost roughly have done he growled and lurching past her he reached the table took up a bottle and brimmed himself a measure he gulped the wine avidly set down the cup and shivered where is blake he asked  blake echoed ruth her lips white diana sank into a chair watchful fearful and silent taking now no glory in the thing she had encompassed  richard beat his hands together in a passion of dismay is he not here he asked and groaned o god he flung himself all limp into a chair you have heard the news i see he said  not all of it said diana hoarsely leaning forward tell us what passed  he moistened his lips with his tongue we were betrayed he said in a quivering voice betrayed did i but know by whom he broke off with a bitter laugh and shrugged rubbing his hands together and shivering till his shoulders shook blakes party was set upon by half a company of musketeers their corpses are strewn about old newlingtons orchard not one of them escaped they say that newlington himself is dead he poured himself more wine  ruth listened her eyes burning the rest of her as cold as ice butbut oh thank god that you at least are safe dick  how did you escape quoth diana  how he started as if he had been stung he laughed in a high cracked voice his eyes wild and bloodshot how perhaps it is just as well that blake has gone to his account perhaps he checked on the word and started to his feet diana screamed in sheer aifright behind her the windows had been thrust open so violently that one of the panes was shivered blake stood under the lintel scarce recognizable so smeared was his face with the blood escaping from the wound his cheek had taken his clothes were muddied soiled torn and disordered  framed there against the black background of the night he stood and surveyed them for a moment his aspect terrific then he leapt forward baring his sword as he came an incoherent roar burst from his lips as he bore straight down upon richard  you damned infernal traitor he cried draw draw or die like the muckworm that you are  intrepid her terror all vanished now that there was the need for courage ruth confronted him barring his passage a buckler to her palsied brother  out of my way mistress or ill be doing you a mischief  you are mad sir rowland she told him in a voice that did something towards restoring him to his senses  his fierce eyes considered her a moment and he controlled himself to offer an explanation the twenty that were with me lie stark under the stars in newlingtons garden he told her as richard had told her already i escaped by a miracle no less but for what feversham will demand of me a stern account of those lives whilst if i am found in bridgwater there will be a short shrift for me at the rebel handsfor my share in this affair is known my name on every lip in the town and why he asked with a sudden increase of fierceness why because that craven villain there betrayed me  he did not she answered in so assured a voice that not only did it give him pause but caused richard cowering behind her to raise his head in wonder  sir rowland smiled his disbelief and that smile twisting his bloodsmeared countenance was grotesque and horrible i left him to guard our backs and give me warning if any approached he informed her i knew him for too great a coward to be trusted in the fight so i gave him a safe task and yet in that he failed mefailed me because he had betrayed and sold me  he had not i tell you he had not she insisted i swear it  he stared at her there was no one else for it he made answer and bade her harshly stand aside  diana huddled together watched and waited in horror for the end of these consequences of her work  blake made a sudden movement to win past ruth richard staggered to his feet intent on defending himself but he was swordless retreat to the door suggested itself and he had half turned to attempt to gain it when ruths next words arrested him petrified him  there was some one else for it sir rowland she cried it was not richard who betrayed you it it was i  you the fierceness seemed all to drop away from him whelmed in the immensity of his astonishment you then he laughed loud in scornful disbelief you think to save him he said  should i lie she asked him calm and brave  he stared at her stupidly he passed a hand across his brow and looked at diana oh it is impossible he said at last  you shall hear she answered and told him how at the last moment she had learnt not only that her husband was in bridgwater but that he was to sup at newlingtons with the dukes party  i had no thought of betraying you or of saving the duke she said i knew how justifiable was what you intended but i could not let mr wilding go to his death i sought to detain him warning him only when i thought it would be too late for him to warn others but you delayed overlong and  a hoarse inarticulate cry from him came to interrupt her at that point one glimpse of his face she had and of the hand half raised with sword pointing towards her and she closed her eyes thinking that her sands were run and indeed blakes intention was just then to kill her that he should owe his betrayal to her was in itself cause enough to enrage him but that her motive should have been her desire to save wildingwilding of all menthat was the last straw  had he been forewarned that wilding was to be one of monmouths party at mr newlingtons his pulses would have throbbed with joy and he would have flung himself into his murderous task with twice the zest he had carried to it and now he learnt that not only had she thwarted his schemes against monmouth but had deprived him of the ardently sought felicity of widowing her he drew back his arm for the thrust diana huddled into her chair too horrorstricken to speak or move richardimmediately behind his sistersaw nothing of what was passing and thought of nothing but his own safety  then blake paused stepped back returned his sword to its scabbard and bending himselfbut whether to bow or not was not quite plainhe took some paces backwards then turned and went out by the window as he had come but there was a sudden purposefulness in the way he did it that might have warned them this withdrawal was not quite the retreat it seemed  they watched him with many emotions predominant among which was relief and when he was gone diana rose and came to ruth  come she said and sought to lead her from the room  but there was richard now to be reckoned with richard from whom the palsy was of a sudden fallen now that the cause of it had withdrawn he had his back to the door and his weak mouth was pursed up into a semblance of resolution his pale eyes looked stern his white eyebrows bent together in a frown  wait he said they looked at him and the shadow of a smile almost flitted across dianas face he stepped to the door and opening it held it wide go diana he said ruth and i must understand each other  diana hesitated you had better go diana said her cousin whereupon mistress horton went  hot and fierce came the recriminations from richards lips when he and his sister were alone and ruth weathered the storm bravely until it was stemmed again by fresh fear in richard for blake had suddenly reappeared he came forward from his window his manner composed and full of resolution young westmacott recoiled the heat all frozen out of him but blake scarce looked at him his smouldering glance was all for ruth who watched him with incipient fear despite herself  madam he said tis not to be supposed a mind holding so much thought for a husbands safety could find room for any concern as to anothers i will ask you natheless to consider what tale i am to bear lord feversham  what tale said she  ayethat will account for what has chanced for my failure to discharge the task entrusted me and for the slaughter of an officer of his and twenty men  why ask me this she demanded half angrily then suddenly bethinking her of how she had ruined his enterprise and of the position in which she had placed him she softened her clear mind held justice very dear she approached oh i am sorrysorry sir rowland she cried  he sneered he had wiped some of the blood from his face but still looked terrible enough  sorry said he and laughed unpleasantly youll come with me to feversham and tell him what you did said he  i she recoiled in fear  at once he informed her  wha whats that faltered richard calling up his manhood and coming forward what are you saying blake  sir rowland disdained to heed him come mistress he said and putting forward his hand he caught her wrist and pulled her roughly towards him she struggled to free herself but he leered evilly upon her no whit discomposed by her endeavours though short of stature he was a man of considerable bodily strength and she though tall was slight of frame he released her wrist and before she realized what he was about he had stooped passed an arm behind her knees another round her waist and swinging her from her feet took her up bodily in his arms he turned about and a scream broke from her  hold cried richard hold you madman  keep off or ill make an end of you before i go roared blake over his shoulder for already he had turned about and was making for the window apparently no more hindered by his burden than had she been a doll  richard sprang to the door jasper he bawled jasper he had no weapons as we have seen else it may be that he had made an attempt to use them  ruth got a hand free and caught at the windowframe as blake was leaping through it checked their progress but did not sensibly delay it it was unfortunately her wounded hand with which she had sought to cling and with an angry brutal wrench sir rowland compelled her to unclose her grasp he sped down the lawn towards the orchard where his horse was tethered and now she knew in a subconscious sort of way why he had earlier withdrawn he had gone to saddle for this purpose  she struggled now thinking that he would be too hampered to compel her to his will he became angry and set her down beside his horse one arm still holding her  look you mistress he told her fiercely living or dead you come with me to feversham choose now  his tone was such that she never doubted he would carry out his threat and so in dull despair she submitted hoping that feversham might be a gentleman and would recognize and respect a lady half fainting she allowed him to swing her to the withers of his horse thus they threaded their way in the dim starlit night through the trees towards the gate  it stood open and they passed out into the lane there sir rowland put his horse to the trot which he increased to a gallop when he was over the bridge and clear of the town    chapter xxi the sentence   mr wilding as we know was to remain at bridgwater for the purpose of collecting from mr newlington the fine which had been imposed upon him it is by no means clear whether monmouth realized the fullness of the tragedy at the merchants house and whether he understood that stricken with apoplexy at the thought of parting with so considerable a portion of his fortune mr newlington had not merely fainted but had expired under his graces eyes if he did realize it he was cynically indifferent and lest we should be doing him an injustice by assuming this we had better give him the benefit of the doubt and take it that in the subsequent bustle of departure his mind filled with the prospect of the night attack to be delivered upon his uncles army atsedgemoor he thought no more either of mr newlington or of mr wilding the latter as we know had no place in the rebel army although a man of his hands he was not a trained soldier and notwithstanding that he may fully have intended to draw his sword for monmouth when the time came yet circumstances had led to his continuing after monmouths landing the more diplomatic work of movementman in which he had been engaged for the months that had preceded it  so it befell that when monmouths army marched out of bridgwater at eleven oclock on that sunday night not to make for gloucester and cheshire as was generally believed but to fall upon the encamped feversham at sedgemoor and slaughter the royal army in their beds mr wilding was left behind trenchard was gone in command of his troop of horse and mr wilding had for only company his thoughts touching the singular happenings of that busy night  he went back to the sign of the ship overlooking the cross and kicking off his sodden shoes he supped quietly in the room of which shattered door and broken window reminded him of his odd interview with ruth and of the comedy of love she had enacted to detain him there the thought of it embittered him the part she had played seemed to his retrospective mind almost a wantons partfor all that in name she was his wife and yet underlying a certain irrepressible nausea came the reflection that after all her purpose had been to save his life it would have been a sweet thought sweet enough to have overlaid that other bitterness had he not insisted upon setting it down entirely to her gratitude and her sense of justice she intended to repay the debt in which she had stood to him since at the risk of his own life and fortune he had rescued her brother from the clutches of the lordlieutenant at taunton  he sighed heavily as he thought of the results that had attended his compulsory wedding of her in the intensity of his passion in the blindness of his vanity which made him confidentgloriously confidentthat did he make himself her husband she herself would make of him her lover before long he had committed an unworthiness of which it seemed he might never cleanse himself in life there was but one amend as he had told her let him make it and perhaps she wouldout of gratitude if out of no other feelingcome to think more kindly of him and that night it seemed to him as he sat alone in that mean chamber that it were a better and a sweeter thing to earn some measure of her esteem by death than to continue in a life that inspired her hatred and resentment from which it will be seen how utterly he disbelieved the protestations she had uttered in seeking to detain him they werehe was assureda part of a scheme a trick to lull him while monmouth and his officers were being butchered and she had gone the length of saying she loved him he regretted that being as he was convinced of its untruth what cause had she to love him she hated him and because she hated him she did not scruple to lie to himonce with suggestions and this time with actual expression of affectionthat she might gain her ends ends that concerned her brother and sir rowland blake sir rowland blake the name was a very goad to his passion and despair  he rose from the table and took a turn in the room moving noiselessly in his stockinged feet he felt the need of air and action the weariness of his flesh incurred in his long ride from london was cast off or forgotten he must go forth he picked up his fine shoes of spanish leather but as luck would have itlittle though he guessed the extent just thenhe found them hardening though still damp from the dews of mr newlingtons garden he cast them aside and taking a key from his pocket unlocked an oak cupboard and withdrew the heavy muddy boots in which he had ridden from town he drew them on and taking up his hat and sword went down the creaking stairs and out into the street  bridgwater had fallen quiet by now the army was gone and townsfolk were in their beds moodily unconsciously yet as if guided by a sort of instinct he went down the high street and then turned off into the narrower lane that led in the direction of lupton house by the gates of this he paused recalled out of his abstraction and rendered aware of whither his steps had led him by the sight of the hall door standing open a black figure silhouetted against the light behind it what was happening here why were they not abed like all decent folk  the figure called to him in a quavering voice mr wilding mr wilding for the light beating upon his face and figure from the open door had revealed him the form came swiftly forward its steps pattering down the walk another slenderer figure surged in its place upon the threshold hovered there an instant then plunged down into the darkness to come after it but the first was by now upon mr wilding  what is it jasper he asked recognizing the old servant  mistress ruth wailed the fellow wringing his hands she she has been carried off he got it out in gasps winded by his short run and by the excitement that possessed him  no word said wilding he just stood and stared scarcely understanding and in that moment they were joined by richard he seized wilding by the arm blake has carried her off he cried  blake said mr wilding and wondered with a sensation of nausea was it an ordinary running away but richards next words made it plain to him that it was no amorous elopement nor even amorous abduction  he has carried her to feversham for her betrayal of his tonights plan to seize the duke  that stirred mr wilding he wasted no time in idle questions or idler complainings how long since he asked and it was he who clutched richard now by the shoulder and with a hand that hurt  not ten minutes ago was the quavering answer  and you were at hand when it befell cried wilding the scorn in his voice rising superior to his agitation and fears for ruth you were at hand and could neither prevent nor follow him  ill go with you now if youll give chase whimpered richard feeling himself for once the craven that he was  if echoed wilding scornfully and dragged him past the gate and up towards the house even as he spoke is there room for a doubt of it have you horses at least  to spare said richard as they hurried on they skirted the house and found the stable door open as blake had left it old jasper followed with a lamp which burned steadily so calm was the air of that july night in three minutes they had saddled a couple of nags in five they were riding for the bridge and the road to weston zoyland  it is a miracle you remained in bridgwater said richard as they rode how came you to be left behind  i had a task assigned me in the town against the dukes return tomorrow wilding explained and he spoke almost mechanically his mind full ofanguished bythoughts of ruth  against the dukes return cried richard first surprised and then thinking that wilding spoke at random against the dukes return he repeated  that is what i said  but the duke is marching to gloucester  the duke is marching by circuitous ways to sedgemoor answered wilding never dreaming that at this time of day there could be the slightest imprudence in saying so much indeed taking little heed of what he said his mind obsessed by the other to him far weightier matter  to sedgemoor gasped westmacott  ayeto take feversham by surpriseto destroy king jamess soldiers in their beds he should be near upon the attack by now but there spur on and save your breath if we are to overtake sir rowland  they pounded on through the night at a breakneck pace which they never slackened until when within a quarter of a mile or so of penzoy pound where the army was encamped and slumbering by now they caught sight of the musketeers matches glowing in the dark ahead of them an outpost barred their progress but richard had the watchword and he spurred ahead shouting albemarle and the soldiers fell back and gave them passage on they galloped skirting penzoy pound and the army sleeping in utter unconsciousness of the fate that was creeping stealthily upon it out of the darkness and mists across the moors they clattered on past langmoor stone and dashed straight into the village richard never drawing rein until he reached the door of the cottage where feversham was lodged  they had come not only at a headlong pace but in a headlong manner without quite considering what awaited them at the end of their ride in addition to their object of finding ruth it was only now as he drew rein before the lighted house and caught the sound of blakes raised voice pouring through an open window on the ground floor that richard fully realized what manner of rashness he was committing he was too late to rescue ruth from blake what more could he look to achieve his hope had been that with wildings help he might snatch her from sir rowland before the latter reached his destination but nowto enter fevershams presence and in association with so notorious a rebel as mr wilding were a piece of folly of the heroic kind that richard did not savour indeed had it not been for wildings masterful presence it is more than odds he had turned tail and ridden home again to bed  but wilding who had leapt nimbly to the ground stood waiting for richard to dismount impatient now that from the sound of sir rowlands voice he had assurance that richard had proved an able guide the young man got down but might yet have hesitated had not wilding caught him by the arm and whirled him up the steps through the open door past the two soldiers who kept it and who were too surprised to stay him straight into the long lowceilinged chamber where feversham attended by a captain of horse was listening to blakes angry narrative of that nights failure  mr wildings entrance was decidedly sensational he stepped quickly forward and taking blake who was still talking all unconscious of those behind him by the collar of his coat he interrupted him in the middle of an impassioned period wrenched him backwards off his feet and dashed him with a force almost incredible into a heap in a corner of the room there for some moments the baronet lay half dazed by the shock of his fall  a long table which seemed to divide the chamber in two stood between lord feversham and his officer and mr wilding and ruthby whose side he had now come to stand in blakes room  there was an exclamation half anger half amazement at mr wildings outrage upon sir rowland and the captain of horse sprang forward but wilding raised his hand his face so composed and calm that it was impossible to think him conceiving any violence as indeed he protested at that moment  be assured gentlemen he said that i have no further rudeness to offer any so that this lady is suffered to withdraw with me and he took in his own a hand that ruth amazed and unresisting yielded up to him that touch of his seemed to drive out her fears and to restore her confidence the mortal terror in which she had been until his coming dropped from her now she was no longer alone and abandoned to the vindictiveness of rude and violent men she had beside her one in whom experience had taught her to have faith  louis duras marquis de blanquefort and earl of feversham coughed with mock discreetness under cover of his hand ahem  he was a comely man with a long nose good lowlidded eyes a humorous mouth and a weak chin at a glance he looked what he was a weak goodnatured sensualist he was resplendent at the moment in a blue satin dressinggown stiff with gold lace for he had been interrupted by blakes arrival in the very act of putting himself to bed and his headdivested of his wigwas bound up in a scarf of many colours  at his side the redcoated captain arrested by the generals sardonic cough stood a redfaced freckled boy looking to his superior for orders  i tink you ave urt sare rowland said feversham composedly in his bad english who are you sare  this ladys husband answered wilding whereupon the captain stared and fevershams brows went up in surprised amusement  soho tat true quoth the latter in a tone suggesting that it explained everything to him tis gif a differen colour to your story sare rowlan then he added in a chuckle ho holamour and laughed outright  blake gathering together his wits and his limbs at the same time made shift to rise  what a plague does their relationship matter he began he would have added more but the frenchman thought this question one that needed answering  parbleu he swore his amusement rising it seem to matter someting  damn me swore blake red in the face from pale that he had been do you conceive that if i had run away with his wife for her own sake i had fetched her to you he lurched forward as he spoke but kept his distance from wilding who stood between ruth and him  feversham bowed sardonically you are a such flatterer sare rowlan said he laughter bubbling in his words  blake looked his scorn of this trivial frenchman who upon scenting what appeared to be the comedy of an outraged husband overtaking the man who had carried off his wife forgot the serious business a part of which sir rowland had already imparted to him captain wentwortha timeserving gentlemansmiled with this french general of a british army that he might win the great mans favour  i have told your lordship said blake froth on his lips that the twenty men i had from you as well as ensign norris are dead in bridgwater and that my plan to carry off king monmouth has come to ruin all because we were betrayed by this woman it is now my further privilege to point out to your lordship the man to whom she sold us  feversham misliked sir rowlands arrogant tone misliked his angry scornful glance his eyes narrowed the laughter faded slowly from his face  yes yes i remember said he tis lady you have tole us betray you ver well but you have not tole us who betray you to tis lady and he looked inquiringly at blake  the baronets jaw dropped his face lost some of its high colour he was stunned by the question as the bird is stunned that flies headlong against a pane of glass he had crashed into an obstruction so transparent that he had not seen it  so said feversham and he stroked the cleft of his chin captain wentwort be so kind as to call te guard  wentworth moved to obey but before he had gone round the table blake had looked behind him and espied richard shrinking by the door  by heaven he cried i can more than answer your lordships question  wentworth stopped looking at feversham  voyons said the general  i can place you in possession of the man who has wrought our ruin he is there and he pointed theatrically to richard  feversham looked at the limp figure in some bewilderment indeed he was having a most bewildering eveningor morning rather for it was even then on the stroke of one oclock an who are you sare he asked  richard came forward nerving himself for what was to follow it had just occurred to him that he held a card which should trump any trick of sir rowlands vindictiveness and the prospect heartened and comforted him  i am this ladys brother my lord he answered and his voice was fairly steady  tiens said feversham and smiling he turned to wentworth  quite a family party sir said the captain smiling back  oh mais toutfait said the general laughing outright and then wilding created a diversion by leading ruth to a chair that stood at the far end of the table and drawing it forward for her ah yes said feversham airily let madame sit  you are very good sir said ruth her voice brave and calm  but somewhat lacking in spontaneity wilding criticized which set wentworth staring and the frenchman scowling  shall i call the guard my lord asked wentworth crisply  i tink yes said feversham and the captain gained the door and spoke a word to one of the soldiers without  but my lord exclaimed blake in a tone of protest i vow you are too ready to take this fellows word  he as spoke so few said feversham  do you know who he is  you af eard im sayte ladys usband  ayebut his name cried blake quivering with anger do you know that it is wilding  the name certainly made an impression that might have flattered the man to whom it belonged fevershams whole manner changed the trivial air of persiflage that he had adopted hitherto was gone on the instant and his brow grew dark  tat true he asked sharply are you mistaire wildinmistaire antoine wildin  your lordships most devoted servant said wilding suavely and made a leg  wentworth in the background paused in the act of reclosing the door to stare at this gentleman whose name albemarle had rendered so excellently well known  and you to dare come ere thundered feversham thoroughly roused by the others airy indifference you to dare come ereinto my ver presence  mr wilding smiled conciliatingly i came for my wife my lord he reminded him it grieves me to intrude upon your lordship at so late an hour and indeed it was far from my intent i had hoped to overtake sir rowland before he reached you  nom de dieu swore feversham ho a so great effrontery he swung round upon blake again sare rowlan he bade him angrily be so kind to tell me what appen in breechwatereveryting  blake his face purple seemed to struggle for breath and words mr wilding answered for him  sir rowland is so choleric my lord he said in his pleasant level voice that perhaps the tale would come more intelligibly from me believe me that he has served you to the best of his ability unfortunately for the success of your choice plan of murder i had news of it at the eleventh hour and with a party of musketeers i was able to surprise and destroy your cutthroats in mr newlingtons garden you see my lord i was to have been one of the victims myself and i resented the attentions that were intended me i had no knowledge that sir rowland had contrived to escape and frankly it is a thing i deplore more than i can say for had that not happened much trouble might have been saved and your lordships rest had not been disturbed  but te woman cried feversham impatiently how is she come into this galare  it was she who warned him blake got out as already i have had the honour to inform your lordship  and your lordship cannot blame her for that said wilding the lady is a most loyal subject of king james but she is also as you observe a dutiful wife i will add that it was her intention to warn me only when too late for interference sir rowland as it happened was slow in  silence blazed the frenchman now tat i know who you are tat make a so great difference where is te guard wentwort  i hear them answered the captain and from the street came the tramp of their marching feet  feversham turned again to blake te affaire as appen so he said between question and assertion summing up the situation as he understood it tis rogue and he pointed to richard ave betray your plan to is sister who betray it to er usband who save te duc de monmoot nestce pas  that is so said blake and ruth scarcely thought it worth while to add that she had heard of the plot not only from her brother but from blake as well after all blakes attitude in the matter his action in bringing her to feversham for punishment and to exculpate himself must suffice to cause any such statement of hers to be lightly received by the general  she sat in an anguished silence her eyes wide her face pale and waited for the end of this strange business in her heart she did permit herself to think that it would be difficult to assemble a group of men less worthy of respect choleric and vindictive blake foolish feversham stupid wentworth and timid richardeven richard did not escape the unfavourable criticism they were undergoing in her subconscious mind only wilding detached in that assemblyas he had detached in another that she rememberedand stood out in sharp relief a very man calm intrepid selfpossessed and if she was afraid she was more afraid for him than for herself this was something that perhaps she scarcely realized just then but she was to realize it soon  feversham was speaking again asking blake a fresh question and who betray you to tis rogue  to westmacott cried blake he was in the plot with me he was left to guard the rear to see that we were not taken by surprise and he deserted his post had he not done that there had been no disaster in spite of mr wildings intervention  fevershams brow was dark his eyes glittered as they rested on the traitor  tat true sare he asked him  not quite put in mr wilding mr westmacott i think was constrained away he did not intend  taistoi blazed feversham did i interrogate you it is for mistaire westercott to answer he set a hand on the table and leaned forward towards wilding his face very malign you shall to answer for yourself mistaire wildin i promise you you shall to answer for yourself he turned again to richard ek bien he snapped will you speak  richard came forward a step he was certainly nervous and certainly pale but neither as pale nor as nervous as from our knowledge of richard we might have looked to see him at that moment  it is in a measure true he said but what mr wilding has said is more exact i was induced away i did not dream any could know of the plan or that my absence could cause this catastrophe  so you went eh vaurien you tought tat be to do your duty eh and it was you who tole your sistaire  i may have told her but not before she had the tale already from blake  feversham sneered and shrugged natural you will not speak true a traitor i ave observe is always liar   richard drew himself up he seemed invested almost with a new dignity your lordship is pleased to account me a traitor he inquired  a dam traitor said his lordship and at that moment the door opened and a sergeant with six men following him stood at the salute upon the threshold a la bonne heure his lordship hailed them sergean you will arrest tis rogue and tis ladyhe waved his hand from richard to ruthand you will take tem to lockup  the sergeant advanced towards richard who drew a step away from him ruth rose to her feet in agitation mr wilding interposed himself between her and the guard his hand upon his sword  my lord he cried do they teach no better courtesy in france  feversham scowled at him smiling darkly i shall talk wit you soon sare said he his words a threat  but my lord began richard i can make it very plain i am no traitor  in te mornin said feversham blandly waving his hand and the sergeant took richard by the shoulder  but richard twisted from his grasp in the morning will be too late he cried i have it in my power to render you such a service as you little dream of  take im away said feversham wearily  i can save you from destruction bawled richard you and your army  perhaps even now feversham had not heeded him but for wildings sudden interference  silence richard he cried to him would you betray he checked on the word more he dared not say but he hoped faintly that he had said enough  feversham however chanced to observe that this man who had shown himself hitherto so calm looked suddenly most singularly perturbed  eh quoth the general an instan sergean what is tis ehand he looked from wilding to richard  your lordship shall learn at a price cried richard  me i not bargain wit traitors said his lordship stiffly  very well then answered richard and he folded his arms dramatically but no matter what your lordships life may be hereafter you will never regret anything more bitterly than you shall regret this by sunrise if indeed you live to see it  feversham shifted uneasily on his feet what you say he asked what you mean  you shall know at a price said richard again  wilding realizing the hopelessness of interfering now stood gloomily apart a great bitterness in his soul at the indiscretion he had committed in telling richard of the night attack that was afoot  your lordship shall hear my price but you need not pay it me until you have had an opportunity of verifying the information i have to give you  tell me said feversham after a brief pause during which he scrutinized the young mans face  if your lordship will promise liberty and safeconduct to my sister and myself  tell me feversham repeated  when you have promised to grant me what i ask in return for my information  yes if i tink your information is wort  i am content said richard he inclined his head and loosed the quarrel of his news your camp is slumbering your officers are all abed with the exception of the outpost on the road to bridgwater what should you say if i told you that monmouth and all his army are marching upon you at this very moment will probably fall upon you before another hour is past  wilding uttered a groan and his hands fell to his sides had feversham observed this he might have been less ready with his sneering answer  a lie he answered and laughed my fren i ave myself been tonight at midnight on te moore and i ave eard te army of te duc de monmoot marching to bristol on te roadwhat you call te road wentwort  the eastern causeway my lord answered the captain  voil said feversham and spread his hands what you say now eh  that that is part of monmouths plan to come at you across the moors by way of chedzoy avoiding your only outpost and falling upon you in your beds all unawares lord sir do not take my word for it send out your scouts and i dare swear theyll not need go far before they come upon the enemy  feversham looked at wentworth his lordships face had undergone a change  what you tink he asked  indeed my lord it sounds so likely answered wentworth that that i marvel we did not provide against such a contingency  but i ave provide cried this nephew of the great turenne ogeltorpe is on te moor and sare francis compton if tis is true ow can tey ave miss monmoot send word to milor churchill at once wentwort let te matter be investigateat once wentwortat once the general was dancing with excitement wentworth saluted and turned to leave the room if you ave tole me true continued feversham turning now to richard you shall ave te price you ask and te tanks of te kings army but if not  oh its true enough broke in wilding and his voice was like a groan his face overcharged with gloom  feversham looked at him his sneering smile returned  me i not remember said he that mr westercott ave include you in te bargain  nothing had been further from wildings thoughts than such a suggestion and he snorted his disdain the sergeant had fallen back at fevershams words and his men lined the wall of the chamber the general bade richard be seated whilst he waited sir rowland stood apart leaning wearily against the wainscot waiting also his dull wits not quite clear how richard might have come by so valuable a piece of information his evil spirit almost wishing it untrue in his vindictiveness to the end that richard might pay the price of having played him false and ruth the price of having scorned him  feversham meanwhile was seekingwith no great successto engage mr wilding in talk of monmouth against whom feversham harboured in addition to his political enmity a very deadly personal hatred for feversham had been a suitor to the hand of the lady henrietta wentworth the woman for whom monmouthworthy son of his fatherhad practically abandoned his own wife the woman with whom he had run off to the great scandal of court and nation  despairing of drawing any useful information from wilding his lordship was on the point of turning to blake when quick steps and the rattle of a scabbard sounded without the door was thrust open without ceremony and captain wentworth reappeared  my lord he cried his manner excited beyond aught one could have believed possible in so phlegmaticseeming a person it is true we are beset  beset echoed feversham beset already  we can hear them moving on the moor they are crossing the langmoor rhine they will be upon us in ten minutes at the most i have roused colonel douglas and dunbartons regiment is ready for them  feversham exploded what else ave you done he asked where is milor churchill  lord churchill is mustering his men as quietly as may be that they may be ready to surprise those who come to surprise us by heaven sir we owe a great debt to mr westmacott without his information we might have had all our throats cut whilst we slept  be so kind to call belmont said feversham tell him to bring my clotes  wentworth turned and went out again to execute the generals orders feversham spoke to richard we are oblige mr westercott said he we are ver much oblige  suddenly from a little distance came the roll of drums other sounds began to stir in the night outside to tell of a waking army  feversham stood listening it is dunbartons he murmured then with some show of heat ah pardieu he cried but it was a dirty ting tis monmoot ave prepare it is murder it is not te war  and yet said wilding critically it is a little more like war than the bridgwater affair to which your lordship gave your sanction  feversham pursed his lips and considered the speaker wentworth reentered followed by the earls valet carrying an armful of garments his lordship threw off his dressinggown and stood forth in shirt and breeches  mais dpchetoi donc belmont said he nous nous battons ii faut que je mhabille belmont a little wizened fellow who understood nothing of this topsyturveydom hastened forward deposited his armful on the table and selected a finely embroidered waistcoat which he proceeded to hold for his master wriggling into it feversham rapped out his orders       captain wentwort you will go to your regimen at once  but first ahwait take tose six men and mistaire wilding ave im shot at once you onderstan eh good allons belmont my cravat    chapter xxii the execution   captain wentworth clicked his heels together and saluted blake in the background drew a deep breathunmistakably of satisfaction and his eyes glittered a muffled cry broke from ruth who rose instantly from her chair her hand on her bosom richard stood with fallen jaw amazed a trifle troubled even whilst mr wilding started more in surprise than actual fear and approached the table  you heard sir said captain wentworth  i heard answered mr wilding quietly but surely not aright one moment sir and he waved his hand so compellingly that despite the order he had received the phlegmatic captain hesitated  feversham who had taken the cravata yard of priceless dutch lacefrom the hands of his valet and was standing with his back to the company at a small and very faulty mirror that hung by the overmantel looked peevishly over his shoulder  my lord said wilding and blake for all his hatred of this man marvelled at a composure that did not forsake him even now you are surely not proposing to deal with me in this fashionnot seriously my lord  ah ca said the frenchman tink it a jest if you please what for you come ere  assuredly not for the purpose of being shot said wilding and actually smiled then in the tones of one discussing a matter that is grave but not of surpassing gravity he continued it is not that i fail to recognize that i may seem to have incurred the rigour of the law but these matters must be formally proved against me i have affairs to set in order against such a consummation  ta ta snapped feversham tat not regard me weutwort you ave eard my order and he returned to his mirror and the nice adjustment of his neckwear  but my lord insisted wilding you have not the rightyou have not the power so to proceed against me a man of my quality is not to be shot without a trial  you can ang if you prefer said feversham indifferently drawing out the ends of his cravat and smoothing them down upon his breast he faced about briskly give me tat coat belmont his majesty ave empower me to ang or shoot any gentlemens of te partie of te duc te monmoot on te spot i say tat for your satisfaction and look i am desolate to be so quick wit you but please to consider te circumstance te enemy go to attack wentwort must go to his regimen and my oter officers are all occupi you comprehen i ave not te time to spare younestcepaswentworths hand touched wilding on the shoulder he was standing with head slightly bowed his brows knit in thought he looked round at the touch sighed and smiled  belmont held the coat for his master who slipped into it and flung at wilding what was intended for a consolatory sop it is fortune de guerre mistaire wilding i am desolate but it is fortune of te war  may it be less fortunate for your lordship then said wilding dryly and was on the point of turning when ruths voice came in a loud cry to startle him and to quicken his pulses  my lord it was a cry of utter anguish  feversham settling his goldlaced coat comfortably to his figure looked at her madame said he  but she had nothing to say she stood deathly white slightly bent forward one hand wringing the other her eyes almost wild her bosom heaving frantically  hum said feversham and he loosened and removed the scarf from his head he shrugged slightly and looked at wentworth finissons said he  the word and the look snapped the trammels that bound ruths speech  five minutes my lord she cried imploringly give him five minutesand me my lord  wilding deeply shaken trembled now as he awaited fevershams reply  the frenchman seemed to waver bien he began spreading his hands and in that moment a shot rang out in the night and startled the whole company feversham threw back his head the signs of yielding left his face ha he cried tey are arrive he snatched his wig from his lacqueys hands donned it and turned again an instant to the mirror to adjust the great curls quick wentwort tere is no more time now make mistaire wilding be shot at once ten to your regimen he faced about and took the sword his valet proffered au revoir messieurs  serviteur madame and buckling his swordbelt as he went he swept out leaving the door wide open belmont following wentworth saluting and the guards presenting arms  come sir said the captain in a subdued voice his eyes avoiding ruths face  i am ready answered wilding firmly and he turned to glance at his wife  she was bending towards him her hands held out such a look on her face as almost drove him mad with despair reading it as he did he made a sound deep in his throat before he found words  give me one minute sirone minute he begged wentworth i ask no more than that  wentworth was a gentleman and not illnatured but he was a soldier and had received his orders he hesitated between the instincts of the two conditions and what time he did so there came a clatter of hoofs without to resolve him it was feversham departing  you shall have your minute sir said he more i dare not give you as you can see  from my heart i thank you answered mr wilding and from the gratitude of his tone you might have inferred that it was his life wentworth had accorded him  the captain had already turned aside to address his men two of you outside guard that window he ordered the rest of you in the passage bestir there  take your precautions by all means sir said wilding but i give you my word of honour i shall attempt no escape  wentworth nodded without replying his eye lighted on blakewho had been seemingly forgotten in the confusionand on richard a kindliness for the man who met his end so unflinchingly a respect for so worthy an emeny actuated the redfaced captain  you had better take yourself off sir rowland said he and you mr westmacottyou can wait in the passage with my men  they obeyed him promptly enough but when outside sir rowland made bold to remind the captain that he was failing in his duty and that he should make a point of informing the general of this anon wentworth bade him go to the devil and so was rid of him  alone inside that lowceilinged chamber stood ruth and wilding face to face he advanced towards her and with a shuddering sob she flung herself into his arms still he mistrusted the emotion to which she was a preydreading lest it should have its root in pity he patted her shoulder soothingly  nay nay little child he whispered in her ear never weep for me that have not a tear for myself what better resolution of the difficulties my folly has created for only answer she clung closer her hands locked about his neck her slender body shaken by her silent weeping dont pity me he besought her i am content it should be so it is the amend i promised you waste no pity on me ruth  she raised her face her eyes wild and blurred with tears looked up to his  it is not pity she cried i want you anthony i love you anthony anthony  his face grew ashen it is true then he asked her and what you said tonight was true i thought you said it only to detain me  oh it is true it is true she wailed  he sighed he disengaged a hand to stroke her face i am happy he said and strove to smile had i lived who knows  no no no she interrupted him passionately her arms tightening about his neck he bent his head their lips met and clung a knock fell upon the door they started and wilding raised his hands gently to disengage her pinioning arms  i must go sweet he said  god help me she moaned and clung to him still it is i who am killing youi and your love for me for it was to save me you rode hither tonight never pausing to weigh your own deadly danger oh i am punished for having listened to every voice but the voice of my own heart where you were concerned had i loved you earlierhad i owned it earlier  it had still been too late he said more to comfort her than because he knew it to be so be brave for my sake ruth you can be brave i knowso well listen sweet your words have made me happy mar not this happiness of mine by sending me out in grief at your grief  her response to his prayer was brave indeed through her tears came a faint smile to overspread her face so white and pitiful  we shall meet soon again she said  ayethink on that he bade her and pressed her to him goodbye sweet god keep you till we meet he added his voice infinitely tender  mr wilding wentworths voice called him and the captain thrust the door open a foot or so mr wilding  i am coming he answered steadily he kissed her again and on that kiss of his she sank against him and he felt her turn all limp he raised his voice richard he shouted wildly richard  at the note of alarm in his voice wentworth flung wide the door and entered richards ashen face showing over his shoulder in her brothers care wilding delivered his mercifully unconscious wife see to her dick he said and turned to go mistrusting himself now but he paused as he reached the door wentworth waxing more and more impatient at his elbow he turned again  dick he said we might have been better friends i would we had been let us part so at least and he held out his hand smiling  before so much gallantry richard was conquered almost to the point of worship a weak man himself there was no virtue he could more admire than strength he left ruth in the highbacked chair in which wildings tender hands had placed her and sprang forward tears in his eyes he wrung wildings hands in wordless passion  be good to her dick said wilding and went out with wentworth  he was marched down the street in the centre of that small party of musketeers of dunbartons regiment his thoughts all behind him rather than ahead a smile on his lips he had conquered at the last he thought of that other parting of theirs nearly a month ago on the road by walford now as then circumstance was the fire that had melted her but the crucible was no longeras then of pity it was the crucible of love  and in that same crucible too anthony wildings nature had undergone a transmutation his love for ruth had been purified of that base alloy of desire which had driven him into the unworthiness of making her his own at all costs there was no carnal grossness in his present passion it was pure as a religionthe love that takes no account of self the love that makes for joyous and grateful martyrdom and a joyous and grateful martyr would anthony wilding have been could he have thought that his death would bring her happiness or peace in such a faith as that he had marchedor so he thought blithely to his end and the smile on his lips had been less wistful than it was thinking of the agony in which he had left her he almost came to wishso pure was his love grownthat he had not conquered the joy that at first was his was now all dashed his death would cause her pain his death o god it is an easy thing to be a martyr but this was not martyrdom having done what he had done he had not the right to die the last vestige of the smile that he had worn faded from his tightpressed lips tightpressed as though to endure some physical suffering his face greyed and deep lines furrowed his brow thus he marched on mechanically amid his marching escort through the murky fogladen night taking no heed of the stir about them for all weston zoyland was aroused by now  ahead of them and over to the east the firing blazed and crackled volley upon volley to tell them that already battle had been joined in earnest monmouths surprise had aborted and it passed through wildings mind that to a great extent he was to blame for this but it gave him little care  at least his indiscretion had served the purpose of rescuing ruth from lord fevershams unclean clutches for the rest knowing that monmouths army by far outnumbered fevershams he had no doubt that the advantage must still lie with the duke in spite of fevershams having been warned in the eleventh hour  louder grew the sounds of battle above the din of firing a swelling chorus rose upon the night startling and weird in such a time and place monmouths pious infantry went into action singing hymns and wentworth impatient to be at his post bade his men go faster  the night was by now growing faintly luminous and the deathly grey light of approaching dawn hung in the mists upon the moor objects grew visible in bulk at least if not in form and shape by the time the little company had reached the end of weston village and come upon the deep mud dyke which had been wentworths objectivea ditch that communicated with the great rhine that served the kings forces so well on that night of sedgemoor  within some twenty paces of this wentworth called a halt and would have had wildings hands pinioned behind him and his eyes blindfolded but that wilding begged him this might not be done wentworth was as we know impatient and between impatience and kindliness perhaps he acceded to wildings prayer  he even hesitated a moment at the last it was in his mind to speak some word of comfort to the doomed man then a sudden volley more terrific than any that had preceded it followed by hoarse cheering away to eastward quickened his impatience he bade the sergeant lead mr wilding forward and stand him on the edge of the ditch his object was that thus the mans body would be disposed of without waste of time this wilding realized his soul rebelling against this fate which had come upon him in the very hour when he most desired to live mad thoughts of escape crossed his mindof a leap across the dyke and a wild dash through the fog but the futility of it was too appalling the musketeers were already blowing their matches he would suffer the ignominy of being shot in the back like a coward if he made any such attempt  and so despairing but not resigned he took his stand on the very edge of the ditch in an irony of obligingness he set half of his heels over the void so that he was nicely balanced upon the edge of the cutting and must go backwards and down into the mud when hit  it was this position he had taken that gave him an inspiration in that last moment the sergeant had moved away out of the line of fire and he stood there alone waiting erect and with his head held high his eyes upon the grey mass of musketeersblurred alike by mist and semidarknesssome twenty paces distant along the line of which glowed eight red fuses  wentworths voice rang out with the words of command  blow your matches  brighter gleamed the points of light and under their steel pots the faces of the musketeers suffused by a dull red glow sprang for a moment out of the grey mass to fade once more into the general greyness at the word cock your matches  guard your pans came a second later the captains voice and then  present  there was a stir and rattle and the dark indistinct figure standing on the lip of the ditch was covered by the eight muskets to the eyes of the firingparty he was no more than a blurred shadowy form showing a little darker than the encompassing dark grey  give fire  on the word mr wilding lost the delicate precarious balance he had been sustaining on the edge of the ditch and went over backwards at the imminent riskas he afterwards relatedof breaking his neck at the same instant a jagged eightpointed line of flame slashed the darkness and the thunder of the volley pealed forth to lose itself in the greater din of battle on penzoy pound hard by    chapter xxiii mr wildings boots   in the filth of the ditch mr wilding rolled over and lay prone he threw out his left arm and rested his brow upon it to keep his face above the mud he strove to hold his breath not that he might dissemble death but that he might avoid being poisoned by the foul gases that disturbed by his weight bubbled up to choke him his body half sank and settled in the mud and seen from above as he was presently seen by wentworthwho ran forward with the sergeants lanthorn to assure himself that the work had been well donehe had all the air of being not only dead but already half buried  and now for a second mr wilding was in his greatest danger and this from the very humaneness of the sergeant the fellow advanced to the captains side a pistol in his hand wentworth held the light aloft and peered down into that six feet of blackness at the jacent figure  shall i give him an ounce of lead to make sure captain quoth the sergeant but wentworth in his great haste had already turned about and the light of his lanthorn no longer revealed the form of mr wilding  there is not the need the ditch will do what may remain to be done if anything does come on man we are wanted yonder  the light passed steps retreated the sergeant muttering and then wentworths voice was heard by wilding some little distance off  bring up your muskets  shoulder  by the rightturn march and the tramp tramp of feet receded rapidly  wilding was already sitting up endeavouring to get a breath of purer air he rose to his feet sinking almost to the top of his boots in the oozy slime foul gases were belched up to envelop him he seized at irregularities in the bank and got his head above the level of the ground he thrust forward his chin and took great greedy breaths in a very gluttony of airand never came muscadine sweeter to a drunkards lips he laughed softly to himself he was alone and safe wentworth and his men had disappeared away in the direction of penzoy pound the sounds of battle swelled ever to a greater volume cannons were booming now and all was uproarflame and shouting cheering and shrieking the thunder of hastening multitudes the clash of steel the pounding of horses all blent to make up the horrid din of carnage  mr wilding listened and considered what to do his first impulse was to join the fray but bethinking him that there could be little place for him in the confusion that must prevail by now he reconsidered the matter and his thoughts returning to ruththe wife for whom he had been at such pains to preserve himself on the very brink of deathhe resolved to endanger himself no further for that night  he dropped back into the ditch and waded ankle deep in slime to the other side there he crawled out and gaining the moor lay down awhile to breathe his lungs but not for long the dawn was creeping pale and ghostly across the solid earth and a faint fresh breeze was stirring and driving the mist in wispy shrouds before it if he lingered there he might yet be found by some party of royalist soldiers and that would be to undo all that he had done he rose and struck out across the peaty ground none knew the moors better than did he and had he been with greys horse that night it is possible things had fared differently for he had proved a surer guide than did godfrey the spy  at first he thought of making for bridgwater and lupton house by now richard would be on his way thither with ruth and wilding was in haste that she should be reassured that he had not fallen to the muskets of wentworths firingparty but bridgwater was far and he began to realize now that all excitement was past that he was utterly exhausted next he thought of scoresby hall and his cousin lord gervase but he was by no means sure that he might count upon a welcome gervase had shown no sympathy for monmouth or his partisans and whilst he would hardly go so far as to refuse mr wilding shelter still wilding felt an aversion to seeking what might be grudged him at last he bethought him of home zoyland chase was near at hand but he had not been there since his weddingday and in the mean time he knew that it had been used as a barrack for the militia and had no doubt that it had been wrecked and plundered still it must have walls and a roof and that for the time was all he craved that he might rest awhile and recuperate his wasted forces  a halfhour later he dragged himself wearily up the avenue between the elmslooking white as snow in the pale july dawnto the clearing in front of his house  desertion was stamped upon the face of it shattered windows and hanging shutters everywhere how wantonly they had wrecked it it might have been a church and the militia a regiment of cromwells iconoclastic puritans the door was locked but going round he found a windowone of the doorwindows of his library hanging loose upon its hinges he pushed it wide and entered with a heavy heart instantly something stirred in a corner a fierce growl was followed by a furious bark and a lithe brown body leapt from the greater into the lesser shadows to attack the intruder but at one word of his the hound checked suddenly crouched an instant then with a queer throaty sound bounded forward in a wild delight that robbed it on the instant of its voice it found it anon and leapt about him barking furious joy in spite of all his vain endeavours to calm it he grew afraid lest the dog should draw attention he knew not whoif anymight be in possession of his house the library as he looked round showed a scene of wreckage that excellently matched the exterior not a picture on the walls not an arras but had been rent to shreds the great lustre that had hung from the centre of the ceiling was gone disorder reigned along the bookshelves and yet there and elsewhere there was a certain orderliness suggesting an attempt to straighten up the place after the ravagers had departed it was these signs made him afraid the house might be tenanted by such as might prove his enemies  down jack he said to the dog for the twentieth time patting its sleek head down down  but still the dog bounded about him barking wildly  sh he hissed suddenly steps sounded in the hall it was as he feared the door was suddenly thrown open and the grey morning light gleamed upon the long barrel of a musket after it bearing it entered a whitehaired old man  he paused on the threshold measuring the tall disordered stranger who stood there his figure a black silhouette against the window by which he had entered  what seek you here sir in this house of desolation asked the voice of mr wildings old servant  he answered but one word walters  the musket dropped with a clatter from the old mans hands he sank back against the doorpost and leaned there an instant then whimpering and laughing he came tottering forwardhis old legs failing him in this excess of unexpected joyand sank on his knees to kiss his masters hand  wilding patted the old head as he had patted the dogs a little while ago he was oddly moved there was a knot in his throat no homecoming could well have been more desolate and yet what homecoming could have brought him such a torturing joy as was now his oh it is good to be loved if it be by no more than a dog and an old servant  in a moment walters was himself again he was on his feet scrutinizing wildings haggard face and disordered filthy clothes he broke into exclamations between dismay and reproach but these wilding interrupted to ask the old man how it happened that he had remained  my son john was a sergeant in the troop that quartered itself here sir walters explained and so they left me alone but even had it not been for that i scarcely think they would have harmed an old man they were brave fellows for all the mischief they did here and they seemed to have little heart in the service of the popish king it was the officers drove them on to all this damage and once theyd startedwell there were rogues amongst them saw a chance of plunder and they took it i have sought to put the place to rights but they did some woeful wanton mischief  wilding sighed its little matter perhaps as the place is no longer mine  no no longer yours sir  im an attainted outlaw walters he explained theyll bestow it on some popish timeserver unless king monmouth can follow up by greater victories tonights have you aught a man may eat or drink  meat and wine fresh linen and fresh garments did old walters find him and when he had washed eaten and drunk mr wilding wrapped himself in a dressinggown and laid himself down to sleep on a settle in the library his servant and his dog on guard  not above an hour however was he destined to enjoy his hardearned rest the light had grown meanwhile and from grey it had turned golden the heralds of the sun being already in the east in the distance the firing had died down to a mere occasional boom  suddenly old walters raised his head to listen the beat of hoofs was drawing rapidly near so near that presently he rose in alarm for a horseman was pounding up the avenue had drawn rein at the main entrance  walters knit his brows in perplexity and glanced at his master who slept on utterly worn out a silent pause followed lasting some minutes then it was the dog that rose with a growl his coat bristling and an instant later there came a sharp rapping at the hall door  sh down jack whispered walters afraid of rousing mr wilding he tiptoed softly across the room picked up his musket and calling the dog went out a great fear in his heart but not for himself  the rapping continued growing every instant more urgent so urgent that walters was almost reassured here was no enemy but surely some one in need walters opened at last and mr trenchard grimy of face and hands his hat shorn of its plumes his clothes torn staggered with an oath across the threshold  walters he cried thank god i thought youd be here but i wasnt certain down jack  the hound was barking madly again having recognized an old friend  plague on the dog growled walters hell wake mr wilding  mr wilding said trenchard and checked midway across the hall mr wilding  he arrived here a couple of hours ago sir  wilding here oddsheart i was more than well advised to come where is he man  sh sir hes asleep in the library youll wake him youll wake him  but trenchard never paused he crossed the hall at a bound and flung wide the library door anthony he shouted anthony and in the background walters cursed him for a fool wilding leapt to his feet awake and startled  wha nick  oons roared nick youre choicely found i came to send to bridgwater for you we must away at once man  howaway i thought you were in the fight nick  and dont i look as if i had been  but then  the fight is fought and lost theres an end to the garboil monmouth is in full flight with whats left him of his horse when i quitted the field he was riding hard for polden hill he dropped into a chair his accents grim and despairing his eyes haggard  lost gasped wilding and his conscience pricked him for a moment remembering how much it had been his faulthowever indirectlythat feversham had been forewarned but how lost he cried a moment later  ask grey snapped trenchard ask his craven numskulled lordship he had as good a hand in losing it as any oh it was all most infernally mishandled as has been everything in this illstarred rising grey sent back godfrey the guide and attempted in the dark to find his own way across the rhine he missed the ford what else could the fool have hoped and when he was discovered and dunbartons guns began to play on ushell and fire we ran as if sedgemoor had been a racecourse  the rest was but the natural sequel the foot seeing our confusion broke they were rallied again broke again and again were rallied but all too late the enemy was up and with that damned ditch between us there was no getting to close quarters with them had grey ridden round and sought to turn their flank things might have beeno godthey would have been entirely different i did suggest it but for my pains grey threatened to pistol me if i presumed to instruct him in his duty i would to heaven i had pistolled him where he stood  walters at gaze in the doorway listened to the bitter tirade wilding on the settle sat silent a moment his elbows on his knees his chin in his hands his eyes set and grim as trenchards own then he mastered himself and waved a hand towards the table where stood food and wine  eat and drink nick he said and well discuss whats to be done  itll need little discussing was nicks savage answer as he rose and went to pour himself a cup of wine theres but one course open to us instant flight i am for minehead to join hewlings horse which went there yesterday for guns we might seize a ship somewhere on the coast and thus get out of this infernal country of mine  they discussed the matter in spite of trenchards having said that there was nothing to discuss and in the end wilding agreed to go with him what choice had he but first he must go to bridgwater to reassure his wife  to bridgwater blazed trenchard in a passion at the folly of the suggestion youre clearly mad all the kings forces will be there in an hour or two  no matter said wilding i must go i am dead already as it happens and he related his singular adventure in fevershams camp last night  trenchard heard him in amazement if any suspicion crossed his mind that his friends love affairs had had anything to do with rousing feversham prematurely he showed no sign of it but he shook his head at wildings insistence that he must first go to lupton house  shalt send a message anthony walters will find some one to bear it but you must not go yourself  in the end mr trenchard prevailed upon him to adopt this course however reluctant he might be thereafter they proceeded to make their preparations there were still a couple of nags in the stables in spite of the visitation of the militia and walters was able to find fresh clothes for mr trenchard abovestairs  a halfhour later they were ready to set out on this forlorn hope of escape the horses were at the door and mr wilding was in the act of drawing on the fresh pair of boots which walters had fetched him suddenly he paused his foot in the leg of his right boot and sat bemused a moment   trenchard watching him waxed impatient what ails you now he croaked  without answering him wilding turned to walters where are the boots i wore last night he asked and his voice was sharpoddly sharp considering how trivial the matter of his speech  in the kitchen answered walters  fetch me them and he kicked off again the boot he had half drawn on  but they are all befouled with mud sir  clean them walters clean them and let me have them  still walters hesitated pointing out that the boots he had brought his master were newer and sounder wilding interrupted him impatiently do as i bid you walters and the old man understanding nothing went off on the errand  a pox on your boots swore trenchard what does this mean  wilding seemed suddenly to have undergone a transformation his gloom had fallen from him he looked up at his old friend and smiling answered him it means nick that whilst these excellent boots that walters would have me wear might be well enough for a ride to the coast such as you propose they are not at all suited to the journey i intend to make  maybe said nick with a sniff youre intending to journey to tower hill  in that direction answered mr wilding suavely  i am for london nick and you shall come with me  god save us do you keep a fools egg under that nest of hair  wilding explained and by the time walters returned with the boots trenchard was walking up and down the room in an odd agitation odds my life tony he cried at last i believe it is the best thing  the only thing nick  and since all is lost why trenchard blew out his cheeks and smacked fist into palm i am with you said he    chapter xxiv justice   it has fallen to my lot in the course of this veridical chronicle of mr anthony wildings connection with the rebellion in the west and of his wedding and postnuptial winning of ruth westmacott to relate certain matters of incident and personality that may be accounted strange but the strangest yet remains to be related for in spite of all that had passed between sir rowland blake and the westmacotts on that memorable night of sunday to monday on which the battle of sedgemoor was lost and won towards the end of that same month of july we find him not only back at lupton house but once again the avowed suitor of mr wildings widow for effrontery this is a matter of which it is to be doubted whether history furnishes a parallel indeed until the circumstances are sifted it seems wild and incredible so let us consider these  on the morrow of sedgemoor the town of bridgwater became investedinfested were no whit too strong a wordby the kings forces under feversham and the odious kirke and there began a reign of terror for the town the prisons were choked with attainted and suspected rebels from bridgwater to weston zoyland the road was become an avenue of gallows each bearing its repulsive gemmaceladen burden for the kings commands were unequivocal and hanging was the order of the day  it is not my desire at this stage to surfeit you with the horrors that were perpetrated during that hideous week of july when no mans life was safe from the royal butchers the awful campaign of jeifreys and his four associates was yet to follow but it is doubtful if it could compare in ruthlessness with that of feversham and kirke at least when jeifreys came men were given a trialor what looked like itand there remained them a chance however slender of acquittal as many lived to prove thereafter with feversham there was no such chance and it was of this circumstance that sir rowland blake took the fullest and the cowardliest advantage  there can be no doubt that sir rowland was a villain it might be urged for him that he was a creature of circumstance and that had circumstances been other it is possible he had been a credit to his name but he was weak in character and out of that weakness he had developed a herculean strength in villainy failure had dogged him in everything he undertook broken at the gamingtables hounded out of town by creditors he was in desperate straits to repair his fortunes and as we have seen he was not nice in his endeavours to achieve that end  ruth westmacotts fair inheritance had seemed an easy thing to conquer and to its conquest he had applied himself to suffer defeat as he had suffered it in all things else but sir rowland did not yet acknowledge himself beaten and the bridgwater reign of terror dealt him a fresh handa hand of trumps with this he came boldly to renew the game  he was as smooth as oil at first a very penitent confessing himself mad in what he had done on that sunday nightmad with despair and rage at having been defeated in the noble task to which he had turned his hands his penitence might have had little effect upon the westmacotts had he not known how to insinuate that it might be best for them to lend an ear to itand a forgiving one  you will tell mr westmacott jasper he had said when jasper told him that they could not receive him that he would be unwise not to see me and the same to mistress wilding  and old jasper had carried his message and had told richard of the wicked smile that had been on sir rowlands lips when he had uttered it  now richard was in many ways a changed man since that night at weston zoyland a transformation seemed to have been wrought in him as odd as it was sudden and it dated from the moment when with tears in his eyes he had wrung wildings hand in farewell where precept had failed richard found himself converted by example he contrasted himself in that stressful hour with greatsouled anthony wilding and saw himself as he was a weakling strong only in vicious ways repentance claimed him repentance and a fine ambition to be worthier to resemble as nearly as his nature would allow him this anthony wilding whom he took for pattern he changed his ways abandoned drink and gaming and gained thereby a healthier countenance then in his zeal he overshot his mark he developed a taste for scripturereading bethought him of prayers and even took to saying grace to his meat indeedfor conversion when it comes is a furious thingthe swing of his souls pendulum threatened now to carry him to extremes of virtue and piety o lord he would cry a score of times a day thou hast brought up my soul from the grave thou hast kept me alive that i should not go down to the pit  but underlying all this remained unfortunately the inherent weakness of his natureindeed it was that very weakness and malleability made this sudden and wholesale conversion possible  upon hearing sir rowlands message his heart fainted despite his good intentions and he urged that perhaps they had better hear what the baronet might have to say  it was three days after sedgemoor fight and poor ruth was worn and exhausted with her griefbelieving wilding dead for he had sent no message to inform her of his almost miraculous preservation the thing he went to do in london was fraught with such peril that he foresaw but the slenderest chance of escaping with his life therefore he had argued why console her now with news that he lived when in a few days the headsman might prove that his end had been but postponed to do so might be to give her cause to mourn him twice again he was haunted by the thought that in spite of all it may have been pity that had so grievously moved her at their last meeting better then to wait better for both their sakes if he came safely through his ordeal it would be time enough to bear her news of his preservation  in deepest mourning very white with dark stains beneath her eyes to tell the tale of anguished vigils she received sir rowland in the withdrawingroom her brother at her side to his expressions of deep penitence he found them cold so he passed on to show them what disastrous results might ensue upon a stubborn maintaining of this attitude of theirs towards him  i have come he said his eyes downcast his face longdrawn for he could play the sorrowful with any hypocrite in england to do something more than speak of my grief and regret i have come to offer proof of it by service  we ask no service of you sir said ruth her voice a sword of sharpness  he sighed and turned to richard this were folly he assured his whilom friend you know the influence i wield  do i quoth richard his tone implying doubt you think that the bungled matter at newlingtons may have shaken it quoth blake with feversham perhaps but albemarle remember trusts me very fully there are ugly happenings in the town here men are being hung like linen on a washingday be not too sure that yourself are free from all danger richard paled under the baronets baleful halfsneering glance be not in too great haste to cast me aside for you may find me useful  do you threaten sir cried ruth  threaten quoth he he turned up his eyes and showed the whites of them is it to threaten to promise you my protection to show you how i can serve youthan which i ask no sweeter boon of heaven a word from me and richard need fear nothing  he need fear nothing without that word said ruth disdainfully such service as he did lord feversham the other night  is soon forgotten blake cut in adroitly indeed twill be most convenient to his lordship to forget it think you he would care to have it known that twas to such a chance he owes the preservation of his army he laughed and added in a voice of much sly meaning the times are full of peril theres kirke and his lambs and theres no saying how kirke might act did he chance to learn what richard failed to do that night when he was left to guard the rear at newlingtons  would you inform him of it cried richard between anger and alarm  blake thrust out his hands in a gesture of horrified repudiation richard he cried in deep reproof and again richard  what other tongue has he to fear asked ruth am i the only one who knows of it cried blake oh madam why will you ever do me such injustice richard has been my friendmy dearest friend i wish him so to continue and i swear that he shall find me his as you shall find me yours  it is a boon i could dispense with she assured him and rose this talk can profit little sir rowland said she you seek to bargain  you shall see how unjust you are he cried with deep sorrow it is but fitting perhaps after what has passed it is my punishment but you shall come to acknowledge that you have done me wrong you shall see how i shall befriend and protect him  that said he took his leave and went but he left behind him a shrewd seed of fear in richards mind and of the growth that sprang from it richard almost unconsciously transplanted something in the days that followed into the heart of ruth as a result to make sure that no harm should come to her brother the last of his name and race she resolved to receive sir rowland resolved in spite of dianas outspoken scorn in spite of richards protestsfor though afraid yet he would not have it soin spite even of her own deep repugnance of the man  days passed and grew to weeks bridgwater was settling down to peace againto peace and mourning the royalist scourge had spread to taunton and blake lingered on at lupton house an unwelcome but an undeniable guest  his presence was as detestable to richard now as it was to ruth for richard had to submit to the mockery with which the town rake lashed his godly bearing and altered ways more than once in gusts of sudden valour the boy urged his sister to permit him to drive the baronet from the house and let him do his worst but ruth afraid for richard bade him wait until the times were more settled when the royal vengeance had slaked its lust for blood it might matter little perhaps what tales sir rowland might elect to carry  and so sir rowland remained and waited he assured himself that he knew how to be patient and congratulated himself upon that circumstance wilding dead a little time must now suffice to blunt the sharp edge of his widows grief let him but await that time and the rest should be easy the battle his with richard he did not so much as trouble himself to reckon  thus he determined and thus no doubt he would have acted but for an unforeseen contingency a miserable paltry creditor had smoked him out in his somerset retreat and got a letter to him full of dark hints of a debtors gaol the fellows name was swiney and sir rowland knew him for fierce and pertinacious where a defaulting creditor was concerned one only course remained him to force matters with wildings widow for days he refrained fearing that precipitancy might lose him all it was his wish to do the thing without too much coercion some he was not coxcomb enough to thinkcoxcomb though he wasmight be dispensed with  at last one sunday evening he decided to be done with dallying and to bring ruth between the hammer and the anvil of his will it was the last sunday in july exactly three weeks after sedgemoor and the odd coincidence of his having chosen such a day and hour you shall appreciate anon  they were on the lawn taking the cool of the evening after an oppressively hot day by the stone seat now occupied by lady horton and diana richard lay on the sward at their feet in talk with them and their talk was of sir rowland dianagall in her soul to see the baronet by way of gaining yet his endschid richard in strong terms for his weakness in submitting to blakes constant presence at lupton house and richard meekly took her chiding and promised that if ruth would but sanction it things should be changed upon the morrow  sir rowland all unconsciousreckless indeedof this sauntered with ruth some little distance from them having contrived adroitly to draw her aside he broke a spell of silence with a dolorous sigh  ruth said he pensively i mind me of the last evening on which you and i walked here alone  she flashed him a glance of fear and aversion and stood still under his brow he watched the quick heave of her bosom the sudden flow and abiding ebb of blood in her facegrown now so thin and wistfuland he realized that before him lay no easy task he set his teeth for battle  will you never have a kindness for me ruth he sighed  she turned about her intent to join the others a dull anger in her soul he sat a hand upon her arm wait said he and the tone in which he uttered that one word kept her beside him his manner changed a little i am tired of this said he  why so am i she answered bitterly  since we are agreed so far let us agree to end it  it is all i ask  yes butalasin a different way listen now  i will not listen let me go  i were your enemy did i do so for you would know hereafter a sorrow and repentance for which nothing short of death could offer you escape richard is under suspicion  do you hark back to that the scorn of her voice was deadly had it been herself he desired surely that tone had quenched all passion in him or else transformed it into hatred but blake was playing for a fortune for shelter from a debtors prison  it has become known he continued that richard was one of the early plotters who paved the way for monmouths coming i think that that in conjunction with his betrayal of his trust that night at newlingtons thereby causing the death of some twenty gallant fellows of king jamess will be enough to hang him  her hand clutched at her heart what ist you seek she cried it was almost a moan what ist you want of me  yourself said he i love you ruth he added and stepped close up to her  o god she cried aloud had i a man at hand to kill you for that insult  and thenmiracle of miraclesa voice from the shrubs by which they stood bore to her ears the startling words that told her her prayer was answered there and then  madam that man is here  she stood frozen not more of a statue was lots wife in the moment of looking behind her than she who dared not look behind that voice a voice from the dead a voice she had heard for the last time in the cottage that was fevershams lodging at weston zoyland her wild eyes fell upon sir rowlands face it showed livid the netherlip sucked in and caught in the strong teeth as if to prevent an outcry the eyes wild with fright what did it mean by an effort she wrenched herself round at last and a scream broke from her to rouse her aunt her cousin and her brother and bring them hastening towards her across the sweep of lawn  before her on the edge of the shrubbery a grey figure stood erect and graceful and the face with its thin lips faintly smiling its dark eyes gleaming was the face of anthony wilding and as she stared he moved forward and she heard the fall of his foot upon the turf the clink of his spurs the swish of his scabbard against the shrubs and reason told her that this was no ghost  she held out her arms to him anthony anthony she staggered forward and he was no more than in time to catch her as she swayed  he held her fast against him and kissed her brow sweet he said forgive me that i frightened you i came by the orchard gate and my coming was so timely that i could not hold in my answer to your cry  her eyelids fluttered she drew a long sighing breath and nestled closer to him anthony she murmured again and reached up a hand to stroke his face to feel that it was truly living flesh  and sir rowland realizing too by now that here was no ghost recovered his lost courage he put a hand to his sword then withdrew it leaving the weapon sheathed here was a hangmans job not a swordsmans he opinedand wisely for he had had earlier experience of mr wildings play of steel  he advanced a step o fool he snarled the hangman waits for you  and a creditor for you sir rowland came the voice of mr trenchard who now pushed forward through those same shrubs that had masked his friends approach a mr swiney twas i sent him from town hes lodged at the bull and bellows like one when he speaks of what you owe him there are three messengers with him and they tell of a debtors gaol for you sweetheart  a spasm of fury crossed the face of blake they may have me and welcome when ive told my tale said he let me but tell of anthony wildings lurking here and not only anthony wilding but all the rest of you are doomed for harbouring him you know the law i think he mocked them for lady horton diana and richard who had come up stood now a pace or so away in deepest wonder you shall know it better before the night is out and better still before next sundays come  tush said trenchard and quoted theres none but anthony may conquer anthony  tis clear said wilding you take me for a rebel an odd mistake for it chances sir rowland that you behold in me an accredited servant of the secretary of state  blake stared then fell a prey to ironic laughter he would have spoken but mr wilding plucked a paper from his pocket and handed it to trenchard  show it him said he and blakes face grew white again as he read the lines above sunderlands signature and observed the seals of office he looked from the paper to the hated smiling face of mr wilding  you were a spy he said his tone making a question of the odious statement a dirty spy  your incredulity is flattering at least said wilding pleasantly as he repocketed the parchment and it leads you in the right direction i neither was nor am a spy  that paper proves it cried blake contemptuously having been a spy himself he was a good judge of the vileness of the office  see to my wife nick said wilding sharply and made as if to transfer her to the care of his friend  nay said trenchard tis your own duty that let me discharge the other for you and he stepped up to blake and tapped him briskly on the shoulder sir rowland said he youre a knave sir rowland stared at him youre a foul thinga muckwormsir rowland added trenchard amiably and youve been discourteous to a lady for which may heaven forgive youi cant  stand aside blake bade him hoarse with passion blind to all risks my affair is with mr wilding  aye said trenchard but mine is with you if you survive it you can settle what other affairs you pleaseincluding belike your business with mr swiney  not so nick said wilding suddenly and turned to richard here richard take her he bade his brotherinlaw  anthony you damned shirkduty see to your wife leave me to my own diversions sir rowland he reminded the baronet i have called you a knave and a foul thing and faith if you want it proven you need but step down the orchard with me  he saw hesitation lingering in sir rowlands face and he uncurled the last of the whip he carried id grieve to do a violent thing before the ladies he murmured deprecatingly id never respect myself again if i had to drive a gentleman of your quality to the ground of honour with a horsewhip but as gods my life if you dont go willingly this instant tis what will happen  richards newborn righteousness prompted him to interfere to seek to avert this threatened bloodshed his humanity urged him to let matters be and his humanity prevailed diana watched this foreshadowing of tragedy with tight lips pale cheeks justice was to be done at last it seemed and as her frightened eye fell upon sir rowland she knew not whether to exult or weep her motherunderstanding nothingplied her meanwhile with whispered questions  as for sir rowland he looked into the old rakes eyes agleam with wicked mirth and rage welled up to choke him he must kill this man  come said he ill see to your fine friend wilding afterwards  excellent said trenchard and led the way through the shrubbery to the orchard  ruth reviving looked up her glance met mr wildings it quickened into understanding and she stirred is it true is it really true she cried i am being tortured by this dream again  nay sweet it is true it is true i am here say shall i stay  she clung to him for answer and you are in no danger  in none sweet i am mr wilding of zoyland chase free to come and go as best shall seem to me he begged the others to leave them a little while and he led her to the stone seat by the river he set her at his side there and told her the story of his escape from the firingparty and of the inspiration that had come to him on the morrow to make use of the letter in his boot which sunderland had given him for monmouth in the hour of panic monmouths cavalier treatment of him when he had arrived in bridgwater had precluded his delivering that letter at the council there was never another opportunity nor did he again think of the package in the stressful hours that followed it was not until the following morning that he suddenly remembered it lay undelivered and bethought him that it might prove a weapon to win him delivery from the dangers that encompassed him  it was a slender chance he told her but i employed it i waited in london in hiding close upon a fortnight ere i had an opportunity of seeing sunderland he laughed me to scorn at first and threatened me with the tower but i told him the letter was in safe hands and would remain there in earnest of his good behaviour and that did he have me arrested it would instantly be laid before the king and bring his own head to the block more surely even than my own it frightened him but it had scarcely done so sweet had he known that that precious letter was still in my boot for my boot was on my leg and my leg was in the room with the rest of me  he surrendered at last and gave me papers proving that trenchard and ifor i stipulated for old nicks safety toowere his majestys accredited agents in the west i loathed the title buthe spread his hands and smiledit was that or widowing you  she took his face in her hands and stroked it fondly and they sat thus until a dry cough behind them roused them from their joyous silence mr trenchard was sauntering towards them his left eye tucked farther under his hat than usual his hands behind him  tis a thirsty evening he informed them  go tell richard so said wilding who knew naught of richards altered ways  ive thought of it but haply hes sensitive on the score of drinking with me again he has done it twice to his undoing  hell do it a third time no doubt said mr wilding curtly and trenchard taking the hint turned with a shrug and went up the lawn towards the house he found richard in the porch where he had lingered fearfully waiting for news at sight of mr trenchards grim weatherbeaten countenance he came forward suddenly  how has it sped he asked his lips twitching on the words  yonder they sit said trenchard pointing down the lawn  no no i mean sir rowland  oh sir rowland cried the old sinner as though sir rowland were some matter long forgotten he sighed alas poor swiney i fear ive cheated him  you mean  art slow at inference dick sir rowland has passed away in the odour of villainy  richard clasped nervous hands together and raised his colourless eyes to heaven  may the lord have mercy on his soul said he  may he indeed said trenchard when he had recovered from his surprise but he added pessimistically i doubt the rogues in hell  richards eyes kindled suddenly and he quoted from the thirtieth psalm i will extol thee o lord for thou hast lifted me up and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me  dumbfounded wondering indeed was westmacotts mind unhinged trenchard scanned him narrowly richard caught the glance and misinterpreted it for one of reproof he bethought him that his joy was unrighteous he stifled it and forced his lips to sigh poor blake  poor indeed quoth trenchard and adapted a remembered line of his playacting days to suit the case the tears live in an onion that shall water his grave though perhaps i am forgetting swiney then in a brisker tone come richard what like is the muscadine you keep at lupton house  i have abjured all wine said richard  a plague you have quoth trenchard understanding less and less have you turned mussuman perchance  no answered richard sternly christian  trenchard hesitated rubbing his nose thoughtfully hum said he at length peace be with you then ill leave you here to bay the moon to your hearts content perhaps jasper will know where to find me a brainwash and with a final suspicious wondering look at the whilom bibber he passed into the house much exercised on the score of the sanity of this family into which his friend anthony had married  outside the twilight shadows were deepening  shall we home sweet whispered mr wilding the shadows befriended her a veil for her sudden confusion she breathed something that seemed no more than a sigh though more it seemed to anthony wilding
