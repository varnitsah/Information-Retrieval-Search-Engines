20227991	twice told tales                       edward fanes rosebud                       by nathaniel hawthorne    there is hardly a more difficult exercise of fancy than while gazing at a figure of melancholy age to recreate its youth and without entirely obliterating the identity of form and features to restore those graces which time has snatched away some old  people especially women so ageworn and woeful are they seem never to have been young and gay  it is  easier to conceive that such gloomy phantoms were sent into the world as withered and decrepit as we behold them now with sympathies only for pain and grief to watch at deathbeds and weep at funerals even the  sable garments of their widowhood appear essential to their existence all their attributes combine to render them darksome shadows creeping strangely amid the sunshine of human life  yet it is no unprofitable task to take one of these doleful creatures and set fancy resolutely at work to brighten the dim eye and darken the silvery locks and paint the ashen cheek with rosecolor and repair the shrunken and crazy form till a dewy maiden shall be seen in the old matrons elbowchair the miracle being wrought then let the years roll back again each sadder than the last and the whole weight of age and sorrow settle down upon the youthful figure  wrinkles and furrows the handwriting of time may thus be deciphered and found to contain deep lessons of thought and feeling  such profit might be derived by a skilful observer from my muchrespected friend the widow toothaker a nurse of great repute who has breathed the atmosphere of sickchambers and dying breaths these forty years  see she sits cowering over her lonesome hearth with her gown and upper petticoat drawn upward gathering thriftily into her person the whole warmth of the fire which now at nightfall begins to dissipate the autumnal chill of her chamber  the blaze quivers capriciously in front alternately glimmering into the deepest chasms of her wrinkled visage and then permitting a ghostly dimness to mar the outlines of her venerable figure  and nurse toothaker holds a teaspoon in her right hand with which to stir up the contents of a tumbler in her left whence steams a vapory fragrance abhorred of temperance societies  now she sipsnow stirsnow sips again  her sad old heart has need to be revived by the rich infusion of geneva which is mixed half and half with hot water in the tumbler  all day long she has been sitting by a deathpillow and quitted it for her home only when the spirit of her patient left the clay and went homeward too but now are her melancholy meditations cheered and her torpid blood warmed and her shoulders lightened of at least twenty ponderous years by a draught from the true fountain of youth in a casebottle it is strange that men should deem that fount a fable when its liquor fills more bottles than the congresswater  sip it again good nurse and see whether a second draught will not take off another score of years and perhaps ten more and show us in your highbacked chair the blooming damsel who plighted troths with edward fane  get you gone age and widowhood  come back unwedded youth  but alas the charm will not work  in spite of fancys most potent spell i can see only an old dame cowering over the fire a picture of decay and desolation while the november blast roars at her in the chimney and fitful showers rush suddenly against the window  yet there was a time when rose graftonsuch was the pretty maiden name of nurse toothakerpossessed beauty that would have gladdened this dim and dismal chamber as with sunshine  it won for her the heart of edward fane who has since made so great a figure in the world and is now a grand old gentleman with powdered hair and as gouty as a lord  these early lovers thought to have walked hand in hand through life  they had wept together for edwards little sister mary whom rose tended in her sickness partly because she was the sweetest child that ever lived or died but more for love of him  she was but three years old  being such an infant death could not embody his terrors in her little corpse nor did rose fear to touch the dead childs brow though chill as she curled the silken hair around it nor to take her tiny hand and clasp a flower within its fingers afterward when she looked through the pane of glass in the coffinlid and beheld marys face it seemed not so much like death or life as like a waxwork wrought into the perfect image of a child asleep and dreaming of its mothers smile  rose thought her too fair a thing to be hidden in the grave and wondered that an angel did not snatch up little marys coffin and bear the slumbering babe to heaven and bid her wake immortal  but when the sods were laid on little mary the heart of rose was troubled  she shuddered at the fantasy that in grasping the childs cold fingers her virgin hand had exchanged a first greeting with mortality and could never lose the earthly taint  how many a greeting since  but as yet she was a fair young girl with the dewdrops of fresh feeling in her bosom and instead of rose which seemed too mature a name for her halfopened beauty her lover called her rosebud  the rosebud was destined never to bloom for edward fane  his mother was a rich and haughty dame with all the aristocratic prejudices of colonial times  she scorned rose graftons humble parentage and caused her son to break his faith though had she let him choose he would have prized his rosebud above the richest diamond  the lovers parted and have seldom met again both may have visited the same mansions but not at the same time for one was bidden to the festal hall and the other to the sickchamber he was the guest of pleasure and prosperity and she of anguish  rose after their separation was long secluded within the dwelling of mr toothaker whom she married with the revengeful hope of breaking her false lovers heart  she went to her bridegrooms arms with bitterer tears they say than young girls ought to shed at the threshold of the bridal chamber yet though her husbands head was getting gray and his heart had been chilled with an autumnal frost rose soon began to love him and wondered at her own conjugal affection  he was all she had to love there were no children  in a year or two poor mr toothaker was visited with a wearisome infirmity which settled in his joints and made him weaker than a child  he crept forth about his business and came home at dinnertime and eventide not with the manly tread that gladdens a wifes heart but slowly feebly jotting down each dull footstep with a melancholy dub of his staff  we must pardon his pretty wife if she sometimes blushed to own him  her visitors when they heard him coming looked for the appearance of some old old man but he dragged his nerveless limbs into the parlorand there was mr toothaker the disease increasing he never went into the sunshine save with a staff in his right hand and his left on his wifes shoulder bearing heavily downward like a dead mans hand  thus a slender woman still looking maidenlike she supported his tall broadchested frame along the pathway of their little garden and plucked the roses for her grayhaired husband and spoke soothingly as to an infant  his mind was palsied with his body its utmost energy was peevishness  in a few months more she helped him up the staircase with a pause at every step and a longer one upon the landingplace and a heavy glance behind as he crossed the threshold of his chamber  he knew poor man that the precincts of those four walls would thenceforth be his worldhis world his home his tombat once a dwelling and a burialplace till he were borne to a darker and a narrower one  but rose was with him in the tomb  he leaned upon her in his daily passage from the bed to the chair by the fireside and back again from the weary chair to the joyless bedhis bed and herstheir marriagebed till even this short journey ceased and his head lay all day upon the pillow and hers all night beside it  how long poor mr toothaker was kept in misery  death seemed to draw near the door and often to lift the latch and sometimes to thrust his ugly skull into the chamber nodding to rose and pointing at her husband but still delayed to enter  this bedridden wretch cannot escape me quoth death  i will go forth and run a race with the swift and fight a battle with the strong and come back for toothaker at my leisure  o when the deliverer came so near in the dull anguish of her wornout sympathies did she never long to cry death come in  but no  we have no right to ascribe such a wish to our friend rose she never failed in a wifes duty to her poor sick husband  she murmured not though a glimpse of the sunny sky was as strange to her as him nor answered peevishly though his complaining accents roused her from her sweetest dream only to share his wretchedness  he knew her faith yet nourished a cankered jealousy and when the slow disease had chilled all his heart save one lukewarm spot which deaths frozen fingers were searching for his last words were what would my rose have done for her first love if she has been so true and kind to a sick old man like me   and then his poor soul crept away and left the body lifeless though hardly more so than for years before and rose a widow though in truth it was the weddingnight that widowed her  she felt glad it must be owned when mr toothaker was buried because his corpse had retained such a likeness to the man half alive that she hearkened for the sad murmur of his voice bidding her shift his pillow  but all through the next winter though the grave had held him many a month she fancied him calling from that cold bed  rose rose come put a blanket on my feet  so now the rosebud was the widow toothaker  her troubles had come early and tedious as they seemed had passed before all her bloom was fled  she was still fair enough to captivate a bachelor or with a widows cheerful gravity she might have won a widower stealing into his heart in the very guise of his dead wife  but the widow toothaker had no such projects  by her watchings and continual cares her heart had become knit to her first husband with a constancy which changed its very nature and made her love him for his infirmities and infirmity for his sake  when the palsied old man was gone even her early lover could not have supplied his place  she had dwelt in a sickchamber and been the companion of a halfdead wretch till she could scarcely breathe in a free air and felt ill at ease with the healthy and the happy  she missed the fragrance of the doctors stuff  she walked the chamber with a noiseless footfall  if visitors came in she spoke in soft and soothing accents and was startled and shocked by their loud voices often in the lonesome evening she looked timorously from the fireside to the bed with almost a hope of recognizing a ghastly face upon the pillow  then went her thoughts sadly to her husbands grave  if one impatient throb bad wronged him in his lifetimeif she had secretly repined because her buoyant youth was imprisoned with his torpid ageif ever while slumbering beside him a treacherous dream had admitted another into her heartyet the sick man had been preparing a revenge which the dead now claimed  on his painful pillow he had cast a spell around her his groans and misery had proved more captivating charms than gayety and youthful grace in his semblance disease itself had won the rosebud for a bride nor could his death dissolve the nuptials  by that indissoluble bond she had gained a home in every sickchamber and nowhere else there were her brethren and sisters thither her husband summoned her with that voice which had seemed to issue from the grave of toothaker  at length she recognized her destiny  we have beheld her as the maid the wife the widow now we see her in a separate and insulated character she was in all her attributes nurse toothaker  and nurse toothaker alone with her own shrivelled lips could make known her experience in that capacity  what a history might she record of the great sicknesses in which she has gone hand in hand with the exterminating angel  she remembers when the smallpox hoisted a red banner on almost every house along the street  she has witnessed when the typhus fever swept off a whole household young and old all but a lonely mother who vainly shrieked to follow her last loved one  where would be deaths triumph if none lived to weep  she can speak of strange maladies that have broken out as if spontaneously but were found to have been imported from foreign lands with rich silks and other merchandise the costliest portion of the cargo  and once she recollects the people died of what was considered a new pestilence till the doctors traced it to the ancient grave of a young girl who thus caused many deaths a hundred years after her own burial  strange that such black mischief should lurk in a maidens grave  she loves to tell how strong men fight with fiery fevers utterly refusing to give up their breath and how consumptive virgins fade out of the world scarcely reluctant as if their lovers were wooing them to a far country  tell us thou fearful woman tell us the deathsecrets  fain would i search out the meaning of words faintly gasped with intermingled sobs and broken sentences half audibly spoken between earth and the judgmentseat  an awful woman  she is the patron saint of young physicians and the bosom friend of old ones  in the mansions where she enters the inmates provide themselves black garments the coffinmaker follows her and the bell tolls as she comes away from the threshold  death himself has met her at so many a bedside that he puts forth his bony hand to greet nurse toothaker  she is an awful woman  and o is it conceivable that this handmaid of human infirmity and afflictionso darkly stained so thoroughly imbued with all that is saddest in the doom of mortalscan ever again be bright and gladsome even though bathed in the sunshine of eternity  by her long communion with woe has she not forfeited her inheritance of immortal joy  does any germ of bliss survive within her  hark an eager knocking at nurse toothakers door  she starts from her drowsy revery sets aside the empty tumbler and teaspoon and lights a lamp at the dim embers of the fire  rap rap rap again and she hurries adown the staircase wondering which of her friends can be at deaths door now since there is such an earnest messenger at nurse toothakers  again the peal resounds just as her hand is on the lock   be quick nurse toothaker cries a man on the doorstep old general fane is taken with the gout in his stomach and has sent for you to watch by his deathbed  make haste for there is no time to lose  fane edward fane  and has he sent for me at last  i am ready  i will get on my cloak and begone  so adds the sablegowned ashenvisaged funereal old figure edward fane remembers his rosebud  our question is answered  there is a germ of bliss within her her longhoarded constancyher memory of the bliss that wasremaining amid the gloom of her after life like a sweetsmelling flower in a coffin is a symbol that all maybe renewed  in some happier clime the rosebud may revive again with all the dewdrops in its bosom
