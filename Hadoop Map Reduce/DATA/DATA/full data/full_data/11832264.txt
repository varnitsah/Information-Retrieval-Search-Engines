11832264	an unprotected female at the pyramids  by anthony trollope     in the happy days when we were young no description conveyed to us so complete an idea of mysterious reality as that of an oriental city  we knew it was actually there but had such vague notions of its ways and looks  let any one remember his early impressions as to bagdad or grand cairo and then say if this was not so  it was probably taken from the arabian nights and the picture produced was one of strange fantastic luxurious houses of women who were either very young and very beautiful or else very old and very cunning but in either state exercising much more influence in life than women in the east do now of goodnatured capricious though sometimes tyrannical monarchs and of life full of quaint mysteries quite unintelligible in every phasis and on that account the more picturesque  and perhaps grand cairo has thus filled us with more wonder even than bagdad  we have been in a certain manner at home at bagdad but have only visited grand cairo occasionally  i know no place which was to me in early years so delightfully mysterious as grand cairo  but the route to india and australia has changed all this  men from all countries going to the east now pass through cairo and its streets and costumes are no longer strange to us  it has become also a resort for invalids or rather for those who fear that they may become invalids if they remain in a cold climate during the winter months and thus at cairo there is always to be found a considerable population of french americans and of english  oriental life is brought home to us dreadfully diluted by western customs and the delights of the arabian nights are shorn of half their value  when we have seen a thing it is never so magnificent to us as when it was half unknown  it is not much that we deign to learn from these orientalswe who glory in our civilisation  we do not copy their silence or their abstemiousness nor that invariable mindfulness of his own personal dignity which always adheres to a turk or to an arab  we chatter as much at cairo as elsewhere and eat as much and drink as much and dress ourselves generally in the same old ugly costume  but we do usually take upon ourselves to wear red caps and we do ride on donkeys  nor are the visitors from the west to cairo by any means confined to the male sex  ladies are to be seen in the streets quite regardless of the mahommedan custom which presumes a veil to be necessary for an appearance in public and to tell the truth the mahommedans in general do not appear to be much shocked by their effrontery  a quarter of the town has in this way become inhabited by men wearing coats and waistcoats and by women who are without veils but the english tongue in egypt finds its centre at shepheards hotel  it is here that people congregate who are looking out for parties to visit with them the upper nile and who are generally all smiles and courtesy and here also are to be found they who have just returned from this journey and who are often in a frame of mind towards their companions that is much less amiable  from hence during the winter a cortege proceeds almost daily to the pyramids or to memphis or to the petrified forest or to the city of the sun  and then again four or five times a month the house is filled with young aspirants going out to india male and female full of valour and bloom or with others coming home no longer young no longer aspiring but laden with children and grievances  the party with whom we are at present concerned is not about to proceed further than the pyramids and we shall be able to go with them and return in one and the same day  it consisted chiefly of an english family mr and mrs damer their daughter and two young sonsof these chiefly because they were the nucleus to which the others had attached themselves as adherents they had originated the journey and in the whole management of it mr damer retarded himself as the master  the adherents were firstly m delabordeau a frenchman now resident in cairo who had given out that he was in some way concerned in the canal about to be made between the mediterranean and the red sea  in discussion on this subject he had become acquainted with mr damer and although the latter gentleman true to english interests perpetually declared that the canal would never be made and thus irritated m delabordeau not a littlenevertheless some measure of friendship had grown up between them  there was also an american gentleman mr jefferson ingram who was comprising all countries and all nations in one grand tour as american gentlemen so often do  he was young and goodlooking and had made himself especially agreeable to mr damer who had declared more than once that mr ingram was by far the most rational american he had ever met  mr ingram would listen to mr damer by the halfhour as to the virtue of the british constitution and had even sat by almost with patience when mr damer had expressed a doubt as to the good working of the united states scheme of policywhich in an american was most wonderful  but some of the sojourners at shepheards had observed that mr ingram was in the habit of talking with miss damer almost as much as with her father and argued from that that fond as the young man was of politics he did sometimes turn his mind to other things also  and then there was miss dawkins  now miss dawkins was an important person both as to herself and as to her line of life and she must be described  she was in the first place an unprotected female of about thirty years of age  as this is becoming an established profession setting itself up as it were in opposition to the old world idea that women like green peas cannot come to perfection without supporting sticks it will be understood at once what were miss dawkinss sentiments  she consideredor at any rate so expressed herselfthat peas could grow very well without sticks and could not only grow thus unsupported but could also make their way about the world without any incumbrance of sticks whatsoever  she did not intend she said to rival ida pfeiffer seeing that she was attached in a moderate way to bed and board and was attached to society in a manner almost more than moderate but she had no idea of being prevented from seeing anything she wished to see because she had neither father nor husband nor brother available for the purpose of escort  she was a human creature with arms and legs she said and she intended to use them  and this was all very well but nevertheless she had a strong inclination to use the arms and legs of other people when she could make them serviceable  in person miss dawkins was not without attraction  i should exaggerate if i were to say that she was beautiful and elegant but she was good looking and not usually ill mannered  she was tall and gifted with features rather sharp and with eyes very bright  her hair was of the darkest shade of brown and was always worn in bandeaux very neatly she appeared generally in black though other circumstances did not lead one to suppose that she was in mourning and then no other travelling costume is so convenient  she always wore a dark broad brimmed straw hat as to the ribbons on which she was rather particular  she was very neat about her gloves and boots and though it cannot be said that her dress was got up without reference to expense there can be no doubt that it was not effected without considerable outlayand more considerable thought  miss dawkinssabrina dawkins was her name but she seldom had friends about her intimate enough to use the word sabrinawas certainly a clever young woman  she could talk on most subjects if not well at least well enough to amuse  if she had not read much she never showed any lamentable deficiency she was goodhumoured as a rule and could on occasions be very soft and winning  people who had known her long would sometimes say that she was selfish but with new acquaintance she was forbearing and selfdenying  with what income miss dawkins was blessed no one seemed to know  she lived like a gentlewoman as far as outward appearance went and never seemed to be in want but some people would say that she knew very well how many sides there were to a shilling and some enemy had once declared that she was an old soldier  such was miss dawkins  she also as well as mr ingram and m delabordeau had laid herself out to find the weak side of mr damer  mr damer with all his family was going up the nile and it was known that he had room for two in his boat over and above his own family  miss dawkins had told him that she had not quite made up her mind to undergo so great a fatigue but that nevertheless she had a longing of the soul to see something of nubia  to this mr damer had answered nothing but oh which miss dawkins had not found to be encouraging  but she had not on that account despaired  to a married man there are always two sides and in this instance there was mrs damer as well as mr damer  when mr damer said oh miss dawkins sighed and said yes indeed then smiled and betook herself to mrs damer  now mrs damer was softhearted and also somewhat oldfashioned  she did not conceive any violent affection for miss dawkins but she told her daughter that the single lady by herself was a very nice young woman and that it was a thousand pities she should have to go about so much alone like  miss damer had turned up her pretty nose thinking perhaps how small was the chance that it ever should be her own lot to be an unprotected female  but miss dawkins carried her point at any rate as regarded the expedition to the pyramids  miss damer i have said had a pretty nose  i may also say that she had pretty eyes mouth and chin with other necessary appendages all pretty  as to the two master damers who were respectively of the ages of fifteen and sixteen it may be sufficient to say that they were conspicuous for red caps and for the constancy with which they raced their donkeys  and now the donkeys and the donkey boys and the dragomans were all standing at the steps of shepheards hotel  to each donkey there was a donkeyboy and to each gentleman there was a dragoman so that a goodly cortege was assembled and a goodly noise was made  it may here be remarked perhaps with some little pride that not half the noise is given in egypt to persons speaking any other language that is bestowed on those whose vocabulary is english  this lasted for half an hour  had the party been french the donkeys would have arrived only fifteen minutes before the appointed time  and then out came damer pere and damer mere damer fille and damer fils damer mere was leaning on her husband as was her wont  she was not an unprotected female and had no desire to make any attempts in that line  damer fille was attended sedulously by mr ingram for whose demolishment however mr damer still brought up in a loud voice the fag ends of certain political arguments which he would fain have poured direct into the ears of his opponent had not his wife been so persistent in claiming her privileges  m delabordeau should have followed with miss dawkins but his french politeness or else his fear of the unprotected female taught him to walk on the other side of the mistress of the party  miss dawkins left the house with an eager young damer yelling on each side of her but nevertheless though thus neglected by the gentlemen of the party she was all smiles and prettiness and looked so sweetly on mr ingram when that gentleman stayed a moment to help her on to her donkey that his heart almost misgave him for leaving her as soon as she was in her seat  and then they were off  in going from the hotel to the pyramids our party had not to pass through any of the queer old narrow streets of the true cairocairo the oriental  they all lay behind them as they went down by the back of the hotel by the barracks of the pasha and the college of the dervishes to the village of old cairo and the banks of the nile  here they were kept half an hour while their dragomans made a bargain with the ferryman a stately reis or captain of a boat who declared with much dignity that he could not carry them over for a sum less than six times the amount to which he was justly entitled while the dragomans with great energy on behalf of their masters offered him only five times that sum  as far as the reis was concerned the contest might soon have been at an end for the man was not without a conscience and would have been content with five times and a half but then the three dragomans quarrelled among themselves as to which should have the paying of the money and the affair became very tedious  what horrid odious men said miss dawkins appealing to mr damer do you think they will let us go over at all  well i suppose they will people do get over generally i believe abdallah  abdallah why dont you pay the man  that fellow is always striving to save half a piastre for me  i wish he wasnt quite so particular said mrs damer who was already becoming rather tired but im sure hes a very honest man in trying to protect us from being robbed  that he is said miss dawkins  what a delightful trait of national character it is to see these men so faithful to their employers  and then at last they got over the ferry mr ingram having descended among the combatants and settled the matter in dispute by threats and shouts and an uplifted stick  they crossed the broad nile exactly at the spot where the nilometer or river guage measures from day to day and from year to year the increasing or decreasing treasures of the stream and landed at a village where thousands of eggs are made into chickens by the process of artificial incubation  mrs damer thought that it was very hard upon the maternal hensthe hens which should have been maternalthat they should be thus robbed of the delights of motherhood  so unnatural you know said miss dawkins so opposed to the fostering principles of creation  dont you think so mr ingram  mr ingram said he didnt know  he was again seating miss damer on her donkey and it must be presumed that he performed this feat clumsily for fanny damer could jump on and off the animal with hardly a finger to help her when her brother or her father was her escort but now under the hands of mr ingram this work of mounting was one which required considerable time and care  all which miss dawkins observed with precision  its all very well talking said mr damer bringing up his donkey nearly alongside that of mr ingram and ignoring his daughters presence just as he would have done that of his dog but you must admit that political power is more equally distributed in england than it is in america  perhaps it is said mr ingram equally distributed among we will say three dozen families and he made a feint as though to hold in his impetuous donkey using the spur however at the same time on the side that was unseen by mr damer  as he did so fannys donkey became equally impetuous and the two cantered on in advance of the whole party  it was quite in vain that mr damer at the top of his voice shouted out something about three dozen corruptible demagogues  mr ingram found it quite impossible to restrain his donkey so as to listen to the sarcasm  i do believe papa would talk politics said fanny if he were at the top of mont blanc or under the falls of niagara  i do hate politics mr ingram  i am sorry for that very said mr ingram almost sadly  sorry why  you dont want me to talk politics do you  in america we are all politicians more or less and therefore i suppose you will hate us all  well i rather think i should said fanny you would be such bores but there was something in her eye as she spoke which atoned for the harshness of her words  a very nice young man is mr ingram dont you think so said miss dawkins to mrs damer  mrs damer was going along upon her donkey not altogether comfortably  she much wished to have her lord and legitimate protector by her side but he had left her to the care of a dragoman whose english was not intelligible to her and she was rather cross  indeed miss dawkins i dont know who are nice and who are not  this nasty donkey stumbles at ever step  there  i know i shall be down directly  you need not be at all afraid of that they are perfectly safe i believe always said miss dawkins rising in her stirrup and handling her reins quite triumphantly  a very little practice will make you quite at home  i dont know what you mean by a very little practice  i have been here six weeks  why did you put me on such a bad donkey as this and she turned to abdallah the dragoman  him berry good donkey my lady berry goodbest of all  call him jack in cairo  him go to pyramid and back and mind noting  what does he say miss dawkins  he says that that donkey is one called jack  if so ive had him myself many times and jack is a very good donkey  i wish you had him now with all my heart said mrs damer  upon which miss dawkins offered to change but those perils of mounting and dismounting were to mrs damer a great deal too severe to admit of this  seven miles of canal to be carried out into the sea at a minimum depth of twentythree feet and the stone to be fetched from heaven knows where  all the money in france wouldnt do it  this was addressed by mr damer to m delabordeau whom he had caught after the abrupt flight of mr ingram  den we will borrow a leetle from england said m delabordeau  precious little i can tell you  such stock would not hold its price in our markets for twentyfour hours  if it were made the freights would be too heavy to allow of merchandise passing through  the heavy goods would all go round and as for passengers and mails you dont expect to get them i suppose while there is a railroad ready made to their hand  ye vill carry all your ships through vidout any transportation  think of that my friend  pshaw  you are worse than ingram  of all the plans i ever heard of it is the most monstrous the most impracticable the most  but here he was interrupted by the entreaties of his wife who had in absolute deed and fact slipped from her donkey and was now calling lustily for her husbands aid  whereupon miss dawkins allied herself to the frenchman and listened with an air of strong conviction to those arguments which were so weak in the ears of mr damer  m delabordeau was about to ride across the great desert to jerusalem and it might perhaps be quite as well to do that with him as to go up the nile as far as the second cataract with the damers  and so m delabordeau you intend really to start for mount sinai  yes mees ve intend to make one start on monday week  and so on to jerusalem  you are quite right  it would be a thousand pities to be in these countries and to return without going over such ground as that  i shall certainly go to jerusalem myself by that route  vot mees you  would you not find it too much fatigante  i care nothing for fatigue if i like the party i am withnothing at all literally  you will hardly understand me perhaps m delabordeau but i do not see any reason why i as a young woman should not make any journey that is practicable for a young man  ah dat is great resolution for you mees  i mean as far as fatigue is concerned  you are a frenchman and belong to the nation that is at the head of all human civilisation  m delabordeau took off his hat and bowed low to the peak of his donkey saddle  he dearly loved to hear his country praised as miss dawkins was aware  and i am sure you must agree with me continued miss dawkins that the time is gone by for women to consider themselves helpless animals or to be so considered by others  mees dawkins vould never be considered not in any times at all to be one helpless animal said m delabordeau civilly  i do not at any rate intend to be so regarded said she  it suits me to travel alone not that i am averse to society quite the contrary if i meet pleasant people i am always ready to join them but it suits me to travel without any permanent party and i do not see why false shame should prevent my seeing the world as thoroughly as though i belonged to the other sex  why should it m delabordeau  m delabordeau declared that he did not see any reason why it should  i am passionately anxious to stand upon mount sinai continued miss dawkins to press with my feet the earliest spot in sacred history of the identity of which we are certain to feel within me the awe inspiring thrill of that thrice sacred hour  the frenchman looked as though he did not quite understand her but he said that it would be magnifique  you have already made up your party i suppose m delabordeau  m delabordeau gave the names of two frenchmen and one englishman who were going with him  upon my word it is a great temptation to join you said miss dawkins only for that horrid englishman  vat mr stanley  oh i dont mean any disrespect to mr stanley  the horridness i speak of does not attach to him personally but to his stiff respectable ungainly wellbehaved irrational and uncivilised country  you see i am not very patriotic  not quite so much as my friend mr damer  ha ha ha an excellent creature isnt he  and so they all are dear creatures  but then they are so backward  they are most anxious that i should join them up the nile but and then miss dawkins shrugged her shoulders gracefully and as she flattered herself like a frenchwoman  after that they rode on in silence for a few moments  yes i must see mount sinai said miss dawkins and then sighed deeply  m delabordeau notwithstanding that his country does stand at the head of all human civilisation was not courteous enough to declare that if miss dawkins would join his party across the desert nothing would be wanting to make his beatitude in this world perfect  their road from the village of the chickenbatching ovens lay up along the left bank of the nile through an immense grove of lofty palm trees looking out from among which our visitors could ever and anon see the heads of the two great pyramidsthat is such of them could see it as felt any solicitude in the matter  it is astonishing how such things lose their great charm as men find themselves in their close neighbourhood  to one living in new york or london how ecstatic is the interest inspired by these huge structures one feels that no price would be too high to pay for seeing them as long as time and distance and the worlds inexorable taskwork forbid such a visit  how intense would be the delight of climbing over the wondrous handiwork of those wondrous architects so long since dead how thrilling the awe with which one would penetrate down into their interior cavesthose caves in which lay buried the bones of ancient kings whose very names seem to have come to us almost from another world  but all these feelings become strangely dim their acute edges wonderfully worn as the subjects which inspired them are brought near to us  ah so those are the pyramids are they says the traveller when the first glimpse of them is shown to him from the window of a railway carriage  dear me they dont look so very high do they for heavens sake put the blind down or we shall be destroyed by the dust  and then the ecstasy and keen delight of the pyramids has vanished for ever  our friends therefore who for weeks past had seen from a distance though they had not yet visited them did not seem to have any strong feeling on the subject as they trotted through the grove of palmtrees mr damer had not yet escaped from his wife who was still fretful from the result of her little accident  it was all the chattering of that miss dawkins said mrs damer she would not let me attend to what i was doing  miss dawkins is an ass said her husband  it is a pity she has no one to look after her said mrs damer  m delabordeau was still listening to miss dawkinss raptures about mount sinai  i wonder whether she has got any money said m delabordeau to himself  it cant be much he went on thinking or she would not be left in this way by herself  and the result of his thoughts was that miss dawkins if undertaken might probably become more plague than profit  as to miss dawkins herself though she was ecstatic about mount sinaiwhich was not presentshe seemed to have forgotten the poor pyramids which were then before her nose  the two lads were riding races along the dusty path much to the disgust of their donkeyboys  their time for enjoyment was to come there were hampers to be opened and then the absolute climbing of the pyramids would actually be a delight to them  as for miss damer and mr ingram it was clear that they had forgotten palmtrees pyramids the nile and all egypt  they had escaped to a much fairer paradise  could i bear to live among republicans said fanny repeating the last words of her american lover and looking down from her donkey to the ground as she did so  i hardly know what republicans are mr ingram  let me teach you said he  you do talk such nonsense  i declare there is that miss dawkins looking at us as though she had twenty eyes  could you not teach her mr ingram  and so they emerged from the palmtree grove through a village crowded with dirty straggling arab children on to the cultivated plain beyond which the pyramids stood now full before them the two large pyramids a smaller one and the huge sphynxs head all in a group together  fanny said bob damer riding up to her mamma wants you so toddle back  mamma wants me  what can she want me for now said fanny with a look of anything but filial duty in her face  to protect her from miss dawkins i think  she wants you to ride at her side so that dawkins maynt get at her  now mr ingram ill bet you halfacrown im at the top of the big pyramid before you  poor fanny  she obeyed however doubtless feeling that it would not do as yet to show too plainly that she preferred mr ingram to her mother  she arrested her donkey therefore till mrs damer overtook her and mr ingram as he paused for a moment with her while she did so fell into the hands of miss dawkins  i cannot think fanny how you get on so quick said mrs damer im always last but then my donkey is such a very nasty one  look there now hes always trying to get me off  we shall soon be at the pyramids now mamma  how on earth i am ever to get back again i cannot think  i am so tired now that i can hardly sit  youll be better mamma when you get your luncheon and a glass of wine  how on earth we are to eat and drink with those nasty arab people around us i cant conceive  they tell me we shall be eaten up by them  but fanny what has mr ingram been saying to you all the day  what has he been saying mamma  oh  i dont knowa hundred things i dare say  but he has not been talking to me all the time  i think he has fanny nearly since we crossed the river  oh dear oh dear this animal does hurt me so  every time he moves he flings his head about and that gives me such a bump  and then fanny commiserated her mothers sufferings and in her commiseration contrived to elude any further questionings as to mr ingrams conversation  majestic piles are they not said miss dawkins who having changed her companion allowed her mind to revert from mount sinai to the pyramids  they were now riding through cultivated ground with the vast extent of the sands of libya before them  the two pyramids were standing on the margin of the sand with the head of the recumbent sphynx plainly visible between them  but no idea can be formed of the size of this immense figure till it is visited much more closely  the body is covered with sand and the head and neck alone stand above the surface of the ground  they were still two miles distant and the sphynx as yet was but an obscure mount between the two vast pyramids  immense piles said miss dawkins repeating her own words  yes they are large said mr ingram who did not choose to indulge in enthusiasm in the presence of miss dawkins  enormous  what a grand ideaeh mr ingram  the human race does not create such things as those nowadays  no indeed he answered but perhaps we create better things  better  you do not mean to say mr ingram that you are an utilitarian  i do in truth hope better things of you than that yes steam mills are better no doubt and mechanics institutes and penny newspapers  but is nothing to be valued but what is useful and miss dawkins in the height of her enthusiasm switched her donkey severely over the shoulder  i might perhaps have said also that we create more beautiful things said mr ingram  but we cannot create older things  no certainly we cannot do that  nor can we imbue what we do create with the grand associations which environ those piles with so intense an interest  think of the mighty dead mr ingram and of their great homes when living  think of the hands which it took to raise those huge blocks  and of the lives which it cost  doubtless  the tyranny and invincible power of the royal architects add to the grandeur of the idea  one would not wish to have back the kings of egypt  well no they would be neither useful nor beautiful  perhaps not and i do not wish to be picturesque at the expense of my fellowcreatures  i doubt even whether they would be picturesque  you know what i mean mr ingram  but the associations of such names and the presence of the stupendous works with which they are connected fill the soul with awe  such at least is the effect with mine  i fear that my tendencies miss dawkins are more realistic than your own  you belong to a young country mr ingram and are naturally prone to think of material life  the necessity of living looms large before you  very large indeed miss dawkins  whereas with us with some of us at least the material aspect has given place to one in which poetry and enthusiasm prevail  to such among us the associations of past times are very dear  cheops to me is more than napoleon bonaparte  that is more than most of your countrymen can say at any rate just at present  i am a woman continued miss dawkins  mr ingram took off his hat in acknowledgment both of the announcement and of the fact  and to us it is not givennot given as yetto share in the great deeds of the present  the envy of your sex has driven us from the paths which lead to honour  but the deeds of the past are as much ours as yours  oh quite as much  tis to your country that we look for enfranchisement from this thraldom  yes mr ingram the women of america have that strength of mind which has been wanting to those of europe  in the united states woman will at last learn to exercise her proper mission  mr ingram expressed a sincere wish that such might be the case and then wondering at the ingenuity with which miss dawkins had travelled round from cheops and his pyramid to the rights of women in america he contrived to fall back under the pretence of asking after the ailments of mrs damer  and now at last they were on the sand in the absolute desert making their way up to the very foot of the most northern of the two pyramids they were by this time surrounded by a crowd of arab guides or arabs professing to be guides who had already ascertained that mr damer was the chief of the party and were accordingly driving him almost to madness by the offers of their services and their assurance that he could not possibly see the outside or the inside of either structure or even remain alive upon the ground unless he at once accepted their offers made at their own prices  get away will you said he  i dont want any of you and i wont have you  if you take hold of me ill shoot you  this was said to one specially energetic arab who in his efforts to secure his prey had caught hold of mr damer by the leg  yes yes i say  englishmen always take mememe and then no break him leg  yesyesyesi go  master say yes  only one leetle ten shillings  abdallah shouted mr damer why dont you take this man away  why dont you make him understand that if all the pyramids depended on it i would not give him sixpence  and then abdallah thus invoked came up and explained to the man in arabic that he would gain his object more surely if he would behave himself a little more quietly a hint which the man took for one minute and for one minute only  and then poor mrs damer replied to an application for backsheish by the gift of a sixpence  unfortunate woman  the word backsheish means i believe a gift but it has come in egypt to signify money and is eternally dinned into the ears of strangers by arab suppliants  mrs damer ought to have known better as during the last six weeks she had never shown her face out of shepheards hotel without being pestered for backsheish but she was tired and weak and foolishly thought to rid herself of the man who was annoying her  no sooner had the coin dropped from her hand into that of the arab than she was surrounded by a cluster of beggars who loudly made their petitions as though they would each of them individually be injured if treated with less liberality than that first comer  they took hold of her donkey her bridle her saddle her legs and at last her arms and hands screaming for backsheish in voices that were neither sweet nor mild  in her dismay she did give away sundry small coinsall probably that she had about her but this only made the matter worse  money was going and each man by sufficient energy might hope to get some of it  they were very energetic and so frightened the poor lady that she would certainly have fallen had she not been kept on her seat by the pressure around her  oh dear oh dear get away she cried  i havent got any more indeed i havent  go away i tell you  mr damer oh mr damer and then in the excess of her agony she uttered one loud long and continuous shriek  up came mr damer up came abdallah up came m delabordeau up came mr ingram and at last she was rescued  you shouldnt go away and leave me to the mercy of these nasty people  as to that abdallah he is of no use to anybody  why you bodder de good lady you dem blackguard said abdallah raising his stick as though he were going to lay them all low with a blow  now you get noting you tief  the arabs for a moment retired to a little distance like flies driven from a sugarbowl but it was easy to see that like the flies they would return at the first vacant moment  and now they had reached the very foot of the pyramids and proceeded to dismount from their donkeys  their intention was first to ascend to the top then to come down to their banquet and after that to penetrate into the interior  and all this would seem to be easy of performance  the pyramid is undoubtedly high but it is so constructed as to admit of climbing without difficulty  a lady mounting it would undoubtedly need some assistance but any man possessed of moderate activity would require no aid at all  but our friends were at once imbued with the tremendous nature of the task before them  a sheikh of the arabs came forth who communicated with them through abdallah  the work could be done no doubt he said but a great many men would be wanted to assist  each lady must have four arabs and each gentlemen three and then seeing that the work would be peculiarly severe on this special day each of these numerous arabs must be remunerated by some very large number of piastres  mr damer who was by no means a close man in his money dealings opened his eyes with surprise and mildly expostulated m delabordeau who was rather a close man in his reckonings immediately buttoned up his breeches pocket and declared that he should decline to mount the pyramid at all at that price and then mr ingram descended to the combat  the protestations of the men were fearful  they declared with loud voices eager actions and manifold english oaths that an attempt was being made to rob them  they had a right to demand the sums which they were charging and it was a shame that english gentlemen should come and take the bread out of their mouths  and so they screeched gesticulated and swore and frightened poor mrs damer almost into fits  but at last it was settled and away they started the sheikh declaring that the bargain had been made at so low a rate as to leave him not one piastre for himself  each man had an arab on each side of him and miss dawkins and miss damer had each in addition one behind  mrs damer was so frightened as altogether to have lost all ambition to ascend  she sat below on a fragment of stone with the three dragomans standing around her as guards but even with the three dragomans the attacks on her were so frequent and as she declared afterwards she was so bewildered that she never had time to remember that she had come there from england to see the pyramids and that she was now immediately under them  the boys utterly ignoring their guides scrambled up quicker than the arabs could follow them  mr damer started off at a pace which soon brought him to the end of his tether and from that point was dragged up by the sheer strength of his assistants thereby accomplishing the wishes of the men who induce their victims to start as rapidly as possible in order that they may soon find themselves helpless from want of wind  mr ingram endeavoured to attach himself to fanny and she would have been nothing loth to have him at her right hand instead of the hideous brown shrieking oneeyed arab who took hold of her but it was soon found that any such arrangement was impossible  each guide felt that if he lost his own peculiar hold he would lose his prey and held on therefore with invincible tenacity  miss dawkins looked too as though she had thought to be attended to by some christian cavalier but no christian cavalier was forthcoming  m delabordeau was the wisest for he took the matter quietly did as he was bid and allowed the guides nearly to carry him to the top of the edifice  ha so this is the top of the pyramid is it said mr damer bringing out his words one by one being terribly out of breath  very wonderful very wonderful indeed  it is wonderful said miss dawkins whose breath had not failed her in the least very wonderful indeed  only think mr damer you might travel on for days and days till days became months through those interminable sands and yet you would never come to the end of them  is it not quite stupendous  ah yes quitepuff puffsaid mr damer striving to regain his breath  mr damer was now at her disposal weak and worn with toil and travel out of breath and with half his manhood gone if ever she might prevail over him so as to procure from his mouth an assent to that nile proposition it would be now  and after all that nile proposition was the best one now before her  she did not quite like the idea of starting off across the great desert without any lady and was not sure that she was prepared to be fallen in love with by m delabordeau even if there should ultimately be any readiness on the part of that gentleman to perform the role of lover  with mr ingram the matter was different nor was she so diffident of her own charms as to think it altogether impossible that she might succeed in the teeth of that little chit fanny damer  that mr ingram would join the party up the nile she had very little doubt and then there would be one place left for her  she would thus at any rate become commingled with a most respectable family who might be of material service to her  thus actuated she commenced an earnest attack upon mr damer  stupendous she said again for she was fond of repeating favourite words  what a wondrous race must have been those egyptian kings of old  i dare say they were said mr damer wiping his brow as he sat upon a large loose stone a fragment lying on the flat top of the pyramid one of those stones with which the complete apex was once made or was once about to be made  a magnificent race so gigantic in their conceptions  their ideas altogether overwhelm us poor insignificant latterday mortals  they built these vast pyramids but for us it is task enough to climb to their top  quite enough ejaculated mr damer  but mr damer would not always remain weak and out of breath and it was absolutely necessary for miss dawkins to hurry away from cheops and his tomb to thebes and karnac  after seeing this it is impossible for any one with a spark of imagination to leave egypt without going farther afield  mr damer merely wiped his brow and grunted  this miss dawkins took as a signal of weakness and went on with her task perseveringly  for myself i have resolved to go up at any rate as far as asouan and the first cataract  i had thought of acceding to the wishes of a party who are going across the great desert by mount sinai to jerusalem but the kindness of yourself and mrs damer is so great and the prospect of joining in your boat is so pleasurable that i have made up my mind to accept your very kind offer  this it will be acknowledged was bold on the part of miss dawkins but what will not audacity effect  to use the slang of modern language cheek carries everything nowadays  and whatever may have been miss dawkinss deficiencies in this virtue she was not deficient  i have made up my mind to accept your very kind offer she said shining on mr damer with her blandest smile  what was a stout breathless perspiring middleaged gentleman to do under such circumstances  mr damer was a man who in most matters had his own way  that his wife should have given such an invitation without consulting him was he knew quite impossible  she would as soon have thought of asking all those arab guides to accompany them nor was it to be thought of that he should allow himself to be kidnapped into such an arrangement by the impudence of any miss dawkins  but there was he felt a difficulty in answering such a proposition from a young lady with a direct negative especially while he was so scant of breath  so he wiped his brow again and looked at her  but i can only agree to this on one understanding continued miss dawkins and that is that i am allowed to defray my own full share of the expense of the journey  upon hearing this mr damer thought that he saw his way out of the wood  wherever i go miss dawkins i am always the paymaster myself and this he contrived to say with some sternness palpitating though he still was and the sternness which was deficient in his voice he endeavoured to put into his countenance  but he did not know miss dawkins  oh mr damer she said and as she spoke her smile became almost blander than it was before oh mr damer i could not think of suffering you to be so liberal i could not indeed  but i shall be quite content that you should pay everything and let me settle with you in one sum afterwards  mr damers breath was now rather more under his own command  i am afraid miss dawkins he said that mrs damers weak state of health will not admit of such an arrangement  what about the paying  not only as to that but we are a family party miss dawkins and great as would be the benefit of your society to all of us in mrs damers present state of health i am afraidin short you would not find it agreeableand therefore this he added seeing that she was still about to perseverei fear that we must forego the advantage you offer  and then looking into his face miss dawkins did perceive that even her audacity would not prevail  oh very well she said and moving from the stone on which she had been sitting she walked off carrying her head very high to a corner of the pyramid from which she could look forth alone towards the sands of libya  in the mean time another little overture was being made on the top of the same pyramidan overture which was not received quite in the same spirit  while mr damer was recovering his breath for the sake of answering miss dawkins miss damer had walked to the further corner of the square platform on which they were placed and there sat herself down with her face turned towards cairo  perhaps it was not singular that mr ingram should have followed her  this would have been very well if a dozen arabs had not also followed them  but as this was the case mr ingram had to play his game under some difficulty  he had no sooner seated himself beside her than they came and stood directly in front of the seat shutting out the view and by no means improving the fragrance of the air around them  and this then miss damer will be our last excursion together he said in his tenderest softest tone  de good englishman will gib de poor arab one little backsheish said an arab putting out his hand and shaking mr ingrams shoulder  yes yes yes him gib backsheish said another  him berry good man said a third putting up his filthy hand and touching mr ingrams face  and young lady berry good too she give backsheish to poor arab  yes said a fourth preparing to take a similar liberty with miss damer  this was too much for mr ingram  he had already used very positive language in his endeavour to assure his tormentors that they would not get a piastre from him  but this only changed their soft persuasions into threats  upon hearing which and upon seeing what the man attempted to do in his endeavour to get money from miss damer he raised his stick and struck first one and then the other as violently as he could upon their heads  any ordinary civilised men would have been stunned by such blows for they fell on the bare foreheads of the arabs but the objects of the americans wrath merely skulked away and the others convinced by the only arguments which they understood followed in pursuit of victims who might be less pugnacious  it is hard for a man to be at once tender and pugnaciousto be sentimental while he is putting forth his physical strength with all the violence in his power  it is difficult also for him to be gentle instantly after having been in a rage  so he changed his tactics at the moment and came to the point at once in a manner befitting his present state of mind  those vile wretches have put me in such a heat he said that i hardly know what i am saying  but the fact is this miss damer i cannot leave cairo without knowing  you understand what i mean miss damer  indeed i do not mr ingram except that i am afraid you mean nonsense  yes you do you know that i love you  i am sure you must know it at any rate you know it now  mr ingram you should not talk in such a way  why should i not  but the truth is fanny i can talk in no other way  i do love you dearly  can you love me well enough to go and be my wife in a country far away from your own  before she left the top of the pyramid fanny damer had said that she would try  mr ingram was now a proud and happy man and seemed to think the steps of the pyramid too small for his elastic energy  but fanny feared that her troubles were to come  there was papathat terrible bugbear on all such occasions  what would papa say  she was sure her papa would not allow her to marry and go so far away from her own family and country  for herself she liked the americansalways had liked them so she saidwould desire nothing better than to live among them  but papa  and fanny sighed as she felt that all the recognised miseries of a young lady in love were about to fall upon her  nevertheless at her lovers instance she promised and declared in twenty different loving phrases that nothing on earth should ever make her false to her love or to her lover  fanny where are you  why are you not ready to come down shouted mr damer not in the best of tempers  he felt that he had almost been unkind to an unprotected female and his heart misgave him  and yet it would have misgiven him more had he allowed himself to be entrapped by miss dawkins  i am quite ready papa said fanny running up to himfor it may be understood that there is quite room enough for a young lady to run on the top of the pyramid  i am sure i dont know where you have been all the time said mr damer and where are those two boys  fanny pointed to the top of the other pyramid and there they were conspicuous with their red caps  and m delabordeau  oh he has gone down i thinkno he is there with miss dawkins and in truth miss dawkins was leaning on his arm most affectionately as she stooped over and looked down upon the ruins below her  and where is that fellow ingram said mr damer looking about him he is always out of the way when hes wanted  to this fanny said nothing  why should she  she was not mr ingrams keeper  and then they all descended each again with his proper number of arabs to hurry and embarrass him and they found mr damer at the bottom like a piece of sugar covered with flies  she was heard to declare afterwards that she would not go to the pyramids again not if they were to be given to her for herself as ornaments for her garden  the picnic lunch among the big stones at the foot of the pyramid was not a very gay affair  miss dawkins talked more than any one else being determined to show that she bore her defeat gallantly  her conversation however was chiefly addressed to m delabordeau and he seemed to think more of his cold chicken and ham than he did of her wit and attention  fanny hardly spoke a word  there was her father before her and she could not eat much less talk as she thought of all that she would have to go through  what would he say to the idea of having an american for a soninlaw  nor was mr ingram very lively  a young man when he has been just accepted never is so  his happiness under the present circumstances was no doubt intense but it was of a silent nature  and then the interior of the building had to be visited  to tell the truth none of the party would have cared to perform this feat had it not been for the honour of the thing  to have come from paris new york or london to the pyramids and then not to have visited the very tomb of cheops would have shown on the part of all of them an indifference to subjects of interest which would have been altogether fatal to their character as travellers  and so a party for the interior was made up  miss damer when she saw the aperture through which it was expected that she should descend at once declared for staying with her mother  miss dawkins however was enthusiastic for the journey  persons with so very little command over their nerves might really as well stay at home she said to mr ingram who glowered at her dreadfully for expressing such an opinion about his fanny  this entrance into the pyramids is a terrible task which should be undertaken by no lady  those who perform it have to creep down and then to be dragged up through infinite dirt foul smells and bad air and when they have done it they see nothing  but they do earn the gratification of saying that they have been inside a pyramid  well ive done that once said mr damer coming out and i do not think that any one will catch me doing it again  i never was in such a filthy place in my life  oh fanny i am so glad you did not go i am sure it is not fit for ladies said poor mrs damer forgetful of her friend miss dawkins  i should have been ashamed of myself said miss dawkins bristling up and throwing back her head as she stood if i had allowed any consideration to have prevented my visiting such a spot  if it be not improper for men to go there how can it be improper for women  i did not say improper my dear said mrs damer apologetically  and as for the fatigue what can a woman be worth who is afraid to encounter as much as i have now gone through for the sake of visiting the last restingplace of such a king as cheops  and miss dawkins as she pronounced the last words looked round her with disdain upon poor fanny damer  but i meant the dirt said mrs damer  dirt ejaculated miss dawkins and then walked away  why should she now submit her high tone of feeling to the damers or why care longer for their good opinion  therefore she scattered contempt around her as she ejaculated the last word dirt  and then the return home  i know i shall never get there said mrs damer looking piteously up into her husbands face  nonsense my dear nonsense you must get there  mrs damer groaned and acknowledged in her heart that she musteither dead or alive  and jefferson said fanny whisperingfor there had been a moment since their descent in which she had been instructed to call him by his christian namenever mind talking to me going home  i will ride by mamma  do you go with papa and put him in good humour and it he says anything about the lords and the bishops dont you contradict him you know  what will not a man do for love  mr ingram promised  and in this way they started the two boys led the van then came mr damer and mr ingram unusually and unpatriotically acquiescent as to englands aristocratic propensities then miss dawkins riding alas alone after her m delabordeau also alonethe ungallant frenchman and the rear was brought up by mrs damer and her daughter flanked on each side by a dragoman with a third dragoman behind them  and in this order they went back to cairo riding their donkeys and crossing the ferry solemnly and for the most part silently  mr ingram did talk as he had an important object in viewthat of putting mr damer into a good humour  in this he succeeded so well that by the time they had remounted after crossing the nile mr damer opened his heart to his companion on the subject that was troubling him and told him all about miss dawkins  i dont see why we should have a companion that we dont like for eight or ten weeks merely because it seems rude to refuse a lady  indeed i agree with you said mr ingram i should call it weak minded to give way in such a case  my daughter does not like her at all continued mr damer  nor would she be a nice companion for miss damer not according to my way of thinking said mr ingram  and as to my having asked her or mrs damer having asked her  why god bless my soul it is pure invention on the womans part  ha ha ha laughed mr ingram i must say she plays her game well but then she is an old soldier and has the benefit of experience what would miss dawkins have said had she known that mr ingram called her an old soldier  i dont like the kind of thing at all said mr damer who was very serious upon the subject  you see the position in which i am placed i am forced to be very rude or  i dont call it rude at all  disobliging then or else i must have all my comfort invaded and pleasure destroyed by by by  and mr damer paused being at a loss for an appropriate name for miss dawkins  by an unprotected female suggested mr ingram  yes just so  i am as fond of pleasant company as anybody but then i like to choose it myself  so do i said mr ingram thinking of his own choice  now ingram if you would join us we should be delighted  upon my word sir the offer is too flattering said ingram hesitatingly for he felt that he could not undertake such a journey until mr damer knew on what terms he stood with fanny  you are a terrible democrat said mr damer laughing but then on that matter you know we could agree to differ  exactly so said mr ingram who had not collected his thoughts or made up his mind as to what he had better say and do on the spur of the moment  well what do you say to it said mr damer encouragingly  but ingram paused before he answered  for heavens sake my dear fellow dont have the slightest hesitation in refusing if you dont like the plan  the fact is mr damer i should like it too well  like it too well  yes sir and i may as well tell you now as later  i had intended this evening to have asked for your permission to address your daughter  god bless my soul said mr damer looking as though a totally new idea had now been opened to him  and under these circumstances i will now wait and see whether or no you will renew your offer  god bless my soul said mr damer again  it often does strike an old gentleman as very odd that any man should fall in love with his daughter whom he has not ceased to look upon as a child  the case is generally quite different with mothers  they seem to think that every young man must fall in love with their girls  and have you said anything to fanny about this asked mr damer  yes sir i have her permission to speak to you  god bless my soul said mr damer and by this time they had arrived at shepheards hotel  oh mamma said fanny as soon as she found herself alone with her mother that evening i have something that i must tell you  oh fanny dont tell me anything tonight for i am a great deal too tired to listen  but oh mamma prayyou must listen to this indeed you must  and fanny knelt down at her mothers knee and looked beseechingly up into her face  what is it fanny  you know that all my bones are sore and i am so tired that i am almost dead  mamma mr ingram has  has what my dear has he done anything wrong  no mamma  but he hashe has proposed to me  and fanny bursting into tears hid her face in her mothers lap  and thus the story was told on both sides of the house  on the next day as a matter of course all the difficulties and dangers of such a marriage as that which was now projected were insisted on by both father and mother  it was improper it would cause a severing of the family not to be thought of it would be an alliance of a dangerous nature and not at all calculated to insure happiness and in short it was impossible  on that day therefore they all went to bed very unhappy  but on the next day as was also a matter of course seeing that there were no pecuniary difficulties the mother and father were talked over and mr ingram was accepted as a soninlaw  it need hardly be said that the offer of a place in mr damers boat was again made and that on this occasion it was accepted without hesitation  there was an american protestant clergyman resident in cairo with whom among other persons miss dawkins had become acquainted  upon this gentleman or upon his wife miss dawkins called a few days after the journey to the pyramid and finding him in his study thus performed her duty to her neighbour   you know your countryman mr ingram i think said she  oh yes very intimately  if you have any regard for him mr burton such was the gentlemans name i think you should put him on his guard  on his guard against what said mr burton with a serious air for there was something serious in the threat of impending misfortune as conveyed by miss dawkins  why said she those damers i fear are dangerous people  do you mean that they will borrow money of him  oh no not that exactly but they are clearly setting their cap at him  setting their cap at him  yes there is a daughter you know a little chit of a thing and i fear mr ingram may be caught before he knows where he is  it would be such a pity you know  he is going up the river with them i hear that in his place is very foolish  they asked me but i positively refused  mr burton remarked that in such a matter as that mr ingram would be perfectly able to take care of himself  well perhaps so but seeing what was going on i thought it my duty to tell you  and so miss dawkins took her leave  mr ingram did go up the nile with the damers as did an old friend of the damers who arrived from england  and a very pleasant trip they had of it  and as far as the present historian knows the two lovers were shortly afterwards married in england  poor miss dawkins was left in cairo for some time on her beam ends but she was one of those who are not easily vanquished  after an interval of ten days she made acquaintance with an irish familyhaving utterly failed in moving the hard heart of m delabordeauand with these she proceeded to constantinople  they consisted of two brothers and a sister and were therefore very convenient for matrimonial purposes  but nevertheless when i last heard of miss dawkins she was still an unprotected female
