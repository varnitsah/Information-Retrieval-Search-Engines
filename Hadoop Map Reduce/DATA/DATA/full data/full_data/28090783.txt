robert louis stevenson  vii  the riviera againmarseilles and hy√àres  october 1882august 1884   in the two years and odd months since his return from california stevenson had made no solid gain of health his winters and especially his second winter at davos had seemed to do him much temporary good but during the summers in scotland he had lost as much as he had gained or more loving the mediterranean shores of france from of old he now made up his mind to try them once again  as the ways and restrictions of a settled invalid were repugnant to stevensons character and instincts so were the life and society of a regular invalid station depressing and uncongenial to him he determined accordingly to avoid settling in one of these and hoped to find a suitable climate and habitation that should be near though not in some centre of the active and ordinary life of man with accessible markets libraries and other resources in september 1882 he started with his cousin mr r a m stevenson in search of a new home and thought first of trying the languedoc coast a region new to him at montpellier he was laid up again with a bad bout of his lung troubles and the doctor not recommending him to stay returned to marseilles here he was rejoined by his wife and after a few days exploration in the neighbourhood they lighted on what seemed exactly the domicile they wanted this was a roomy and attractive enough house and garden called the campagne defli near the manufacturing suburb of st marcel in a sheltered position in full view of the shapely coastward hills by the third week in october they were installed and in eager hopes of pleasant days to come and a return to working health these hopes were not realised week after week went on and the hemorrhages and fits of fever and exhaustion did not diminish work except occasional verses and a part of the story called the treasure of franchard would not flow and the time had to be whiled away with games of patience and other resources of the sick man nearly two months were thus passed during the whole of one of them stevenson had not been able to go beyond the garden and by christmas he had to face the fact that the air of the place was tainted an epidemic of fever due to some defect of drainage broke out and it became clear that this could be no home for stevenson accordingly at his wifes instance though having scarce the strength to travel he left suddenly for nice she staying behind to pack their chattels and wind up their affairs and responsibilities as well as might be various misadventures miscarriages of telegrams journeys taken at cross purposes and the like making existence uncomfortably dramatic at the moment caused the couple to believe for a while that they had fairly lost each other mrs stevenson allows me to print a letter from herself to mr j a symonds vividly relating these predicaments see p 11 foll at last in the course of january they came safely together at marseilles and next made a few weeks stay at nice where stevensons health quickly mended thence they returned as far as hy√®res staying here through the greater part of february at the h√¥tel des √éles dor and finding the place to their liking they cast about once more for a restingplace and were this time successful  the house chosen by the stevensons at hy√®res was not near the sea but inland on the road above the old town and beneath the ruins of the castle the chalet la solitude it was called a cramped but habitable cottage built in the swiss manner with a pleasant strip of garden and a view and situation hardly to be bettered here he and his family lived for the next sixteen months march 1883 to july 1884 to the first part of this period he often afterwards referred as the happiest time of his life his malady remained quiescent enough to afford at least to his own buoyant spirit a strong hope of ultimate recovery he delighted in his surroundings and realised for the first time the joys of a true home of his own the last shadow of a cloud between himself and his parents had long passed away and towards his father now in declining health and often suffering from moods of constitutional depression the son begins on his part to assume how touchingly and tenderly will be seen from the following letters a quasipaternal attitude of encouragement and monition at the same time his work on the completion of the silverado squatters on prince otto the childs garden of verses for which his own name was penny whistles on the black arrow designated hereinafter on account of its old english dialect as tushery and other undertakings prospered well in the autumn the publication of treasure island in book form brought with it the first breath of popular applause the reader will see how modest a price stevenson was content nay delighted to receive for this classic it was two or three years yet before he could earn enough to support himself and his family by literature a thing he had always been earnestly bent on doing regarding it as the only justification for his chosen way of life in the meantime it must be understood whatever help he needed from his father was from the hour of his marriage always amply and ungrudgingly given  in september of the same year 1883 stevenson had felt deeply the death of his old friend james walter ferrier see the essay old mortality and the references in the following letters but still his health held out fairly until in january 1884 on a visit to nice he was unexpectedly prostrated anew by an acute congestion of the internal organs which for the time being brought him to deaths door returning to his home his recovery had been only partial when after four months may 1884 a recurrence of violent hemorrhages from the lung once more prostrated him completely soon after which he quitted hy√®res and the epidemic of cholera which broke out there the same summer prevented all thoughts of his return  the hy√®res time both during the happy and hardworking months of marchdecember 1883 and the semiconvalescence of februarymay 1884 was a prolific one in the way of correspondence and there is perhaps no period of his life when his letters reflect so fully the variety of his moods and the eagerness of his occupations     to the editor of the new york tribune      at marseilles while waiting to occupy the house which he had leased    in the suburbs of that city stevenson learned that his old friend    and kind adviser mr james payn with whom he had been intimate as    subeditor of the cornhill magazine under mr leslie stephen in the    70s had been inadvertently represented in the columns of the new    york tribune as a plagiarist of r l s in order to put matters    right he at once sent the following letter both to the tribune and    to the london athen√¶um       terminus hotel marseilles october 16 1882  sirit has come to my ears that you have lent the authority of your columns to an error  more than half in pleasantryand i now think the pleasantry illjudgedi complained in a note to my new arabian nights that some one who shall remain nameless for me had borrowed the idea of a story from one of mine as if i had not borrowed the ideas of the half of my own as if any one who had written a story ill had a right to complain of any other who should have written it better i am indeed thoroughly ashamed of the note and of the principle which it implies  but it is no mere abstract penitence which leads me to beg a corner of your paperit is the desire to defend the honour of a man of letters equally known in america and england of a man who could afford to lend to me and yet be none the poorer and who if he would so far condescend has my free permission to borrow from me all that he can find worth borrowing  indeed sir i am doubly surprised at your correspondents error that james payn should have borrowed from me is already a strange conception the author of lost sir massingberd and by proxy may be trusted to invent his own stories the author of a grape from a thorn knows enough in his own right of the humorous and pathetic sides of human nature  but what is far more monstrouswhat argues total ignorance of the man in questionis the idea that james payn could ever have transgressed the limits of professional propriety i may tell his thousands of readers on your side of the atlantic that there breathes no man of letters more inspired by kindness and generosity to his brethren of the profession and to put an end to any possibility of error i may be allowed to add that i often have recourse and that i had recourse once more but a few weeks ago to the valuable practical help which he makes it his pleasure to extend to younger men  i send a duplicate of this letter to a london weekly for the mistake first set forth in your columns has already reached england and my wanderings have made me perhaps last of the persons interested to hear a

thinking to try the ringstown one but far from being busy i have been steadily ill i was but three or four days in london waiting till one of my friends was able to accompany me and had neither time nor health to see anybody but some publisher people since then i have been worse and better better and worse but never able to do any work and for a large part of the time forbidden to write and even to play patience that last of civilised amusements in brief i have been the sheer hulk to a degree almost outside of my experience and i desire all my friends to forgive me my sins of omission this while back i only wish you were the only one to whom i owe a letter or many letters  but you see at least you had done nothing to offend me and i dare say you will let me have a note from time to time

and the delicacies suitable to my invalid condition cooked in copper and the other ridiculous and revolting yarns pray regard it as a spectral illusion and pass by     mrs r l stevenson to john addington symonds      i intercalate here mrs stevensons extremely vivid and    characteristic account of the weird misadventures that befell the    pair during their retreat from st marcel in search of a healthier    home       campagne defli st marcel january 1883  my dear mr symondswhat must you think of us i hardly dare write to you what do you do when people to whom you have been the dearest of friends requite you by acting like fiends i do hope you heap coals of fire on their heads in the good old christian sense  louis has been very ill again i hasten to say that he is now better but i thought at one time he would never be better again he had continual hemorrhages and became so weak that he was twice insensible in one day and was for a long time like one dead at the worst fever broke out in this village typhus i think and all day the deathbells rang and we could hear the chanting whilst the wretched villagers carried about their dead lying bare to the sun on their coffinlids so spreading the contagion through the streets the evening of the day when louis was so long insensible the weather changed becoming very clear and fine and greatly refreshing and reviving him then i said if it held good he should start in the morning for nice and try what a change might do just at that time there was not money enough for the two of us so he had to start alone though i expected soon to be able to follow him during the night a peasantman died in a house in our garden and in the morning the corpse hideously swollen in the stomach was lying on its coffinlid at our gates fortunately it was taken away just before louis went and he didnt see it nor hear anything about it until afterwards i had been back and forth all the morning from the door to the gates and from the gates to the door in an agony lest louis should have to pass it on his way out  i was to have a despatch from toulon where louis was to pass the night two hours from st marcel and another from nice some few hours further the next day i waited one two three four days and no word came neither telegram nor letter the evening of the fourth day i went to marseilles and telegraphed to the toulon and nice stations and to the bureau of police i had been pouring out letters to every place i could think of the people at marseilles were very kind and advised me to take no further steps to find my husband he was certainly dead they said it was plain that he stopped at some little station on the road speechless and dying and it was now too late to do anything i had much better return at once to my friends eet ofen appens so said the secretary and oh yes all right very well added a swiss in a sympathetic voice i waited all night at marseilles and got no answer all the next day and got no answer then i went back to st marcel and there was nothing there at eight i started on the train with lloyd who had come for his holidays but it only took us to toulon where again i telegraphed at last i got an answer the next day at noon i waited at toulon for the train i had reason to believe louis travelled by intending to stop at every station and inquire for him until i got to nice imagine what those days were to me i never received any of the letters louis had written to me and he was reading the first he had received from me when i knocked at his door a week afterwards i had an answer from the police louis was much better the change and the doctor who seems very clever have done wonderful things for him it was during this first day of waiting that i received your letter there was a vague comfort in it like a hand offered in the darkness but i did not read it until long after  we have had many other wild misadventures louis has twice started actually from nice under a misapprehension at this moment i believe him to be at marseilles stopping at the hotel du petit louvre i am supposed to be packing here at st marcel afterwards we are to go somewhere perhaps to the lake of geneva my nerves were so shattered by the terrible suspense i endured that memorable week that i have not been fit to do much when i was returning from nice a dreadful old man with a fat wife and a weak granddaughter sat opposite me and plied me with the most extraordinary questions he began by asking if lloyd was any connection of mine and ended i believe by asking my mothers maiden name another of the questions he put to me was where louis wished to be buried and whether i could afford to have him embalmed when he died when the train stopped the only other passenger a quiet man in a corner who looked several times as if he wished to interfere and stop the old man but was too shy came to me and said that he knew sidney colvin and he knew you and that you were both friends of louis and that his name was basil hammond1 and he wished to stay on a day in marseilles and help me work off my affairs i accepted his offer with heartfelt thanks i was extremely ill next day but we two went about and arranged about giving up this house and what compensation and did some things that i could not have managed alone my french is useful only in domestic economy and even that i fear is very curious and much of it patois wasnt that a good fellow and a kind fellowi cannot tell you how grateful i am words are such feeble thingsat least for that purpose for anger justifiable wrath they are all too forcible it was very bad of me not to write to you we talked of you so often and thought of you so much and i always saidnow i will writeand then somehow i could not       fanny v de g stevenson     to charles baxter      after his christmas flight to marseilles and thence to nice    stevenson began to mend quickly in this letter to mr baxter he    acknowledges the receipt of a specimen proof set up for their    private amusement of brashiana the series of burlesque sonnets he    had written at davos in memory of the edinburgh publican already    mentioned it should be explained that in their correspondence    stevenson and mr baxter were accustomed to keep up an old play of    their student days by merging their identities in those of two    fictitious personages

further but i am convinced will not and anyway i fear not the consequences  the weather is incredible my heart sings my health satisfies even my wife i did jolly well right to come after all and she now admits it for she broke down as i knew she would and i from here without passing a night at the defli though with a cruel effusion of coachhires took up the wondrous tale and steered the ship

verses referred to in the following are those of the childs    garden       nice february 1883  my dear cummyyou must think and quite justly that i am one of the meanest rogues in creation but though i do not write which is a thing i hate it by no means follows that people are out of my mind it is natural that i should always think more or less about you and still more natural that i should think of you when i went back to nice but the real reason why you have been more in my mind than usual is because of some little verses that i have been writing and that i mean to make a book of and the real reason of this letter although i ought to have written to you anyway is that i have just seen that the book in question must be dedicated to    alison cunningham  the only person who will really understand it i dont know when it may be ready for it has to be illustrated but i hope in the meantime you may like the idea of what is to be and when the time comes i shall try to make the dedication as pretty as i can make it of course this is only a flourish like taking off ones hat but still a person who has taken the trouble to write things does not dedicate them to any one without meaning it and you must just try to take this dedication in place of a great many things that i might have said and that i ought to have done to prove that i am not altogether unconscious of the great debt of gratitude i owe you this little book which is all about my childhood should indeed go to no other person but you who did so much to make that childhood happy  do you know we came very near sending for you this winter if we had not had news that you were ill too i almost believe we should have done so we were so much in trouble  i am now very well but my wife has had a very very bad spell through overwork and anxiety when i was lost i suppose you heard of that she sends you her love and hopes you will write to her though she no more than i deserves it she would add a word herself but she is too played outi am ever your old boy       r l s     to w e henley      stevenson was by this time beginning to send home some of the ms of    the childs garden the title of which had not yet been settled    the pieces as first numbered are in a different order from that    afterwards adopted but the reader will easily identify the    references       nice march 1883  my dear ladthis is to announce to you the ms of nursery verses now numbering xlviii pieces or 599 verses which of course one might augment ad infinitum  but here is my notion to make all clear  i do not want a big ugly quarto my soul sickens at the look of a quarto i want a refined octavo not largenot larger than the donkey book at any price  i think the full page might hold four verses of four lines that is to say counting their blanks at two of twentytwo lines in height the first page of each number would only hold two verses or ten lines the title being low down at this rate we should have seventyeight or eighty pages of letterpress  the designs should not be in the text but facing the poem so that if the artist liked he might give two pages of design to every poem that turned the leaf ie longer than eight lines ie to twentyeight out of the fortysix i should say he would not use this privilege  above five times and some he might scorn to illustrate at all so we may say fifty drawings i shall come to the drawings next  but now you see my book of the thickness since the drawings count two pages of 180 pages and since the paper will perhaps be thicker of near two hundred by bulk it is bound in a quiet green with the words in thin gilt its shape is a slender tall octavo and it sells for the publishers fancy and it will be a darling to look at in short it would be like one of the original heine books in type and spacing  now for the pictures i take another sheet and begin to jot notes for them when my imagination serves i will run through the book writing when i have an idea there i have jotted enough to give the artist a notion of course i dont do more than contribute ideas but i will be happy to help in any and every way i may as well add another idea when the artist finds nothing much to illustrate a good drawing of any object mentioned in the text were it only a loaf of bread or a candlestick is a most delightful thing to a young child i remember this keenly  of course if the artist insists on a larger form i must i suppose bow my head but my idea i am convinced is the best and would make the book truly not fashionably pretty  i forgot to mention that i shall have a dedication i am going to dedicate em to cummy it will please her and lighten a little my burthen of ingratitude a low affair is the muse business  i will add no more to this lest you should want to communicate with the artist try another sheet i wonder how many ill keep wandering to  o i forgot as for the title i think nursery verses the best poetry is not the strong point of the text and i shrink from any title that might seem to claim that quality otherwise we might have nursery muses or new songs of innocence but that were a blasphemy or rimes of innocence the last not bad oran

march 17 1883  dear siryour undated favour from eastbourne came to hand in course of post and i now hasten to acknowledge its receipt we must ask you in future for the convenience of our business arrangements to struggle with and tread below your feet this most unsatisfactory and uncommercial habit our mr cassandra is better our mr wogg expresses himself dissatisfied with our new place of business when left alone in the front shop he bawled like a parrot it is supposed the offices are haunted  to turn to the matter of your letter your remarks on great expectations are very good we have both reread it this winter and i in a manner twice the object being a play the play in its rough outline i now see and it is extraordinary how much of dickens had to be discarded as unhuman impossible and ineffective all that really remains is the loan of a file but from a grownup young man who knows what he was doing and to a convict who although he does not know it is his fatherthe father knows it is his son and the fact of the convictfathers return and disclosure of himself to the son whom he has made rich everything else has been thrown aside and the position has had to be explained by a prologue which is pretty strong i have great hopes of this piece which is very amiable and in places very strong indeed but it was curious how dickens had to be rolled away he had made his story turn on such improbabilities such fantastic trifles not on a good human basis such as i recognised you are right about the casts they were a capital idea a good description of them at first and then afterwards say second for the lawyer to have illustrated points out of the history of the originals dusting the particular bustthat was all the development the thing would bear dickens killed them the only really well executed scenes are the riverside ones the escape in particular is excellent and i may add the capture of the two convicts at the beginning miss havisham is probably the worst thing in human fiction but wemmick i like and i like trabbs boy and mr wopsle as hamlet is splendid  the weather here is greatly improved and i hope in three days to be in the chalet that is if i get some money to float me there  i hope you are all right again and will keep better the month of march is past its mid career it must soon begin to turn toward the lamb here it has already begun to do so and i hope milder weather will pick you up wogg has eaten a forpet of rice and milk his beard is streaming his eyes wild i am besieged by demands of work from america  the ¬£50 has just arrived many

weeks i wrote and revised and only finished iv chapters last week i have just drafted straight ahead and i have just finished chapter xi it will want a heap of oversight and much will not stand but the pace is good about 28 cornhill pp drafted in seven days and almost all of it dialogueindeed i may say all for i have dismissed the rest very summarily in the draft one can always tickle at that at the same rate the draft should be finished in ten days more and then i shall have the pleasure of beginning again at the beginning ah damned job i have no idea whether or not otto will be good it is all pitched pretty high and stilted almost like the arabs at that but of course there is lovemaking in otto and indeed a good deal of it i sometimes feel very weary but the thing travelsand i like it

when they are fifty they shall out on the world i have not written a letter for a cruel time i have been and am so busy drafting a long story for me i mean about a hundred cornhill pages or say about as long as the donkey book prince otto it is called and is at the present hour a sore burthen but a hopeful if i had him all drafted i should whistle and sing but no then ill have to rewrite him and then there will be the publishers alas but some time or other i shall whistle and sing i make no doubt  i am going to make a fortune it has not yet begun for i am not yet clear of debt but as soon as i can i begin upon the fortune i shall begin it with a halfpenny and it shall end with horses and yachts and all the fun of the fair this is the first real grey hair in my character rapacity has begun to show the greed of the protuberant guttler well doubtless when the hour strikes we must all guttle and protube but it comes hard on one who was always so willowslender and as careless as the daisies  truly i am in excellent spirits i have crushed through a financial crisis fanny is much better i am in excellent health and work from four to five hours a dayfrom one to two above my average that is

recapitulate a phrase of three members is the outside of my syntax  first i like the rover better than any of your other verse i believe you are right and can make stories in verse the last two stanzas and one or two in the beginningbut the two last above alli thought excellent i suggest a pursuit of the vein if you want a good story to treat get the memoirs of the chevalier johnstone and do his passage of the tay it would be excellent the dinner in the field the woman he has to follow the dragoons the timid boatmen the brave lasses it would go like a charm look at it and you will say you owe me one  second gilder asking me for fiction i suddenly took a great resolve and have packed off to him my new work the silverado squatters i do not for a moment suppose he will take it but pray say all the good words you can for it i should be awfully glad to get it taken but if it does not mean dibbs at once i shall be ruined for life pray write soon and beg gilder your prettiest for a poor

was disgusted to hear my father was not so well i have a most troubled existence of work and business but the work goes well which is the great affair i meant to have written a most delightful letter too tired however and must stop perhaps ill find time to add to it ere post  i have returned refreshed from eating but have little time as lloyd will go soon with the letters on his way to his tutor louis robert  with whom he learns latin in french and french i suppose in latin which seems to me a capital education he lloyd is a great bicycler already and has been long distances he is most newfangled over his instrument and does not willingly converse on other subjects  our lovely garden is a prey to snails i have gathered about a bushel which not having the heart to slay i steal forth withal and deposit near my neighbours garden wall as a case of casuistry this presents many points of interest i loathe the snails but from loathing to actual butchery trucidation of multitudes there is still a step that i hesitate to take what then to do with them my neighbours vineyard pardy it is a rich villa pleasuregarden of course if it were a peasants patch the snails i suppose would have to perish  the weather these last three days has been much better though it is still windy and unkind i keep splendidly well and am cruelly busy with mighty little time even for a walk and to write at

romance nor yet a comedy nor yet a romantic comedy but a kind of preparation of some of the elements of all three in a glass jar i think it is not without merit but i am not always on the level of my argument and some parts are false and much of the rest is thin it is more a triumph for myself than anything else for i see beyond it better stuff i have nine chapters ready or almost ready for press

 the new dictionary means of course the first instalments of the    great oxford dictionary of the english language edited by dr j a    h murray    la solitude hy√®res june 1883  dear ladi was delighted to hear the good news about  bravo he goes uphill fast let him beware of vanity and he will go higher let him be still discontented and let him if it might be see the merits and not the faults of his rivals and he may swarm at last to the topgallant there is no other way admiration is the only road to excellence and the critical spirit kills but envy and injustice are putrefaction on its feet  thus far the moralist the eager author now begs to know whether you may have got the other whistles and whether a fresh proof is to be taken also whether in that case the dedication should not be printed therewith bulk delights publishers original aphorism to be said sixteen times in succession as a test of sobriety  your wild and ravening commands were received but cannot be obeyed and anyway i do assure you i am getting better every day and if the weather would but turn i should soon be observed to walk in hornpipes truly i am on the mend i am still very careful i have the new dictionary a joy a thing of beauty andbulk i shall be raked i the mools before its finished that is the only pity but meanwhile i sing  i beg to inform you that i robert louis stevenson author of brashiana and other works am merely beginning to commence to prepare to make a first start at trying to understand my profession o the height and depth of novelty and worth in any art and o that i am privileged to swim and shoulder through such oceans could one get out of sight of landall in the blue alas not being anchored here in flesh and the bonds of logic being still about us  but what a great space and a great air there is in these small shallows where alone we venture and how new each sight squall calm or sunrise an art is a fine fortune a palace in a park a band of music health and physical beauty all but loveto any worthy practiser i sleep upon my art for a pillow i waken in my art i am unready for death because i hate to leave it i love my wife i do not know how much nor can nor shall unless i lost her but while i can conceive my being widowed i refuse the offering of life without my art i am not but in my art it is me i am the body of it merely  and yet i produce nothing am the author of brashiana and other works tiddyiddityas if the works one wrote were anything but prentices experiments dear reader i deceive you with husks the real works and all the pleasure are still mine and incommunicable after this break in my work beginning to return to it as from light sleep i wax exclamatory as you see    sursum corda   heave ahead   heres luck   art and blue heaven   april and gods larks   green reeds and the skyscattering river   a stately music   enter god       r l s   ay but you know until a man can write that enter god he has made no art none come let us take counsel together and make some     to trevor haddon      during the height of the proven√ßal summer for july and part of    august stevenson went with his wife to the baths of royat in    auvergne travelling necessarily by way of clermontferrand his    parents joined them at royat for part of their visit this and    possibly the next following letters were written during the trip the    news here referred to was that his correspondent had won a    scholarship at the slade school      la solitude hy√®res but just now writing from       clermontferrand july 5 1883  dear mr haddonyour note with its piece of excellent news duly reached me i am delighted to hear of your success selfishly so for it is pleasant to see that one whom i suppose i may call an admirer is no fool i wish you more and more prosperity and to be devoted to your art an art is the very gist of life it grows with you you will never weary of an art at which you fervently and superstitiously labour superstitiously i mean think more of it than it deserves be blind to its faults as with a wife or father forget the world in a technical trifle the world is very serious art is the cure of that and must be taken very lightly but to take art lightly you must first be stupidly owlishly in earnest over it when i made casimir say tiens at the end i made a blunder i thought it was what casimir would have said and i put it down as your question shows it should have been left out it was a patch of realism and an anticlimax beware of realism it is the devil tis one of the means of art and now they make it the end and such is the farce of the age in which a man lives that we all even those of us who most detest it sin by realism  notes for the student of any art  1 keep an intelligent eye upon all the others it is only by doing so that you come to see what art is art is the end common to them all it is none of the points by which they differ  2 in this age beware of realism  3 in your own art bow your head over technique think of technique when you rise and when you go to bed forget purposes in the meanwhile get to love technical processes to glory in technical successes get to see the world entirely through technical spectacles to see it entirely in terms of what you can do then when you have anything to say the language will be apt and copious  my health is better  i have no photograph just now but when i get one you shall have a copy it will not be like me sometimes i turn out a capital fresh bank clerk once i came out the image of runjeet singh again the treacherous sun has fixed me in the character of a travelling evangelist its quite a lottery but whatever the next venture proves to be soldier sailor tinker tailor you shall have a proof reciprocate the truth is i have no appearance a certain air of disreputability is the one constant character that my face presents the rest change like water but still i am lean and still disreputable  cling to your youth it is an artistic stock in trade dont give in that you are ageing and you wont age i have exactly the same faults and qualities still only a little duller greedier and better tempered a little less tolerant of pain and more tolerant of tedium the last is a great thing for life butquerya bad endowment for art  another note for the art student  4 see the good in other peoples work it will never be yours see the bad in your own and dont cry about it it will be there always try to use your faults at any rate use your knowledge of them and dont run your head against stone walls art is not like theology nothing is forced you have not to represent the world you have to represent only what you can represent with pleasure and effect and the only way to find out what that is is by technical exerciseyours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to jules simoneau        hy√®res or royat summer 1883  my dear friend simoneauit would be difficult to tell how glad i was to get your letter with your good news and kind remembrances it did my heart good to the bottom i shall never forget the good time we had together the many long talks the games of chess the flute on an occasion and the excellent food now i am in clover only my health a mere ruined temple the ivy grows along its shattered front otherwise i have no wish that is not fulfilled a beautiful large garden a fine view of plain sea and mountain a wife that suits me down to the ground and a barrel of good beaujolais to this i must add that my books grow steadily more popular and if i could only avoid illness i should be well to do for money as it is i keep pretty near the wind have i other means i doubt it i saw fran√ßois here and it was in some respects sad to see him pining in the ungenial life and not i think very well pleased with his relatives the young men it is true adored him but his niece tried to pump me about what money i had with an effrontery i was glad to disappoint how he spoke of you i need not tell you he is your true friend dear simoneau and your ears should have tingled when we met for we talked of little but yourself  the papers you speak about are past dates but i will send you a paper from time to time as soon as i am able to go out again we were both well pleased to hear of your marriage and both mrs stevenson and myself beg to be remembered with the kindest wishes to mrs simoneau i am glad you have done this all races are better away from their own country but i think you french improve the most of all at home i like you well enough but give me the frenchman abroad had you stayed at home you would probably have acted otherwise consult your consciousness and you will think as i do how about a law condemning the people of every country to be educated in another to change sons in short should we not gain all around would not the englishman unlearn hypocrisy would not the frenchman learn to put some heart into his friendships i name what strikes me as the two most obvious defects of the two nations the french might also learn to be a little less rapacious to women and the english to be a little more honest  indeed their merits and defects make a balance            the english                     the french   hypocrites                        free from hypocrisy   good stout reliable friends      incapable of friendship   dishonest to the root             fairly honest   fairly decent to women           rather indecent to women  there is my table not at all the usual one but yes i think you will agree with it and by travel each race can cure much of its defects and acquire much of the others virtues let us say that you and i are complete you are anyway i would not change a hair of you the americans hold the english faults dishonest and hypocrites perhaps not so strongly but still to the exclusion of others it is strange that such mean defects should be so hard to eradicate after a century of separation and so great an admixture of other blood  your stay in mexico must have been interesting indeed and it is natural you should be so keen against the church on this side we have a painful exhibition of the other side the librepenseur a mere priest without the sacraments the narrowest tyranny of intolerance popular and in fact a repetition in the xixth century of theological illfeeling minus the sermons we have speeches instead i met the other day one of the new lay schoolmasters of france a pleasant cultivated man and for some time listened to his ravings in short i said you are like louis quatorze you wish to drive out of france all who do not agree with you i thought he would protest not heoui monsieur was his answer and that is the cause of liberty and free thought but the race of man was born tyrannical doubtless adam beat eve and when all the rest are dead the last man will be found beating the last dog in the land of padre d r you see the old tyranny still active on its crutches in this land i begin to see the new a fat fellow out of leadingstrings and already killing flies  this letter drones along unprofitably enough let me put a period to my divagations write again soon and let me hear good news of you and i will try to be more quick of answer  and with the best wishes to yourself and all your family believe me your sincere friend       robert louis stevenson     to alison cunningham      the persons mentioned below in the third paragraph are cousins of the    writer and playmates of his childhood two of them christened lewis    like himself after their balfour grandfather had been nicknamed    after their birthplaces delhi and cramond to avoid confusion    mount chessie is a beautiful place near lasswade cummy has    described his delight when she cut whistles for him there out of a    planetree       hy√®res or royat summer 1883  my dear cummyyes i own i am a real bad correspondent and am as bad as can be in most directions  i have been adding some more poems to your book i wish they would look sharp about it but you see they are trying to find a good artist to make the illustrations without which no child would give a kick for it it will be quite a fine work i hope the dedication is a poem too and has been quite a long while written but i do not mean you to see it till you get the book keep the jelly for the last you know as you would often recommend in former days so now you can take your own medicine  i am very sorry to hear you have been so poorly i have been very well it used to be quite the other way used it not do you remember making the whistle at mount chessie i do not think it was my knife i believe it was yours but rhyme is a very great monarch and goes before honesty in these affairs at least do you remember at warriston one autumn sunday when the beech nuts were on the ground seeing heaven open i would like to make a rhyme of that but cannot  is it not strange to think of all the changes bob cramond delhi minnie and henrietta all married and fathers and mothers and your humble servant just the one point better off and such a little while ago all children together the time goes swift and wonderfully even and if we are no worse than we are we should be grateful to the power that guides us for more than a generation i have now been to the fore in this rough world and been most tenderly helped and done cruelly wrong and yet escaped and here i am still the worse for wear but with some fight in me still and not unthankfulno surely not unthankful or i were then the worst of human things  my little dog is a very much better child in every way both more loving and more amiable but he is not fond of strangers and is like most of his kind a great specious humbug  fanny has been ill but is much better again she now goes donkey rides with an old woman who compliments her on her french that old womanseventy oddis in a parlous spiritual state  pretty soon in the new sixpenny illustrated magazine woggs picture is to appear this is a great honour and the poor soul whose vanity would just explode if he could understand it will never be a bit the wiserwith much love in which fanny joins believe me your affectionate boy       robert louis stevenson     to edmund gosse      the reference is to mr gosses volume called seventeenth century    studies       hy√®res or royat summer 1883  my dear gossei have now leisurely read your volume pretty soon by the way you will receive one of mine  it is a pleasant instructive and scholarly volume the three best being quite out of sightcrashaw otway and etherege they are excellent i hesitate between them but perhaps crashaw is the most brilliant  your webster is not my webster nor your herrick my herrick on these matters we must fire a gun to leeward show our colours and go by argument is impossible they are two of my favourite authors herrick above all i suppose they are two of yours well januslike they do behold us two with diverse countenances few features are common to these different avatars and we can but agree to differ but still with gratitude to our entertainers like two guests at the same dinner one of whom takes clear and one white soup by my way of thinking neither of us need be wrong  the other papers are all interesting adequate clear and with a pleasant spice of the romantic it is a book you may be well pleased to have so finished and will do you much good the crashaw is capital capital i like the taste of it preface clean and dignified the handling throughout workmanlike with some four or five touches of preciosity which i regret  with my thanks for information entertainment and a pleasurable envy here and thereyours affectionately       r l s     to miss ferrier      soon after he was settled again at hy√®res stevenson had a great    shock in the death of one of the oldest and most intimate of his    friends of edinburgh days mr james walter ferrier see the essay    old mortality in memories and portraits it is in accordance    with the expressed wish of this gentlemans surviving sister that    publicity is given to the following letters       la solitude hy√®res sept 1883  my dear miss ferrierthey say walter is gone you who know how i have neglected him will conceive my remorse i had another letter written when i heard he was worse i promised myself to wake up for the last time alas too late  my dear walter set apart that terrible disease was in his right mind the best and gentlest gentleman god knows he would never intentionally hurt a soul  well he is done with his troubles and out of his long sickness and i dare say is glad to be at peace and out of the body which in him seemed the enemy of the fine and kind spirit he is the first friend i have ever lost and i find it difficult to say anything and fear to intrude upon your grief but i had to try to tell you how much i shared it  could you get any one to tell me particulars do not write yourself of coursei do not mean that but some one else       r l s     to w e henley        la solitude hy√®res september 19 1883  dear boyour letters vigorously cross you will ere this have received a note to coggie god knows what was in it  it is strange a little before the first word you sent meso latekindly late i know and feeli was thinking in my bed when i knew you i had six friendsbob i had by nature then came the good james walterwith all his failingsthe gentleman of the lot alas to sink so low alas to do so little but now thank god in his quiet rest next i found baxterwell do i remember telling walter i had unearthed a ws that i thought would doit was in the academy lane and he questioned me as to the signets qualifications fourth came simpson somewhere about the same time i began to get intimate with jenkin last came colvin then one black winter afternoon long leslie stephen in his velvet jacket met me in the spec by appointment took me over to the infirmary and in the crackling blighting gaslight showed me that old head whose excellent representation i see before me in the photograph now when a man has six friends to introduce a seventh is usually hopeless yet when you were presented you took to them and they to you upon the nail you must have been a fine fellow but what a singular fortune i must have had in my six friends that you should take to all i dont know if it is good latin most probably not but this is enscrolled before my eyes for walter tandem e nubibus in apricum properat rest i suppose i know was all that remained but o to look back to remember all the mirth all the kindness all the humorous limitations and loved defects of that character to think that he was young with me sharing that weatherbeaten fergussonian youth looking forward through the clouds to the sunburst and now clean gone from my path silentwell well this has been a strange awakening last night when i was alone in the house with the window open on the lovely still night i could have sworn he was in the room with me i could show you the spot and what was very curious i heard his rich laughter a thing i had not called to mind for i know not how long  i see his coral waistcoat studs that he wore the first time he dined in my house i see his attitude leaning back a little already with something of a portly air and laughing internally how i admired him and now in the west kirk  i am trying to write out this haunting bodily sense of absence besides what else should i write of  yes looking back i think of him as one who was good though sometimes clouded he was the only gentle one of all my friends save perhaps the other walter and he was certainly the only modest man among the lot he never gave himself away he kept back his secret there was always a gentle problem behind all dear dear what a wreck and yet how pleasant is the retrospect god doeth all things well though by what strange solemn and murderous contrivances  it is strange he was the only man i ever loved who did not habitually interrupt the fact draws my own portrait and it is one of the many reasons why i count myself honoured by his friendship a man like you had to like me you could not help yourself but ferrier was above me we were not equals his true self humoured and smiled paternally upon my failings even as i humoured and sorrowed over his  well first his mother then himself they are gone in their resting graves  when i come to think of it i do not know what i said to his sister and i fear to try again could you send her this there is too much both about yourself and me in it but that if you do not mind is but a mark of sincerity it would let her know how entirely in the mind of i suppose his oldest friend the good true ferrier obliterates the memory of the other who was only his lunatic brother  judge of this for me and do as you please anyway i will try to write to her again my last was some kind of scrawl that i could not see for crying this came upon me remember with terrible suddenness i was surprised by this death and it is fifteen or sixteen years since first i saw the handsome face in the spec i made sure besides to have died first love to you your wife and her sistersever yours dear boy       r l s   i never knew any man so superior to himself as poor james walter the best of him only came as a vision like corsica from the corniche he never gave his measure either morally or intellectually the curse was on him even his friends did not know him but by fits i have passed hours with him when he was so wise good and sweet that i never knew the like of it in any other and for a beautiful good humour he had no match i remember breaking in upon him once with a whole redhot story in my worst manner pouring words upon him by the hour about some truck not worth an egg that had befallen me and suddenly some half hour after finding that the sweet fellow had some concern of his own of infinitely greater import that he was patiently and smilingly waiting to consult me on it sounds nothing but the courtesy and the unselfishness were perfect it makes me rage to think how few knew him and how many had the chance to sneer at their better  well he was not wasted that we know though if anything looked liker irony than this fitting of a man out with these rich qualities and faculties to be wrecked and aborted from the very stocks i do not know the name of it yet we see that he has left an influence the memory of his patient courtesy has often checked me in rudeness has it not you  you can form no idea of how handsome walter was at twenty he was splendid to see then too he had the sense of power in him and great hopes he looked forward ever jesting of course but he looked to see himself where he had the right to expect he believed in himself profoundly but he never disbelieved in others to the roughest highland student he always had his fine kind open dignity of manner and a good word behind his back  the last time that i saw him before leaving for americait was a sad blow to both of us when he heard i was leaving and that might be the last time we might meetit almost was sohe was terribly upset and came round at once we sat late in baxters empty house where i was sleeping my dear friend walter ferrier o if i had only written to him more if only one of us in these last days had been well but i ever cherished the honour of his friendship and now when he is gone i know what i have lost still better we live on meaning to meet but when the hope is gone the pang comes       r l s     to edmund gosse        la solitude hy√®res 26th september 1883  my dear gosseit appears a bolt from transatlantica is necessary to produce four lines from you it is not flattering but as i was always a bad correspondent tis a vice to which i am lenient i give you to know however that i have already twice this makes three times sent you what i please to call a letter and received from you in return a subterfugeor nothing  my present purpose however which must not be postponed is to ask you to telegraph to the americans  after a summer of good health of a very radiant order toothache and the death of a very old friend which came upon me like a thunderclap have rather shelved my powers i stare upon the paper not write i wish i could write like your sculptors yet i am well aware that i should not try in that direction a certain warmth tepid enough and a certain dash of the picturesque are my poor essential qualities and if i went fooling after the too classical i might lose even these but i envied you that page  i am of course deep in schemes i was so ever execution alone somewhat halts how much do you make per annum i wonder this year for the first time i shall pass ¬£300 i may even get halfway to the next milestone this seems but a faint remuneration and the devil of it is that i manage with sickness and moves and education and the like to keep steadily in front of my income however i console myself with this that if i were anything else under gods heaven and had the same crank health i should make an even zero if i had with my present knowledge twelve months of my old health i would could and should do something neat as it is i have to tinker at my things in little sittings and the rent or the butcher or something is always calling me off to rattle up a potboiler and then comes a backset of my health and i have to twiddle my fingers and play patience  well i do not complain but i do envy strong health where it is squandered treasure your strength and may you never learn by experience the profound ennui and irritation of the shelved artist for then what is life all that one has done to make ones life effective then doubles the itch of inefficiency  i trust also you may be long without finding out the devil that there is in a bereavement after love it is the one great surprise that life preserves for us now i dont think i can be astonished any moreyours affectionately       r l s     to miss ferrier        la solitude hy√®res 30th sept 1883  my dear miss ferrieri am very much obliged to you for your letter and was interested by all you told me yes i know it is better for him to be gone and what you say helps me to realise that it is soi did not know how much he had suffered it is so that we are cured of life i am a little afraid to write or think much of walter just yet as i have not quite recovered the news and i have my work and my wife to think of  some day soon when the sharpness passes off if it does i must try to write some more of what he was he was so little understood i dont suppose any one knew him better than i did but just now it is difficult to think of him for you i do mourn indeed and admire your courage the loss is terrible i have no portrait of him is there one if so please let me have it if it has to be copied please let it be  henley seems to have been as good to dear walter as he is to all that introduction was a good turn i did to both it seems so strange for a friendship to begin all these years ago with so much mirth and now to end with this sorrow our little lives are moments in the wake of the eternal silence but how crowded while they last his has gone down in peace  i was not certainly the best companion for walter but i do believe i was the best he had in these early days he was not fortunate in friendslooking back i see most clearly how much we both wanted a man of riper wisdom we had no religion between the pair of usthat was the flaw how very different was our last intimacy in gladstone terrace but youth must learnlooking back over these wasted opportunities i must try rather to remember what i did right than to bewail the much that i left undone and knew not how to do i see that even you have allowed yourself to have regrets dear miss ferrier sure you were his angel we all had something to be glad of in so far as we had understood and loved and perhaps a little helped the gentle spirit but you may certainly be proud he always loved you and i remember in his worst days spoke of you with great affection a thing unusual with him for he was walking very wild and blind and had no true idea whether of himself or life the lifting afterwards was beautiful and touching dear miss ferrier i have given your kind messages to my wife who feels for you and reciprocates the hope to meet when it may come off i know not i feel almost ashamed to say that i keep better i feel as if like mrs leslie you must hate me for itstill i can very easily throw back whether by fatigue or want of care and i do not like to build plans for my return to my own land is there no chance of your coming hereabouts though we cannot in our small and disorderly house offer a lady a room one can be got close by and we can offer possible board and a most lovely little garden for a lounge please remember me kindly to your brother john and sir a and lady grant and believe me with hearty sympathyyours most sincerely       robert louis stevenson   i was rejoiced to hear he never doubted of my love but i must cure my hate of correspondence this has been a sharp lesson     to w e henley      it will be remembered that whistles or penny whistles was his own    name for the verses of the childs garden the proposal referred to    at the end of this letter was one which had reached him from messrs    lippincott the american publishers for a sailing trip to be taken    among the greek islands and made the subject of a book       la solitude hy√®res october 1883  my dear excellent admired volcanic angel of a lad trusty as a dog eruptive as vesuvius in all things great in all the soul of loyalty greeting  that you are better spirits me up good i have had no colour of a mag of art from here here in highairs the palmtrees i have heard your conversation it came here in the form of a mistral and i said to myself damme there is some henley at the foot of this  i shall try to do the whistle as suggested but i can usually do whistles only by giving my whole mind to it to produce even such limping verse demanding the whole forces of my untuneful soul i have other two anyway better or worse i am now deep deep ocean deep in otto a letter is a curst distraction about 100 pp are near fit for publication i am either making a spoon or spoiling the horn of a caledonian bull with that airy potentate god help me i bury a lot of labour in that principality and if i am not greatly a gainer i am a great loser and a great fool however sursum corda faint heart never writ romance  your dumas i think exquisite it might even have been stronglier said the brave old godly pagan i adore his big footprints on the earth  have you read merediths love in the valley it got me i wept i remembered that poetry existed    when her mother tends her before the laughing mirror  i propose if they lippincotts will let me wait till next autumn and go when it is safest to accept ¬£450 with ¬£100 down but it is now too late to go this year november and december are the months when it is safest and the back of the season is broken i shall gain much knowledge by the trip this i look upon as one of the main inducements       r l s     to sidney colvin      the following is in answer to a letter containing remarks on the    proofs of the childs garden then going round among some of his    friends and on the instalments of silverado squatters and the    black arrow which were appearing in the century magazine and young    folks respectively the remarks on professor seeleys literary manner    are √†propos of the expansion of england which i had lately sent

different view of the vocative  5 bewildering and childering are good enough for me these are rhymes jingles i dont go for eternity and the three unities  i will delete some of those condemned but not all i dont care for the name penny whistles i sent a sheaf to henley when i sent em but ive forgot the others i would just as soon call em rimes for children as anything else i am not proud nor particular  your remarks on the black arrow are to the point i am pleased you liked crookback he is a fellow whose hellish energy has always fixed my attention i wish shakespeare had written the play after he had learned some of the rudiments of literature and art rather than before some day i will retickle the sable missile and shoot it moyennant finances once more into the air i can lighten it

first paragraph of the following refers to contributions of r l    s to the magazine of art under mr henleys editorship       la solitude hy√®res autumn 1883  dear ladglad you like fontainebleau i am going to be the means under heaven of a√´rating or literating your pages the idea that because a thing is a picturebook all the writing should be on the wrong tack is triste but widespread thus hokusai will be really a gossip on convention or in great part and the skelt will be as like a charles lamb as i can get it the writer should write and not illustrate pictures else its bosh  your remarks about the ugly are my eye ugliness is only the prose of horror it is when you are not able to write macbeth that you write th√©r√®se raquin fashions are external the essence of art only varies in so far as fashion widens the field of its application art is a mill whose thirlage in different ages widens and contracts but in any case and under any fashion the great man produces beauty terror and mirth and the little man produces cleverness personalities psychology instead of beauty ugliness instead of terror and jokes instead of mirth as it was in the beginning is now and shall be ever world without end amen  and even as you read you say of course quelle rengaine       r l s     to w h low     manhattan mentioned below is the name of a shortlived new york    magazine the editor of which had asked through mr low for a    contribution from r l s       la solitude hy√®res october 1883  my dear low  some day or other in cassells magazine of art you will see a paper which will interest you and where your name appears it is called fontainebleau village communities of artists and the signature of r l stevenson will be found annexed  please tell the editor of manhattan the following secrets for me 1st that i am a beast 2nd that i owe him a letter 3rd that i have lost his and cannot recall either his name or address 4th that i am very deep in engagements which my absurd health makes it hard for me to overtake but 5th that i will bear him in mind 6th and last that i am a brute  my address is still the same and i live in a most sweet corner of the universe sea and fine hills before me and a rich variegated plain and at my back a craggy hill loaded with vast feudal ruins i am very quiet a person passing by my door half startles me but i enjoy the most aromatic airs and at night the most wonderful view into a moonlit garden by day this garden fades into nothing overpowered by its surroundings and the luminous distance but at night and when the moon is out that garden the arbour the flight of stairs that mount the artificial hillock the plumed blue gumtrees that hang trembling become the very skirts of paradise angels i know frequent it and it thrills all night with the flutes of silence damn that gardenand by day it is gone  continue to testify boldly against realism down with dagon the fish god all art swings down towards imitation in these days fatally but the man who loves art with wisdom sees the joke it is the lustful that tremble and respect her ladyship but the honest and romantic lovers of the muse can see a joke and sit down to laugh with apollo  the prospect of your return to europe is very agreeable and i was pleased by what you said about your parents one of my oldest friends died recently and this has given me new thoughts of death up to now i had rather thought of him as a mere personal enemy of my own but now that i see him hunting after my friends he looks altogether darker my own father is not well and henley of whom you must have heard me speak is in a questionable state of health these things are very solemn and take some of the colour out of life it is a great thing after all to be a man of reasonable honour and kindness do you remember once consulting me in paris whether you had not better sacrifice honesty to art and how after much confabulation we agreed that your art would suffer if you did we decided better than we knew in this strange welter where we live all hangs together by a million filaments and to do reasonably well by others is the first prerequisite of art art is a virtue and if i were the man i should be my art would rise in the proportion of my life  if you were privileged to give some happiness to your parents i know your art will gain by it by god it willsic subscribitur       r l s     to r a m stevenson        la solitude hy√®res october 1883  my dear bobyes i got both your letters at lyons but have been since then decading in several steps toothache fever ferriers death lung now it is decided i am to leave tomorrow penniless for nice to see dr williams  i was much struck by your last i have written a breathless note on realism for henley a fifth part of the subject hurriedly touched which will show you how my thoughts are driving you are now at last beginning to think upon the problems of executive plastic art for you are now for the first time attacking them hitherto you have spoken and thought of two thingstechnique and the ars artium or common background of all arts studio work is the real touch that is the genial error of the present french teaching realism i regard as a mere question of method the brown foreground old mastery and the like ranking with villanelles as technical sports and pastimes real art whether ideal or realistic addresses precisely the same feeling and seeks the same qualitiessignificance or charm and the samevery sameinspiration is only methodically differentiated according as the artist is an arrant realist or an arrant idealist each by his own method seeks to save and perpetuate the same significance or charm the one by suppressing the other by forcing detail all other idealism is the brown foreground over again and hence only art in the sense of a game like cup and ball all other realism is not art at allbut not at all it is then an insincere and showy handicraft  were you to reread some balzac as i have been doing it would greatly help to clear your eyes he was a man who never found his method an inarticulate shakespeare smothered under forciblefeeble detail it is astounding to the riper mind how bad he is how feeble how untrue how tedious and of course when he surrendered to his temperament how good and powerful and yet never plain nor clear he could not consent to be dull and thus became so he would leave nothing undeveloped and thus drowned out of sight of land amid the multitude of crying and incongruous details there is but one artto omit o if i knew how to omit i would ask no other knowledge a man who knew how to omit would make an iliad of a daily paper  your definition of seeing is quite right it is the first part of omission to be partly blind artistic sight is judicious blindness sam bough must have been a jolly blind old boy he would turn a corner look for onehalf or quarter minute and then say thisll do lad down he sat there and then with whole artistic plan scheme of colour and the like and begin by laying a foundation of powerful and seemingly incongruous colour on the block he saw not the scene but the watercolour sketch every artist by sixty should so behold nature where does he learn that in the studio i swear he goes to nature for facts relations valuesmaterial as a man before writing a historical novel reads up memoirs but it is not by reading memoirs that he has learned the selective criterion he has learned that in the practice of his art and he will never learn it well but when disengaged from the ardent struggle of immediate representation of realistic and ex facto art he learns it in the crystallisation of daydreams in changing not in copying fact in the pursuit of the ideal not in the study of nature these temples of art are as you say inaccessible to the realistic climber it is not by looking at the sea that you get    the multitudinous seas incarnadine  nor by looking at mont blanc that you find    and visited all night by troops of stars  a kind of ardour of the blood is the mother of all this and according as this ardour is swayed by knowledge and seconded by craft the art expression flows clear and significance and charm like a moon rising are born above the barren juggle of mere symbols  the painter must study more from nature than the man of words by why because literature deals with mens business and passions which in the game of life we are irresistibly obliged to study but painting with relations of light and colour and significances and form which from the immemorial habit of the race we pass over with an unregardful eye hence this crouching upon campstools and these crusts6 but neither one nor other is a part of art only preliminary studies  i want you to help me to get people to understand that realism is a method and only methodic in its consequences when the realist is an artist that is and supposing the idealist with whom you compare him to be anything but a farceur and a dilettante the two schools of working do and should lead to the choice of different subjects but that is a consequence not a cause see my chaotic note which will appear i fancy in november in henleys sheet  poor ferrier it bust me horrid he was after you the oldest of my friends  i am now very tired and will go to bed having prelected freely fanny will finish       r l s     to thomas stevenson      some pages of ms exist in which the writer at this time attempted to    recast and expand a portion of the lay morals of 1879 a letter    written some days earlier to his father and partly quoted in mr    graham balfours life ed 1906 p 209 explains his purpose       la solitude hy√®res 12th october 1883  my dear fatheri have just lunched the day is exquisite the air comes through the open window rich with odour and i am by no means spiritually minded your letter however was very much valued and has been read oftener than once what you say about yourself i was glad to hear a little decent resignation is not only becoming a christian but is likely to be excellent for the health of a stevenson to fret and fume is undignified suicidally foolish and theologically unpardonable we are here not to make but to tread predestined pathways we are the foam of a wave and to preserve a proper equanimity is not merely the first part of submission to god but the chief of possible kindnesses to those about us i am lecturing myself but you also to do our best is one part but to wash our hands smilingly of the consequence is the next part of any sensible virtue  i have come for the moment to a pause in my moral works for i have many irons in the fire and i wish to finish something to bring coin before i can afford to go on with what i think doubtfully to be a duty it is a most difficult work a touch of the parson will drive off those i hope to influence a touch of overstrained laxity besides disgusting like a grimace may do harm nothing that i have ever seen yet speaks directly and efficaciously to young men and i do hope i may find the art and wisdom to fill up a gap the great point as i see it is to ask as little as possible and meet if it may be every view or absence of view and it should be must be easy honesty is the one desideratum but think how hard a one to meet i think all the time of ferrier and myself these are the pair that i address poor ferrier so much a better man than i and such a temporal wreck but the thing of which we must divest our minds is to look partially upon others all is to be viewed and the creature judged as he must be by his creator not dissected through a prism of morals but in the unrefracted ray so seen and in relation to the almost omnipotent surroundings who is to distinguish between f and such a man as dr candlish or between such a man as david hume and such an one as robert burns to compare my poor and good walter with myself is to make me startle he upon all grounds above the merely expedient was the nobler being yet wrecked utterly ere the full age of manhood and the last skirmishes so well fought so humanly useless so pathetically brave only the leaps of an expiring lamp all this is a very pointed instance it shuts the mouth i have learned more in some ways from him than from any other soul i ever met and he strange to think was the best gentleman in all kinder senses that i ever knewever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson     to w h low      the paper referred to at the beginning of the second paragraph is one    on r l s in the century magazine the first seriously critical    notice says mr low which appeared of him in the states       la solitude hy√®res oct 23 1883  my dear lowcest dun bon camarade and i am much obliged to you for your two letters and the inclosure times are a lityle changed with all of us since the ever memorable days of lavenue hallowed be his name hallowed his old fleuryof which you did not seei thinkas i didthe glorious apotheosis advanced on a tuesday to three francs on the thursday to six and on friday swept off holus bolus for the proprietors private consumption well we had the start of that proprietor many a good bottle came our way and was i think worthily made welcome  i am pleased that mr gilder should like my literature and i ask you particularly to thank mr bunner have i the name right for his notice which was of that friendly headlong sort that really pleases an author like what the french call a shakehands it pleased me the more coming from the states where i have met not much recognition save from the buccaneers and above all from pirates who misspell my name i saw my book advertised in a number of the critic as the work of one r l stephenson and i own i boiled it is so easy to know the name of the man whose book you have stolen for there it is at full length on the titlepage of your booty but no damn him not he he calls me stephenson these woes i only refer to by the way as they set a higher value on the century notice  i am now a person with an established illhealtha wifea dog possessed with an evil a gadarene spirita chalet on a hill looking out over the mediterraneana certain reputationand very obscure finances otherwise very much the same i guess and were a bottle of fleury a thing to be obtained capable of developing theories along with a fit spirit even as of yore yet i now draw near to the middle ages nearly three years ago that fatal thirty struck and yet the great work is not yet donenot yet even conceived but so as one goes on the wood seems to thicken the footpath to narrow and the house beautiful on the hills summit to draw further and further away we learn indeed to use our means but only to learn along with it the paralysing knowledge that these means are only applicable to two or three poor commonplace motives eight years ago if i could have slung ink as i can now i should have thought myself well on the road after shakespeare and nowi find i have only got a pair of walkingshoes and not yet begun to travel and art is still away there on the mountain summit but i need not continue for of course this is your story just as much as it is mine and strange to think it was shakespeares too and beethovens and phidiass it is a blessed thing that in this forest of art we can pursue our woodlice and sparrows and not catch them with almost the same fervour of exhilaration as that with which sophocles hunted and brought down the mastodon  tell me something of your work and your wifemy dear fellow i am yours ever       r l stevenson   my wife begs to be remembered to both of you i cannot say as much for my dog who has never seen you but he would like on general principles to bite you     to w e henley      by this time treasure island was out in book form and the    following is in reply to some reflections on its seamanship which had    been conveyed to him through mr henley       la solitude hy√®res november 1883  my dear lad  of course my seamanship is jimmy did i not beseech you i know not how often to find me an ancient marinerand you whose own wifes own brother is one of the ancientest did nothing for me as for my seamen did runciman ever know eighteenth century buccaneers no well no more did i but i have known and sailed with seamen too and lived and eaten with them and i made my putup shot in no great ignorance but as a putup thing has to be made ie to be coherent and picturesque and damn the expense are they fairly lively on the wires then favour me with your tongues are they wooden and dim and no sport then it is i that am silent otherwise not the work strange as it may sound in the ear is not a work of realism the next thing i shall hear is that the etiquette is wrong in ottos court with a warrant and i mean it to be so and the whole matter never cost me half a thought i make these paper people to please myself and skelt and god almighty and with no ulterior purpose yet am i mortal myself for as i remind you i begged for a supervising mariner however my heart is in the right place i have been to sea but i never crossed the threshold of a court and the courts shall be the way i want em  im glad to think i owe you the review that pleased me best of all the reviews i ever had the one i liked best before that was s on the arabians these two are the flowers of the collection according to me to live reading such reviews and die eating ortolanssich is my aspiration  whenever you come you will be equally welcome i am trying to finish otto ere you shall arrive so as to take and be able to enjoy a wellearnedo yes a wellearnedholiday longman fetched by otto is it a spoon or a spoilt horn momentous if the latter if the former a spoon to dip much praise and pudding and to give i do think much pleasure the last part now in hand much smiles upon meever yours       r l s     to mrs thomas stevenson        la solitude hy√®res november 1883  my dear motheryou must not blame me too much for my silence i am over head and ears in work and do not know what to do first i have been hard at otto hard at silverado proofs which i have worked over again to a tremendous extent cutting adding rewriting until some of the worst chapters of the original are now to my mind as good as any i was the more bound to make it good as i had such liberal terms its not for want of trying if i have failed  i got your letter on my birthday indeed that was how i found it out about three in the afternoon when postie comes thank you for all you said as for my wife that was the best investment ever made by man but in our branch of the family we seem to marry well i considering my piles of work am wonderfully well i have not been so busy for i know not how long i hope you will send me the money i asked however as i am not only penniless but shall remain so in all human probability for some considerable time i have got in the mass of my expectations and the ¬£100 which is to float us on the new year cannot come due till silverado is all ready i am delaying it myself for the moment then will follow the binders and the travellers and an infinity of other nuisances and only at the last the jinglingtingling  do you know that treasure island has appeared in the november number of henleys magazine a capital number anyway there is a funny publishers puff of it for your book also a bad article by me lang dotes on treasure island except tom sawyer and the odyssey he writes i never liked any romance so much i will inclose the letter though the bogue is angelic although very dirty it

small ships here mentioned fontainebleau and the    character of dogs are well known a misadventure in france is    probably a draft of the epilogue to an inland voyage not    published till five years later the travelling companion of which    i remember little except that its scene was partly laid in north    italy and that a publisher to whom it was shown declared it a work of    genius but indecent was abandoned some two years later as set forth    on p 193 of this volume       la solitude hy√®res november 1883    ¬£10000 pounds reward  whereas sidney colvin more generally known as the guardian angel has vanished from the gaze of mr r l stevenson the above reward is offered as a means to discover the whereabouts of the misguided gentleman he was known as a man of irregular habits and his rowdy exterior would readily attract attention in a crowd he was never known to resist a drink whisky was his favourite dish if any one will bring him to mr stevensons back area door dead or alive the greatest rejoicing will be felt by a bereaved and uneasy family  also wherefore not a word dear colvin my news is splendid health great success of the black arrow another tale demanded

blooming countenance not the evidence of a selfrighteous spirit  i continue my uphill fight with the twin spirits of bankruptcy and indigestion duns rage about my portal at least to fancys ear  i suppose you heard of ferriers death my oldest friend except bob it has much upset me i did not fancy how much i am strangely concerned about it  my house is the loveliest spot in the universe the moonlight nights we have are incredible love poetry and music and the arabian nights inhabit just my corner of the worldnest there like mavises                      here lies                    the carcase                        of               robert louis stevenson       an active austere and not inelegant                      writer                       who        at the termination of a long career     wealthy wise benevolent and honoured by         the attention of two hemispheres   yet owned it to have been his crowning favour                    to inhabit                   la solitude  with the consent of the intelligent edility of hy√®res he has been interred below this frugal stone in the garden which he honoured for so long with his poetic presence  i must write more solemn letters adieu write       r l s     to mrs milne      this is to a cousin who had been one of his favourite playmates in    childhood and had recognised some allusions in the proof slips of    the childs garden the piece called a pirate story       la solitude hy√®res november 1883  my dear henriettacertainly who else would they be more by token on that particular occasion you were sailing under the title of princess royal i after a furious contest under that of prince alfred and willie still a little sulky as the prince of wales we were all in a buck basket about halfway between the swing and the gate and i can still see the pirate squadron heave in sight upon the weather bow  i wrote a piece besides on giant bunker but i was not happily inspired and it is condemned perhaps ill try again he was a horrid fellow giant bunker and some of my happiest hours were passed in pursuit of him you were a capital fellow to play how few there were who could none better than yourself i shall never forget some of the days at bridge of allan they were one golden dream see a good boy in the penny whistles much of the sentiment of which is taken direct from one evening at b of a when we had had a great play with the little glasgow girl hallowed be that fat book of fairy tales do you remember acting the fair one with golden locks what a romantic drama generally speaking whenever i think of play it is pretty certain that you will come into my head i wrote a paper called childs play once where i believe you or willie would recognise things  surely willie is just the man to marry and if his wife wasnt a happy woman i think i could tell her who was to blame is there no word of it well these things are beyond arrangement and the wind bloweth where it listethwhich i observe is generally towards the west in scotland here it prefers a southeasterly course and is called the mistralusually with an adjective in front but if you will remember my yesterdays toothache and this mornings crick you will be in a position to choose an adjective for yourself not that the wind is unhealthy only when it comes strong it is both very high and very cold which makes it the dvl but as i am writing to a lady i had better avoid this topic winds requiring a great scope of language  please remember me to all at home give ramsay a pennyworth of acidulated drops for his good tasteand believe me your affectionate cousin       robert louis stevenson     to miss ferrier        la solitude hy√®res november 22 1883  dear miss ferriermany thanks for the photograph it iswell it is like most photographs the sun is an artist of too much renown and at any rate we who knew walter in the brave days of old will be difficult to please  i was inexpressibly touched to get a letter from some lawyers as to some money i have never had any account with my friends some have gained and some lost and i should feel there was something dishonest in a partial liquidation even if i could recollect the facts which i cannot but the fact of his having put aside this memorandum touched me greatly  the mystery of his life is great our chemist in this place who had been at malvern recognised the picture you may remember walter had a romantic affection for all pharmacies and the bottles in the window were for him a poem he said once that he knew no pleasure like driving through a lamplit city waiting for the chemists to go by  all these things return now  he had a pretty full translation of schillers √Üsthetic letters which we read together as well as the second part of faust in gladstone terrace he helping me with the german there is no keepsake i should more value than the ms of that translation they were the best days i ever had with him little dreaming all would so soon be over it needs a blow like this to convict a man of mortality and its burthen i always thought i should go by myself not to survive but now i feel as if the earth were undermined and all my friends have lost one thickness of reality since that one passed those are happy who can take it otherwise with that i found things all beginning to dislimn here we have no abiding city and one felt as though he hadand o too much acted  but if you tell me he did not feel my silence however he must have done so and my guilt is irreparable now i thank god at least heartily that he did not resent it  please remember me to sir alexander and lady grant to whose care i will address this when next i am in edinburgh i will take flowers alas to the west kirk many a long hour we passed in graveyards the man who has gone and ior rather not that manbut the beautiful genial witty youth who so betrayed himdear miss ferrier i am yours most sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      this refers to some dispute which had arisen with an editor i forget    whom concerning the refusal of an article on salvini the nickname    fastidious brisk from ben jonsons every man out of his humour    was applied by mr henley to stevensonvery inappropriately as i    always thought       la solitude hy√®res autumn 1883  my dear ladyou know your own business best but i wish your honesty were not so warfaring these conflicts pain lucretian sitters on the shore and one wondersone wonderswonders and whimpers i do not say my attitude is noble but is yours conciliatory i revere salvini but i shall never see himnor anybodyplay again that is all a matter of history heroic history to me were i in london i should be the liker tantalusno more but as for these quarrels in not many years shall we not all be claycold and safe below ground you with your loudmouthed integrity i with my fastidious brisknessandwith all their faults and merits swallowed in silence it seems to me in ignorance of cause that when the dustman has gone by these quarrellings will prick the conscience am i wrong i am a great sinner so my brave friend are you the others also let us a little imitate the divine patience and the divine sense of humour and smilingly tolerate those faults and virtues that have so brief a period and so intertwined a being  i fear i was born a parson but i live very near upon the margin though by your leave i may outlive you all and too much rigour in these daily things sounds to me like clatter on the kitchen dishes if it might becould it not be smoothed this very day my father writes me he has gone to see upon his deathbed an old friend to whom for years he has not spoken or written on his deathbed no picking up of the lost stitches merely to say my little fury my spotted uprightness after having split our lives have not a word of quarrel to say more and the same post brings me the news of anotherwar things in this troubled medium are not so clear dear henley there are faults upon all hands and the end comes and ferriers grave gapes for us all       the prosy preacher    but written in deep dejection my dear man  suppose they are wrong well am i not tolerated are you not toleratedwe and our faults     to w h low        la solitude hy√®res var 13th december 1883  my dear low  i was much pleased with what you said about my work illhealth is a great handicapper in the race i have never at command that press of spirits that are necessary to strike out a thing redhot silverado is an example of stuff worried and pawed about god knows how often in poor health and you can see for yourself the result good pages an imperfect fusion a certain languor of the whole not in short art i have told roberts to send you a copy of the book when it appears where there are some fair passages that will be new to you my brief romance prince ottofar my most difficult adventure up to nowis near an end i have still one chapter to write de fond en comble and three or four to strengthen or recast the rest is done i do not know if i have made a spoon or only spoiled a horn but i am tempted to hope the first if the present bargain hold it will not see the light of day for some thirteen months then i shall be glad to know how it strikes you there is a good deal of stuff in it both dramatic and i think poetic and the story is not like these purposeless fables of today but is at least intended to stand firm upon a base of philosophyor moralsas you please it has been long gestated and is wrought with care enfin nous verrons my labours have this year for the first time been rewarded with upwards of ¬£350 that of itself so base we are encourages me and the better tenor of my health yet moreremember me to mrs low and believe me yours most sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to thomas stevenson        la solitude december 20 1883  my dear fatheri do not know which of us is to blame i suspect it is you this time the last accounts of you were pretty good i was pleased to see i am on the whole very wellsuffering a little still from my fever and liver complications but better  i have just finished rereading a book which i counsel you above all things not to read as it has made me very ill and would make you worselockharts scott it is worth reading as all things are from time to time that keep us nose to nose with fact though i think such reading may be abused and that a great deal of life is better spent in reading of a light and yet chivalrous strain thus no waverley novel approaches in power blackness bitterness and moral elevation to the diary and lockharts narrative of the end and yet the waverley novels are better reading for every day than the life you may take a tonic daily but not phlebotomy  the great double danger of taking life too easily and taking it too hard how difficult it is to balance that but we are all too little inclined to faith we are all in our serious moments too much inclined to forget that all are sinners and fall justly by their faults and therefore that we have no more to do with that than with the thundercloud only to trust and do our best and wear as smiling a face as may be for others and ourselves but there is no royal road among this complicated business hegel the german got the best word of all philosophy with his antinomies the contrary of everything is its postulate that is of course grossly expressed but gives a hint of the idea which contains a great deal of the mysteries of religion and a vast amount of the practical wisdom of life for your part there is no doubt as to your dutyto take things easy and be as happy as you can for your sake and my mothers and that of many besides excuse this sermonever your loving son       r l s     to mr and mrs thomas stevenson

not grateful enough he is like fanny his resignation is not the true blue a man who has gained a stone whose son is better and after so many fears to the contrary i dare to say a credit to him whose business is arranged whose marriage is a picturewhat i should call resignation in such a case as his would be to take down his fiddle and play as lood as ever he could that and nought else and now you

reading for every day than the tragic life and he takes it backside foremost and shakes his head and is gloomier than ever tell him that i give him up i dont want no such a parent this is not the man for my money i do not call that by the name of religion which fills a man with bile i write him a whole letter bidding him beware of extremes and telling him that his gloom is gallowsworthy and i get back an answerperish the thought of it  here am i on the threshold of another year when according to all human foresight i should long ago have been resolved into my elements here am i who you were persuaded was born to disgrace youand i will do you the justice to add on no such insufficient groundsno very burning discredit when all is done here am i married and the marriage recognised to be a blessing of the first order a1 at lloyds there is he at his not first youth able to take more exercise than i at thirtythree and gaining a stones weight a thing of which i am incapable there are you has the man no gratitude there is smeoroch8 is he blind tell him from me that all this is    not the true blue  i will think more of his prayers when i see in him a spirit of praise piety is a more childlike and happy attitude than he admits martha martha do you hear the knocking at the door but mary was happy even the shorter catechism not the merriest epitome of religion and a work exactly as pious although not quite so true as the multiplication tableeven that dryasdust epitome begins with a heroic note what is mans chief end let him study that and ask himself if to refuse to enjoy gods kindest gifts is in the spirit indicated up dullard it is better service to enjoy a novel than to mump  i have been most unjust to the shorter catechism i perceive i wish to say that i keenly admire its merits as a performance and that all that was in my mind was its peculiarly unreligious and unmoral texture from which defect it can never of course exercise the least influence on the minds of children but they learn fine style and some austere thinking unconsciouslyever your loving son       r l s     to mr and mrs thomas stevenson        la solitude hy√®reslespalmiers var january 1 1884  my dear peoplea good new year to you the year closes leaving me with ¬£50 in the bank owing no man nothing ¬£100 more due to me in a week or so and ¬£150 more in the course of the month and i can look

to the commanders in the    nile campaigns of those years       la solitude hy√®res 9th march 1884  my dear s cyou will already have received a not very sane note from me so your patience was rewardedmay i say your patient silence however now comes a letter which on receipt i thus acknowledge  i have already expressed myself as to the political aspect about grahame i feel happier it does seem to have been really a good neat honest piece of work we do not seem to be so badly off for commanders wolseley and roberts and this pile of woods stewarts alisons grahames and the like had we but one statesman on any side of the house  two chapters of otto do remain one to rewrite one to create and i am not yet able to tackle them for me it is my chief o works hence probably not so for others since it only means that i have here attacked the greatest difficulties but some chapters towards the end three in particulari do think come off i find them stirring dramatic and not unpoetical we shall see however as like as not the effort will be more obvious than the success for of course i strung myself hard to carry it out the next will come easier and possibly be more popular i believe in the covering of much paper each time with a definite and not too difficult artistic purpose and then from time to time drawing oneself up and trying in a superior effort to combine the facilities thus acquired or improved thus one progresses but mind it is very likely that the big effort instead of being the masterpiece may be the blotted copy the gymnastic exercise this no man can tell only the brutal and licentious public snouting in mudies washtrough can return a dubious answer  i am today thanks to a pure heaven and a beneficent loudtalking antiseptic mistral on the high places as to health and spirits money holds out wonderfully fanny has gone for a drive to certain meadows which are now one sheet of jonquils seabound meadows the thought of which may freshen you in bloomsbury ye have been fresh and fair ye have been filled with flowersi fear i misquote why do people babble surely herrick in his true vein is superior to martial himself though martial is a very pretty poet  did you ever read st augustine the first chapters of the confessions are marked by a commanding genius shakespearian in depth i was struck dumb but alas when you begin to wander into controversy the poet drops out his description of infancy is most seizing and how is this sed majorum nugae negotia vocantur puerorum autem talia cum sint puniuntur a majoribus which is quite after the heart of r l s see also his splendid passage about the luminosus limes amicitiae and the nebulae de limosa concupiscentia carnis going on utrumque in confuso aestuabat et rapiebat imbecillam aetatem per abrupta cupiditatum that utrumque is a real contribution to lifes science lust alone is but a pigmy but it never or rarely attacks us singlehanded  do you ever read to go miles off indeed the incredible barbey daur√©villy a psychological poeto be for a moment henley i own with pleasure i prefer him with all his folly rot sentiment and mixed metaphors to the whole modern school in france it makes me laugh when its nonsense and when he gets an effect though its still nonsense and mere po√´ry not poesy it wakens me ce qui ne meurt pas nearly killed me with laughing and left mewell it left me very nearly admiring the old ass at least its the kind of thing one feels one couldnt do the dreadful moonlight when they all three sit silent in the roomby george sir its imaginedand the brief scene between the husband and wife is all there quant au fond the whole thing of course is a fever dream and worthy of eternal laughter had the young man broken stones and the two women been hardworking honest prostitutes there had been an end of the whole immoral and baseless business you could at least have respected them in that case  i also read petronius arbiter which is a rum work not so immoral as most modern works but singularly silly i tackled some tacitus too i got them with a dreadful french crib on the same page with the text which helps me along and drives me mad the french do not even try to translate they try to be much more classical than the classics with astounding results of barrenness and tedium tacitus i fear was too solid for me i liked the war part but the dreary intriguing at rome was too much       r l s     to mr dick      this correspondent was for many years head clerk and confidential    assistant in the family firm at edinburgh       la solitude hy√®res 12th march 1884  my dear mr dicki have been a great while owing you a letter but i am not without excuses as you have heard i overworked to get a piece of work finished before i had my holiday thinking to enjoy it more and instead of that the machinery near hand came sundry in my hands like murdies uniform however i am now i think in a fair way of recovery i think i was made what there is of me of whipcord and thornswitches surely i am tough but i fancy i shall not overdrive again or not so long it is my theory that work is highly beneficial but that it should if possible and certainly for such partially brokendown instruments as the thing i call my body be taken in batches with a clear break and breathing space between i always do vary my work laying one thing aside to take up another not merely because i believe it rests the brain but because i have found it most beneficial to the result reading bacon says makes a full man but what makes me full on any subject is to banish it for a time from all my thoughts however what i now propose is out of every quarter to work two months and rest the third i believe i shall get more done as i generally manage on my present scheme to have four months impotent illness and two of imperfect healthone before one after i break down this at least is not an economical division of the year  i reread the other day that heartbreaking book the life of scott one should read such works now and then but o not often as i live i feel more and more that literature should be cheerful and bravespirited even if it cannot be made beautiful and pious and heroic we wish it to be a green place the waverley novels are better to reread than the overtrue life fine as dear sir walter was the bible in most parts is a cheerful book it is our little piping theologies tracts and sermons that are dull and dowie and even the shorter catechism which is scarcely a work of consolation opens with the best and shortest and completest sermon ever writtenupon mans chief endbelieve me my dear mr dick very sincerely yours       robert louis stevenson   psyou see i have changed my hand i was threatened apparently with scriveners cramp and at any rate had got to write so small that the revisal of my ms tried my eyes hence my signature alone remains upon the old model for it appears that if i changed that i should be cut off from my vivers       r l s     to cosmo monkhouse      this amiable and excellent public servant artcritic and versifier    was a friend of old savile club days the drift of his letter can    easily be guessed from this reply the reference to lamb is to the    essay on the restoration dramatists       la solitude hy√®res march 16 1884  my dear monkhouseyou see with what promptitude i plunge into correspondence but the truth is i am condemned to a complete inaction stagnate dismally and love a letter yours which would have been welcome at any time was thus doubly precious  dover sounds somewhat shiveringly in my ears you should see the weather i havecloudless clear as crystal with just a punkahdraft of the most aromatic air all pine and gum tree you would be ashamed of dover you would scruple to refer sir to a spot so paltry to be idle at dover is a strange pretension pray how do you warm yourself if i were there i should grind knives or write blank verse or but at least you do not bathe it is idle to deny it i havei may say i nourisha growing jealousy of the robust largelegged healthy britaindwellers patient of grog scorners of the timid umbrella innocuously breathing fog all which i once was and i am ashamed to say liked it how ignorant is youth grossly rolling among unselected pleasures and how nobler purer sweeter and lighter to sip the choice tonic to recline in the luxurious invalid chair and to tread wellshawled the little round of the constitutional seriously do you like to repose ye gods i hate it i never rest with any acceptation i do not know what people mean who say they like sleep and that damned bedtime which since long ere i was breeched has rung a knell to all my days doings and beings and when a man seemingly sane tells me he has fallen in love with stagnation i can only say to him you will never be a pirate this may not cause any regret to mrs monkhouse but in your own soul it will clang hollowthink of it never after all boyhoods aspirations and youths immoral daydreams you are condemned to sit down grossly draw in your chair to the fat board and be a beastly burgess till you die can it be is there not some escape some furlough from the moral law some holiday jaunt contrivable into a better land shall we never shed blood this prospect is too grey    here lies a man who never did   anything but what he was bid   who lived his life in paltry ease   and died of commonplace disease  to confess plainly i had intended to spend my life or any leisure i might have from piracy upon the high seas as the leader of a great horde of irregular cavalry devastating whole valleys i can still looking back see myself in many favourite attitudes signalling for a boat from my pirate ship with a pockethandkerchief i at the jetty end and one or two of my bold blades keeping the crowd at bay or else turning in the saddle to look back at my whole command some five thousand strong following me at the handgallop up the road out of the burning valley this last by moonlight  et point du tout i am a poor scribe and have scarce broken a commandment to mention and have recently dined upon cold veal as for you who probably had some ambitions i hear of you living at dover in lodgings like the beasts of the field but in heaven when we get there we shall have a good time and see some real carnage for heaven ismust bethat great kingdom of antinomia which lamb saw dimly adumbrated in the country wife where the worm which never dies the conscience peacefully expires and the sinner lies down beside the ten commandments till then here a sheer hulk lies poor tom bowling with neither health nor vice for anything more spirited than procrastination which i may well call the consolation stakes of wickedness and by whose diligent practice without the least amusement to ourselves we can rob the orphan and bring down grey hairs with sorrow to the dust  this astonishing gush of nonsense i now hasten to close envelope and expedite to shakespeares cliff remember me to shakespeare and believe me yours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to edmund gosse      mr gosse had written describing the office which he then occupied a    picturesque oldfashioned chamber in the upper stories of the board    of trade       la solitude hy√®res march 17 1884  my dear gosseyour officeoffice is profanely saidyour bower upon the leads is divine have you like pepys the right to fiddle there i see you mount the companion barbiton in hand and fluttered about by city sparrows pour forth your spirit in a voluntary now when the spring begins you must lay in your flowers how do you say about a potted hawthorn would it bloom wallflower is a choice potherb lilyofthevalley too and carnation and indian cress trailed about the window is not only beautiful by colour but the leaves are good to eat i recommend thyme and rosemary for the aroma which should not be left upon one side they are good quiet growths  on one of your tables keep a great map spread out a chart is still betterit takes one furtherthe havens with their little anchors the rocks banks and soundings are adorably marine and such furniture will suit your shipshape habitation i wish i could see those cabins they smile upon me with the most intimate charm from your leads do you behold st pauls i always like to see the foolscap it is london per se and no spot from which it is visible is without romance then it is good company for the man of letters whose veritable nursing paternoster is so near at hand  i am all at a standstill as idle as a painted ship but not so pretty my romance which has so nearly butchered me in the writing not even finished though so near thank god that a few days of tolerable strength will see the roof upon that structure i have worked very hard at it and so do not expect any great public favour in moments of effort one learns to do the easy things that people like there is the golden maxim thus one should strain and then play strain again and play again the strain is for us it educates the play is for the reader and pleases do you not feel so we are ever threatened by two contrary faults both deadly to sink into what my forefathers would have called rank conformity and to pour forth cheap replicas upon the one hand upon the other and still more insidiously present to forget that art is a diversion and a decoration that no triumph or effort is of value nor anything worth reaching except charmyours affectionately       r l s     to miss ferrier      soon after the date of the following letter miss ferrier went out to    her friends and stayed with them through the trying weeks which    followed       la solitude hy√®res march 22 1884  my dear miss ferrierare you really going to fail us this seems a dreadful thing my poor wife who is not well off for friends on this bare coast has been promising herself and i have been promising her a rare acquisition and now miss burn has failed and you utter a very doubtful note you do not know how delightful this place is nor how anxious we are for a visit look at the names the solitudeis that romantic the palmtreeshow is that for the gorgeous east var the name of a riverthe quiet waters by tis true they are in another department and consist of stones and a biennial spate but what a music what a plash of brooks for the imagination we have hills we have skies the roses are putting forth as yet sparsely the meadows by the sea are one sheet of jonquils the birds sing as in an english mayfor considering we are in france and serve up our songbirds i am ashamed to say on a little field of toast and with a sprig of thyme my own receipt in their most innocent and now unvocal belliesconsidering all this we have a wonderfully fair woodmusic round this solitude of ours what can i say moreall this awaits you kennst du das land in shortyour sincere friend       robert louis stevenson     to w h low      the verses enclosed were the set entitled the canoe speaks    afterwards printed in underwoods stevenson was suffering at this    time from a temporary weakness of the eyesight       la solitude hy√®res april 1884  my dear lowthe blind man in these sprawled lines sends greeting i have been ill as perhaps the papers told you the newsgreat newsglorious newssecond editionwent the round in england  anyway i now thank you for your pictures which particularly the arcadian one we all bob included he was here sicknursing me much liked  herewith are a set of verses which i thought pretty enough to send to press then i thought of the manhattan towards whom i have guilty and compunctious feelings last i had the best thought of allto send them to you in case you might think them suitable for illustration it seemed to me quite in your vein if so good if not hand them on to manhattan century or lippincott at your pleasure as all three desire my work or pretend to but i trust the lines will not go unattended some riverside will haunt you and o be tender to my bathing girls the lines are copied in my wifes hand as i cannot see to write otherwise than with the pen of cormoran gargantua or nimrod love to your wifeyours ever       r l s  copied it myself     to thomas stevenson        la solitude hy√®res april 19 1884  my dear fatheryesterday i very powerfully stated the h√¶resis stevensoniana or the complete body of divinity of the family theologian to miss ferrier she was much impressed so was i you are a great heresiarch and i know no better whaur the devil did ye get thon about the soap is it altogether your own i never heard it elsewhere and yet i suspect it must have been held at some time or other and if you were to look up you would probably find yourself condemned by some council  i am glad to hear you are so well the hear is excellent the cornhills came i made miss ferrier read us thrawn janet and was quite bowled over by my own works the merry men i mean to make much longer with a whole new d√©nouement not yet quite clear to me the story of a lie i must rewrite entirely also as it is too weak and ragged yet is worth saving for the admiral did i ever tell you that the admiral was recognised in america  when they are all on their legs this will make an excellent collection   has davie never read guy mannering rob roy or the antiquary all of which are worth three waverleys i think kenilworth better than waverley nigel too and quentin durward about as good but it shows a true piece of insight to prefer waverley for it is different and though not quite coherent better worked in parts than almost any other surely more carefully it is undeniable that the love of the slapdash and the shoddy grew upon scott with success perhaps it does on many of us which may be the granite on which ds opinion stands however i hold it in patrick walkers phrase for an old condemned damnable error dr simson was condemned by p w as being a bagful of such one of patricks amenities  another ground there may be to ds opinion those who avoid or seek to avoid scotts facility are apt to be continually straining and torturing their style to get in more of life and to many the extra significance does not redeem the strain       doctor stevenson     to w e henley        la solitude hy√®res april 20th 1884  i have been really ill for two days hemorrhage weakness extreme nervousness that will not let me lie a moment and damned sciatica o nights but today i am on the recovery time for i was miserable it is not often that i suffer with all my turns and tumbles from the sense of serious illness and i hate it as i believe everybody does and then the combination of not being able to read not being allowed to speak being too weak to write and not wishing to eat leaves a man with some empty seconds but i bless god its over now today i am much mended  insatiable gulf greedier than hell and more silent than the woods of styx have you or have you not lost the dedication to the childs garden answer that plain question as otherwise i must try to tackle to it once again  sciatica is a word employed much by shakespeare in a certain connection tis true he was no physician but as i read he had smarted in his day i too do smart and yet this keen soprano agony these veins of fire and bombshell explosions in the knee are as nothing to a certain dull drowsy pain i had when my kidneys were congested at nice there was death in that the creak of charons rowlocks and the miasmas of the styx i may say plainly much as i have lost the power of bearing pain i had still rather suffer much than die not only the love of life grows on me but the fear of certain odd endseconds grows as well tis a suffocating business take it how you will and tyrrel and forest only bunglers  well this is an essay on death or worse on dying to return to daylight and the winds i perceive i have grown to live too much in my work and too little in life tis the dollars do it the world is too much whenever i think i would like to live a little i hear the butchers cart resounding through the neighbourhood and so to plunge again the fault is a good fault for me to be able to do so is to succeed in life and my life has been a huge success i can live with joy and without disgust in the art by which i try to support myself i have the best wife in the world i have rather more praise and nearly as much coin as i deserve my friends are many and truehearted sir it is a big thing in successes and if mine anchorage lies something open to the wind sciatica if the crew are blind and the captain spits blood one cannot have all and i may be patched up again who knows his timbers yet are indifferently sound and he may float again  thanks for the word on silveradoyours ever       the sciaticated bard     to trevor haddon      the allusions to skelt the last of the designers and etchers of    cheap sheets illustrating the popular dramas and melodramas of the    day will need no explanation to readers familiar with the essay a    penny plain and twopence coloured       la solitude hy√®res april 23rd 1884  dear mr haddoni am pleased to see your hand again and waiting my wifes return to guess at some of the contents for various things have befallen me of late first as you see i had to change my hand lastly i have fallen into a kind of blindness and cannot read this more inclines me for something to do to answer your letter before i have read it a safe plan familiar to diplomatists  i gather from half shut eyes that you were a skeltist now seriously that is a good beginning there is a deal of romance cheap in skelt look at it well and you will see much of dickens and even skelt is better than conscientious grey backgardens and conscientious dull still lives the great lack of art just now is a spice of life and interest and i prefer galvanism to acquiescence in the grave all do not tis an affair of tastes and mine are young those who like death have their innings today with art that is like mahogany and horsehair furniture solid true serious and as dead as c√¶sar i wish i could read treasure island i believe i should like it but work done for the artist is the golden goose killed you sell its feathers and lament the eggs tomorrow the fresh woods  i have been seriously ill and do not pick up with that finality that i should like to see i linger over and digest my convalescence like a favourite wine and what with blindness green spectacles and seclusion cut but a poor figure in the world  i made out at the end that you were asking some advicebut what my failing eyes refuse to inform me i must keep a sheet for the answer and mrs stevenson still delays and still i have no resource against tedium but the waggling of this pen  you seem to me to be a pretty lucky young man keep your eyes open to your mercies that part of piety is eternal and the man who forgets to be grateful has fallen asleep in life please to recognise that you are unworthy of all that befalls youunworthy too i hear you wail of this terrible sermon but indeed we are not worthy of our fortunes love takes us in a counterfeit success comes to us at play health stays with us while we abuse her and even when we gird at our fellowmen we should remember that it is of their good will alone that we still live and still have claims to honour the sins of the most innocent if they were exactly visited would ruin them to the doer and if you know any man who believes himself to be worthy of a wifes love a friends affection a mistresss caress even if venal you may rest assured he is worthy of nothing but a kicking i fear men who have no open faults what do they conceal we are not meant to be good in this world but to try to be and fail and keep on trying and when we get a cake to say thank god and when we get a buffet to say just so well hit  i have been getting some of the buffets of late but have amply earned themyou need not pity me pity sick children and the individual poor man not the mass dont pity anybody else and never pity fools the optimistic stevenson but there is a sense in these wanderings  now i have heard your letter and my sermon was not mal√†propos for you seem to be complaining everybodys home is depressing i believe it is their difficult business to make it less so there is an unpleasant saying which would have pricked me sharply at your ageyours truly       robert louis stevenson     to cosmo monkhouse        la solitude hy√®res april 24 1884  dear monkhouseif you are in love with repose here is your occasion change with me i am too blind to read hence no reading i am too weak to walk hence no walking i am not allowed to speak hence no talking but the great simplification has yet to be named for if this goes on i shall soon have nothing to eatand hence o hallelujah hence no eating the offer is a fair one i have not sold myself to the devil for i could never find him i am married but so are you i sometimes write verses but so do you come hic quies as for the commandments i have broken them so small that they are the dust of my chambers you walk upon them triturate and toothless and with the golosh of philosophy they shall not bite your heel true the tenement is falling ay friend but yours also take a larger view what is a year or two dust in the balance tis done behold you cosmo stevenson and me r l monkhouse you at hy√®res i in london you rejoicing in the clammiest repose me proceeding to tear your tabernacle into rags as i have already so admirably torn my own  my place to which i now introduce youit is yoursis like a london house high and very narrow upon the lungs i will not linger the heart is large enough for a ballroom the belly greedy and inefficient the brain stocked with the most damnable explosives like a dynamiters den the whole place is well furnished though not in a very pure taste corinthian much of it showy and not strong  about your place i shall try to find my way above an interesting exploration imagine me as i go to bed falling over a bloodstained remorse opening that cupboard in the cerebellum and being welcomed by the spirit of your murdered uncle i should probably not like your remorses i wonder if you will like mine i have a spirited assortment they whistle in my ear o nights like a northeaster i trust yours dont dine with the family mine are better mannered you will hear nought of them till 2 am except one to be sure that i have made a pet of but he is small i keep him in buttons so as to avoid commentaries you will like him muchif you like what is genuine  must we likewise change religions mine is a good article with a trick of stopping cathedral bell note ornamental dial supported by venus and the graces quite a summerparlour piety of yours since your last i fear there is little to be said  there is one article i wish to take away with me my spirits they suit me i dont want yours i like my own i have had them a long while in bottle it is my only reservationyours as you

shakes yet cannot workcannot that is flat not even verses as for prose that more active place is shut on me long since  my view of life is essentially the comic and the romantically comic as you like it is to me the most birdhaunted spot in letters tempest and twelfth night follow these are what i mean by poetry and nature i make an effort of my mind to be quite one with moli√®re except upon the stage where his inimitable jeux de sc√®ne beggar belief but you will observe they are stageplaysthings ad hoc not great olympian debauches of the heart and fancy hence more perfect and not so great then i come after great wanderings to carmosine and to fantasio to one part of la derni√®re aldini which by the by we might dramatise in a week to the notes that meredith has found evan and the postillion evan and rose harry in germany and to me these things are the good beauty touched with sex and laughter beauty with gods earth for the background tragedy does not seem to me to come off and when it does it does so by the heroic illusion the antimasque has been omitted laughter which attends on all our steps in life and sits by the deathbed and certainly redacts the epitaph laughter has been lost from these greathearted lies but the comedy which keeps the beauty and touches the terrors of our life laughter and tragedyinagoodhumour having kissed that is the last word of moved

wanted to which of these does b j refer i guess it must be the history of the scottish church i jest for of course i know it must be a book i have never read and which this makes me keen to readi mean

july 1884 stevenson took up his quarters first for a few weeks at richmond he was compelled to abandon the hope of making his permanent home at hy√®res partly by the renewed failure there of his own health partly by a bad outbreak of cholera which occurred in the old proven√ßal town about the time he left it after consultation with several doctors all of whom held out hopes of ultimate recovery despite the gravity of his present symptoms he moved to bournemouth here he found in the heaths and pinewoods some distant semblance of the landscape of his native scotland and in the sandy curves of the channel coast a passable substitute for the bays and promontories of his beloved mediterranean at all events he liked the place well enough to be willing to try it for a home and such it became for all but three years from september 1884 to august 1887 these although in the matter of health the worst and most trying years of his life were in the matter of work some of the most active and successful for the first two or three months the stevensons occupied a lodging on the west cliff called wensleydale for the next five from midnovember 1884 to midapril 1885 they were tenants of a house named bonallie towers pleasantly situated amid the pinewoods of branksome park and by its name recalling familiar midlothian associations lastly about easter 1885 they entered into occupation of a house of their own given by the elder mr stevenson as a special gift to his daughterinlaw and renamed by its new occupants skerryvore in reminiscence of one of the great lighthouse works carried out by the family firm off the scottish coast  during all the time of stevensons residence at bournemouth he was compelled to lead the life irksome to him above all men but borne with invincible spirit and patience of a chronic invalid and almost constant prisoner to the house a great part of his time had perforce to be spent in bed and there almost all his literary work was produced often for days and sometimes for whole weeks together he was forbidden to speak aloud and compelled to carry on conversation with his family and friends in whispers or with the help of pencil and paper the few excursions to a distance which he attemptedmost commonly to my house at the british museum once to cambridge once to matlock once to exeter and once in 1886 as far as paristhese excursions generally ended in a breakdown and a hurried retreat to home and bed nevertheless he was able in intervals of comparative ease to receive and enjoy the visits of friends from a distance both old and newamong the most welcome of the latter being mr henry james mr william archer and mr john s sargent while among bournemouth residents who attached themselves to him on terms of special intimacy and affection were sir percy and lady shelley and sir henry and lady taylor and their daughters  at the same time seizing and making the most of every week nay every day and hour of respite he contrived to produce work surprising under the circumstances alike by quantity and quality during the first two months of his life at bournemouth the two plays admiral guinea and beau austin were written in collaboration with mr henley and many other dramatic schemes were broached which health and leisure failed him to carry out in the course of the next few months he finished prince otto the childs garden of verses and more new arabian nights all three of which had been begun and the two first almost completed before he left hy√®res he at the same time attacked two new tasksa highway novel called the great north road and a life of wellington for a series edited by mr andrew lang both of which he had in the sequel to abandon and a third the boys story of kidnapped which in its turn had to be suspended but on its publication next year turned out one of the most brilliant of his successes  about midsummer of this year 1885 he was distressed by the sudden death of his old and kind friend professor fleeming jenkin and after a while undertook the task of writing a memoir of him to be prefixed to his collected papers towards the close of the same year he was busy with what proved to be the most popular of all his writings the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde and with the christmas story of olalla jekyll and hyde was published in january 1886 and after threatening for the first week or two to fall flat in no long time caught the attention of all classes of readers was quoted from a hundred pulpits and made the writers name familiar to multitudes both in england and america whom it had never reached before a success scarcely inferior though of another kind was made a few months afterwards by kidnapped which stevenson had taken up again in the early spring and which was published about midsummer after completing this task in march he was able to do little work during the remainder of the year except in preparing materials for the life of fleeming jenkin and in writing occasional verses which helped to make up the collection published in the following year under the title underwoods in the early autumn of the same year 1886 he took a longer and more successful excursion from home than usual staying without breakdown for two or three weeks at the monument as he always called my house at the british museum and seeing something of kindred spirits among his elders such as robert browning james russell lowell the painters burnejones and w b richmond and others who had hitherto delighted in his work and now learned to delight no less in his society  thence he went with mr henley for a short trip to paris chiefly in order to see the sculptor rodin and his old friends mr and mrs w h low from this trip he returned none the worse but during all the later autumn and winter at bournemouth was again hampered in his work by renewed and prolonged attacks of illness a further cause of trouble was the distressing failure of his fathers health and spirits attended by symptoms which plainly indicated the beginning of the end  for some weeks of april 1887 he was much taken up with a scheme which had nothing to do with literature and which the few friends to whom he confided it regarded as wildly quixotic and unwise in these years he had as we have seen taken deeply to heart both what he thought the guilty remissness of government action in the matter of the soudan garrisons and of gordon and the tameness of acquiescence with which the national conscience appeared to take the result he had been not less disturbed at the failure hitherto of successive administrations to assert the reign of law in ireland he was no blind partisan of the english cause in that country and had even written of the hereditary hatred of irish for english as a sentiment justified by the facts of history but he held strongly that private warfare the use of dynamite and the knife with the whole system of agrarian vengeances and the persecution of the weak were means which no end could justify and that redress of grievances whatever form it might ultimately take must be preceded by the reestablishment of law in more new arabian nights published the year before he had endeavoured to make dynamite ridiculous if he could not make it horrible and to the old elements of fantastic invention and humorously solemn realism in the unreal had added the new element of a witty and scornful criminal psychology a case that now appealed to him with especial force was that of the cruel persecution kept up against the widow and daughters of the murdered man curtin he determined that if no one else would take up the duty of resisting such persecution without regard to consequences he would take it up himself in the hope of more effectually rousing the public conscience to the evils of the time his plan was to go with his family occupy and live upon the derelict farm and let happen what would this as the letters referring to the matter plainly show was no irresponsible dream or whim but a purpose conceived in absolute and sober earnest his wife and household were prepared to follow though under protest had he persisted as it seemed for some weeks that he certainly would until at last the arguments of his friends and still more the unmistakable evidence that his fathers end was near persuaded him to give up his purpose but to the last i think he was never well satisfied that in giving way he had not been a coward preferring fireside ease and comfort to the call of a public duty  after spending a part of the winter at bournemouth and a part at torquay both stevensons parents returned to edinburgh in april 1887 and within a few weeks after their arrival he was summoned north to his fathers deathbed he stayed at edinburgh the short time necessary for the dispatch of business and returned to his own sickroom life at skerryvore  during the two years and nine months of stevensons residence at bournemouth preceding the date of his fathers death he had made no apparent progress towards recovery every period of respite had been quickly followed by a relapse and all his work brilliant and varied as it was had been done under conditions which would have reduced almost any other man to inactivity the close and frequently recurring struggles against the danger of death from hemorrhage and exhaustion which he had been used when they first occurred to find exciting grew in the long run merely irksome and even his persistent high courage and gaiety sustained as they were by the devoted affection of his wife and many friends began occasionally for the first time to fail him accordingly when in may 1887 the death of his father severed the strongest of the ties which bound him to the old country he was very ready to listen to the advice of his physicians who were unanimous in thinking his case not hopeless but urged him to try some complete change of climate surroundings and mode of life his wifes connections pointing to the west he thought of the mountain healthresorts of colorado and of their growing reputation for the cure of lung patients having let his house at bournemouth he accordingly took passage on board the ss ludgate hill sailing for new york from london on august 21st 1887 with his whole party consisting of his wife his widowed mother whom they had persuaded to join them his young stepson and a trusted servant valentine roch the concluding letters of the present section tell of the preparations for this departure     to mr and mrs thomas stevenson     wensleydale bournemouth sunday

earnestly desire to live this pleasant middle age into whose port we are steering is quite to my fancy i would cast anchor here and go ashore for twenty years and see the manners of the place youth was a great time but somewhat fussy now in middle age bar lucre all seems mighty placid it likes me i spy a little bright caf√© in one corner of the port in front of which i now propose we should sit down there is just enough of the bustle of the harbour and no more and the ships are close in regarding us with sternwindowsthe ships that bring deals from norway and parrots from the indies let us

alas which i have never read and cannot though i live to ninety i would god that some one else had written it by all that i can learn it is the very book for my complaint i like the way i hear it

bournemouth november 1884  my dear campbellthe books came duly to hand my wife has occupied the translation ever since nor have i yet been able to dislodge her as for the primer i have read it with a very strange result that i find no fault if you knew how dogmatic and pugnacious i stand warden on the literary art you would the more appreciate your success and mywell i will own itdisappointment for i love to put people right or wrong about the arts but what you say of tragedy and of sophocles very amply satisfies me it is well felt and well said a little less technically than it is my weakness to desire to see it put but clear and adequate you are very right to express your admiration for the resource displayed in oedipus king it is a miracle would it not have been well to mention voltaires interesting onslaught a thing which gives the best lesson of the difference of neighbour artssince all his criticisms which had been fatal to a narrative do not amount among them to exhibit one flaw in this masterpiece of drama for the drama it is perfect though such a fable in a romance might make the reader crack his sides so imperfect so ethereally slight is the verisimilitude required of these conventional rigid and eggdancing arts  i was sorry to see no more of you but shall conclude by hoping for better luck next time my wife begs to be remembered to both of youyours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      the arabs mentioned below are the stories comprised in the volume    more new arabian nights the dynamiter written by stevenson and    his wife in collaboration       wensleydale bournemouth november 1884  dear henleywe are all to pieces in health and heavily handicapped with arabs i have a dreadful cough whose attacks leave me √¶tat 90 i never let up on the arabs all the same and rarely get less than eight pages out of hand though hardly able to come downstairs for twittering knees  i shall put in s letter he says so little of his circumstances that i am in an impossibility to give him advice more specific than a copybook give him my love however and tell him it is the mark of the parochial gentleman who has never travelled to find all wrong in a foreign land let him hold on and he will find one country as good as another and in the meanwhile let him resist the fatal british tendency to communicate his dissatisfaction with a country to its inhabitants tis a good idea but it somehow fails to please in a fortnight if i can keep my spirit in the box at all i should be nearly through this arabian desert so can tackle something freshyours ever       r l s     to w h low      it was some twenty months since the plan of publishing the childs    garden in the first instance as a picturebook had been mooted see    above pp 18 foll but it had never taken effect and in the    following march the volume appeared without illustrations in england    and also i believe in america        bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth hants england          first week in november i guess 1884  my dear lownow look here the above is my address for three months i hope continue on your part if you please to write to edinburgh which is safe but if mrs low thinks of coming to england she might take a run down from london four hours from waterloo main line and stay a day or two with us among the pines if not i hope it will be only a pleasure deferred till you can join her  my childrens verses will be published here in a volume called a childs garden the sheets are in hand i will see if i cannot send you the lot so that you might have a bit of a start in that case i would do nothing to publish in the states and you might try an illustrated edition there which if the book went fairly over here might when ready be imported but of this more fully ere long you will see some verses of mine in the last magazine of art with pictures by a young lady rather pretty i think if we find a market for phasellulus loquitur we can try another i hope it isnt necessary to put the verse into that rustic printing i am philistine enough to prefer clean printers type indeed i can form no idea of the verses thus transcribed by the incult and tottering hand of the draughtsman nor gather any impression beyond one of weariness to the eyes yet the other day in the century i saw it imputed as a crime to vedder that he had not thus travestied omar khayy√†m we live in a rum age of music without airs stories without incident pictures without beauty american wood engravings that should have been etchings and drypoint etchings that ought to have been mezzotints i think of giving em literature without words and i believe if you were to try invisible illustration it would enjoy a considerable vogue so long as an artist is on his head is painting with a flute or writes with an etchers needle or conducts the orchestra with a meataxe all is well and plaudits shower along with roses but any plain man who tries to follow the obtrusive canons of his art is but a commonplace figure to hell with him is the motto or at least not that for he will have his reward but he will never be thought a person of parts  january 3 1885and here has this been lying near two months i have failed to get together a preliminary copy of the childs verses for you in spite of doughty efforts but yesterday i sent you the first sheet of the definitive edition and shall continue to send the others as they come if you can and care to work themwhy so well if not i send you fodder but the time presses for though i will delay a little over the proofs and though it is even possible they may delay the english issue until easter it will certainly not be later therefore perpend and do not get caught out of course if you can do pictures it will be a great pleasure to me to see our names joined and more than that a great advantage as i dare say you may be able to make a bargain for some share a little less spectral than the common for the poor author but this is all as you shall choose i give you carte blanche to do or not to doyours most sincerely       robert louis stevenson   o sargent has been and painted my

that is where the childless man rejoices although to confess fully my whole philosophy of life renounces these renunciations i am persuaded we gain nothing in the least comparable to what we lose by holding back the hand from any province of life the intrigue the imbroglio such as it is was made for the plunger and not for the teetotaller and anyway i hope your news is good  i have nearly finished lawsons most lively pamphlet it is very clear and interesting for myself i am in our housea home of our own in a most lovely situation among forest trees where i hope you will come and see us and find me in a repaired and more comfortable conditiongreatly pleased with itrather hardup verging on the deadbrokeand full tilt at hammering up some new arabians for the pot  i wonder what you do without regular habits of work i am capable of only two theories of existence the industrious workers the spreesters all between seems blank to me we grow too old and i at least am too much deteriorated for the last and the first becomes a bedrock necessary my father is in a gloomy state and has the yellow flag at the peak or the fore or wherever it should be and he has just emptied some melancholy vials on me i am also by way of change spitting blood this somewhat clouds the termination of my noteyours ever affectionately       robert louis stevenson     to thomas stevenson      about this time mr stevenson was in some hesitation as to letting    himself be proposed for the office of president of the royal society    of edinburgh       bonallie towers bournemouth november 1884  my dear fatheri have no hesitation in recommending you to let your name go up please yourself about an address though i think if we could meet we could arrange something suitable what you propose would be well enough in a way but so modest as to suggest a whine from that point of view it would be better to change a little but this whether we meet or not we must discuss tait chrystal the royal society and i all think you amply deserve this honour and far more it is not the true blue to call this serious compliment a trial you should be glad of this recognition as for resigning that is easy enough if found necessary but to refuse would be husky and unsatisfactory sic subs       r l s   my cold is still very heavy but i carry it well fanny is very very much out of sorts principally through perpetual misery with me i fear i have been a little in the dumps which as you know sir is a very great sin i must try to be more cheerful but my cough is so severe that i have sometimes most exhausting nights and very peevish wakenings however this shall be remedied and last night i was distinctly better than the night before there is my dear mr stevenson so i moralise blandly as we sit together on the devils gardenwall no more abominable sin than this gloom this plaguy peevishness why say i what matters it if we be a little uncomfortablethat is no reason for mangling our unhappy wives and then i turn and girn on the unfortunate cassandrayour fellow culprit       r l s     to thomas stevenson      mr stevenson the elder had read the play of admiral guinea    written in september by his son and mr henley in collaboration and    had protested with his usual vehemence of feeling and expression    against the stage confrontation of profane blackguardry in the person    of pew with evangelical piety in that of the reformed slaving captain    who gives his name to the piece       bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth the three bs         november 5 1884  my dear fatherallow me to say in a strictly pickwickian sense that you are a silly fellow i am pained indeed but how should i be offended i think you exaggerate i cannot forget that you had the same impression of the deacon and yet when you saw it played were less revolted than you looked for and i will still hope that the admiral also is not so bad as you suppose there is one point however where i differ from you very frankly religion is in the world i do not think you are the man to deny the importance of its r√¥le and i have long decided not to leave it on one side in art the opposition of the admiral and mr pew is not to my eyes either horrible or irreverent but it may be and it probably is very ill done what then this is a failure better luck next time more power to the elbow more discretion more wisdom in the design and the old defeat becomes the scene of the new victory concern yourself about no failure they do not cost lives as in engineering they are the pierres perdues of successes fame is truly a vapour do not think of it if the writer means well and tries hard no failure will injure him whether with god or man  i wish i could hear a brighter account of yourself but i am inclined to acquit the admiral of having a share in the responsibility my very heavy cold is i hope drawing off and the change to this charming house in the forest will i hope complete my reestablishmentwith love to all believe me your ever affectionate       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley     bonallie towers bournemouth november 11 1884  dear boyi have been nearly smashed altogether fever and chills with really very considerable suffering and to my deep gloom and some fear about the future work has had to stop there was no way out of it yesterday and today nothing would come it was a mere waste of tissue productive of spoiled paper  i hope it will not last long for the bumbaily is panting at my rump and when i turn a scared eye across my shoulder i behold his talons quivering above my frockcoat tails  gosse has writ to offer me ¬£40 for a christmas number ghost story for the pall mall eight thousand words i have with some conditions accepted i pray heaven i may be able to do it but i am not sure that my incapacity to work is wholly due to illness i believe the morphine i have been taking for my bray may have a hand in it it moderates the bray but i think sews up the donkey  i think my wife is a little better if only i could get in trim and get this work done i should be quite chipper       r l s     to charles baxter      the two next letters on the same subject are written in the styles    and characters of the two edinburgh exelders johnstone or johnson    and thomson alternately       bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth november 11 1884  my dear charlesi am in my new house thus proudly styled as you perceive but the deevil a tower ava can be perceived except out of window this is not as it should be one might have hoped at least a turret we are all vilely unwell i put in the dark watches imitating a donkey with some success but little pleasure and in the afternoon i indulge in a smart fever accompanied by aches and shivers there is thus little monotony to be deplored i at least am a regular invalid i would scorn to bray in the afternoon i would indignantly refuse the proposal to fever in the night what is bred in the bone will come out sir in the flesh and the same spirit that prompted me to date my letter regulates the hour and character of my attacksi am sir yours       thomson     to miss ferrier

and referred me to his big brother and the big brother refused to move so i slept upon the field of battle paraded sang te deum and came home after a review rather than a campaign  please tell campbell i got his letter the wild woman of the west has been much amiss and complaining sorely i hope nothing more serious is wrong with her than just my illhealth and consequent anxiety and labour

nov 13 1884  my dear boya thousand thanks for the moli√®re i have already read in this noble presentment la comtesse descarbaguas le malade imaginaire and a part of les femmes savantes i say poquelin took damned good care of himself argan and arysule what parts many thanks also for john silvers pistol i recognise it that was the one he gave jim hawkins at the mouth of the pit i shall get a plate put upon it to that effect  my birthday was a great success i was better in health i got delightful presents i received the definite commission from the pmg and began to write the tale and in the evening bob arrived a simple seraph we have known each other ten years and here we are too like the pair that met in the infirmary why can we not mellow into kindness and sweetness like bob what is the reason does nature even in my octogenarian carcase run too strong that i must be still a bawler and a brawler and a treader upon corns you at least have achieved the miracle of embellishing your personal appearance to that point that unless your mother is a woman of even more perspicacity than i suppose it is morally impossible that she can recognise you when i saw you ten years ago you looked rough andkind of stigmatised a look of an embittered political shoemaker where is it now you now come waltzing around like some lighthearted monarch essentially jovial essentially royal radiant of smiles and in the meanwhile by a complementary process i turn into a kind of hunchback with white hair the devil  well let us be thankful for our mercies in these ten years what a change from the cell in the hospital and the two sick boys in the next bed to the influence the recognition the liberty and the happiness of today well well fortune is not so blind as people say you dreed a good long weird but you have got into a fine green paddock now to kick your heels in and i too what a difference what a difference in my work in my situation and unfortunately also in my health but one need not complain of a pebble in the shoe when by mere justice one should rot in a dungeon  many thanks to both of you long life to our friendship and that means i do most firmly believe to these clay continents on which we fly our colours good luck to one and all and may god continue to be mercifulyour old and warm friend       r l s     to edmund gosse      stevenson had been unable to finish for the pall mall christmas    number the tale he had first intended had tried the publishers with    markheim afterwards printed in the collection called merry men    which proved too short had then furbished up as well as he could a    tale drafted in the pitlochry days the body snatcher which was    advertised in the streets of london by sandwichmen carrying posters    so horrific that they were suppressed if i remember right by the    police stevenson rightly thought the tale not up to his best mark    and would not take the full payment which had been bargained for his    correspondent was just about to start on a tour to the united states       bonallie towers bournemouth nov 15 1884  my dear gossethis mr morley12 of yours is a most desperate fellow he has sent me for my opinion the most truculent advertisement i ever saw in which the white hairs of gladstone are dragged round troy behind my chariot wheels what can i say i say nothing to him and to you i content myself with remarking that he seems a desperate fellow  all luck to you on your american adventure may you find health wealth and entertainment if you see as you likely will frank r stockton pray greet him from me in words to this effect    my stockton if i failed to like     it were a sheer depravity   for i went down with the thomas hyke     and up with the negative gravity  i adore these tales  i hear flourishing accounts of your success at cambridge so you leave with a good omen remember me to green corn if it is in season if not you had better hang yourself on a sour apple tree for your voyage has been lostyours affectionately       robert louis stevenson     to austin dobson      written in acknowledgment of the gift of a desk       bonallie towers bournemouth december 1884   dear dobsonset down my delay to your own fault i wished to acknowledge such a gift from you in some of my inapt and slovenly rhymes but you should have sent me your pen and not your desk the verses stand up to the axles in a miry crossroad whence the coursers of the sun shall never draw them hence i am constrained to this uncourtliness that i must appear before one of the kings of that country of rhyme without my singing robes for less than this if we may trust the book of esther favourites have tasted death but i conceive the kingdom of the muses mildlier mannered and in particular that county which you administer and which i seem to see as a halfsuburban land a land of hollyhocks and country houses a land where at night in thorny and sequestered bypaths you will meet masqueraders going to a ball in their sedans and the rector steering homeward by the light of his lantern a land of the windmill and the west wind and the flowering hawthorn with a little scented letter in the hollow of its trunk and the kites flying over all in the season of kites and the far away blue spires of a cathedral city  will you forgive me then for my delay and accept my thanks not only for your present but for the letter which followed it and which perhaps i more particularly value and believe me to be with much admiration yours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      stevenson and his wife were still busy on more new arabian nights    the romance of the great north road having been begun and    postponed the question here touched is to what publishers should    they be offered       bonallie towers bournemouth december 1884  dear ladfor cassell i thought the gnr not railway this time was the motto what are cassells to do with this eccentric mass of blague and seriousness their poor auld pows will a turn white as snaw man they would skriegh with horror you see the lot of tales is now coming to a kind of bearing they are being quite rehandled all the three intercalary narratives have been condemned and are being replacedtwo by picturesque and highly romantic adventures one by a comic tale of character and the thing as it goes together so far is i do think singularly varied and vivid coming near to laughter and touching tears  will cassell stand it no  et de deux  i vote for the syndicate and to give cassell the north road when done et sic subscr       r l s   my health is better i never sleep to be sure cawdor hath butchered sleep and i am twinged a bit by aches and rheumatism but i get my five to seven hours of work and if that is not health it is the nearest i am like to have     to henry james      the following to mr henry james refers to the essay of r l s    called a humble remonstrance which had just appeared in longmans    magazine mr james had written holding out the prospect of a    continuance of the friendly controversy which had thus been opened up    between them on the aims and qualities of fiction       bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth december 8 1884  my dear henry jamesthis is a very brave hearing from more points than one the first point is that there is a hope of a sequel for this i laboured seriously from the dearth of information and thoughtful interest in the art of literature those who try to practise it with any deliberate purpose run the risk of finding no fit audience people suppose it is the stuff that interests them they think for instance that the prodigious fine thoughts and sentiments in shakespeare impress by their own weight not understanding that the unpolished diamond is but a stone they think that striking situations or good dialogue are got by studying life they will not rise to understand that they are prepared by deliberate artifice and set off by painful suppressions now i want the whole thing well ventilated for my own education and the publics and i beg you to look as quick as you can to follow me up with every circumstance of defeat where we differ and to prevent the flouting of the laity to emphasise the points where we agree i trust your paper will show me the way to a rejoinder and that rejoinder i shall hope to make with so much art as to woo or drive you from your threatened silence i would not ask better than to pass my life in beating out this quarter of corn with such a seconder as yourself  point the secondi am rejoiced indeed to hear you speak so kindly of my work rejoiced and surprised i seem to myself a very rude lefthanded countryman not fit to be read far less complimented by a man so accomplished so adroit so craftsmanlike as you you will happily never have cause to understand the despair with which a writer like myself considers say the park scene in lady barberina every touch surprises me by its intangible precision and the effect when done as light as syllabub as distinct as a picture fills me with envy each man among us prefers his own aim and i prefer mine but when we come to speak of performance i recognise myself compared with you to be a lout and slouch of the first water  where we differ both as to the design of stories and the delineation of character i begin to lament of course i am not so dull as to ask you to desert your walk but could you not in one novel to oblige a sincere admirer and to enrich his shelves with a beloved volume could you not and might you not cast your characters in a mould a little more abstract and academic dear mrs pennyman had already among your other work a taste of what i mean and pitch the incidents i do not say in any stronger but in a slightly more emphatic keyas it were an episode from one of the old socalled novels of adventure i fear you will not and i suppose i must sighingly admit you to be right and yet when i see as it were a book of tom jones handled with your exquisite precision and shot through with those sidelights of reflection in which you excel i relinquish the dear vision with regret think upon it  as you know i belong to that besotted class of man the invalid this puts me to a stand in the way of visits but it is possible that some day you may feel that a day near the sea and among pinewoods would be a pleasant change from town if so please let us know and my wife and i will be delighted to put you up and give you what we can to eat and drink i have a fair bottle of clareton the back of which believe me yours sincerely       robert louis stevenson   psi reopen this to say that i have reread my paper and cannot think i have at all succeeded in being either veracious or polite i knew of course that i took your paper merely as a pin to hang my own remarks upon but alas what a thing is any paper what fine remarks can you not hang on mine how i have sinned against proportion and with every effort to the contrary against the merest rudiments of courtesy to you you are indeed a very acute reader to have divined the real attitude of my mind and i can only conclude not without closed eyes and shrinking shoulders in the wellworn words    lay on macduff     to mr and mrs thomas stevenson        bonallie towers bournemouth december 9 1884  my dear peoplethe dreadful tragedy of the pall mall has come to a happy but ludicrous ending i am to keep the money the tale writ for them is to be buried certain fathoms deep and they are to flash out before the world with our old friend of kinnaird the body snatcher when you come please to bring    1 my montaigne or at least the two last volumes    2 my milton in the three vols in green    3 the shakespeare that babington sent me for a weddinggift    4 hazlitts table talk and plain speaker  if you care to get a box of books from douglas and foulis let them be solid croker papers correspondence of napoleon history of henry iv langs folk lore would be my desires  i had a charming letter from henry james about my longman paper i did not understand queries about the verses the pictures to the seagull i thought charming those to the second have left me with a pain in my poor belly and a swimming in the head  about money i am afloat and no more and i warn you unless i have great luck i shall have to fall upon you at the new year like a hundredweight of bricks doctor rent chemist are all threatening sickness has bitterly delayed my work and unless as i say i have the mischiefs luck i shall completely break down verbum sapientibus i do not live cheaply and i question if i ever shall but if only i had a halfpenny worth of health i could now easily suffice the last breakdown of my head is what makes this bankruptcy probable  fanny is still out of sorts bogue better self fair but a stranger to the blessings of sleepever affectionate son       r l s     to w e henley        bonallie towers bournemouth december 1884  dear ladi have made up my mind about the p m g and send you a copy which please keep or return as for not giving a reduction what are we are we artists or city men why do we sneer at stockbrokers o nary i will not take the ¬£40 i took that as a fair price for my best work i was not able to produce my best and i will be damned if i steal with my eyes open sufficit this is my lookout as for the paper being rich certainly it is but i am honourable it is no more above me in money than the poor slaveys and cads from whom i look for honesty are below me am i pepys that because i can find the countenance of some of our ablest merchants that becauseandpour forth languid twaddle and get paid for it i too should cheerfully continue to steal i am not pepys i do not live much to god and honour but i will not wilfully turn my back on both i am like all the rest of us falling ever lower from the bright ideas i began with falling into greed into idleness into middleaged and slippered fireside cowardice but is it you my bold blade that i hear crying this sordid and rank twaddle in my ear preaching the dankest grundyism and upholding the rank customs of our tradeyou who are so cruel hard upon the customs of the publishers o man look at the beam in our own eyes and whatever else you do do not plead satans cause or plead it for all either embrace the bad or respect the good when you see a poor devil trying for it if this is the honesty of authorsto take what you can get and console yourself because publishers are richtake my name from the rolls of that association tis a caucus of weaker thieves jealous of the strongerever yours       the roaring r l s   you will see from the enclosed that i have stuck to what i think my dues pretty tightly in spite of this

university       bonallie towers bournemouth dec 1884  my dear coggiewe are very much distressed to hear of this which has befallen your family as for sir alexander i can but speak from my own feelings he survived to finish his book and to conduct with such a great success the tercentenary ah how many die just upon the threshold had he died a year ago how great a disappointment but all this is nothing to the survivors do please as soon as you are able let us know how it goes and how it is likely to go with the family and believe that both my wife and i are most anxious to have good news or the best possible my poor coggie i know very well how you must feel you are passing a bad time  our news must seem very impertinent we have both been ill i pretty bad my wife pretty well down but i at least am better the bogue who is let out every night for half an hours yapping is anchored in the moonlight just before the door and under the belief that he is watchdog at a lone farm beleaguered by mosstroopers is simply raising cain  i can add nothing more but just that we wish to hear as soon as you have nothing else to donot to hurry of courseif it takes three months no matterbut bear us in mind       r l s     to w e henley        bonallie towers bournemouth winter 1884  my dear ladhere was i in bed not writing not hearing and finding myself gently and agreeably ill used and behold i learn you are bad yourself get your wife to send us a word how you are i am better decidedly bogue got his christmas card and behaved well for three days after it may interest the cynical to learn that i started my last hemorrhage by too sedulous attentions to my dear bogue the stick was broken and that night bogue who was attracted by the extraordinary aching of his bones and is always inclined to a serious view of his own ailments announced with his customary pomp that he was dying in this case however it was not the dog that died he had tried to bite his mothers ankles i have written a long and peculiarly solemn paper on the technical elements of style it is pathbreaking and epochmaking but i do not think the public will be readily convoked to its perusal did i tell you that s c had risen to the paper on james at last o but i was pleased hes like johnnie been lang lang o comin but here he is he will not object to my future manoeuvres in the same field as he has to my former all the family are here my father better than i have seen him these two years my mother the same as ever i do trust you are better and i am yours ever       r l s     to h a jones        bonallie towers bournemouth dec 30 1884  dear siri am so accustomed to hear nonsense spoken about all the arts and the drama in particular that i cannot refrain from saying thank you for your paper in my answer to mr james in the december longman you may see that i have merely touched i think in a parenthesis on the drama but i believe enough was said to indicate our agreement in essentials  wishing you power and health to further enunciate and to act upon these principles believe me dear sir yours truly       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      stevenson had begun with great eagerness to prepare material for a    volume on the duke of wellington for the series of english worthies    published by messrs longman and edited by mr andrew lang but    beyond preparation the scheme never went       bonallie towers bournemouth jan 4 1885  dear s ci am on my feet again and getting on my boots to do the iron duke conceive my glee i have refused the ¬£100 and am to get some sort of royalty not yet decided instead tis for longmans english worthies edited by a lang aw haw haw  now look here could you get me a loan of the despatches or is that a dream i should have to mark passages i fear and certainly note pages on the fly if you think it a dream will bain get me a secondhand copy or who would the sooner and cheaper i can get it the better if there is anything in your weird library that bears on either the man or the period put it in a mortar and fire it here instanter i shall catch i shall want of course an infinity of books among which any lives there may be a

l stevenson     to thomas stevenson      stevenson had been asked by his father to look over the proofs of a    paper which the latter was about to read as president of the royal    society of edinburgh on the principal causes of silting in    estuaries in connection with the manchester ship canal scheme       bonallie towers bournemouth 14th january 1885  my dear fatheri am glad you like the changes i own i was pleased with my hands darg you may observe i have corrected several errors which you may tell mr dick he had allowed to pass his eagle eye i wish there may be none in mine at least the order is better the second title some new engineering questions involved in the m s c scheme of last session of p likes me the best i think it a very good paper and i am vain enough to think i have materially helped to polish the diamond i ended by feeling quite proud of the paper as if it had been mine the next time you have as good a one i will overhaul it for the wages of feeling as clever as i did when i had managed to understand and helped to set it clear i wonder if i anywhere misapprehended you i rather think not at the last at the first shot i know i missed a point or two some of what may appear to you to be wanton changes a little study will show to be necessary  yes carlyle was ashamed of himself as few men have been and let all carpers look at what he did he prepared all these papers for publication with his own hand all his wifes complaints all the evidence of his own misconduct who else would have done so much is repentance which god accepts to have no avail with men nor even with the dead i have heard too much against the thrawn discomfortable dog dead he is and we may be glad of it but he was a better man than most of us no less patently than he was a worse to fill the world with whining is against all my views i do not like impiety butbutthere are two sides to all things and the old scalded baby had his noble sideever affectionate son       r l s     to sidney colvin        bonallie towers bournemouth january 1885  dear s ci have addressed a letter to the g o m √† propos of wellington and i became aware you will be interested to hear of an overwhelming respect for the old gentleman i can blaguer his failures but when you actually address him and bring the two statures and records to confrontation dismay is the result by mere continuance of years he must impose the man who helped to rule england before i was conceived strikes me with a new sense of greatness and antiquity when i must actually beard him with the cold forms of correspondence i shied at the necessity of calling him plain sir had he been my lord i had been happier no i am no equalitarian honour to whom honour is due and if to none why then honour to the old  these o slade professor are my unvarnished sentiments i was a little surprised to find them so extreme and therefore i communicate the fact  belabour thy brains as to whom it would be well to question i have a small space i wish to make a popular book nowhere obscure nowhere if it can be helped unhuman it seems to me the most hopeful plan to tell the tale so far as may be by anecdote he did not die till so recently there must be hundreds who remember him and thousands who have still ungarnered stories dear man to the breach up soldier of the iron dook up slades and at em which conclusively he did not say the at emic theory is to be dismissed you know piles of fellows who must reek with matter help help i am going to try happyandgloriouslongtoreignoverus hm must remember things and it is my belief if my letter could be discreetly introduced she would like to tell them so i jest when i dont address my mind to it when i do shall i be smit louting to my knee as before the g o m probl√®meyours ever       r l s     to sidney colvin      in the two following letters are expressed some of the distress and    bitterness with which in common with most englishmen stevenson felt    the circumstances of gordons abandonment in the soudan and the    failure of the belated attempt to rescue him the advice to go on    with my book refers if i remember right to some scheme for the    republication in book form of stray magazine papers of mine of a more    or less personal or biographical nature       bonallie towers bournemouth february 1885  my dear colvinyou are indeed a backward correspondent and much may be said against you but in this weather and o dear in this political scene of degradation much must be forgiven i fear england is dead of burgessry and only walks about galvanised i do not love to think of my countrymen these days nor to remember myself why was i silent i feel i have no right to blame any one but i wont write to the g o m i do really not see my way to any form of signature unless your fellow criminal in the eyes of god which might disquiet the proprieties  about your book i have always said go on the drawing of character is a different thing from publishing the details of a private career no one objects to the first or should object if his name be not put upon it at the other i draw the line in a preface if you chose you might distinguish it is besides a thing for which you are eminently well equipped and which you would do with taste and incision i long to see the book people like themselves to explain a little more no one likes his life which is a misbegotten issue and a tale of failure to see these failures either touched upon or coasted to get the idea of a spying eye and blabbing tongue about the house is to lose all privacy in life to see that thing which we do love our character set forth is ever gratifying see how my talk and talkers went every one liked his own portrait and shrieked about other peoples so it will be with yours if you are the least true to the essential the sitter will be pleased very likely not his friends and that from various motives       r l s   when will your holiday be i sent your letter to my wife and forget keep us in mind and i hope we shall be able to receive you     to j a symonds        bonallie towers bournemouth february 1885  my dear symondsyes we have both been very neglectful i had horrid luck catching two thundering influenzas in august and november i recovered from the last with difficulty but have come through this blustering winter with some general success in the house up and down my wife however has been painfully upset by my health last year of course was cruelly trying to her nerves nice and hy√®res are bad experiences and though she is not ill the doctor tells me that prolonged anxiety may do her a real mischief  i feel a little old and fagged and chary of speech and not very sure of spirit in my work but considering what a year i have passed and how i have twice sat on charons pierhead i am surprising  my father has presented us with a very pretty home in this place into which we hope to move by may my childs verses come out next week otto begins to appear in april more new arabian nights as soon as possible moreover i am neck deep in wellington also a story on the stocks the great north road o i am busy lloyd is at college in edinburgh that is i think all that can be said by way of news  have you read huckleberry finn it contains many excellent things above all the whole story of a healthy boys dealings with his conscience incredibly well done  my own conscience is badly seared a want of piety yet i pray for it tacitly every day believing it after courage the only gift worth having and its want in a man of any claims to honour quite unpardonable the tone of your letter seemed to me very sound in these dark days of public dishonour i do not know that one can do better than carry our private trials piously what a picture is this of a nation no man that i can see on any side or party seems to have the least sense of our ineffable shame the desertion of the garrisons i tell my little parable that germany took england and then there was an indian mutiny and bismarck said quite right let delhi and calcutta and bombay fall and let the women and children be treated sepoy fashion and people say o but that is very different and then i wish i were dead millais i hear was painting gladstone when the news came of gordons death millais was much affected and gladstone said why it is the mans own temerity voil√† le bourgeois le voil√† nu but why should i blame gladstone when i too am a bourgeois when i have held my peace why did i hold my peace because i am a sceptic ie a bourgeois we believe in nothing symonds you dont and i dont and these are two reasons out of a handful of millions why england stands before the world dripping with blood and daubed with dishonour i will first try to take the beam out of my own eye trusting that even private effort somehow betters and braces the general atmosphere see for example if england has shown i put it hypothetically one spark of manly sensibility they have been shamed into it by the spectacle of gordon policeofficer cole is the only man that i see to admire i dedicate my new arabs to him and cox in default of other great public charactersyours ever most affectionately       robert louis stevenson     to edmund gosse      the following refers to an edition of gray with notes and a short    prefatory life by mr gosse and to the publication of the childs    garden of verses       bonallie towers bournemouth march 12 1885  my dear gossei was indeed much exercised how i could be worked into gray and lo when i saw it the passage seemed to have been written with a single eye to elucidate theworstwell not a very good poem of grays your little life is excellent clean neat efficient i have read many of your notes too with pleasure your connection with gray was a happy circumstance it was a suitable conjunction  i did not answer your letter from the states for what was i to say i liked getting it and reading it i was rather flattered that you wrote it to me and then ill tell you what i didi put it in the fire why well just because it was very natural and expansive and thinks i to myself if i die one of these fine nights this is just the letter that gosse would not wish to go into the hands of third parties was i well inspired and i did not answer it because you were in your high places sailing with supreme dominion and seeing life in a particular glory and i was peddling in a corner confined to the house overwhelmed with necessary work which i was not always doing well and in the very mild form in which the disease approaches me touched with a sort of bustling cynicism why throw cold water how ape your agreeable frame of mind in short i held my tongue  i have now published on 101 small pages the complete proof of mr r l stevensons incapacity to write verse in a series of graduated examples with table of contents i think i shall issue a companion volume of exercises analyse this poem collect and comminate the ugly words distinguish and condemn the chevilles state mr stevensons faults of taste in regard to the measure what reasons can you gather from this example for your belief that mr s is unable to write any other measure  they look ghastly in the cold light of print but there is something nice in the little ragged regiment for all the blackguards seem to me to smile to have a kind of childish treble note that sounds in my ears freshly not song if you will but a childs voice  i was glad you enjoyed your visit to the states most englishmen go there with a confirmed design of patronage as they go to france for that matter and patronage will not pay besides in this year ofgrace said iof disgrace who should creep so low as an englishman it is not to be thought of that the floodah wordsworth you would change your note were you alive today  i am now a beastly householder but have not yet entered on my domain when i do the social revolution will probably cast me back upon my dung heap there is a person called hyndman whose eye is on me his step is behynd me as i go i shall call my house skerryvore when i get it skerryvore cest bon pour la po√©shie i will conclude with

of a forthcoming illustrated    edition of keatss lamia       bonallie towers bournemouth march 13 1885  my dear lowyour success has been immense i wish your letter had come two days ago otto alas has been disposed of a good while ago but it was only day before yesterday that i settled the new volume of arabs however for the future you and the sons of the deified scribner are the men for me really they have behaved most handsomely i cannot lay my hand on the papers or i would tell you exactly how it compares with my english bargain but it compares well ah if we had that copyright i do believe it would go far to make me solvent illhealth and all  i wrote you a letter to the rembrandt in which i stated my views about the dedication in a very brief form it will give me sincere pleasure and will make the second dedication i have received the other being from john addington symonds it is a compliment i value much i dont know any that i should prefer  i am glad to hear you have windows to do that is a fine business i think but alas the glass is so bad nowadays realism invading even that as well as the huge inferiority of our technical resource corrupting every tint still anything that keeps a man to decoration is in this age good for the artists spirit  by the way have you seen james and me on the novel james i think in the august or septemberr l s in the december longman i own i think the √©cole b√™te of which i am the champion has the whip hand of the argument but as james is to make a rejoinder i must not boast anyway the controversy is amusing to see i was terribly tied down to space which has made the end congested and dull i shall see if i can afford to send you the april contemporarybut i dare say you see it anywayas it will contain a paper of mine on style a sort of continuation of old arguments on art in which you have wagged a most effective tongue it is a sort of start upon my treatise on the art of literature a small arid book that shall some day appear  with every good wish from me and mine should i not say she and hers to you and yours believe me yours ever       robert louis stevenson     to pg hamerton      the work of his correspondents which r l s notices in the    following is the sumptuous volume landscape seeley  co 1885    the passages specially referred to will be found pp 4662 of that    work       bournemouth march 16 1885  my dear hamertonvarious things have been reminding me of my misconduct first swans application for your address second a sight of the sheets of your landscape book and last your note to swan which he was so kind as to forward i trust you will never suppose me to be guilty of anything more serious than an idleness partially excusable my illhealth makes my rate of life heavier than i can well meet and yet stops me from earning more my conscience sometimes perhaps too easily stifled but still for my time of life and the public manners of the age fairly well alive forces me to perpetual and almost endless transcriptions on the back of all this my correspondence hangs like a thundercloud and just when i think i am getting through my troubles crack down goes my health i have a long costly sickness and begin the world again it is fortunate for me i have a father or i should long ago have died but the opportunity of the aid makes the necessity none the more welcome my father has presented me with a beautiful house hereor so i believe for i have not yet seen it being a cage bird but for nocturnal sorties in the garden i hope we shall soon move into it and i tell myself that some day perhaps we may have the pleasure of seeing you as our guest i trust at least that you will take me as i am a thoroughly bad correspondent and a man a hater indeed of rudeness in others but too often rude in all unconsciousness himself and that you will never cease to believe the sincere sympathy and admiration that i feel for you and for your work  about the landscape which i had a glimpse of while a friend of mine was preparing a review i was greatly interested and could write and wrangle for a year on every page one passage particularly delighted me the part about ulyssesjolly then you know that is just what i fear i have come to think landscape ought to be in literature so there we should be at odds or perhaps not so much as i suppose as montaigne says it is a pot with two handles and i own i am wedded to the technical handle which i likewise own and freely you do well to keep for a mistress i should much like to talk with you about some other points it is only in talk that one gets to understand your delightful wordsworth trap i have tried on two hardened wordsworthians not that i am not one myself by covering up the context and asking them to guess what the passage was both and both are very clever people one a writer one a painter pronounced it a guidebook do you think it an unusually good guidebook i asked and both said no not at all their grimace was a picture when i showed the original  i trust your health and that of mrs hamerton keep better your last account was a poor one i was unable to make out the visit i had hoped as i do not know if you heard of it i had a very violent and dangerous hemorrhage last spring i am almost glad to have seen death so close with all my wits about me and not in the customary lassitude and disenchantment of disease even thus clearly beheld i find him not so terrible as we suppose but indeed with the passing of years the decay of strength the loss of all my old active and pleasant habits there grows more and more upon me that belief in the kindness of this scheme of things and the goodness of our veiled god which is an excellent and pacifying compensation i trust if your health continues to trouble you you may find some of the same belief but perhaps my fine discovery is a piece of art and belongs to a character cowardly intolerant of certain feelings and apt to selfdeception i dont think so however and when i feel what a weak and fallible vessel i was thrust into this hurlyburly and with what marvellous kindness the wind has been tempered to my frailties i think i should be a strange kind of ass to feel anything but gratitude  i do not know why i should inflict this talk upon you but when i summon the rebellious pen he must go his own way i am no michael scott to rule the fiend of correspondence most days he will none of me and when he comes it is to rape me where he willyours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      stevenson was by this time beginning to realise that work at    playwriting in collaboration with mr henley was doing much more to    exhaust his strength than to replenish either of their purses and    mr henley who had built hopes of fame and fortune on their    collaboration was very unwilling to face the fact       bournemouth march 1885  my dear ladthat is all right and a good job about coming down you cannot get into us for a while as you may imagine we are in desperate vortex and everybody most dead i have been two days in bed with liver and slight bleeding  do you think you are right to send macaire and the admiral about not a copy have i sent nor speaking for myself personally do i want sent the reperusal of the admiral by the way was a sore blow eh god man it is a low black dirty blackguard ragged piece vomitable in many partssimply vomitable pew is in places a reproach to both art and man but of all that afterwards what i mean is that i believe in playing dark with second and thirdrate work macaire is a piece of jobwork hurriedly bockled might have been worse might have been better happygolucky act it orletitrot piece of business not a thing i think to send in presentations do not let us gober ourselvesand above all not gober dam potboilersand pbs with an obvious flaw and hole in them such as is our unrealised bertrand in this one but of this also on a meeting  i am not yet done with my proofs i am sorry to say so soon as i am i must tackle kidnapped seriously or be content to have no bread which you would scarcely recommend it is all i shall be able to do to wait for the young folk money on which ill have to live as best i can till the book comes in  plays at that rate i do not think i can possibly look at before july so let that be a guide to you in your views july or august or september or thereabouts these must be our times whichever we attack i think you had better suspend a visit till we can take you in and till i can speak it seems a considerable waste of money above all as just now i could not even offer you meals with my woman in such a state of overwork my father and mother have had to go to lodgingspost       r l s     to w e henley        bournemouth march 1885  dear ladmuch better but rather unequal to do what i ought a common complaint the change of weather much helped me not too soon  i have thought as well as i could of what you said and i come unhesitatingly to the opinion that the stage is only a lottery must not be regarded as a trade and must never be preferred to drudgery if money comes from any play let us regard it as a legacy but never count upon it in our income for the year in other words i must go on and drudge at kidnapped which i hate and am unfit to do and you will have to get some journalism somehow these are my cold and blighting sentiments it is bad enough to have to live by an artbut to think to live by an art combined with commercial speculationthat way madness lies  time is our only friend the admiral pulled simply in pieces and about half deleted will act some day such is my opinion i can no moreyours ever       r l s     to william archer      an anonymous review of the childs garden appearing in march gave    r l s so much pleasure that he wrote in the four words now who    are you to inquire the name of its writer and learned that it    was mr archer with whom he had hitherto had no acquaintance he    thereupon entered into friendly correspondence with his critic       bournemouth march 29 1885  dear mr archeryes i have heard of you and read some of your work but i am bound in particular to thank you for the notice of my verses there i said throwing it over to the friend who was staying with me its worth writing a book to draw an article like that had you been as hard upon me as you were amiable i try to tell myself i should have been no blinder to the merits of your notice for i saw there to admire and to be very grateful for a most sober agile pen an enviable touch the marks of a reader such as one imagines for ones self in dreams thoughtful critical and kind and to put the top on this memorial column a greater readiness to describe the author criticised than to display the talents of his censor  i am a man blas√© to injudicious praise though i hope some of it may be judicious too but i have to thank you for the best criticism i ever had and am therefore dear mr archer the most grateful critickee now extant       robert louis stevenson   psi congratulate you on living in the corner of all london that i like best √Ä propos you are very right about my voluntary aversion from the painful sides of life my childhood was in reality a very mixed experience full of fever nightmare insomnia painful days and interminable nights and i can speak with less authority of gardens than of that other land of counterpane but to what end should we renew these sorrows the sufferings of life may be handled by the very greatest in their hours of insight it is of its pleasures that our common poems should be formed these are the experiences that we should seek to recall or to provoke and i say with thoreau what right have i to complain who have not ceased to wonder and to add a rider of my own who have no remedy to offer       r l s     to mr and mrs joseph pennell     acknowledging the dedication of an illustrated canterbury    pilgrimage       skerryvore bournemouth summer 1885  dear sir and madamthis horrible delay must be forgiven me it was not caused by any want of gratitude but by the desire to acknowledge the dedication more suitably and to display my wit in a copy of verses well now i give that up and tell you in plain prose that you have given me much pleasure by the dedication of your graceful book  as i was writing the above i received a visit from lady shelley who mentioned to me that she was reading mrs pennells mary wollstonecraft with pleasure it is odd how streams cross mr pennells work i have of course long known and admired and i believe there was once some talk on the part of mr gilder that we should work together but the scheme fell through from my rapacity and since then has been finally rendered impossible or so i fear by my health  i should say that when i received the pilgrimage i was in a state not at all common with me of depression and the pleasant testimony that my work had not all been in vain did much to set me up again you will therefore understand late as is the hour with what sincerity i am able to sign myselfgratefully yours       robert louis stevenson   mr and mrs pennelli see i should explain that this is all in my own hand i have not fobbed you off with an amanuensis but as i have two handwritings both equally bad in these days i might lead you to think so       r l s     to mrs fleeming jenkin      on the death of professor fleeming jenkin who in stevensons early    student days at edinburgh had been both the warmest and the wisest of    his elder friends died june 12 1885       skerryvore bournemouth june 1885  my dear mrs jenkinyou know how much and for how long i have loved respected and admired him i am only able to feel a little with you but i know how he would have wished us to feel i never knew a better man nor one to me more lovable we shall all feel the loss more greatly as time goes on it scarce seems life to me what must it be to you yet one of the last things that he said to me was that from all these sad bereavements of yours he had learned only more than ever to feel the goodness and what we in our feebleness call the support of god he had been ripening so muchto other eyes than ours we must suppose he was ripe and try to feel it i feel it is better not to say much more it will be to me a great pride to write a notice of him the last i can now do what more in any way i can do for you please to think and let me know for his sake and for your own i would not be a useless friend i know you know me a most warm one please command me or my wife in any way do not trouble to write to me austin i have no doubt will do so if you are as i fear you will be unfit  my heart is sore for you at least you know what you have been to him how he cherished and admired you how he was never so pleased as when he spoke of you with what a boys love up to the last he loved you this surely is a consolation yours is the cruel partto survive you must try and not grudge to him his better fortune to go first it is the sad part of such relations that one must remain and suffer i cannot see my poor jenkin without you nor you indeed without him but you may try to rejoice that he is spared that extremity perhaps i as i was so much his confidant know even better than you can do what your loss would have been to him he never spoke of you but his face changed it wasyou werehis religion  i write by this post to austin and to the academyyours most sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to mrs fleeming jenkin        skerryvore bournemouth june 1885  my dear mrs jenkini should have written sooner but we are in a bustle and i have been very tired though still well your very kind note was most welcome to me i shall be very much pleased to have you call me louis as he has now done for so many years sixteen you say is it so long it seems too short now but of that we cannot judge and must not complain  i wish that either i or my wife could do anything for you when we can you will i am sure command us  i trust that my notice gave you as little pain as was possible i found i had so much to say that i preferred to keep it for another place and make but a note in the academy to try to draw my friend at greater length and say what he was to me and his intimates what a good influence in life and what an example is a desire that grows upon me it was strange as i wrote the note how his old tests and criticisms haunted me and it reminded me afresh with every few words how much i owe to him  i had a note from henley very brief and very sad we none of us yet feel the loss but we know what he would have said and wished  do you know that dew smith has two photographs of him neither very bad and one giving a lively though not flattering air of him in conversation if you have not got them would you like me to write to dew and ask him to give you proofs  i was so pleased that he and my wife made friends that is a great pleasure we found and have preserved one fragment the head of the drawing he made and tore up when he was last here he had promised to come and stay with us this summer may we not hope at least some time soon to have one from youbelieve me my dear mrs jenkin with the most real sympathy your sincere friend       robert louis stevenson  dear me what happiness i owe to both of you

9th 1885  dear sirthe great north road is still unfinished it is scarce i should say beyond highgate but it will be finished some day bar the big accident it will not however gratify your taste the

blague and folly to write to you you never answer and even when you do your letters crackle under the teeth like ashes containing nothing as they do but unseasonable japes and a great cloudy vagueness as of the realm of chaos in this i know well they are like mine and it becomes me well to write suchbut not youfor reasons too obvious to mention we have both been sick but today i am up though with an aching back but i hope all will be better of your views state finances etc etc i know nothing we were mighty near the end of all things financially when a strange shape of a hand giving appeared in heaven or from hell and set us up again for the moment yet still we totter on a whoreson brink i beg pardon i forgot i was writing to a lady but the word shall stay it is the only word i would say it to the qn of ed  how do you like letters of this kind it is your kind they mean nothing they are blankly insignificant and impudently put one in the wrong one has learnt nothing and forsooth one must replyyours the inexpressive correspondent       r l s   heyeyey sold again heyeyey  postscript sold again     to w h low      in august of this year stevenson made with his wife an excursion to    the west country stopping at dorchester on the way for the pleasure    of seeing mr thomas hardy at home and was detained for several    weeks at the new london inn exeter by a bad fit of hemorrhage his    correspondence is not resumed until the autumn       skerryvore bournemouth october 22 1885  my dear lowi trust you are not annoyed with me beyond forgiveness for indeed my silence has been devilish prolonged i can only tell you that i have been nearly six months more than six in a strange condition of collapse when it was impossible to do any work and difficult more difficult than you would suppose to write the merest note i am now better but not yet my own man in the way of brains and in health only soso i suppose i shall learn i begin to think i am learning to fight this vast vague featherbed of an obsession that now overlies and smothers me but in the beginnings of these conflicts the inexperienced wrestler is always worsted and i own i have been quite extinct i wish you to know though it can be no excuse that you are not the only one of my friends by many whom i have thus neglected and even now having come so very late into the possession of myself with a substantial capital of debts and my work still moving with a desperate slownessas a child might fill a sandbag with its little handfulsand my future deeply pledged there is almost a touch of virtue in my borrowing these hours to write to you why i said hours i know not it would look blue for both of us if i made good the word  i was writing your address the other day ordering a copy of my next prince otto to go your way i hope you have not seen it in parts it was not meant to be so read and only my poverty dishonourably consented to the serial evolution  i will send you with this a copy of the english edition of the childs garden i have heard there is some vile rule of the postoffice in the states against inscriptions so i send herewith a piece of doggerel which mr bunner may if he thinks fit copy off the flyleaf  sargent was down again and painted a portrait of me walking about in my own diningroom in my own velveteen jacket and twisting as i go my own moustache at one corner a glimpse of my wife in an indian dress and seated in a chair that was once my grandfathers but since some months goes by the name of henry jamessfor it was there the novelist loved to sitadds a touch of poesy and comicality it is i think excellent but is too eccentric to be exhibited i am at one extreme corner my wife in this wild dress and looking like a ghost is at the extreme other end between us an open door exhibits my palatial entrance hall and a part of my respected staircase all this is touched in lovely with that witty touch of sargents but of course it looks dam queer as a whole  pray let me hear from you and give me good news of yourself and your wife to whom please remember meyours most sincerely my dear low       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      prince otto was published in october of this year and the    following refers to two reviews of itone of them by mr henley    which to the writers displeasure had been pruned by the editor    before printing the other by a writer in the saturday review who    declared that otto was a fool and a wittol and could see nothing    but false style in the story of seraphinas flight through the    forest       skerryvore bournemouth autumn 1885  dear ladif there was any more praise in what you wrote i think the editor has done us both a service some of it stops my throat what it would not have been the same if dumas or musset had done it would it not well no i do not think it would do you know now i am really of opinion it would not and a dam good job too why think what musset would have made of otto think how gallantly dumas would have carried his crowd through and whatever you do dont quarrel with  it gives me much pleasure to see your work there i think you do yourself great justice in that field and i would let no annoyance petty or justifiable debar me from such a market i think you do good there whether considering our intimate relations you would not do better to refrain from reviewing me i will leave to yourself were it all on my side you could foresee my answer but there is your side also where you must be the judge  as for the saturday otto is no fool the reader is left in no doubt as to whether or not seraphina was a messalina though much it would matter if you come to that and therefore on both these points the reviewer has been unjust secondly the romance lies precisely in the freeing of two spirits from these court intrigues and here i think the reviewer showed himself dull lastly if ottos speech is offensive to him he is one of the large class of unmanly and ungenerous dogs who arrogate and defile the name of manly as for the passages quoted i do confess that some of them reek gongorically they are excessive but they are not inelegant after all however had he attacked me only there he would have scored  your criticism on gondremark is i fancy right i thought all your criticisms were indeed only your praisechokes meyours ever       r l s     to william archer     the paper referred to in this and the following letters is one which    mr archer wrote over his own signature in the november number of    time a magazine now extinct       skerryvore bournemouth october 28 1885  dear mr archeri have read your paper with my customary admiration it is very witty very adroit it contains a great deal that is excellently true particularly the parts about my stories and the description of me as an artist in life but you will not be surprised if i do not think it altogether just it seems to me in particular that you have wilfully read all my works in terms of my earliest my aim even in style has quite changed in the last six or seven years and this i should have thought you would have noticed again your first remark upon the affectation of the italic names a practice only followed in my two affected little books of travel where a typographical minauderie of the sort appeared to me in character and what you say of it then is quite just but why should you forget yourself and use these same italics as an index to my theology some pages further on this is lightness of touch indeed may i say it is almost sharpness of practice  excuse these remarks i have been on the whole much interested and sometimes amused are you aware that the praiser of this brave gymnasium has not seen a canoe nor taken a long walk since 79 that he is rarely out of the house nowadays and carries his arm in a sling can you imagine that he is a backslidden communist and is sure he will go to hell if there be such an excellent institution for the luxury in which he lives and can you believe that though it is gaily expressed the thought is hag and skeleton in every moment of vacuity or depression can you conceive how profoundly i am irritated by the opposite affectation to my own when i see strong men and rich men bleating about their sorrows and the burthen of life in a world full of cancerous paupers and poor sick children and the fatally bereaved ay and down even to such happy creatures as myself who has yet been obliged to strip himself one after another of all the pleasures that he had chosen except smoking and the days of that i know in my heart ought to be over i forgot eating which i still enjoy and who sees the circle of impotence closing very slowly but quite steadily around him in my view one dank dispirited word is harmful a crime of l√®sehumanit√© a piece of acquired evil every gay every bright word or picture like every pleasant air of music is a piece of pleasure set afloat the reader catches it and if he be healthy goes on his way rejoicing and it is the business of art so to send him as often as possible  for what you say so kindly so prettily so precisely of my style i must in particular thank you though even here i am vexed you should not have remarked on my attempted change of manner seemingly this attempt is still quite unsuccessful well we shall fight it out on this line if it takes all summer  and now for my last word mrs stevenson is very anxious that you should see me and that she should see you in the flesh if you at all share in these views i am a fixture write or telegraph giving us time however to telegraph in reply lest the day be impossible and come down here to a bed and a dinner what do you say my dear critic i shall be truly pleased to see you and to explain at greater length what i meant by saying narrative was the most characteristic mood of literature on which point i have great hopes i shall persuade youyours truly       robert louis stevenson   psmy opinion about thoreau and the passage in the week is perhaps a fad but it is sincere and stable i am still of the same mind five years later did you observe that i had said modern authors and will you observe again that this passage touches the very joint of our division it is one that appeals to me deals with that part of life that i think the most important and you if i gather rightly so much less so you believe in the extreme moment of the facts that humanity has acquired and is acquiring i think them of moment but still of much less than those inherent or inherited brute principles and laws that sit upon us in the character of conscience as heavy as a shirt of mail and that in the character of the affections and the airy spirit of pleasure make all the light of our lives the house is indeed a great thing and should be rearranged on sanitary principles but my heart and all my interest are with the dweller that ancient of days and dayold infant man       r l s   an excellent touch is p 584 by instinct or design he eschews what demands constructive patience i believe it is both my theory is that literature must always be most at home in treating movement and change hence i look for them     to thomas stevenson        skerryvore bournemouth october 28 1885  my dearest fatherget the november number of time and you will see a review of me by a very clever fellow who is quite furious at bottom because i am too orthodox just as purcell was savage because i am not orthodox enough i fall between two stools it is odd too to see how this man thinks me a fullblooded foxhunter and tells me my philosophy would fail if i lost my health or had to give up exercise  an illustrated treasure island will be out next month i have had an early copy and the french pictures are admirable the artist has got his types up in hogarth he is full of fire and spirit can draw and can compose and has understood the book as i meant it all but one or two little accidents such as making the hispaniola a brig i would send you my copy but i cannot it is my new toy and i cannot divorce myself from this enjoyment  i am keeping really better and have been out about every second day though the weather is cold and very wild  i was delighted to hear you were keeping better you and archer would agree more shame to you archer is my pessimist critic goodbye to all of you with my best love we had a dreadful overhauling of my conduct as a son the other night and my wife stripped me of my illusions and made me admit i had been a detestable bad one of one thing in particular she convicted me in my own eyes i mean a most unkind reticence which hung on me then and i confess still hangs on me now when i try to assure you that i do love youever your bad son       robert louis stevenson     to henry james        skerryvore bournemouth october 28 1885  my dear henry jamesat last my wife being at a concert and a story being done i am at some liberty to write and give you of my views and first many thanks for the works that came to my sickbed and second and more important as to the princess13 well i think you are going to do it this time i cannot of course foresee but these two first numbers seem to me picturesque and sound and full of lineament and very much a new departure as for your young lady she is all there yes sir you can do low life i believe the prison was excellent it was of that nature of touch that i sometimes achingly miss from your former work with some of the grime that is and some of the emphasis of skeleton there is in nature i pray you to take grime in a good sense it need not be ignoble dirt may have dignity in nature it usually has and your prison was imposing  and now to the main point why do we not see you do not fail us make an alarming sacrifice and let us see henry jamess chair properly occupied i never sit in it myself though it was my grandfathers it has been consecrated to guests by your approval and now stands at my elbow gaping we have a new room too to introduce to youour last baby the drawingroom it never cries and has cut its teeth likewise there is a cat now it promises to be a monster of laziness and selfsufficiency  pray see in the november time a dread name for a magazine of light reading a very clever fellow w archer stating his views of me the rosygilled athletico√¶sthete and warning me in a fatherly manner that a rheumatic fever would try my philosophy as indeed it would and that my gospel would not do for those who are shut out from the exercise of any manly virtue save renunciation to those who know that rickety and cloistered spectre the real r l s the paper besides being clever in itself presents rare elements of sport the critical parts are in particular very bright and neat and often excellently true get it by all manner of means  i hear on all sides i am to be attacked as an immoral writer this is painful have i at last got like you to the pitch of being attacked tis the consecration i lackand could do without not that archers paper is an attack or what either he or i i believe would call one tis the attacks on my morality which i had thought a gem of the first water i referred to  now my dear james comecomecome the spirit that is me says come and the bride and that is my wife says come and the best thing you can do for us and yourself and your work is to get up and do so right awayyours affectionately       robert louis stevenson     to william archer        skerryvore bournemouth october 30 1885  dear mr archerit is possible my father may be soon down with me he is an old man and in bad health and spirits and i could neither leave him alone nor could we talk freely before him if he should be here when you offer your visit you will understand if i have to say no and put you off  i quite understand your not caring to refer to things of private knowledge what still puzzles me is how you in the witness boxha i like the phrase should have made your argument actually hinge on a contention which the facts answered  i am pleased to hear of the correctness of my guess it is then as i supposed you are of the school of the generous and not the sullen pessimists and i can feel with you i used myself to rage when i saw sick folk going by in their bathchairs since i have been sick myself and always when i was sick myself i found life even in its rough places to have a property of easiness that which we suffer ourselves has no longer the same air of monstrous injustice and wanton cruelty that suffering wears when we see it in the case of others so we begin gradually to see that things are not black but have their strange compensations and when they draw towards their worst the idea of death is like a bed to lie on i should bear false witness if i did not declare life happy and your wonderful statement that happiness tends to die out and misery to continue which was what put me on the track of your frame of mind is diagnostic of the happy man raging over the misery of others it could never be written by the man who had tried what unhappiness was like and at any rate it was a slip of the pen the ugliest word that science has to declare is a reserved indifference to happiness and misery in the individual it declares no leaning toward the black no iniquity on the large scale in fates doings rather a marble equality dread not cruel giving and taking away and reconciling  why have i not written my timon well here is my worst quarrel with you you take my young books as my last word the tendency to try to say more has passed unperceived my fault that and you make no allowance for the slowness with which a man finds and tries to learn his tools i began with a neat brisk little style and a sharp little knack of partial observation i have tried to expand my means but still i can only utter a part of what i wish to say and am bound to feel and much of it will die unspoken but if i had the pen of shakespeare i have no timon to give forth i feel kindly to the powers that be i marvel they should use me so well and when i think of the case of others i wonder too but in another vein whether they may not whether they must not be like me still with some compensation some delight to have suffered nay to suffer sets a keen edge on what remains of the agreeable this is a great truth and has to be learned in the fireyours very truly       robert louis stevenson   we expect you remember that     to william archer        skerryvore bournemouth november 1 1885  dear mr archeryou will see that i had already had a sight of your article and what were my thoughts  one thing in your letter puzzles me are you too not in the witnessbox and if you are why take a wilfully false hypothesis if you knew i was a chronic invalid why say that my philosophy was unsuitable to such a case my call for facts is not so general as yours but an essential fact should not be put the other way about  the fact is consciously or not you doubt my honesty you think i am making faces and at heart disbelieve my utterances and this i am disposed to think must spring from your not having had enough of pain sorrow and trouble in your existence it is easy to have too much easy also or possible to have too little enough is required that a man may appreciate what elements of consolation and joy there are in everything but absolutely overpowering physical pain or disgrace and how in almost all circumstances the human soul can play a fair part you fear life i fancy on the principle of the hand of little employment but perhaps my hypothesis is as unlike the truth as the one you chose well if it be so if you have had trials sickness the approach of death the alienation of friends poverty at the heels and have not felt your soul turn round upon these things and spurn them underyou must be very differently made from me and i earnestly believe from the majority of men but at least you are in the right to wonder and complain  to say all stay here all at once that would require a word from the pen of gargantua we say each particular thing as it comes up and with that sort of emphasis that for the time there seems to be no other words will not otherwise serve us no nor even shakespeare who could not have put as you like it and timon into one without ruinous loss both of emphasis and substance is it quite fair then to keep your face so steadily on my most lighthearted works and then say i recognise no evil yet in the paper on burns for instance i show myself alive to some sorts of evil but then perhaps they are not your sorts  and again to say all all yes everything no the task were endless the effect nil but my all in such a vast field as this of life is what interests me what stands out what takes on itself a presence for my imagination or makes a figure in that little tricky abbreviation which is the best that my reason can conceive that i must treat or i shall be fooling with my readers that and not the all of some one else  and here we come to the division not only do i believe that literature should give joy but i see a universe i suppose eternally different from yours a solemn a terrible but a very joyous and noble universe where suffering is not at least wantonly inflicted though it falls with dispassionate partiality but where it may be and generally is nobly borne where above all this i believe probably you dont i think he may with cancer any brave man may make out a life which shall be happy for himself and by so being beneficent to those about him and if he fails why should i hear him weeping i mean if i fail why should i weep why should you hear me then to me morals the conscience the affections and the passions are i will own frankly and sweepingly so infinitely more important than the other parts of life that i conceive men rather triflers who become immersed in the latter and i will always think the man who keeps his lip stiff and makes a happy fireside clime and carries a pleasant face about to friends and neighbours infinitely greater in the abstract than an atrabilious shakespeare or a backbiting kant or darwin no offence to any of these gentlemen two of whom probably one for certain came up to my standard  and now enough said it were hard if a poor man could not criticise another without having so much ink shed against him but i shall still regret you should have written on an hypothesis you knew to be untenable and that you should thus have made your paper for those who do not know me essentially unfair the rich foxhunting squire speaks with one voice the sick man of letters with anotheryours very truly       robert louis stevenson        prometheusheine in minimis   pshere i go again to me the medicine bottles on my chimney and the blood on my handkerchief are accidents they do not colour my view of life as you would know i think if you had experience of sickness they do not exist in my prospect i would as soon drag them under the eyes of my readers as i would mention a pimple i might chance to have saving your presence on my posteriors what does it prove what does it change it has not hurt it has not changed me in any essential part and i should think myself a trifler and in bad taste if i introduced the world to these unimportant privacies  but again there is this mountainrange between usthat you do not believe me it is not flattering but the fault is probably in my literary art     to w h low     the other thing coming out mentioned below in the last paragraph    but one was the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde       skerryvore bournemouth december 26 1885  my dear lowlamia has not yet turned up but your letter came to me this evening with a scent of the boulevard montparnasse that was irresistible the sand of lavenues crumbled under my heel and the bouquet of the old fleury came back to me and i remembered the day when i found a twenty franc piece under my fetish have you that fetish still and has it brought you luck i remembered too my first sight of you in a frockcoat and a smokingcap when we passed the evening at the caf√© de medicis and my last when we sat and talked in the parc monceau and all these things made me feel a little young again which to one who has been mostly in bed for a month was a vivifying change  yes you are lucky to have a bag that holds you comfortably mine is a strange contrivance i dont die damme and i cant get along on both feet to save my soul i am a chronic sickist and my work cripples along between bed and the parlour between the medicine bottle and the cupping glass well i like my life all the same and should like it none the worse if i could have another talk with you though even my talks now are measured out to me by the minute hand like poisons in a minim glass  a photograph will be taken of my ugly mug and sent to you for ulterior purposes i have another thing coming out which i did not put in the way of the scribners i can scarce tell how but i was sick and penniless and rather back on the world and mismanaged it i trust they will forgive me  i am sorry to hear of mrs lows illness and glad to hear of her recovery i will announce the coming lamia to bob he steams away at literature like smoke i have a beautiful bob on my walls and a good sargent and a delightful lemon and your etching now hangs framed in the diningroom so the arts surround meyours       r l s     to mrs de mattos     with this cousin the writer had always been on terms of close    affection and he now dedicated to her the strange case of dr    jekyll and mr hyde in the dedication as published only the second    verse stands       skerryvore bournemouth january 1st 1886  dearest katharinehere on a very little book and accompanied with lame verses i have put your name our kindness is now getting well on in years it must be nearly of age and it gets more valuable to me with every time i see you it is not possible to express any sentiment and it is not necessary to try at least between us you know very well that i love you dearly and that i always will i only wish the verses were better but at least you like the story and it is sent to you by the one that loves youjekyll and not hyde       r l s     ave    bells upon the city are ringing in the night   high above the gardens are the houses full of light   on

my dear kinnicum14i am a very bad dog but not for the first time your book which is very interesting came duly and i immediately got a very bad cold indeed and have been fit for nothing whatever i am a bit better now and aye on the mend so i write to tell you i thought of you on new years day though i own it would have been more decent if i had thought in time for you to get my letter then well what cant be cured must be endured mr lawrie and you must be content with what i give if i wrote all the letters i ought to write and at the proper time i should be very good and very happy but i doubt if i should do anything else  i suppose you will be in town for the new year and i hope your health is pretty good what you want is diet but it is as much use to tell you that as it is to tell my father and i quite admit a diet is a beastly thing i doubt however if it be as bad as not being allowed to speak which i have tried fully and do not like when at the same time i was not allowed to read it passed a joke but these are troubles of the past and on this day at least it is proper to suppose they wont return but we are not put here to enjoy ourselves it was not gods purpose and i am prepared to argue it is not our sincere wish as for our deserts the less said of them the better for somebody might hear and nobody cares to be laughed at a good man is a very noble thing to see but not to himself what he seems to god is fortunately not our business that is the domain of faith and whether on the first of january or the thirtyfirst of december faith is a good word to end on  my dear cummy many happy returns to you and my best lovethe worst correspondent in the world       robert louis stevenson     to mr and mrs thomas stevenson        skerryvore bournemouth january 1st 1886  my dear peoplemany happy returns of the day to you all i am fairly well and in good spirits and much and hopefully occupied with dear jenkins life the inquiry in every detail every letter that i read makes me think of him more nobly i cannot imagine how i got his friendship i did not deserve it i believe the notice will be interesting and useful  my fathers last letter owing to the use of a quill pen and the neglect of blottingpaper was hopelessly illegible every one tried and every one failed to decipher an important word on which the interest of one whole clause and the letter consisted of two depended  i find i can make little more of this but ill spare the blotsdear people ever your loving son       r l s   i will try again being a giant refreshed by the house being empty the presence of people is the great obstacle to letterwriting i deny that letters should contain news i mean mine those of other people should but mine should contain appropriate sentiments and humorous nonsense or nonsense without the humour when the house is empty the mind is seized with a desireno that is too stronga willingness to pour forth unmitigated rot which constitutes in me the true spirit of correspondence when i have no remarks to offer and nobody to offer them to my pen flies and you see the remarkable consequence of a page literally covered with words and genuinely devoid of sense i can always do that if quite alone and i like doing it but i have yet to learn that it is beloved by correspondents the deuce of it is that there is no end possible but the end of the paper and as there is very little left of thatif i cannot stop writingsuppose you give up reading it would all come to the same thing and i think we should all be happier     to w h low      in the following letter r l s accepts the dedication of mr lows    illustrated edition of keatss lamia and sends him in return the    newly published jekyll and hyde and a set of verses afterwards    printed in the century magazine and underwoods and inscribed by    mr st gaudens on his medallion portrait of the author the terms of    the lamia dedication are as follows in testimony of loyal    friendship and of a common faith in doubtful tales from faeryland i    dedicate to robert louis stevenson my work in this book the latin    legend inscribed above the design runs neque est ullum certius    amicitiae vinculum quam consensus et societas consiliorum et    voluntatum       skerryvore bournemouth jan 2nd 1886  my dear lowlamia has come and i do not know how to thank you not only for the beautiful art of the designs but for the handsome and apt words of the dedication my favourite is bathes unseen which is a masterpiece and the next into the green recessed woods is perhaps more remarkable though it does not take my fancy so imperiously the night scene at corinth pleases me also the second part offers fewer opportunities i own i should like to see both isabella and the eve thus illustrated and then theres hyperiono yes and endymion i should like to see the lot beautiful pictures dance before me by hundreds i believe endymion would suit you best it also is in faeryland and i see a hundred opportunities cloudy and flowery glories things as delicate as the cobweb in the bush actions not in themselves of any mighty purport but made for the pencil the feast of pan peonas isle the slabbed margin of a well the chase of the butterfly the nymph glaucus cybele sleep on his couch a farrago of unconnected beauties but i divagate and all this sits in the bosom of the publisher  what is more important i accept the terms of the dedication with a frank heart and the terms of your latin legend fairly the sight of your pictures has once more awakened me to my right mind something may come of it yet one more bold push to get free of this prisonyard of the abominably ugly where i take my daily exercise with my contemporaries i do not know i have a feeling in my bones a sentiment which may take on the forms of imagination or may not if it does i shall owe it to you and the thing will thus descend from keats even if on the wrong side of the blanket if it can be done in prosethat is the puzzlei divagate again thank you again you can draw and yet you do not love the ugly what are you doing in this age flee while it is yet time they will have your four limbs pinned upon a stable door to scare witches the ugly my unhappy friend is de rigueur it is the only wear what a chance you threw away with the serpent why had apollonius no pimples heavens my dear low you do not know your business  i send you herewith a gothic gnome for your greek nymph but the gnome is interesting i think and he came out of a deep mine where he guards the fountain of tears it is not always the time to rejoiceyours ever       r l s   the gnomes name is jekyll  hyde i believe you will find he is likewise quite willing to answer to the name of low or stevenson  same dayi have copied out on the other sheet some bad verses which somehow your picture suggested as a kind of image of things that i pursue and cannot reach and that you seemno not to have reachedbut to have come a thought nearer to than i this is the life we have chosen well the choice was mad but i should make it again  what occurs to me is this perhaps they might be printed in say the century for the sake of my name and if that were possible they might advertise your book it might be headed as sent in acknowledgment of your lamia or perhaps it might be introduced by the phrases i have marked above i dare say they would stick it in i want no payment being well paid by lamia if they are not keep them to yourself     to will h low   damned bad lines in return for a beautiful book    youth now flees on feathered foot   faint

    skerryvore bournemouth jan 2nd 1886  my dear gossethank you for your letter so interesting to my vanity there is a review in the st jamess which as it seems to hold somewhat of your opinions and is besides written with a pen and not a poker we think may possibly be yours the prince16 has done fairly well in spite of the reviews which have been bad he was as you doubtless saw well slated in the saturday one paper received it as a childs story another picture my agony described it as a gilbert comedy it was amusing to see the race between me and justin mcarthy the milesian has won by a length  that is the hard part of literature you aim high and you take longer over your work and it will not be so successful as if you had aimed low and rushed it what the public likes is work of any kind a little loosely executed so long as it is a little wordy a little slack a little dim and knotless the dear public likes it it should if possible be a little dull into the bargain i know that good work sometimes hits but with my hand on my heart i think it is by an accident and i know also that good work must succeed at last but that is not the doing of the public they are only shamed into silence or affectation i do not write for the public i do write for money a nobler deity and most of all for myself not perhaps any more noble but both more intelligent and nearer home  let us tell each other sad stories of the bestiality of the beast whom we feed what he likes is the newspaper and to me the press is the mouth of a sewer where lying is professed as from an university chair and everything prurient and ignoble and essentially dull finds its abode and pulpit i do not like mankind but men and not all of theseand fewer women as for respecting the race and above all that fatuous rabble of burgesses called the public god save me from such irreligionthat way lies disgrace and dishonour there must be something wrong in me or i would not be popular  this is perhaps a trifle stronger than my sedate and permanent opinion not much i think as for the art that we practise i have never been able to see why its professors should be respected they chose the primrose path when they found it was not all primroses but some of it brambly and much of it uphill they began to think and to speak of themselves as holy martyrs but a man is never martyred in any honest sense in the pursuit of his pleasure and delirium tremens has more of the honour of the cross we were full of the pride of life and chose like prostitutes to live by a pleasure we should be paid if we give the pleasure we pretend to give but why should we be honoured  i hope some day you and mrs gosse will come for a sunday but we must wait till i am able to see people i am very full of jenkins life it is painful yet very pleasant to dig into the past of a dead friend and find him at every spadeful shine brighter i own as i read i wonder more and more why he should have taken me to be a friend he had many and obvious faults upon the face of him the heart was pure gold i feel it little pain to have lost him for it is a loss in which i cannot believe i take it against reason for an absence if not today then tomorrow i still fancy i shall see him in the door and then now when i know him better how glad a meeting yes if i could believe in the immortality business the world would indeed be too good to be true but we were put here to do what service we can for honour and not for hire the sods cover us and the worm that never dies the conscience sleeps well at last these are the wages besides what we receive so lavishly day by day and they are enough for a man who knows his own frailty and sees all things in the proportion of reality the soul of piety was killed long ago by that idea of reward nor is happiness whether eternal or temporal the reward that mankind seeks happinesses are but his wayside campings his soul is in the journey he was born for the struggle and only tastes his life in effort and on the condition that he is opposed how then is such a creature so fiery so pugnacious so made up of discontent and aspiration and such noble and uneasy passionshow can he be rewarded but by rest i would not say it aloud for mans cherished belief is that he loves that happiness which he continually spurns and passes by and this belief in some ulterior happiness exactly fits him he does not require to stop and taste it he can be about the rugged and bitter business where his heart lies and yet he can tell himself this fairy tale of an eternal teaparty and enjoy the notion that he is both himself and something else and that his friends will yet meet him all ironed out and emasculate and still be lovableas if love did not live in the faults of the beloved only and draw its breath in an unbroken round of forgiveness but the truth is we must fight until we die and when we die there can be no quiet for mankind but complete resumption intowhatgod let us saywhen all these desperate tricks will lie spellbound at last  here came my dinner and cut this sermon shortexcusez       r l s     to james payn      the late mrs buckle a daughter of mr james payn married to the    editor of the times had laughingly remonstrated through her father    on recognising some features of her own house in queen square    bloomsbury in the description of that tenanted by the fair cuban in    the section of stevensons dynamiter which tells the story of the    brown box       skerryvore bournemouth jan 2nd 1886  dear james paynyour very kind letter came very welcome and still more welcome the news that you see s tale i will now tell you and it was very good and very wise of me not to tell it before that he is one of the most unlucky men i know having put all his money into a pharmacy at hy√®res when the cholera certainly not his fault swept away his customers in a body thus you can imagine the pleasure i have to announce to him a spark of hope for he sits today in his pharmacy doing nothing and taking nothing and watching his debts inexorably mount up  to pass to other matters your hand you are perhaps aware is not one of those that can be read running and the name of your daughter remains for me undecipherable i call her then your daughterand a very good name tooand i beg to explain how it came about that i took her house the hospital was a point in my tale but there is a house on each side now the true house is the one before the hospital is that no 11 if not what do you complain of if it is how can i help what is true everything in the dynamiter is not true but the story of the brown box is in almost every particular i lay my hand on my heart and swear to it it took place in that house in 1884 and if your daughter was in that house at the time all i can say is she must have kept very bad society  but i see you coming perhaps your daughters house has not a balcony at the back i cannot answer for that i only know that side of queen square from the pavement and the back windows of brunswick row thence i saw plenty of balconies terraces rather and if there is none to the particular house in question it must have been so arranged to spite me  i now come to the conclusion of this matter i address three questions to your daughter    1st has her house the proper terrace   2nd is it on the proper side of the hospital   3rd was she there in the summer of 1884  you see i begin to fear that mrs desborough may have deceived me on some trifling points for she is not a lady of peddling exactitude if this should prove to be so i will give your daughter a proper certificate and her house property will return to its original value  can man say moreyours very truly       robert louis stevenson   i saw the other day that the eternal had plagiarised from lost sir massingberd good again sir i wish he would plagiarise the death of zero     to w h low      the late sir percy and lady shelley had in these days attached    themselves warmly to r l s and saw in his ways and character a    living image of those of the poet sir percys father as they    imagined him       skerryvore bournemouth jan somethingorotherth 1886  my dear lowi send you two photographs they are both done by sir percy shelley the poets son which may interest the sitting down one is i think the best but if they choose that see that the little reflected light on the nose does not give me a turnup that would be tragic dont forget baronet to sir percys name  we all think a heap of your book and i am well pleased with my dedicationyours ever       r l stevenson   psapropos of the odd controversy about shelleys nose i have before me four photographs of myself done by shelleys son my nose is hooked not like the eagle indeed but like the accipitrine family in man well out of these four only one marks the bend one makes it straight and one suggests a turnup this throws a flood of light on calumnious manand the scandalmongering sun for personally i cling to my curve to continue the shelley controversy i have a look of him all his sisters had noses like mine sir percy has a marked hook all the family had high cheekbones like mine what doubt then but that this turnup of which jeaffreson accuses the poet along with much other fatras is the result of some accident similar to what has happened in my photographs by his son       r l s     to charles j guthrie      the lad is lloyd osbourne at this time a student at edinburgh    university       skerryvore bournemouth jan 18th 1886  my dear guthriei hear the lad has got into the spec and i write to thank you very warmly for the part you have played i only wish we were both going there together tomorrow night and you would be in the secretarys place that so well became you sir and i were to open a debate or harry you on private business and omond perhaps to read us a few glowing pages onthe siege of saragossa was it or the battle of saratoga my memory fails me but i have not forgotten a certain white charger that careered over the fields of incoherent fight with a prodigious consequence of laughter have you i wonder has omond  well well perierunt but i hope non imputantur we have had good fun  again thanking you sincerely i remain my dear guthrie your old comrade       robert louis stevenson     to thomas stevenson      kidnapped had at this time just been taken up again and stevenson    explains the course of the story to his father who had taken the    deepest interest in it since they visited together the scene of the    appin murder       skerryvore bournemouth january 25 1886  my dear fathermany thanks for a letter quite like yourself i quite agree with you and had already planned a scene of religion in balfour the society for the propagation of christian knowledge furnishes me with a catechist whom i shall try to make the man i have another catechist the blind pistolcarrying highway robber whom i have transferred from the long island to mull i find it a most picturesque period and wonder scott let it escape the covenant is lost on one of the tarrans and david is cast on earraid where being from inland he is nearly starved before he finds out the island is tidal then he crosses mull to toronsay meeting the blind catechist by the way then crosses morven from kinlochaline to kingairloch where he stays the night with the good catechist that is where i am next day he is to be put ashore in appin and be present at colin campbells death today i rest being a little run down strange how liable we are to brain fag in this scooty family but as far as i have got all but the last chapter i think david is on his feet and to my mind a far better story and far sounder at heart than treasure island  i have no earthly news living entirely in my story and only coming out of it to play patience the shelleys are gone the taylors kinder than can be imagined the other day lady taylor drove over and called on me she is a delightful old lady and great fun i mentioned a story about the duchess of wellingtonwhich i had heard sir henry tell and though he was very tired he looked it up and copied it out for me in his own handyour most affectionate son       robert louis stevenson     to c w stoddard        skerryvore bournemouth feb 13th 1886  my dear stoddardi am a dreadful character but you see i have at last taken pen in hand how long i may hold it god knows this is already my sixth letter today and i have many more waiting and my wrist gives me a jog on the subject of scriveners cramp which is not encouraging  i gather you were a little down in the jaw when you wrote your last i am as usual pretty cheerful but not very strong i stay in the house all winter which is base but as you continue to see the pen goes from time to time though neither fast enough nor constantly enough to please me  my wife is at bath with my father and mother and the interval of widowery explains my writing another person writing for you when you have done work is a great enemy to correspondence today i feel out of health and shant work and hence this so much overdue reply  i was rereading some of your south sea idyls the other day some of the chapters are very good indeed some pages as good as they can be  how does your class get along if you like to touch on otto any day in a byhour you may tell themas the authors last dying confessionthat it is a strange example of the difficulty of being ideal in an age of realism that the unpleasant giddymindedness which spoils the book and often gives it a wanton air of unreality and juggling with airbells comes from unsteadiness of key from the too great realism of some chapters and passagessome of which i have now spotted others i dare say i shall never spotwhich disprepares the imagination for the cast of the remainder  any story can be made true in its own key any story can be made false by the choice of a wrong key of detail or style otto is made to reel like a drunkeni was going to say man but let us substitute cipherby the variations of the key have you observed that the famous problem of realism and idealism is one purely of detail have you seen my note on realism in cassells magazine of art and elements of style in the contemporary and romance and humble apology in longmans they are all in your line of business let me know what you have not seen and ill send em  i am glad i brought the old house up to you it was a pleasant old spot and i remember you there though still more dearly in your own strange den upon a hill in san francisco and one of the most san franciscoy parts of san francisco  goodbye my dear fellow and believe me your friend       robert louis stevenson     to edmund gosse     concerning the payment which mr gosse had procured him from an    american magazine for the set of verses addressed to mr low see    above p 172       skerryvore bournemouth feb 17 1886  dear gossenon cest honteux for a set of shambling lines that dont know whether theyre trochees or what they are that you or any of the crafty ones would blush all over if you had so much as thought upon all by yourselves in the watercloset but god knows i am glad enough of five pounds and this is almost as honest a way to get it as plain theft so what should i careever yours       r l s     to j a symonds        skerryvore bournemouth spring 1886  my dear symondsif we have lost touch it is i think only in a material sense a question of letters not hearts you will find a warm welcome at skerryvore from both the lightkeepers and indeed we never tell ourselves one of our financial fairy tales but a run to davos is a prime feature i am not changeable in friendship and i think i can promise you you have a pair of trusty wellwishers and friends in bournemouth whether they write or not is but a small thing the flag may not be waved but it is there  jekyll is a dreadful thing i own but the only thing i feel dreadful about is that damned old business of the war in the members this time it came out i hope it will stay in in future  raskolnikoff17 is easily the greatest book i have read in ten years i am glad you took to it many find it dull henry james could not finish it all i can say is it nearly finished me it was like having an illness james did not care for it because the character of raskolnikoff was not objective and at that i divined a great gulf between us and on further reflection the existence of a certain impotence in many minds of today which prevents them from living in a book or a character and keeps them standing afar off spectators of a puppet show to such i suppose the book may seem empty in the centre to the others it is a room a house of life into which they themselves enter and are tortured and purified the juge dinstruction i thought a wonderful weird touching ingenious creation the drunken father and sonia and the student friend and the uncircumscribed protoplasmic humanity of raskolnikoff all upon a level that filled me with wonder the execution also superb in places another has been translatedhumili√©s et offens√©s it is even more incoherent than le crime et le ch√¢timent but breathes much of the same lovely goodness and has passages of power dostoieffsky is a devil of a swell to be sure have you heard that he became a stout imperialist conservative it is interesting to know to something of that side the balance leans with me also in view of the incoherency and incapacity of all the old boyish idea of the march on paradise being now out of season and all plans and ideas that i hear debated being built on a superb indifference to the first principles of human character a helpless desire to acquiesce in anything of which i know the worst assails me fundamental errors in human nature of two sorts stand on the skyline of all this modern world of aspirations first that it is happiness that men want and second that happiness consists of anything but an internal harmony men do not want and i do not think they would accept happiness what they live for is rivalry effort successthe elements our friends wish to eliminate and on the other hand happiness is a question of moralityor of immorality there is no differenceand conviction gordon was happy in khartoum in his worst hours of danger and fatigue marat was happy i suppose in his ugliest frenzy marcus aurelius was happy in the detested camp pepys was pretty happy and i am pretty happy on the whole because we both somewhat crowingly accepted a via media both liked to attend to our affairs and both had some success in managing the same it is quite an open question whether pepys and i ought to be happy on the other hand there is no doubt that marat had better be unhappy he was right if he said it that he was la mis√®re humaine cureless miseryunless perhaps by the gallows death is a great and gentle solvent it has never had justice done it no not by whitman as for those crockery chimneypiece ornaments the bourgeois quorum pars and their cowardly dislike of dying and killing it is merely one symptom of a thousand how utterly they have got out of touch of life their dislike of capital punishment and their treatment of their domestic servants are for me the two flaunting emblems of their hollowness  god knows where i am driving to but here comes my lunch  which interruption happily for you seems to have stayed the issue i have now nothing to say that had formerly such a pressure of twaddle pray dont fail to come this summer it will be a great disappointment now it has been spoken of if you doyours ever       robert louis stevenson     to f w h myers      in reply to a paper of criticisms on jekyll and hyde       skerryvore bournemouth march 1st 1886  my dear siri know not how to thank you this is as handsome as it is clever with almost every word i agreemuch of it i even knew beforemuch of it i must confess would never have been if i had been able to do what i like and lay the thing by for the matter of a year but the wheels of byles the butcher drive exceeding swiftly and jekyll was conceived written rewritten rerewritten and printed inside ten weeks nothing but this whitehot haste would explain the gross error of hydes speech at lanyons your point about the specialised fiend is more subtle but not less just i had not seen itabout the picture i rather meant that hyde had brought it himself and uttersons hypothesis of the gift p 42 an errorthe tidiness of the room i thought but i dare say my psychology is here too ingenious to be sound was due to the dread weariness and horror of the imprisonment something has to be done he would tidy the room but i dare say it is false  i shall keep your paper and if ever my works come to be collected i will put my back into these suggestions in the meanwhile i do truly lack words in which to express my sense of gratitude for the trouble you have taken the receipt of such a paper is more than a reward for my labours i have read it with pleasure and as i say i hope to use it with profitbelieve me your most obliged       robert louis stevenson     to w h low      the following letter relates to a suggestion which mr gilder as    editor of the century magazine had already made in the hy√®res time    nearly three years previously and had now lately revived that    stevenson and his friend mr w h low should make a joint excursion    down the sa√¥ne and rhone the result to be a book written by r l s    and illustrated by mr low considerations of health caused the plan    to be promptly abandoned for the second time       skerryvore bournemouth march 1886  my dear lowthis is the most enchanting picture now understand my state i am really an invalid but of a mysterious order i might be a malade imaginaire but for one too tangible symptom my tendency to bleed from the lungs if we could go 1st we must have money enough to travel with leisure and comfortespecially the first 2nd you must be prepared for a comrade who would go to bed some part of every day and often stay silent 3rd you would have to play the part of a thoughtful courier sparing me fatigue looking out that my bed was warmed etc 4th if you are very nervous you must recollect a bad hemorrhage is always on the cards with its concomitants of anxiety and horror for those who are beside me  do you blench if so let us say no more about it  if you are still unafraid and the money were forthcoming i believe the trip might do me good and i feel sure that working together we might produce a fine book the rhone is the river of angels i adore it have adored it since i was twelve and first saw it from the train  lastly it would depend on how i keep from now on i have stood the winter hitherto with some credit but the dreadful weather still continues and i cannot holloa till i am through the wood  subject to these numerous and gloomy provisos i embrace the prospect with glorious feelings  i write this from bed snow pouring without and no circumstance of pleasure except your letter that however counts for much i am glad you liked the doggerel i have already had a liberal cheque over which i licked my fingers with a sound conscience i had not meant to make money by these stumbling feet but if it comes it is only too welcome in my handsome but impecunious house  let me know soon what is to be expectedas far as it does not hang by that inconstant quantity my want of health remember me to madam with the best thanks and wishes and believe me your friend       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      written just before a visit to london not this time as my guest at    the british museum but to stay with his father at an hotel in    fitzroy square       skerryvore bournemouth march 1886  my dear colvini have been reading the vth and vith aeneidthe latter for the first timeand am overpowered that is one of the most astonishing pieces of literature or rather it contains the best i ever met with we are all damned small fry and virgil is one of the tops of human achievement i never appreciated this you should have a certain age to feel this it is no book for boys who grind under the lack of enterprise and dash and pass ignorantly over miracles of performance that leave an old hoaryheaded practitioner like me stricken down with admiration even as a boy the sibyl would have bust me but i never read the vith till i began it two days ago it is all fresh and wonderful do you envy me if only i knew any latin if you had a decent edition with notesmany notesi should like well to have it mine is a damned didot with not the ghost of a note type that puts my eyes out and i suspect no very splendid textbut there the carnal feelings of the man who cant construe are probably parents to the suspicion  my dear fellow i would tenfold rather come to the monument but my father is an old man and if i go to town it shall be this time for his pleasure he has many marks of age some of childhood i wish this knighthood business could come off though even the talk of it has been already something but the change to my eyes is thoroughly begun and a very beautiful simple honourable highspirited and childlike and childish man is now in process of deserting us piecemeal si quis piorumgod knows not that he was pious but he did his hands darg or tried to do it and if notwell it is a melancholy businessyours ever       r l s     to mrs fleeming jenkin      the first letter showing stevensons new interest in the    technicalities of music       skerryvore bournemouth march 1886  my dear mrs jenkini try to tell myself it is good nature but i know it is vanity that makes me write  i have drafted the first part of chapter vi fleeming and his friends his influence on me his views on religion and literature his part at the savile it should boil down to about ten pages and i really do think it admirably good it has so much evoked fleeming for myself that i found my conscience stirred just as it used to be after a serious talk with him surely that means it is good i had to write and tell you being alone  i have excellent news of fanny who is much better for the change my father is still very yellow and very old and very weak but yesterday he seemed happier and smiled and followed what was said even laughed i think when he came away he said to me take care of yourself my dearie which had a strange sound of childish days and will not leave my mind  you must get litolfs gavottes c√©l√®bres i have made another trover there a musette of lullys the second part of it i have not yet got the hang of but the firstonly a few bars the gavotte is beautiful and pretty hard i think and very much of the period and at the end of it this musette enters with the most really thrilling effect of simple beauty oits firstrate i am quite mad over it if you find other books containing lully rameau martini please let me know also you might tell me you who know bach where the easiest is to be found i write all morning come down and never leave the piano till about five write letters dine get down again about eight and never leave the piano till i go to bed this is a fine lifeyours most sincerely       r l s   if you get the musette lullys please tell me if i am right and it was probably written for strings anyway it is as neat asas neat as bachon the piano or seems so to my ignorance  i play much of the rigadoon but its strange it dont come off quite so well with me  illustration  there is the first part of the musette copied from memory so i hope theres nothing wrong is it not angelic but it ought of course to have the gavotte before the gavotte is in g and ends on the keynote thus if i remember  illustration  staccato i think then you sail into the musette   nbwhere i have put an a is that a dominant eleventh or what or just a seventh on the d and if the latter is that allowed it sounds very funny never mind all my questions if i begin about music which is my leading ignorance and curiosity i have always to babble questions all my friends know me now and take no notice whatever the whole piece is marked allegro but surely could easily be played too fast the dignity must not be lost the periwig feeling     to sidney colvin      written after his return from an excursion to matlock with his    father following on their visit to london the verses means    underwoods the suppressed poem is that headed to     afterwards printed in songs of travel       skerryvore bournemouth april 1886  my dear colvinthis is to announce to you what i believe should have been done sooner that we are at skerryvore we were both tired and i was fighting my second cold so we came straight through by the west  we have a butler he doesnt buttle but the point of the thing is the style when fanny gardens he stands over her and looks genteel he opens the door and i am told waits at table well whats the odds i shall have it on my tombhe ran a butler    he may have been this and that     a drunkard or a guttler   he may have been bald and fat     at least he kept a butler    he may have sprung from ill or well     from emperor or sutler   he may be burning now in hell     on earth he kept a butler  i want to tell you also that i have suppressed your poem i shall send it you for yourself and i hope you will agree with me that it was not good enough in point of view of merit and a little too intimate as between you and me i would not say less of you my friend but i scarce care to say so much in public while we live a man may stand on his own head it is not fair to set his friend on a pedestal  the verses are now at press i have written a damn fine balladand i am dear s c ever yours       tomnoddy     to thomas stevenson      want of health preventing the author at this time from carrying the    adventures of david balfour as narrated in kidnapped through to    their issue as originally designed it was resolved to wind them up    for the present with the discomfiture of the wicked uncle leaving    open the possibility of a sequel which was supplied six years later    in catriona       skerryvore bournemouth april 1886  my dear fatherthe david problem has today been decided i am to leave the door open for a sequel if the public take to it and this will save me from butchering a lot of good material to no purpose your letter from carlisle was pretty like yourself sir as i was pleased to see the hand of jekyll not the hand of hyde i am for action quite unfit and even a letter is beyond me so pray take these scraps at a vast deal more than their intrinsic worth i am in great spirits about david colvin agreeing with henley fanny and myself in thinking it far the most human of my labours hitherto as to whether the longeared british public may take to it all think it more than doubtful i wish they would for i could do a second volume with ease and pleasure and colvin thinks it sin and folly to throw away david and alan breck upon so small a field as this oneever your affectionate son       r l s     to miss monroe      the next is in answer to criticisms on prince otto received from a    lady correspondent in chicago       skerryvore bournemouth may 25th 1886  dear miss monroei hope i have this rightly i must lose no time in thanking you for a letter singularly pleasant to receive it may interest you to know that i read to the signature without suspecting my correspondent was a woman though in one point a reference to the countess i might have found a hint of the truth you are not pleased with otto since i judge you do not like weakness and no more do i and yet i have more than tolerance for otto whose faults are the faults of weakness but never of ignoble weakness and who seeks before all to be both kind and just seeks not succeeds but what is man so much of cynicism to recognise that nobody does right is the best equipment for those who do not wish to be cynics in good earnest think better of otto if my plea can influence you and this i mean for your own sakenot his poor fellow as he will never learn your opinion but for yours because as men go in this world and women too you will not go far wrong if you light upon so fine a fellow and to light upon one and not perceive his merits is a calamity in the flesh of course i mean in the book the fault of course is with my stumbling pen seraphina made a mistake about her otto it begins to swim before me dimly that you may have some traits of seraphina  with true ingratitude you see me pitch upon your exception but it is easier to defend oneself gracefully than to acknowledge praise i am truly glad that you should like my books for i think i see from what you write that you are a reader worth convincing your name if i have properly deciphered it suggests that you may be also something of my countrywoman for it is hard to see where monroe came from if not from scotland i seem to have here a double claim on your good nature being myself pure scotch and having appreciated your letter make up two undeniable merits which perhaps if it should be quite without trouble you might reward with your photographyours truly       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      evidently written about the 10th of june very soon after the    decision of mr gladstone to dissolve parliament on the defeat of the    home rule bill june 8 as to the travelling companion see above    p 68       skerryvore bournemouth june 1886  my dear colvini am in bed againbloodie jackery and be damned to it lloyd is better i think and money matters better only my rascal carcase and the muddy and oily lees of what was once my immortal soul are in a poor and pitiful condition        litany   damn the political situation       you       me        and       gladstone  i am a kind of dam home ruler worse luck to it i would support almost anything but that bill how am i to vote great c√¶sars ghostever yours       r l s   o the travelling companion wont do i am back on it entirely it is a foul gross bitter ugly daub with lots of stuff in it and no urbanity and no glee and no true tragedyto the crows with it a carrion tale i will do no more carrion i have done too much in this carrion epoch i will now be clean and by clean i dont mean any folly about purity but such things as a healthy man with his bowels open shall find fit to see and speak about without a pang of nauseai am yours       a repentant dankist   the lakeists the drainists the brookists and the riverites let me be a brookist faute de mieux  i did enjoy myself in town and was a thousandfold the better of it     to miss monroe        skerryvore bournemouth june 1886  my dear miss monroei am ill in bed and stupid incoherently stupid yet i have to answer your letter and if the answer is incomprehensible you must forgive me you say my letter caused you pleasure i am sure as it fell out not near so much as yours has brought to me the interest taken in an author is fragile his next book or your next year of culture might see the interest frosted or outgrown and himself in spite of all you might probably find the most distasteful person upon earth my case is different i have bad health am often condemned to silence for days togetherwas so once for six weeks so that my voice was awful to hear when i first used it like the whisper of a shadowhave outlived all my chief pleasures which were active and adventurous and ran in the open air and being a person who prefers life to art and who knows it is a far finer thing to be in love or to risk a danger than to paint the finest picture or write the noblest book i begin to regard what remains to me of my life as very shadowy from a variety of reasons i am ashamed to confess i was much in this humour when your letter came i had a good many troubles was regretting a high average of sins had been recently reminded that i had outlived some friends and wondering if i had not outlived some friendships and had just while boasting of better health been struck down again by my haunting enemy an enemy who was exciting at first but has now by the iteration of his strokes become merely annoying and inexpressibly irksome can you fancy that to a person drawing towards the elderly this sort of conjunction of circumstances brings a rather aching sense of the past and the future well it was just then that your letter and your photograph were brought to me in bed and there came to me at once the most agreeable sense of triumph my books were still young my words had their good health and could go about the world and make themselves welcome and even in a shadowy and distant sense make something in the nature of friends for the sheer hulk that stays at home and bites his pen over the manuscripts it amused me very much to remember that i had been in chicago not so many years ago in my proper person where i had failed to awaken much remark except from the ticket collector and to think how much more gallant and persuasive were the fellows that i now send instead of me and how these are welcome in that quarter to the sitter of herr platz while their author was not very welcome even in the villainous restaurant where he tried to eat a meal and rather failed  and this leads me directly to a confession the photograph which shall accompany this is not chosen as the most like but the bestlooking put yourself in my place and you will call this pardonable even as it is even putting forth a flattered presentment i am a little pained and very glad it is a photograph and not myself that has to go for in this case if it please you you can tell yourself it is my imageand if it displease you you can lay the blame on the photographer but in that there were no help and the poor author might belie his labours  kidnapped should soon appear i am afraid you may not like it as it is very unlike prince otto in every way but i am myself a great admirer of the two chief characters alan and david virginibus puerisque has never been issued in the states i do not think it is a book that has much charm for publishers in any land but i am to bring out a new edition in england shortly a copy of which i must try to remember to send you i say try to remember because i have some superficial acquaintance with myself and i have determined after a galling discipline to promise nothing more until the day of my death at least in this way i shall no more break my word and i must now try being churlish instead of being false  i do not believe you to be the least like seraphina your photograph has no trace of her which somewhat relieves me as i am a good deal afraid of seraphinasthey do not always go into the woods and see the sunrise and some are so wellmailed that even that experience would leave them unaffected and unsoftened the hair and eyes of several complexions was a trait taken from myself and i do not bind myself to the opinions of sir john in this case perhapsbut no if the peculiarity is shared by two such pleasant persons as you and i as you and methe grammatical nut is hard it must be a very good thing indeed and sir john must be an ass  the book reader notice was a strange jumble of fact and fancy i wish you could have seen my fathers old assistant and present partner when he heard my father described as an inspector of lighthouses for we are all very proud of the family achievements and the name of my house here in bournemouth is stolen from one of the seatowers of the hebrides which are our pyramids and monuments i was never at cambridge again but neglected a considerable succession of classes at edinburgh but to correct that friendly blunderer were to write an autobiographyand so now with many thanks believe me yours sincerely

she was an ancestor of yours as david was no doubt some kind of relative of mine  i have no time for more but send my love and remembrances to your brotherever your affectionate       r l s     to r a m stevenson      during these months as already indicated stevenson was very much    taken up in byhours with trying to learn something of the theory    and practice of music and spent much of his time pickling as he    called it in an elementary manner on the piano he even tried his    hand in an experimental way at composition and had sent one of his    attempts for criticism to his cousin mr r a m stevenson who was    better versed in the art       skerryvore bournemouth july 1886  siryour foolish letter was unduly received there may be hidden fifths and if there are it shows how dam spontaneous the thing was i could tinker and tictactoe on a piece of paper but scorned the act with a threnody which was poured forth like blood and water on the groaning organ if your heart which was what i addressed remained unmoved let us refer to the affair no more crystallised emotion the statement and the reconciliation of the sorrows of the race and the individual is obviously no more to you than supping sawdust well well if ever i write another threnody my next op will probably be a passepied and fugue in g or d  the mind is in my case shrunk to the size and sp gr of an aged spanish

arranged la dove prende almost to the end for two melodious forefingers i am next going to score the really nobler colomba o tortorella for the same instruments          this day is published   the

keys despoiled of their graces and even changed in time i do not wish to regard music nor to be regarded through that bony lenz you say you are a spoonfed idiot but how about lenz and how about me sir me  i yesterday sent lloyd by parcel post at great expense an empty matchbox and empty cigarettepaper book a bell from a cats collar an iron kitchen spoon and a piece of coal more than half the

head       skerryvore bournemouth july 7th 1886  my dear peopleit is probably my fault and not yours that i did not understand i think it would be well worth trying the winter in bournemouth but i would only take the house by the monththis after mature discussion my leakage still pursues its course if i were only well i have a notion to go north and get in if i could at the inn at kirkmichael which has always smiled upon me much if i did well there we might then meet and do what should most smile at the time  meanwhile of course i must not move and am in a rancid box here feeling the heat a great deal and pretty tired of things alexander did a good thing of me at last it looks like a mixture of an aztec idol a lion an indian rajah and a woman and certainly represents a mighty comic figure f and lloyd both think it is the best thing that has been done of me up to now  you should hear lloyd on the penny whistle and me on the piano dear powers what a concerto i now live entirely

decided not to come to scotland but just to do as dobell wished and take an outing i believe this is wiser in all ways but i own it is a disappointment i am weary of england like alan i weary for the heather if not for the deer lloyd has gone to scilly with katharine and c where and with whom he should have a good time david seems really to be going to succeed which is a pleasant prospect on all sides i am i believe floated financially a book that sells will be a pleasant novelty i enclose another review mighty complimentary and calculated to sell the book too  coolins tombstone has been got out honest man and it is to be polished for it has got scratched and have a touch of gilding in the letters and be sunk in the front of the house worthy man he too will maybe weary for the heather and the bents of gullane where as i dare say you remember he gaed clean gyte and jumped on to his crown from a gig in hot and hopeless chase of many thousand rabbits i can still hear the little cries of the honest fellow as he disappeared and my mother will correct me but i believe it was two days before he turned up again at north berwick to judge by his belly he had caught not one out of these thousands but he had had some exercise  i keep wellever your affectionate son       r l s     to alison cunningham      anticipating the gift of a cupboard and answering the questions set    in his last the date of the readings had been his seventh year mr    galpin was a partner in cassell petter galpin  co       skerryvore bournemouth july or august 1886  my dear cummythe cupboard has not yet turned up and i was hanging on to be able to say it had however that is only a trick to escape another letter and i should despise myself if i kept it up it was truly kind of you dear cummy to send it to us and i will let you know where we set it and how it looks  carus rearn and andrew silex and the others were from a story you read me in cassells family paper and which i have been reading again and found by no means a bad story mr galpin lent me all the old volumes and i mean to reread custaloga also but have not yet it was strangely like old times to read the other dont you remember the poisoning with mushrooms that was andrew silexyours most affectionately       r l s     to mrs thomas stevenson      having given up going to scotland for a summer change stevenson had    started on the outing which he mentions in the last letter it took    the shape of a ten days visit to my house at the british museum    followed by another made in the company of mr henley to paris    chiefly for the sake of seeing the w h lows and the sculptor rodin       british museum august 10th 1886  my dear motherwe are having a capital holiday and i am much better and enjoying myself to the nines richmond is painting my portrait today i lunch with him and meet burnejones tonight browning dines with us that sounds rather lofty work does it not his path was paved with celebrities tomorrow we leave for paris and next week i suppose or the week after come home address here as we may not reach paris i am really very wellever your affectionate son       r l s     to t wattsdunton      written after his return from london and paris       skerryvore bournemouth september 1886  dear mr wattsthe sight of the last athen√¶um reminds me of you and of my debt now too long due i wish to thank you for your notice of kidnapped and that not because it was kind though for that also i valued it but in the same sense as i have thanked you before now for a hundred articles on a hundred different writers a critic like you is one who fights the good fight contending with stupidity and i would fain hope not all in vain in my own case for instance surely not in vain  what you say of the two parts in kidnapped was felt by no one more painfully than by myself i began it partly as a lark partly as a potboiler and suddenly it moved david and alan stepped out from the canvas and i found i was in another world but there was the cursed beginning and a cursed end must be appended and our old friend byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping at the back door so it had to go into the world one part as it does seem to me alive one part merely galvanised no work only an essay for a man of tentative method and weak health and a scarcity of private means and not too much of that frugality which is the artists proper virtue the days of sinecures and patrons look very golden the days of professional literature very hard yet i do not so far deceive myself as to think i should change my character by changing my epoch the sum of virtue in our books is in a relation of equality to the sum of virtues in ourselves and my kidnapped was doomed while still in the womb and while i was yet in the cradle to be the thing it is  and now to the more genial business of defence you attack my fight on board the covenant i think it literal david and alan had every advantage on their sideposition arms training a good conscience a handful of merchant sailors not well led in the first attack not led at all in the second could only by an accident have taken the roundhouse by attack and since the defenders had firearms and food it is even doubtful if they could have been starved out the only doubtful point with me is whether the seamen would have ever ventured on the second onslaught i half believe they would not still the illusion of numbers and the authority of hoseason would perhaps stretch far enough to justify the extremityi am dear mr watts your very sincere admirer       robert louis stevenson     to alison cunningham        skerryvore bournemouth september 1886  my dear cummyi am home from a long holiday vastly better in health my wife not home yet as she is being cured in some rather boisterous fashion by some swedish doctors i hope it may do her good as the process seems not to be agreeable in itself  your cupboard has come and it is most beautiful it is certainly worth a lot of money and is just what we have been looking for in all the shops for quite a while so your present falls very pat it is to go in our bedroom i think but perhaps my wife will think it too much of a good thing to be put so much out of the way so i shall not put it in its place till her return i am so well that i am afraid to speak of it being a coward as to boasting i take walks in the wood daily and have got back to my work after a long break the story i wrote you about was one you read to me in cassells family paper long ago when it came out it was astonishing how clearly i remembered it all pictures characters and incidents though the last were a little mixed and i had not the least the hang of the story it was very pleasant to read it again and remember old days and the weekly excursion to mrs hoggs after that precious journal dear me lang syne now god bless you dear cummyyour afft boy       r l stevenson     to frederick lockerlampson     mr lockerlampson better known as frederick locker the friend of    tennyson and most accomplished writer of vers de soci√©t√© in his    time had through their common friend mr andrew lang asked stevenson    for a set of verses and he had sent the followingwhich were first    printed i believe at the head of a very scarce volumerowfant    rhymes by frederick locker with an introduction by austin dobson    cleveland the rowfant club 1895 127 copies only printed       skerryvore september 4 1886    not roses to the rose i trow     the thistle sends nor to the bee   do wasps bring honey wherefore now     should locker ask a verse from me    martial perchancebut he is dead     and herrick now must rhyme no more   still burning with the muse they tread     and arm in arm the shadowy shore    they if they lived with dainty hand     to music as of mountain brooks   might bring you worthy words to stand     unshamed dear locker in your books    but tho these fathers of your race     be gone before yourself a sire   today you see before your face     your stalwart youngsters touch the lyre    on theseon lang or dobsoncall     long leaders of the songful feast   they lend a verse your laughing fall     a verse they owe you at the least     to frederick lockerlampson      to mr lockers acknowledgment of these verses stevenson replied as    follows asking his correspondents interest on behalf of a friend    who had been kind to him at hy√®res in procuring a nomination for her    son to the bluecoat school       skerryvore bournemouth september 1886  dear lockeryou take my verses too kindly but you will admit for such a bluebottle of a versifier to enter the house of gertrude where her necklace hangs was not a little brave your kind invitation i fear must remain unaccepted and yetif i am very wellperhaps next springfor i mean to be very wellmy wife might but all that is in the clouds with my better health and now look here you are a rich man and know many people therefore perhaps some of the governors of christs hospital if you do i know a most deserving case in which i would if i could do anything to approach you in this way is not decent and you may therefore judge by my doing it how near this matter lies to my heart i enclose you a list of the governors which i beg you to return whether or not you shall be able to do anything to help me  the boys name is  he and his mother are very poor it may interest you in her cause if i tell you this that when i was dangerously ill at hy√®res this brave lady who had then a sick husband of her own since dead and a house to keep and a family of four to cook for all with her own hands for they could afford no servant yet took watchabout with my wife and contributed not only to my comfort but to my recovery in a degree that i am not able to limit you can conceive how much i suffer from my impotence to help her and indeed i have already shown myself a thankless friend let not my cry go up before you in vainyours in hope       robert louis stevenson     to frederick lockerlampson      mr locker apparently misunderstanding the application had replied    with a cheque       skerryvore bournemouth september 1886  my dear lockerthat i should call myself a man of letters and land myself in such unfathomable ambiguities no my dear locker i did not want a cheque and in my ignorance of business which is greater even than my ignorance of literature i have taken the liberty of drawing a pen through the document and returning it should this be against the laws of god or man forgive me all that i meant by my excessively disgusting reference to your material wellbeing was the vague notion that a man who is well off was sure to know a governor of christs hospital though how i quite arrived at this conclusion i do not see a man with a cold in the head does not necessarily know a ratcatcher and the connection is equally closeas it now appears to my awakened and somewhat humbled spirit for all that let me thank you in the warmest manner for your friendly readiness to contribute you say you have hopes of becoming a miser i wish i had but indeed i believe you deceive yourself and are as far from it as ever i wish i had any excuse to keep your cheque for it is much more elegant to receive than to return but i have my way of making it up to you and i do sincerely beg you to write to the two governors this extraordinary outpouring of correspondence would if you knew my habits convince you of my great eagerness in this matter i would promise gratitude but i have made a promise to myself to make no more promises to anybody else having broken such a host already and come near breaking my heart in consequence and as for gratitude i am by nature a thankless dog and was spoiled from a child up but if you can help this lady in the matter of the hospital you will have helped the worthy let me continue to hope that i shall make out my visit in the spring and believe me yours very truly       robert louis stevenson   it may amuse you to know that a very long while ago i broke my heart to try to imitate your verses and failed hopelessly i saw some of the evidences the other day among my papers and blushed to the heels       r l s   i give up finding out your name in the meantime and keep to that by which you will be knownfrederick locker     to frederick lockerlampson        skerryvore bournemouth 24th september 1886  my dear lockeryou are simply an angel of light and your two letters have gone to the post i trust they will reach the hearts of the recipientsat least that could not be more handsomely expressed about the cheque well now i am going to keep it but i assure you mrs  has never asked me for money and i would not dare to offer any till she did for all that i shall stick to the cheque now and act to that amount as your almoner in this way i reward myself for the ambiguity of my epistolary style  i suppose if you please you may say your verses are thin would you so describe an arrow by the way and one that struck the gold it scarce strikes me as exhaustively descriptive and thin or not they are and i have found them inimitably elegant i thank you again very sincerely for the generous trouble you have taken in this matter which was so near my heart and you may be very certain it will be the fault of my health and not my inclination if i do not see you before very long for all that has past has made me in more than the official sense sincerely yours       robert louis stevenson     to auguste rodin     written after another visit to me in london in

following refers first if i remember right to some steps that    were being taken to obtain recognition in the form of a knighthood    for the elder stevensons public services next to the writers own    work at the time in hand and lastly to my volume on keats then in    preparation for the english men of letters series       skerryvore dec 14 1886  my dear colvinthis is firstrate of you the lord love you for it i am truly much obliged hemy fatheris very changeable at times he seems only a slow quiet edition of himself again he will be very heavy and blank but never so violent as last spring and therefore to my mind better on the whole  fanny is pretty peepy i am splendid i have been writing much versequite the bard in fact and also a dam tale to order which will be what it will be i dont love it but some of it is passable in its mouldy way the misadventures of john nicholson all my bardly exercises are in scotch i have struck my somewhat ponderous guitar in that tongue to no small extent with what success i know not but i think its better than my english verse more marrow and fatness and more ruggedness  how goes keats pray remark if he keats hung back from shelley it was not to be wondered at when so many of his friends were shelleys pensioners i forget if you have made this point it has been borne in upon me reading dowden and the shelley papers and it will do no harm if you have made it i finished a poem today and writ 3000 words of a story tant bien que mal and have a right to be sleepy and what is far nobler and rarer am somy dear colvin ever yours       the real mackay     to lady taylor      stevensons volume of tales the merry men so called from the story    which heads the collection was about to appear with a dedication to    lady taylor professor dowdens shelley had lately come out and    had naturally been read with eager interest in a circle where sir    percy the poets son and lady shelley were intimate friends and    neighbours       skerryvore bournemouth new year 1887  my dear lady taylorthis is to wish you all the salutations of the year with some regret that i cannot offer them in person yet less than i had supposed for hitherto your flight to london seems to have worked well and time flies and will soon bring you back again though time is ironical too and it would be like his irony if the same tide that brought you back carried me away that would not be at least without some meeting  i feel very sorry to think the book to which i have put your name will be no better and i can make it no better the tales are of all dates and places they are like the box the goose and the cottage of the ferryman and must go floating down time together as best they can but i am after all a superior pennyaliner i must do in the scotch phrase as it will do with me and i cannot always choose what my books are to be only seize the chance they offer to link my name to a friends i hope the lot of them the tales will look fairly disciplined when they are clapped in binding but i fear they will be but an awkward squad i have a mild wish that you at least would read them no further than the dedication  i suppose we have all been reading dowden it seems to me a really firstrate book full of justice and humour without which there can be no justice and of fine intelligence besides here and there perhaps a trifle precious but this is to spy flaws in a fine work i was weary at my resemblances to shelley i seem but a shelley with less oil and no genius though i have had the fortune to live longer and partly to grow up he was growing up there is a manlier note in the last days in spite of such really sickening aberrations as the emillia viviani business i try to take a humorouslygenial view of life but emillia viviani if i have her detested name aright19 is too much for my philosophy i cannot smile when i see all these grown folk waltzing and piping the eye about an insubordinate and perfectly abominable schoolgirl as silly and patently as false as blanche amory20 i really think it is one of those episodes that make the angels weep  with all kind regards and affectionate good wishes to and for you and yours believe me your affectionate friend       robert louis stevenson     to lady taylor      the reference in the last paragraph to a vision cannot be    explained his correspondents daughters retaining no memory on the    subject       skerryvore bournemouth january 1887  my dear lady taylori dont know but what i agree fairly well with all you say only i like the merry men as a fantasia or vision of the sea better than you do the trouble with olalla is that it somehow sounds false and i think it must be this that gives you the feeling of irreverence of thrawn janet which i like very much myself you say nothing thus uttering volumes but it is plain that people cannot always agree i do not think it is a wholesome part of me that broods on the evil in the world and man but i do not think that i get harm from it possibly my readers may which is more serious but at any account i do not purpose to write more in this vein but the odd problem is what makes a story true markheim is true olalla false and i dont know why nor did i feel it while i worked at them indeed i had more inspiration with olalla as the style shows i am glad you thought that young spanish woman well dressed i admire the style of it myself more than is perhaps good for me it is so solidly written and that again brings back almost with the voice of despair my unanswerable why is it false  here is a great deal about my works i am in bed again and my wife but soso and we have no news recently from lloyd and the cat is well and we see or i see no one so that other matters are all closed against me  your vision is strange indeed but i see not how to use it i fear i am earthy enough myself to regard it as a case of disease but certainly it is a thrilling case to hear ofever affectionately yours       robert louis stevenson     to henry james      this letter is written on the front page of a set of proofs of    memories and portraits the silly xmas story is the    misadventures of john nicholson the volume of verse appeared    later in the year as underwoods the signature refers to the two    scots poets of whom in his native speech he considered himself    the follower       skerryvore bournemouth january 1887    all the salutations  my dear jamesi send you the first sheets of the new volume all that has yet reached me the rest shall follow in course i am really a very fair sort of a fellow all things considered have done some work a silly xmas story with some larks in it which wont be out till i dont know when i am also considering a volume of verse much of which will be cast in my native speech that very dark oracular medium i suppose this is a folly but what then as the nurse says in marryat it was only a little one  my wife is peepy and dowie two scotch expressions with which i will leave you to wrestle unaided as a preparation for my poetical works she is a woman as you know not without art the art of extracting the gloom of the eclipse from sunshine and she has recently laboured in this field not without success or as we used to say not without a blessing it is strange we fell out my wife and i the other night she tackled me savagely for being a canarybird i replied bleatingly protesting that there was no use in turning life into king lear presently it was discovered that there were two dead combatants upon the field each slain by an arrow of the truth and we tenderly carried off each others corpses here is a little comedy for henry james to write the beauty was each thought the other quite unscathed at first but we had dealt shrewd stabs  you say nothing of yourself which i shall take to be good news archers note has gone he is in truth a very clever fellow that archer and i believe a good one it is a pleasant thing to see a man who can use a pen he can really says what he means and says it with a manner comes into print like one at his ease not shamefaced and wrongfootforemost like the bulk of us well here is luck and here are the kindest

  skerryvore bournemouth february 5th 1887  my dear lockerhere i am in my bed as usual and it is indeed a long while since i went out to dinner you do not know what a crazy fellow this is my winter has not so far been luckily passed and all hope of paying visits at easter has vanished for twelve calendar months but because i am a beastly and indurated invalid i am not dead to human feelings and i neither have forgotten you nor will forget you some day the wind may round to the right quarter and we may meet till then i am still truly yours       robert louis stevenson     to henry james

it in once more in the absurdest fashion and the creature who now addresses you is but a stringy and whitefaced bouilli out of the pot of fever with the devil to pay in every corner of his economy i suppose to judge by your letter i need not send you these sheets which came during my collapse by the rush i am on the start with three volumes that one of tales a second one of essays and one ofahemverse this is a great order is it not after that i shall have empty lockers all new work stands still i was getting on well with jenkin when this blessed malady unhorsed me and sent me back to the dungcollecting trade of the republisher i shall reissue virg puer as vol i of essays and the new vol as vol ii of ditto to be sold however separately this is but a dry maundering however i am

business of a distinctly rancid character my father under my wifes tutorage proceeds tomorrow to salisbury i remain here in my bed and whistle in no quarter of heaven is anything encouraging apparent

continental bradshaw or sich from london to bournemouth impoverished parties who can stoop to the third class get their ticket for the matter of 10s or as my wife loves to phrase it a half a pound you will also be involved in a 3s fare to get to skerryvore but this i dare say friends could help you in on your arrival so that you may reserve your energies for the two ticketscosting the matter of a

and with the aid of vangs fangs might easily double the whole amountabove all if you have a few friends to meet you  in making this valuable project or budget i discovered for the first time a reason frequently overlooked for the singular costliness of travelling with your wife anybody would count the tickets double but how few would have rememberedor indeed has any one ever rememberedto count the spontaneous lapse of coin double also yet there are two of you each must do his daily leakage and it must be done out of your travelling fund you will tell me perhaps that you carry the coin yourself my dear sir do you think you can fool your maker your wife has to lose her quota and by god she willif you kept the coin in a belt one thing i have omitted you will lose a certain amount on the exchange but this even i cannot foresee as it is one of the few things that vary with the way a man hasi am dear sir yours financially       samuel budgett     to sidney colvin      i had lately sent him two books the fifth volume of huxleys    collected essays and cotter morisons service of man the latter    a work of positivist tendency which its genial and accomplished    author had long meditated but which unfortunately he only began to    write after a rapid decline of health and power had set in       skerryvore bournemouth spring 1887  my dear colvini read huxley and a lot of it with great interest eh what a gulf between a man with a mind like huxley and a man like cotter morison truly tis the book of a boy before i was twenty i was done with all these considerations nor is there one happy phrase except the devastating flood of children why should he din our ears with languid repetitions of the very first ideas and facts that a bright lad gets hold of and how can a man be so destitute of historical perspective so full of cheap outworn generalisationsfeudal ages time of sufferingpas tant quaujourdhui m cotter christianitywhich what how you must not attack all forms from calvin to st thomas from st thomas to one who should surely be considered jesus christ with the same missiles they do not all tell against all but there it is as we said a man joins a sect and becomes oneeyed he affects a horror of vices which are just the thing to stop his devastating flood of babies and just the thing above all to keep the vicious from procreating where then is the ground of this horror in any intelligent servant of humanity o beware of creeds and anticreeds sects and antisects there is but one truth outside science the truth that comes of an earnest smiling survey of mankind from china to peru or further and from today to the days of probably arboreal and the truth however true it is that robs you of sympathy with any form of thought or trait of man is false for you and heretical and hereticoplastic hear morison struggling with his chains hear me hear all of us when we suffer our creeds or anticreeds to degenerate towards the whine and begin to hate our neighbours or our ancestors like ourselves and yet in morison too as in st thomas as in rutherford ay or in peden truth struggles or it would not so deform them the man has not a devil it is an angel that tears and blinds him but morisons is an old almost a venerable seraph with whom i dealt before i was twenty and had done before i was twentyfive  behold how the voices of dead preachers speak hollowly and lengthily within meyours everand rather betternot much       r l s     to alison cunningham        skerryvore april 16th 1887  my dearest cummyas usual i have been a dreary bad fellow and not written for ages but you must just try to forgive me to believe what is the truth that the number of my letters is no measure of the number of times i think of you and to remember how much writing i have to do the weather is bright but still cold and my father im afraid feels it sharply he has hadstill has rathera most obstinate jaundice which has reduced him cruelly in strength and really upset him altogether i hope or think he is perhaps a little better but he suffers much cannot sleep at night and gives john and my mother a severe life of it to wait upon him my wife is i think a little better but no great shakes i keep mightily respectable myself  coolins tombstone is now built into the front wall of skerryvore and poor bogies with a latin inscription also is set just above it poor unhappy wee man he died as you must have heard in fight which was what he would have chosen for military glory was more in his line than the domestic virtues i believe this is about all my news except that as i write there is a blackbird singing in our garden trees as it were at swanston i would like fine to go up the burnside a bit and sit by the pool and be young againor no be what i am still only there instead of here for just a little did you see that i had written about john todd in this months longman it was if you have not seen it i will try and send it you some day climb as high as halkerside for me i am never likely to do it for myself and sprinkle some of the well water on the turf i am afraid it is a pagan rite but quite harmless and ye can sain it wi a bit prayer tell the peewies that i mind their forbears well my heart is sometimes heavy and sometimes glad to mind it all but for what we have received the lord make us truly thankful dont forget to sprinkle the water and do it in my name i feel a childish eagerness in this  remember me most kindly to james and with all sorts of love to yourself believe me your laddie       robert louis stevenson   psi suppose mrs todd ought to see the paper about her man judge of that and if you think she would not dislike it buy her one from me and let me know the article is called pastoral in longmans magazine for april i will send you the money i would today but its the sabbie day and i cannae       r l s   remembrances from all here     to mrs fleeming jenkin      the following sets forth the pros and cons which were balancing    each other in his mind in regard to his scheme of going to make a    stand in his own person against agrarian outrage in ireland       skerryvore bournemouth april 15 or 16         the hour not being known 1887  my dear mrs jenkinit is i know not what hour of the night but i cannot sleep have lit the gas and here goes  first all your packet arrived i have dipped into the schumann already with great pleasure surely in what concerns us there is a sweet little chirrup the good words arrived in the morning just when i needed it and the famous notes that i had lost were recovered also in the nick of time  and now i am going to bother you with my affairs premising first that this is private second that whatever i do the life shall be done first and i am getting on with it well and third that i do not quite know why i consult you but something tells me you will hear with fairness  here is my problem the curtin women are still miserable prisoners no one dare buy their farm of them all the manhood of england and the world stands aghast before a threat of murder 1 now my work can be done anywhere hence i can take up without loss a backgoing irish farm and live on though not as i had originally written in it first reason 2 if i should be killed there are a good many who would feel it writers are so much in the public eye that a writer being murdered would attract attention throw a bullseye light upon this cowardly business second reason 3 i am not unknown in the states from which the funds come that pay for these brutalities to some faint extent my death if i should be killed would tell there third reason 4 nobody else is taking up this obvious and crying duty fourth reason 5 i have a crazy health and may die at any moment my life is of no purchase in an insurance office it is the less account to husband it and the business of husbanding a life is dreary and demoralising fifth reason  i state these in no order but as they occur to me and i shall do the like with the objections  first objection it will do no good you have seen gordon die and nobody minded nobody will mind if you die this is plainly of the devil second objection you will not even be murdered the climate will miserably kill you you will strangle out in a rotten damp heat in congestion etc well what then it changes nothing the purpose is to brave crime let me brave it for such time and to such an extent as god allows third objection the curtin women are probably highly uninteresting females i havent a doubt of it but the government cannot men will not protect them if i am the only one to see this public duty it is to the public and the right i should perform itnot to mesdames curtin fourth objection i am married i have married a wife i seem to have heard it before it smells ancient what was the context fifth objection my wife has had a mean life 1 loves me 2 could not bear to lose me 3 1 i admit i am sorry 2 but what does she love me for and 3 she must lose me soon or late and after all because we run this risk it does not follow we should fail sixth objection my wife wouldnt like it no she wouldnt who would but the curtins dont like it and all those who are to suffer if this goes on wont like it and if there is a great wrong somebody must suffer seventh objection i wont like it no i will not i have thought it through and i will not but what of that and both she and i may like it more than we suppose we shall lose friends all comforts all society so has everybody who has ever done anything but we shall have some excitement and thats a fine thing and we shall be trying to do the right and thats not to be despised eighth objection i am an author with my work before me see second reason ninth objection but am i not taken with the hope of excitement i was at first i am not much now i see what a dreary friendless miserable godforgotten business it will be and anyway is not excitement the proper reward of doing anything both right and a little dangerous tenth objection but am i not taken with a notion of glory i dare say i am yet i see quite clearly how all points to nothing coming to a quite inglorious death by disease and from the lack of attendance or even if i should be knocked on the head as these poor irish promise how little any one will care it will be a smile at a thousand breakfasttables i am nearly forty now i have not many illusions and if i had i do not love this healthtending housekeeping life of mine i have a taste for danger which is human like the fear of it here is a fair cause a just cause no knight ever set lance in rest for a juster yet it needs not the strength i have not only the passive courage that i hope i could muster and the watchfulness that i am sure i could learn  here is a long midnight dissertation with myself with you please let me hear but i charge you this if you see in this idea of mine the finger of duty do not dissuade me i am nearing forty i begin to love my ease and my home and my habits i never knew how much till this arose do not falsely counsel me to put my head under the bedclothes and i will say this to you my wife who hates the idea does not refuse it is nonsense says she but if you go i will go poor girl and her home and her garden that she was so proud of i feel her garden most of all because it is a pleasure i suppose that i do not feel myself to share     1 here is a great wrong    2        a growing wrong    3        a wrong founded on crime    4        crime that the government cannot prevent    5        crime that it occurs to no man to defy    6 but it has occurred to me    7 being a known person some will notice my defiance    8 being a writer i can make people notice it    9 and i think make people imitate me   10 which would destroy in time this whole scaffolding of oppression   11 and if i fail however ignominiously that is not my concern         it is with an odd mixture of reverence and humorous remembrances         of dickens be it saidit is anothers  and here at i cannot think what hour of the morning i shall dry up and remainyours really in want of a little help       r l s     sleepless at midnights dewy    hour                         witching                           maudlin                                etc  next morningeleventh objection i have a father and mother and who has not macduffs was a rare case if we must wait for a macduff besides my father will not perhaps be long here twelfth objection the cause of england in ireland is not worth supporting √Ä qui le ditesvous and i am not supporting that home rule if you like cause of decency the idea that populations should not be taught to gain public ends by private crime the idea that for all men to bow before a threat of crime is to loosen and degrade beyond redemption the whole fabric of mans decency     to mrs fleeming jenkin      the first paragraph of the following refers to the life of fleeming    jenkin the second to a remark of his correspondent that a task    such as he had proposed to himself in ireland should be undertaken    by a society rather than an individual       skerryvore bournemouth april 1887  my dear mrs jenkinthe book it is all drafted i hope soon to send you for comments chapters iii iv and v chapter vii is roughly but satisfactorily drafted a very little work should put that to rights but chapter vi is no joke it is a mare magnum i swim and drown and come up again and it is all broken ends and mystification moreover i perceive i am in want of more matter i must have first of all a little letter from mr ewing about the phonograph work if you think he would understand it is quite a matter of chance whether i use a word or a fact out of it if you think he would not i will go without also could i have a look at ewings pr√©cis and lastly i perceive i must interview you again about a few points they are very few and might come to little and i propose to go on getting things as well together as i can in the meanwhile and rather have a final time when all is ready and only to be criticised i do still think it will be good i wonder if tr√©lat would let me cut but no i think i wouldnt after all tis so quaint and pretty and clever and simple and french and gives such a good sight of fleeming the plum of the book i think  you misunderstood me in one point i always hoped to found such a society that was the outside of my dream and would mean entire success buti cannot play peter the hermit in these days of the fleet street journalist i cannot send out better men than myself with wives or mothers just as good as mine and sisters i may at least say better to a danger and a longdrawn dreariness that i do not share my wife says its cowardice what brave men are the leaderwriters call it cowardice it is mine mind you i may end by trying to do it by the pen only i shall not love myself if i do and is it ever a good thing to do a thing for which you despise yourselfeven in the doing and if the thing you do is to call upon others to do the thing you neglect i have never dared to say what i feel about mens lives because my own was in the wrong shall i dare to send them to death the physician must heal himself he must honestly try the path he recommends if he does not even try should he not be silent  i thank you very heartily for your letter and for the seriousness you brought to it you know i think when a serious thing is your own you keep a saner man by laughing at it and yourself as you go so i do not write possibly with all the really somewhat sickened gravity i feel and indeed what with the book and this business to which i referred and ireland i am scarcely in an enviable state well i ought to be glad after ten years of the worst training on earthvaletudinarianismthat i can still be troubled by a duty you shall hear more in time so far i am at least decided i will go and see balfour when i get to london  we have all had a great pleasure a mrs rawlinson came and brought with her a nineteenyearold daughter simple human as beautiful asherself i never admired a girl before you know it was my weakness we are all three dead in love with her how nice to be able to

fortnight after the date of the above stevenson went    himself and for the last time to scotland and was present too    late for recognition at the death of his father may 8 1887    business detained him for some weeks and the following was written    just before his return to bournemouth       edinburgh june 1887  my dear s cat last i can write a word to you your little note in the pmg was charming i have written four pages in the contemporary which bunting found room for they are not very good but i shall do more for his memory in time  about the death i have long hesitated i was long before i could tell my mind and now i know it and can but say that i am glad if we could have had my father that would have been a different thing but to keep that changelingsuffering changelingany longer could better none and nothing now he rests it is more significant it is more like himself he will begin to return to us in the course of time as he was and as we loved him  my favourite words in literature my favourite sceneo let him pass kent and learwas played for me here in the first moment of my return i believe shakespeare saw it with his own father i had no words but it was shocking to see he died on his feet you know was on his feet the last day knowing nobodystill he would be up this was his constant wish also that he might smoke a pipe on his last day the funeral would have pleased him it was the largest private funeral in mans memory here  we have no plans and it is possible we may go home without going through town i do not know i have no views yet whatever nor can have any at this stage of my cold and my businessever yours       r l s     to sir walter simpson      written during a short visit to me between his return from scotland    and his departure for new york       british museum july 1887  my dear simpsonthis is a long time i have not acknowledged the art of golf though i read it through within thirtysix hours of its arrival i have been ill and out of heart and ill again and again ill till i am weary of it and glad indeed to try the pitchfarthing hazard of a trip to colorado or new mexico there we go if i prove fit for the start on august 20th  meanwhile the art of golf a lot of it is very funny and i liked the fun very well but what interested me most was the more serious part because it turns all the while on a branch of psychology that no one has treated and that interests me much the psychology of athletics i had every reason to be interested in it because i am abnormal i have no memory in athletics i have forgotten how to ride and how to skate and i should not be the least surprised if i had forgotten how to swim  i find i can write no more it is the first i have tried since i was ill and i am too weakyours ever       r l s

1887june 1888   the letters printed in the following section are selected from those which tell of stevensons voyage to new york and reception there at the beginning of september 1887 of his winters life and work at saranac lake and of his decision taken in may 1888 to venture on a yachting cruise in the south seas  the moment of his arrival at new york was that when his reputation had first reached its height in the united states owing to the popularity both of treasure island and kidnapped but more especially to the immense impression made by the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde he experienced consequently for the first time the pleasures such as they were of celebrity and also its inconveniences found the most hospitable of refuges in the house of his kind friends mr and mrs charles fairchild at newport and quickly made many other friends including the late augustus st gaudens the famous sculptor with mr c scribner and mr e l burlingame the owner and the editor of scribners magazine from whom he immediately received and accepted very advantageous offers of work having been dissuaded from braving for the present the fatigue of the long journey to colorado and the extreme rigour of its winter climate he determined to try instead a season at saranac lake in the adirondack mountains new york state which had lately been coming into reputation as a place of cure there under the care of the wellknown resident physician dr trudeau he spent nearly seven months from the end of september 1887 to the end of april 1888 with results on the whole favourable to his own health though not to that of his wife which could never support these winter mountain cures on the 16th of april he and his party left saranac after spending a fortnight in new york where as always in cities his health quickly flagged again he went for the month of may into seaside quarters at union house manasquan on the new jersey coast for the sake of fresh air and boating here he enjoyed the occasional society of some of his new york friends including mr st gaudens and mr w h low and was initiated in the congenial craft of catboat sailing in the meantime mrs stevenson had gone to san francisco to see her relatives and holding that the climate of the pacific was likely to be better for the projected cruise than that of the atlantic had inquired there whether a yacht was to be hired for such a purpose the schooner casco captain otis was found stevenson signified by telegraph his assent to the arrangement determined to risk in the adventure the sum of ¬£2000 of which his fathers death had put him in possession hoping to recoup himself by a series of letters recounting his experiences for which he had received a commission from mr s s mclure and on the 2nd of june started with his mother and stepson for san francisco the first stage on that island cruise from which he was destined never to return  his work during the season september 1887may 1888 had consisted of the twelve papers published in the course of 1888 in scribners magazine including perhaps the most striking of all his essays a chapter on dreams pulvis et umbra beggars the lantern bearers random memories etc as well as the greater part of the master of ballantrae and the wrong boxthe last originally conceived and drafted by mr lloyd osbourne     to sidney colvin      a succession of stevensons friends had visited and spent part of the    day or the evening with him at armfields hotel on sunday august    20th each bringing some farewell gift or another as related by mr    gosse in

farewell to    the party from the boat which landed me i little knew what was the    truth that i was looking on the face of my friend for the last time    the letters next following were written during or immediately after    his passage across the atlantic the commodore is of course r l s       hms vulgarium off havre de grace         this 22nd day of august 1887  sirthe weather has been hitherto inimitable inimitable is the only word that i can apply to our fellowvoyagers whom a categorist possibly premature has been already led to divide into two classesthe better sort consisting of the baser kind of bagman and the worser of undisguised beasts of the field the berths are excellent the pasture swallowable the champagne of h james to recur to my favourite adjective inimitable as for the commodore he slept awhile in the evening tossed off a cup of henry james with his plain meal walked the deck till eight among sands and floating lights and buoys and wrecked brigantines came down to his regret a minute too soon to see margate lit up turned in about nine slept with some interruptions but on the whole sweetly until six and has already walked a mile or so of deck among a fleet of other steamers waiting for the tide within view of havre and pleasantly entertained by passing fishingboats hovering seagulls and vulgarians pairing on deck with endearments of primitive simplicity there sir can be viewed the sham quarrel the sham desire for information and every device of these two poor ancient sexes who might you might think have learned in the course of the ages something new down to the exchange of headgeari am sir yours       bold bob boltsprit   b b b alias the commodore will now turn to his proofs havre de grace is a city of some show it is fortified and so far as i can see is a place of some trade it is situated in france a country of europe you always complain there are no facts in my letters       r l s     to sidney colvin        newport ri usa september 1887  my dear colvinso long it went excellent well and i had a time i am glad to have had really enjoying my life there is nothing like being at sea after all and o why have i allowed myself to rot so long on land but on the banks i caught a cold and i have not yet got over it my reception here was idiotic to the last degree it is very silly and not pleasant except where humour enters and i confess the poor interviewer lads pleased me they are too good for their trade avoided anything i asked them to avoid and were no more vulgar in their reports than they could help i liked the lads  o it was lovely on our stableship chock full of stallions she rolled heartily rolled some of the fittings out of our stateroom and i think a more dangerous cruise except that it was summer it would be hard to imagine but we enjoyed it to the masthead all but fanny and even she perhaps a little when we got in we had run out of beer stout cocoa sodawater water fresh meat and almost of biscuit but it was a thousandfold pleasanter than a great big birmingham liner like a new hotel and we liked the officers and made friends with the quartermasters and i at least made a friend of a baboon for we carried a cargo of apes whose embraces have pretty near cost me a coat the passengers improved and were a very good specimen lot with no drunkard no gambling that i saw and less grumbling and backbiting than one would have asked of poor human nature apes stallions cows matches hay and poor menfolk all or almost all came successfully to landyours ever       r l s     to henry james        newport usa september 1887  my dear jameshere we are at newport in the house of the good fairchilds and a sad burthen we have laid upon their shoulders i have been in bed practically ever since i came i caught a cold on the banks after having had the finest time conceivable and enjoyed myself more than i could have hoped on board our strange floating menagerie stallions and monkeys and matches made our cargo and the vast continent of these incongruities rolled the while like a haystack and the stallions stood hypnotised by the motion looking through the ports at our dinnertable and winked when the crockery was broken and the little monkeys stared at each other in their cages and were thrown overboard like little bluish babies and the big monkey jacko scoured about the ship and rested willingly in my arms to the ruin of my clothing and the man of the stallions made a bower of the black tarpaulin and sat therein at the feet of a raddled divinity like a picture on a box of chocolates and the other passengers when they were not sick looked on and laughed take all this picture and make it roll till the bell shall sound unexpected notes and the fittings shall break loose in our stateroom and you have the voyage of the ludgate hill she arrived in the port of new york without beer porter sodawater cura√ßoa fresh meat or fresh water and yet we lived and we regret her  my wife is a good deal run down and i am no great shakes  america is as i remarked a fine place to eat in and a great place for kindness but lord what a silly thing is popularity i envy the cool obscurity of skerryvore if it even paid said meanness and was abashed at himselfyours most sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        new york end of september 1887  my dear s cyour delightful letter has just come and finds me in a new york hotel waiting the arrival of a sculptor st gaudens who is making a medallion of yours truly and who is to boot one of the handsomest and nicest fellows i have seen i caught a cold on the banks fog is not for me nearly died of interviewers and visitors during twentyfour hours in new york cut for newport with lloyd and valentine a journey like fairyland for the most engaging beauties one little rocky and pineshaded cove after another each with a house and a boat at anchor so that i left my heart in each and marvelled why american authors had been so unjust to their country caught another cold on the train arrived at newport to go to bed and to grow worse and to stay in bed until i left again the fairchilds proving during this time kindness itself mr fairchild simply one of the most engaging men in the world and one of the children blair aet ten a great joy and amusement in his solemn adoring attitude to the author of treasure island  here i was interrupted by the arrival of my sculptori withdraw calling him handsome he is not quite that his eyes are too near together he is only remarkable looking and like an italian cinquecento medallion i have begged him to make a medallion of himself and give me a copy i will not take up the sentence in which i was wandering so long but begin fresh i was ten or twelve days at newport then came back convalescent to new york fanny and lloyd are off to the adirondacks to see if that will suit and the rest of us leave monday this is saturday to follow them up i hope we may manage to stay there all winter i have a splendid appetite and have on the whole recovered well after a mighty sharp attack i am now on a salary of ¬£500 a year for twelve articles in scribners magazine on what i like it is more than ¬£500 but i cannot calculate more precisely you have no idea how much is made of me here i was offered ¬£2000 for a weekly articleeh heh how is that but i refused that lucrative job the success of underwoods is gratifying you see the verses are sane that is their strong point and it seems it is strong enough to carry them  a thousand thanks for your grand letterever yours       r l s     to w e henley      the verses herein alluded to were addressed to rossettis friend dr    gordon hake physician and poet 18091895 in return for some    received from him they are those beginning in the beloved hour that    ushers day and printed as no xix in songs of travel       new york september 1887  my dear ladherewith verses for dr hake which please communicate i did my best with the interviewers  i dont know if lloyd sent you the result my heart was too sick you can do nothing with them and yet literally sweated with anxiety to please and took me down in long hand  i have been quite ill but go better i am being not busted but medallioned by st gaudens who is a firstrate plain highminded artist and honest fellow you would like him down to the ground i believe sculptors are fine fellows when they are not demons o i am now a salaried person ¬£600 a year21 to write twelve articles in scribners magazine it remains to be seen if it really pays huge as the sum is but the slavery may overweigh me i hope you will like my answer to hake and specially that he will  love to allyours affectionately       r l s      le salari√©     to r a m stevenson     saranac lake adirondacks new york usa october 1887  my dear bobthe cold of colorado was too rigorous for me i could not risk the long railway voyage and the season was too late to risk the eastern cape hatteras side of the steamer one so here we stuck and stick we have a wooden house on a hilltop overlooking a river and a village about a quarter of a mile away and very wooded hills the whole scene is very highland bar want of heather and the wooden houses  i have got one good thing of my sea voyage it is proved the sea agrees heartily with me and my mother likes it so if i get any better or no worse my mother will likely hire a yacht for a month or so in summer good lord what fun wealth is only useful for two things a yacht and a string quartette for these two i will sell my soul except for these i hold that ¬£700 a year is as much as any body can possibly want and i have had more so i know for the extry coins were for no use excepting for illness which damns everything  i was so happy on board that ship i could not have believed it possible we had the beastliest weather and many discomforts but the mere fact of its being a trampship gave us many comforts we could cut about with the men and officers stay in the wheelhouse discuss all manner of things and really be a little at sea and truly there is nothing else i had literally forgotten what happiness was and the full mindfull of external and physical things not full of cares and labours and rot about a fellows behaviour my heart literally sang i truly care for nothing so much as for that we took so north a course that we saw newfoundland no one in the ship had ever seen it before  it was beyond belief to me how she rolled in seemingly smooth water the bell striking the fittings bounding out of our stateroom it is worth having lived these last years partly because i have written some better books which is always pleasant but chiefly to have had the joy of this voyage i have been made a lot of here and it is sometimes pleasant sometimes the reverse but i could give it all up and agree that  was the author of my works for a good seventy ton schooner and the coins to keep her on and to think there are parties with yachts who would make the exchange i know a little about fame now it is no good compared to a yacht and anyway there is more fame in a yacht more genuine fame to cross the atlantic and come to anchor in newport say with the union jack and go ashore for your letters and hang about the pier among the holiday yachtsmenthats fame thats glory and nobody can take it away they cant say your book is bad you have crossed the atlantic i should do it south by the west indies to avoid the damned banks and probably come home by steamer and leave the skipper to bring the yacht home  well if all goes well we shall maybe sail out of southampton water some of these days and take a run to havre and try the baltic or somewhere  love to you allever your afft       robert louis stevenson     to sir walter simpson     it was supposed that stevensons letters to this friend like those    to professor fleeming jenkin had been destroyed or disappeared    altogether but besides the two printed above pp 117 and 229 here    is a third preserved by a friend to whom sir walter made a present    of it       saranac lake october 1887  my dear simpson    the address is     co charles scribners sons         243 broadway ny  where i wish you would write and tell us you are better but the place of our abode is saranac lake in the adirondacks it is a mighty good place too and i mean it shall do me good indeed the dreadful depression and collapse of last summer has quite passed away it was a thorough change i wanted i wonder perhaps if it wouldnt pick you upif you are not picked up already you have been a long time in great britain and that is a slow poison very slow for the strong but certain for all old dr chepmell told lloyd any one can stay a year in england and be the better for it but no one can stay there steadily and not be the worse  i have had a very curious experience here being very much made of and called upon and all that quite the famous party in fact it is not so nice as people try to make out when you are young and dont want to bother working fame is nothing to a yacht experto crede there are nice bits of course for you meet very pleasant and interesting people but the thing at large is a bore and a fraud and i am much happier up here where i see no one and live my own life one thing is they do not stick for money to the famed one i was offered ¬£2000 a year for a weekly article and i accepted and now enjoy ¬£720 a year for a monthly one 72012 whatever that may be for each article as long or as short as i please and on any mortal subject i am sure it will do me harm to do it but the sum was irresistible see calculations on verso of last page and observe sir the accuracy of my methods  hulloh i must get up as i cant lose any

          and be done with it     to edmund gosse     the following refers to a review by mr gosse of stevensons volume    of verse called underwoods the book had been published a few weeks    previously and is dedicated as readers will remember to a number    of physicians who had attended him at sundry times and places       saranac lake oct 8th 1887  my dear gossei have just read your article twice with cheers of approving laughter i do not believe you ever wrote anything so funny tyndalls shell the passage on the davos press and its invaluable issues and that on v hugo and swinburne are exquisite so i say it more ruefully is the touch about the doctors for the rest i am very glad you like my verses so well and the qualities you ascribe to them seem to me well found and well named i own to that kind of candour you attribute to me when i am frankly interested i suppose i fancy the public will be so too and when i am moved i am sure of it it has been my luck hitherto to meet with no staggering disillusion before and after may be two and yet i believe the habit is now too thoroughly ingrained to be altered about the doctors you were right that dedication has been the subject of some pleasantries that made me grind and of your happily touched reproof which made me blush and to miscarry in a dedication is an abominable form of bookwreck i am a good captain i would rather lose the tent and save my dedication  i am at saranac lake in the adirondacks i suppose for the winter it seems a firstrate place we have a house in the eye of many winds with a view of a piece of running waterhighland all but the dear hue of peatand of many hillshighland also but for the lack of heather soon the snow will close on us we are here some twenty milestwentyseven they say but this i profoundly disbelievein the woods communication by letter is slow and let me be consistent aleatory by telegram is as near as may be possible  i had some experience of american appreciation i liked a little of it but there is too much a little of that would go a long way to spoil a man and i like myself better in the woods i am so damned candid and ingenuous for a cynic and so much of a cweatu of impulseaw if you remember that admirable leech that i begin to shirk any more taffy i think i begin to like it too well but let us trust the gods they have a rod in pickle reverently i doff my trousers and with screwed eyes await the amari aliquid of the great god busby  i thank you for the article in all ways and remain yours affectionately       r l s     to w h low        saranac lake october 1887  siri have to trouble you with the following paroles bien senties we are here at a firstrate place bakers is the name of our house but we dont address there we prefer the tender care of the postoffice as more aristocratic it is no use to telegraph even to the care of the postoffice who does not give a single damn22 bakers has a prophets chamber which the hypercritical might describe as a garret with a hole in the floor in that garret sir i have to trouble you and your wife to come and slumber not now however with manly hospitality i choke off any sudden impulse because first my wife and my mother are gone a note for the latter strongly suspected to be in the hand of your talented wife now sits silent on the mantel shelf one to niagara and tother to indianapolis because second we are not yet installed and because third i wont have you till i have a buffalo robe and leggings lest you should want to paint me as a plain man which i am not but a rank saranacker and wild man of the woodsyours       robert louis stevenson     to charles fairchild     post office saranac lake adirondacks ny october 1887  my dear fairchildi do not live in the post office that is only my address i live at bakers a house upon a hill and very jolly in every way i believe this is going to do we have a kind of a garret of a spare room where hardy visitors can sleep and our table if homely is not bad  and here appropriately enough comes in the begging part we cannot get any fruit here can you manage to send me some grapes i told you i would trouble you and i will say that i do so with pleasure which means a great deal from yours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson   psremember us to all yours my mother and my wife are away skylarking my mother to niagara my wife to indianapolis and i live here today alone with lloyd valentine some cold meat and four salmon trout one of which is being grilled at this moment of writing so that after the immortal pattern of the indian boys my household will soon only reckon three as usual with me the news comes in a ps and is mostly folly       r l s   ppsmy cold is so much better that i took another yesterday but the new one is a puny child i fear him not and yet i fear to boast if the postscript business goes on this establishment will run out of ps but i hope it wasnt you that made this paperjust for a last wordi could not compliment you upon that and lord if you could see the inknot what i am usingbut the local vintage they dont write much here i bet what you please       r l s     to william archer      the wondrous tale referred to in the following is stevensons black    arrow which had been through mr archers hands in proof       saranac lake october 1887  dear archermany thanks for the wondrous tale it is scarcely a work of genius as i believe you felt thanks also for your pencillings though i defend shrew or at least many of the shrews  we are here i suppose for the winter in the adirondacks a hill and forest country on the canadian border of new york state very unsettled and primitive and cold and healthful or we are the more bitterly deceived i believe it will do well for me but must not boast  my wife is away to indiana to see her family my mother lloyd and i remain here in the cold which has been exceeding sharp and the hill air which is inimitably fine we all eat bravely and sleep well and make great fires and get along like one oclock  i am now a salaried party i am a bourgeois now i am to write a weekly paper for scribners at a scale of payment which makes my teeth ache for shame and diffidence the editor is i believe to apply to you for we were talking over likely men and when i instanced you he said he had had his eye upon you from the first it is worth while perhaps to get in tow with the scribners they are such thorough gentlefolk in all ways that it is always a pleasure to deal with them i am like to be a millionaire if this goes on and be publicly hanged at the social revolution well i would prefer that to dying in my bed and it would be a godsend to my biographer if ever i have one what are you about i hope you are all well and in good case and spirits as i am now after a most nefast experience of despondency before i left but indeed i was quite run down remember me to mrs archer and give my respects to tomyours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      gleeson white in this letter means the collection of ballades    rondeaus c edited by that gentleman and dedicated to r l s    walter scott 1887       saranac lake october 1887  my dear ladi hear some vague reports of a success23 at montreal  my news is not much my mother is away to niagara and fanny to indiana the port admiral and i and valentine keep house together in our verandahed cottage near a wood i am writing and have got into the vein when i got to n y a paper offered me ¬£2000 a year to do critical weekly articles for them the sum was so enormous that i tottered however scribner at once offered me the same scale to give him a monthly paper in his magazine indeed it is rather higher ¬£720 for the twelve papers this i could not decently refuse and i am now a yoked man and after a fit of my usual impotence under bondage seem to have got into the swing i suppose i shall scarce manage to do much else but there is the fixed sum which shines like a sun in the firmament a prophet has certainly a devil of a lot of honour and much coins in another country whatever he has in his own  i got gleeson white your best work and either the best or second best in the book is the ballade in hot weather that is really a masterpiece of melody and fancy damn your villanellesand everybodys g macdonald comes out strong in his two pious rondels fons bandusi√¶ seems as exquisite as ever to my surprise i liked two of the pantoums the bluebottle and the still better afterdeath one from love in idleness lang cuts a poor figure except in the cricket one your patter ballade is a great tour de force but spoiled by similar c√¶suras on the whole tis a ridiculous volume and i had more pleasure out of it than i expected i forgot to praise grant allens excellent ballade which is the one that runs with yoursand here to the point a note from you at margateamong east winds and plain women damn them well what can we do or say we are only at saranac for the winter and if this deacon comes off why you may join us there in glory i would i had some news of it saranac is not quite so dear in some ways as the rest of this land where it costs you a pound to sneeze and fifty to blow your nose but even here it costs 2¬∑50 to get a box from the station think of it lift it up tenderly they had need to pay well but how poor devils live and how it can pay to take a theatre company over to such a land is more than i can fancy the devil of the states for you is the conveyances they are so dearbut o what is not  i have thrown off my cold in excellent style though still very groggy about the knees so that when i climb a paling of which we have many i feel as precarious and nutatory as a man of ninety under this i grind but i believe the place will suit me must stopever affectionately       r l s     to henry james      the dear alexander mentioned below is mr j w alexander the    wellknown american artist who had been a welcome visitor to    stevenson at bournemouth and had drawn his portrait there the    humorous romance proceeding from mr osbournes typewriter was the    first draft of the wrong box or as it was originally called the    finsbury tontine or the game of bluff the article by mr henry    james referred to in the last paragraph is one on r l s which had    appeared in the century magazine for october and was reprinted in    partial portraits       saranac lake october 1887 i know not the day but the month                                        it is the drear october by the                                        ghoulhaunted woodland of weir  my dear henry jamesthis is to say first the voyage was a huge success we all enjoyed it bar my wife to the ground sixteen days at sea with a cargo of hay matches stallions and monkeys and in a ship with no style on and plenty of sailors to talk to and the endless pleasures of the seathe romance of it the sport of the scratch dinner and the smashing crockery the pleasurean endless pleasureof balancing to the swell well its over  second i had a fine time rather a troubled one at newport and new york saw much of and liked hugely the fairchilds st gaudens the sculptor gilder of the centuryjust saw the dear alexandersaw a lot of my old and admirable friend will low whom i wish you knew and appreciatedwas medallioned by st gaudens and at last escaped to  third saranac lake where we now are and which i believe we mean to like and pass the winter at our houseemphatically bakersis on a hill and has a sight of a stream turning a corner in the valleybless the face of running waterand sees some hills too and the paganly prosaic roofs of saranac itself the lake it does not see nor do i regret that i like water fresh water i mean either running swiftly among stones or else largely qualified with whisky as i write the sun which has been long a stranger shines in at my shoulder from the next room the bell of lloyds typewriter makes an agreeable music as it patters off at a rate which astonishes this experienced novelist the early chapters of a humorous romance from still further offthe walls of bakers are neither ancient nor massiverumours of valentine about the kitchen stove come to my ears of my mother and fanny i hear nothing for the excellent reason that they have gone sparking off one to niagara one to indianapolis people complain that i never give news in my letters i have wiped out that reproach  but now fourth i have seen the article and it may be from natural partiality i think it the best you have written oi remember the gautier which was an excellent performance and the balzac which was good and the daudet over which i licked my chops but the r l s is better yet it is so humorous and it hits my little frailties with so neat and so friendly a touch and alan is the occasion for so much happy talk and the quarrel is so generously praised i read it twice though it was only some hours in my possession and low who got it for me from the century sat up to finish it ere he returned it and sir we were all delighted here is the paper out nor will anything not even friendship not even gratitude for the article induce me to begin a second sheet so here with the kindest remembrances and the warmest good wishes i remain yours affectionately       r l s     to charles baxter        saranac lake 18th november 1887  my dear charlesno likely im going to waste a sheet of paper i am offered ¬£1600 8000 for the american serial rights on my next story as you say times are changed since the lothian road well the lothian road was grand fun too i could take an afternoon of it with great delight but im awfu grand noo and long may it last  remember me to any of the faithfulif there are any left i wish i could have a crack with youyours ever affectionately       r l s   i find i have forgotten more than i remembered of business please let us know if you know for how much skerryvore is let you will here detect the female mind i let it for what i could get nor shall the possession of this knowledge which i am happy to have forgot increase the amount by so much as the shadow of a sixpenny piece but my females are agogyours ever       r l s     to charles scribner      shortly after the date of the present correspondence stevenson to    his great advantage put all his publishing arrangements as he had    already put his private business into the hands of his friend mr    baxter meantime he was managing them himself and an occasional    lapse of memory or attention betrayed him once or twice into    misunderstandings and once at least conflicting agreements with two    different publishers both his friends he was the first to denounce    the error when he became aware of it and suffered sharply from the    sense of his own unintentional fault the next two letters and some    allusions in those which follow relate to this affair       saranac lake november 20 or 21 1887  my dear mr scribnerheaven help me i am under a curse just now i have played fast and loose with what i said to you and that i beg you to believe in the purest innocence of mind i told you you should have the power over all my work in this country and about a fortnight ago when mclure was here i calmly signed a bargain for the serial publication of a story you will scarce believe that i did this in mere oblivion but i did and all that i can say is that i will do so no more and ask you to forgive me please write to me soon as to this  will you oblige me by paying in for three articles as already sent to my account with john paton  co 52 william street this will be most convenient for us  the fourth article is nearly done and i am the more deceived or it is a buster  now as to the first thing in this letter i do wish to hear from you soon and i am prepared to hear any reproach or what is harder to hear any forgiveness for i have deserved the worstyours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to e l burlingame      this is the first of many letters increasing in friendliness as the    correspondence goes on to the editor of scribners magazine       saranac lake november 1887  dear mr burlingamei enclose corrected proof of beggars which seems good i mean to make a second sermon which if it is about the same length as pulvis et umbra might go in along with it as two sermons in which case i should call the first the whole creation and the second any good we shall see but you might say how you like the notion  one word if you have heard from mr scribner of my unhappy oversight in the matter of a story you will make me ashamed to write to you and yet i wish to beg you to help me into quieter waters the oversight committedand i do think it was not so bad as mr scribner seems to think itand discovered i was in a miserable position i need not tell you that my first impulse was to offer to share or to surrender the price agreed upon when it should fall due and it is almost to my credit that i arranged to refrain it is one of these positions from which there is no escape i cannot undo what i have done and i wish to beg youshould mr scribner speak to you in the matterto try to get him to see this neglect of mine for no worse than it is unpardonable enough because a breach of an agreement but still pardonable because a piece of sheer carelessness and want of memory done god knows without design and since most sincerely regretted i have no memory you have seen how i omitted to reserve the american rights in jekyll last winter i wrote and demanded as an increase a less sum than had already been agreed upon for a story that i gave to cassells for once that my forgetfulness has by a cursed fortune seemed to gain instead of lose me money it is painful indeed that i should produce so poor an impression on the mind of mr scribner but i beg you to believe and if possible to make him believe that i am in no degree or sense a faiseur and that in matters of business my design at least is honest nor bating bad memory and selfdeception am i untruthful in such affairs  if mr scribner shall have said nothing to you in the matter please regard the above as unwritten and believe me yours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to e l burlingame        saranac lake november 1887  dear mr burlingamethe revise seemed all right so i did not trouble you with it indeed my demand for one was theatrical to impress that obdurate dog your reader herewith a third paper it has been a cruel long time upon the road but here it is and not bad at last i fondly hope i was glad you liked the lantern bearers i did too i thought it was a good paper really contained some excellent sense and was ingeniously put together i have not often had more trouble than i have with these papers thirty or forty pages of foul copy twenty is the very least i have had well you pay high it is fit that i should have to work hard it somewhat quiets my conscienceyours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to john addington symonds     saranac lake adirondack mountains      new york usa november 21 1887  my dear symondsi think we have both meant and wanted to write to you any time these months but we have been much tossed about among new faces and old and new scenes and old and scenes like this of saranac which are neither one nor other to give you some clue to our affairs i had best begin pretty well back we sailed from the thames in a vast bucket of iron that took seventeen days from shore to shore i cannot describe how i enjoyed the voyage nor what good it did me but on the banks i caught friend catarrh in new york and then in newport i was pretty ill but on my return to new york lying in bed most of the time with st gaudens the sculptor sculping me and my old friend low around i began to pick up once more now here we are in a kind of wilderness of hills and firwoods and boulders and snow and wooden houses so far as we have gone the climate is grey and harsh but hungry and somnolent and although not charming like that of davos essentially bracing and briskening the country is a kind of insane mixture of scotland and a touch of switzerland and a dash of america and a thought of the british channel in the skies we have a decent house   december 6tha decent house as i was saying sir on a hilltop with a look down a scottish river in front and on one hand a perthshire hill on the other the beginnings and skirts of the village play hide and seek among other hills we have been below zero i know not how far 10 at 8 am once and when it is cold it is delightful but hitherto the cold has not held and we have chopped in and out from frost to thaw from snow to rain from quiet air to the most disastrous northwesterly curdlers of the blood after a week of practical thaw the ice still bears in favoured places so there is hope  i wonder if you saw my book of verses it went into a second edition because of my name i suppose and its prose merits i do not set up to be a poet only an allround literary man a man who talks not one who sings but i believe the very fact that it was only speech served the book with the public horace is much a speaker and see how popular most of martial is only speech and i cannot conceive a person who does not love his martial most of burns also such as the louse the toothache the haggis and lots more of his best excuse this little apology for my house but i dont like to come before people who have a note of song and let it be supposed i do not know the difference  to return to the more importantnews my wife again suffers in high and cold places i again profit she is off today to new york for a change as heretofore to berne but i am glad to say in better case than then still it is undeniable she suffers and you must excuse her at least if we both prove bad correspondents i am decidedly better but i have been terribly cut up with business complications one disagreeable as threatening loss one of the most intolerable complexion as involving me in dishonour the burthen of consistent carelessness i have lost much by it in the past and for once to my damnation i have gained i am sure you will sympathise it is hard work to sleep it is hard to be told you are a liar and have to hold your peace and think yes by god and a thief too you remember my lectures on ajax or the unintentional sin well i know all about that now nothing seems so unjust to the sufferer or is more just in essence laissez passer la justice de dieu  lloyd has learned to use the typewriter and has most gallantly completed upon that the draft of a tale which seems to me not without merit and promise it is so silly so gay so absurd in spots to my partial eyes so genuinely humorous it is true he would not have written it but for the new arabian nights but it is strange to find a young writer funny heavens but i was depressing when i took the pen in hand and now i doubt if i am sadder than my neighbours will this beginner move in the inverse direction  let me have your news and believe me my dear symonds with genuine affection yours       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      the following refers to a volume on the elder dumas which mr henley    was at this time preparing to write and which he proposed to    dedicate to his friend       saranac december 1887  my dear ladi was indeed overjoyed to hear of the dumas in the matter of the dedication are not cross dedications a little awkward lang and rider haggard did it to be sure perpend and if you should conclude against a dedication there is a passage in memories and portraits written at you when i was most desperate to stir you up a bit which might be quoted something about dumas still waiting his biographer i have a decent time when the weather is fine when it is grey or windy or wet as it too often is i am merely degraded to the dirt i get some work done every day with a devil of a heave not extra good ever and i regret my engagement whiles i have had the most deplorable business annoyances too have been threatened with having to refund money got over that and found myself in the worst scrape of being a kind of unintentional swindler these have worried me a great deal also old age with his stealing steps seems to have clawed me in his clutch to some tune  do you play all fours we are trying it it is still all haze to me can the elder hand beg more than once the port admiral is at boston mingling with millionaires i am but a weed on lethe wharf the wife is only soso the lord lead us all if i can only get off the stage with clean hands i shall sing hosanna put is described quite differently from your version in a book i have what are your rules the port admiral is using a game of put in a tale of his the first copy of which was gloriously finished about a fortnight ago and the revise gallantly begun the finsbury tontine it is named and might fill two volumes and is quite incredibly silly and in parts it seems to me pretty humorouslove to all from       an old old man   i say taines origines de la france contemporaine is no end it would turn the dead body of charles fox into a living tory     to mrs fleeming jenkin        saranac lake december 1887  my dear mrs jenkinthe opal is very well it is fed with glycerine when it seems hungry i am very well and get about much more than i could have hoped my wife is not very well there is no doubt the high level does not agree with her and she is on the move for a holiday to new york lloyd is at boston on a visit and i hope has a good time my mother is really firstrate she and i despairing of other games for two now play all fours out of a gamebook and have not yet discovered its niceties if any  you will have heard i dare say that they made a great row over me here they also offered me much money a great deal more than my works are worth i took some of it and was greedy and hasty and am now very sorry i have done with big prices from now out wealth and selfrespect seem in my case to be strangers  we were talking the other day of how well fleeming managed to grow rich ah that is a rare art something more intellectual than a virtue the book has not yet made its appearance here the life alone with a little preface is to appear in the states and the scribners are to send you half the royalties i should like it to do well for fleemings sake  will you please send me the greek watercarriers song i have a particular use for it  have i any more news i wonderand echo wonders along with me i am strangely disquieted on all political matters and i do not know if it is the signs of the times or the sign of my own time of life but to me the sky seems black both in france and england and only partly clear in america i have not seen it so dark in my time of that i am sure  please let us have some news and excuse me for the sake of my wellknown idleness and pardon fanny who is really not very well for this long silencevery sincerely your friend       robert louis stevenson     to miss adelaide boodle      the lady at bournemouth the giver of the paperknife to whom the    following letter is addressed had been trusted to keep an eye on    stevensons interests in connection with his house which had been    let and other matters and to report thereon from time to time in    their correspondence stevenson is generally referred to as the squire    and the lady as the gamekeeper       saranac lake december 1887  my dear miss boodlei am so much afraid our gamekeeper may weary of unacknowledged reports hence in the midst of a perfect horror of detestable weathers of a quite incongruous strain and with less desire for correspondence thanwell thanwell with no desire for correspondence behold me dash into the breach do keep up your letters they are most delightful to this exiled backwoods family and in your next we shall hope somehow or other to hear better news of you and yoursthat in the first placeand to hear more news of our beasts and birds and kindly fruits of earth and those human tenants who are truly too much with us  i am very well better than for years that is for good but then my wife is no great shakes the place does not suit herit is my private opinion that no place doesand she is now away down to new york for a change which as lloyd is in boston leaves my mother and me and valentine alone in our windbeleaguered hilltop hatbox of a house you should hear the cows butt against the walls in the early morning while they feed you should also see our back log when the thermometer goes as it does go awayaway below zero till it can be seen no more by the eye of mannot the thermometer which is still perfectly visible but the mercury which curls up into the bulb like a hibernating bear you should also see the lad who does chores for us with his red stockings and his thirteenyearold face and his highly manly tramp into the room and his two alternative answers to all questions about the weather either cold or with a really lyrical movement of the voice lovelyraining  will you take this miserable scrap for what it is worth will you also understand that i am the man to blame and my wife is really almost too much out of health to write or at least doesnt writeand believe me with kind remembrances to mrs boodle and your sisters very sincerely yours       robert

was at this time being performed at    chicago with mr e j henley in the titlepart       saranac lake new york december 19 1887  dear miss monroemany thanks for your letter and your good wishes it was much my desire to get to chicago had i doneor if i yet doso i shall hope to see the original of my photograph which is one of my show possessions but the fates are rather contrary my wife is far from well i myself dread worse than almost any other imaginable peril that miraculous and really insane invention the american railroad car heaven help the manmay i add the womanthat sets foot in one ah if it were only an ocean to cross it would be a matter of small thought to meand great pleasure but the railroad carevery man has his weak point and i fear the railroad car as abjectly as i do an earwig and on the whole on better grounds you do not know how bitter it is to have to make such a confession for you have not the pretension nor the weakness of a man if i do get to chicago you will hear of me so much can be said and do you never come east  i was pleased to recognise a word of my poor old deacon in your letter it would interest me very much to hear how it went and what you thought of piece and actors and my collaborator who knows and respects the photograph would be pleased toostill in the hope of seeing you i am yours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to henry james        saranac lake winter 188788  my dear henry jamesit may please you to know how our family has been employed in the silence of the snow the afternoon lamp has lighted an eager fireside group my mother reading fanny lloyd and i devoted listeners and the work was really one of the best works i ever heard and its author is to be praised and honoured and what do you suppose is the name of it and have you ever read it yourself and i am bound i will get to the bottom of the page before i blow the gaff if i have to fight it out on this line all summer for if you have not to turn a leaf there can be no suspense the conspectory eye being swift to pick out proper names and without suspense there can be little pleasure in this world to my mind at leastand in short the name of it is roderick hudson if you please my dear james it is very spirited and very sound and very noble too hudson mrs hudson rowland o all firstrate rowland a very fine fellow hudson as good as he can stick did you know hudson i suspect you did mrs h his real born mother a thing rarely managed in fiction  we are all keeping pretty fit and pretty hearty but this letter is not from me to you it is from a reader of r h to the author of the same and it says nothing and has nothing to say but thank you  we are going to reread casamassima as a proper pendant sir i think these two are your best and care not who knows it  may i beg you the next time roderick is printed off to go over the sheets of the last few chapters and strike out immense and tremendous you have simply dropped them there like your pockethandkerchief all you have to do is to pick them up and pouch them and your roomwhat do i sayyour cathedralwill be swept and garnishedi am dear sir your delighted reader       robert louis stevenson   psperhaps it is a pang of causeless honesty perhaps i hope it will set a value on my praise of roderick perhaps its a burst of the diabolic but i must break out with the news that i cant bear the portrait of a lady i read it all and i wept too but i cant stand your having written it and i beg you will write no more of the like infra sir below you i cant help itit may be your favourite work but in my eyes its below you to write and me to read i thought roderick was going to be another such at the beginning and i cannot describe my pleasure as i found it taking bones and blood and looking out at me with a moved and human countenance whose lineaments are written in my memory until my last of days       r l s   my wife begs your forgiveness i believe for her silence     to sidney colvin        saranac lake december 1887  my dear colvinthis goes to say that we are all fit and the place is very bleak and wintry and up to now has shown no such charms of climate as davos but is a place where men eat and where the cattarh catarrh cattarrh or cattarrhh appears to be unknown i walk in my verandy in the snaw sir looking down over one of those dabbled wintry landscapes that are to be frank so chilly to the human bosom and up at a grey englishnay mehercle scottishheaven and i think it pretty bleak and the wind swoops at me round the corner like a lion and fluffs the snow in my face and i could aspire to be elsewhere but yet i do not catch cold and yet when i come in i eat so that hitherto saranac if not deliriously delectable has not been a failure nay from the mere point of view of the wicked body it has proved a success but i wish i could still get to the woods alas nous nirons plus au bois is my poor song the paths are buried the dingles drifted full a little walk is grown a long one till spring comes i fear the burthen will hold good  i get along with my papers for scribner not fast nor so far specially well only this last the fourth one which makes a third part of my whole task i do believe is pulled off after a fashion it is a mere sermon smith opens out24 but it is true and i find it touching and beneficial to me at least and i think there is some fine writing in it some very apt and pregnant phrases pulvis et umbra i call it i might have called it a darwinian sermon if i had wanted its sentiments although parsonic will not offend even you i believe the other three papers i fear bear many traces of effort and the ungenuine inspiration of an income at so much per essay and the honest desire of the incomer to give good measure for his money well i did my damndest anyway  we have been reading h jamess roderick hudson which i eagerly press you to get at once it is a book of a high orderthe last volume in particular i wish meredith would read it it took my breath away  i am at the seventh book of the √Üneid and quite amazed at its merits also very often floored by its difficulties the circe passage at the beginning and the sublime business of amata with the simile of the boys topo lord what a happy thoughthave specially delighted mei am dear sir your respected friend       john gregg gillson jp mria etc     to sidney colvin      the following narrates the beginning of the authors labours on the    master of ballantrae an unfinished paper written some years later    in samoa and intended for scribners magazine tells how the story    first took shape in his mind see edinburgh edition miscellanies    vol iv p 297 reprinted in essays on the art of writing       saranac lake december 24 1887  my dear colvinthank you for your explanations i have done no more virgil since i finished the seventh book for i have first been eaten up with taine and next have fallen head over heels into a new tale the master of ballantrae no thought have i now apart from it and i have got along up to page ninetytwo of the draft with great interest it is to me a most seizing tale there are some fantastic elements the most is a dead genuine human problemhuman tragedy i should say rather it will be about as long i imagine as kidnapped  dramatis personae    1 my old lord durrisdeer    2 the master of ballantrae and    3 henry durie his sons    4 clementina25 engaged to the first married to the second    5 ephraim mackellar land steward at durrisdeer and narrator of the         most of the book    6 francis burke chevalier de st louis one of prince charlies         irishmen and narrator of the rest  besides these many instant figures most of them dumb or nearly so jessie brown the whore captain crail captain maccombie our old friend alan breck our old friend riach both only for an instant teach the pirate vulgarly blackbeard john paul and macconochie servants at durrisdeer the date is from 1745 to 65 about the scene near kirkcudbright in the states and for a little moment in the french east indies i have done most of the big work the quarrel duel between the brothers and announcement of the death to clementina and my lordclementina henry and mackellar nicknamed squaretoes are really very fine fellows the master is all i know of the devil i have known hints of him in the world but always cowards he is as bold as a lion but with the same deadly causeless duplicity i have watched with so much surprise in my two cowards tis true i saw a hint of the same nature in another man who was not a coward but he had other things to attend to the master has nothing else but his devilry here come my visitorsand have now gone or the first relay of them and i hope no more may come for mark you sir this is our daysaturday as ever was and here we sit my mother and i before a large wood fire and await the enemy with the most steadfast courage and without snow and greyness and the woman fanny in new york for her health which is far from good and the lad lloyd at the inn in the village because he has a cold and the handmaid valentine abroad in a sleigh upon her messages and tomorrow christmas and no mistake such is human life la carri√®re humaine i will enclose if i remember the required autograph  i will do better put it on the back of this page love to all and mostly my very dear colvin to yourself for whatever i say or do or dont say or do you may be very sure i amyours always affectionately       r l s     to miss adelaide boodle        saranac lake christmas 1887  my dear miss boodleand a very good christmas to you all and better fortune and if worse the more courage to support itwhich i think is the kinder wish in all human affairs somewhilei fear a good whileafter this you should receive our christmas gift we have no tact and no taste only a welcome and often tonic brutality and i dare say the present even after my friend baxter has acted on and reviewed my hints may prove a white elephant that is why i dread presents and therefore pray understand if any element of that hamper prove unwelcome it is to be exchanged i will not sit down under the name of a giver of white elephants i never had any elephant but one and his initials were r l s and he trod on my foot at a very early age but this is a fable and not in the least to the point which is that if for once in my life i have wished to make things nicer for anybody but the elephant see fable do not suffer me to have made them ineffably more embarrassing and exchangeruthlessly exchange  for my part i am the most cockered up of any mortal being and one of the healthiest or thereabout at some modest distance from the bulls eye i am condemned to write twelve articles in scribners magazine for the love of gain i think i had better send you them what is far more to the purpose i am on the jump with a new story which has bewitched mei doubt it may bewitch no one else it is called the master of ballantraepronounce ballantray if it is not good well mine will be the fault for i believe it is a good tale  the greetings of the season to you and your mother and your sisters my wife heartily joinsand i am yours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson   psyou will think me an illiterate dog i am for the first time reading robertsons sermons i do not know how to express how much i think of them if by any chance you should be as illiterate as i and not know them it is worth while curing the defect       r l s     to charles baxter      the following letter invites mr baxter to allow himself under an    alias and his office in edinburgh to figure in a preface to the    new story such a preface was drafted accordingly but on second    thoughts suppressed to be on renewed consideration reinstated in    the final editions       saranac lake january 88  dear charlesyou are the flower of doers will my doer collaborate thus much in my new novel in the year 1794 or 5 mr ephraim mackellar am late steward on the durrisdeer estates completed a set of memoranda as long as a novel with regard to the death of the then late lord durrisdeer and as to that of his attainted elder brother called by the family courtesy title the master of ballantrae these he placed in the hand of john macbrair ws the family agent on the understanding they were to be sealed until 1862 when a century would have elapsed since the affair in the wilderness my lords death you succeeded mr macbrairs firm the durrisdeers are extinct and last year in an old green box you found these papers with macbrairs indorsation it is that indorsation of which i want a copy you may remember when you gave me the papers i neglected to take that and i am sure you are a man too careful of antiquities to have let it fall aside i shall have a little introduction descriptive of my visit to edinburgh arrival there denner with yoursel and first reading of the papers in your smokingroom all of which of course you well rememberever yours affectionately       r l s   your name is my friend mr johnstone thomson ws     to e l burlingame        saranac lake winter 188788  dear mr burlingamei am keeping the sermon to see if i cant add another meanwhile i will send you very soon a different paper which may take its place possibly some of these days soon i may get together a talk on things current which should go in if possible earlier than either i am now less nervous about these papers i believe i can do the trick without great strain though the terror that breathed on my back in the beginning is not yet forgotten  the master of ballantrae i have had to leave aside as i was quite worked out but in about a week i hope to try back and send you the first four numbers these are all drafted it is only the revision that has broken me down as it is often the hardest work these four i propose you should set up for me at once and well copyright em in a pamphlet i will tell you the names of the bona fide purchasers in england  the numbers will run from twenty to thirty pages of my manuscript you can give me that much can you not it is a howling good taleat least these first four numbers are the end is a trifle more fantastic but tis all picturesque  dont trouble about any more french books i am on another scent you see just now only the french in hindustan i await with impatience as that is for ballantrae the scene of that romance is scotlandthe statesscotlandindiascotlandand the states again so it jumps like a flea i have enough about the states now and very much obliged i am yet if drakes tragedies of the wilderness is as i gather a collection of originals i should like to purchase it if it is a picturesque vulgarisation i do not wish to look it in the face purchase i say for i think it would be well to have some such collection by me with a view to fresh worksyours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson   psif you think of having the master illustrated i suggest that hole would be very well up to the scottish which is the larger part if you have it done here tell your artist to look at the hall of craigievar in billings baronial and ecclesiastical antiquities and he will get a broad hint for the hall at durrisdeer it is i think the chimney of craigievar and the roof of pinkie and perhaps a little more of pinkie altogether but i should have to see the book myself to be sure hole would be invaluable for this i dare say if you had it illustrated you could let me have one or two for the english edition       r l s     to william archer      the following refers to mr bernard shaws novel cashel byrons    profession which had been sent stevenson to read by their common    friend mr archer       saranac lake winter 188788  my dear archerwhat am i to say i have read your friends book with singular relish if he has written any other i beg you will let me see it and if he has not i beg him to lose no time in supplying the deficiency it is full of promise but i should like to know his age there are things in it that are very clever to which i attach small importance it is the shape of the age and there are passages particularly the rally in presence of the zulu king that show genuine and remarkable narrative talenta talent that few will have the wit to understand a talent of strength spirit capacity sufficient vision and sufficient selfsacrifice which last is the chief point in a narrator  as a whole it is of course a fever dream of the most feverish over bashville the footman i howled with derision and delight i dote on bashvillei could read of him for ever de bashville je suis le ferventthere is only one bashville and i am his devoted slave bashville est magnifique mais il nest gu√®re possible he is the note of the book it is all mad mad and deliriously delightful the author has a taste in chivalry like walter scotts or dumas and then he daubs in little bits of socialism he soars away on the wings of the romantic griffoneven the griffon as he cleaves air shouting with laughter at the nature of the questand i believe in his heart he thinks he is labouring in a quarry of solid granite realism  it is this that makes methe most hardened adviser now extantstand back and hold my peace if mr shaw is below fiveandtwenty let him go his path if he is thirty he had best be told that he is a romantic and pursue romance with his eyes openor perhaps he knows itgod knowsmy brain is softened  it is horrid fun all i ask is more of it thank you for the pleasure you gave us and tell me more of the inimitable author  i say archer my god what womenyours very truly       robert louis stevenson   1 part charles reade 1 part henry james or some kindred author badly assimilated 12 part disraeli perhaps unconscious 112 parts struggling overlaid original talent 1 part blooming gaseous folly that is the equation as it stands what it may be i dont know nor any other man vixere forteso let him remember thatlet him beware of his damned century his gifts of insane chivalry and animated narration are just those that might be slain and thrown out like an untimely birth by the daemon of the epoch and if he only knew how i have adored the chivalry bashvilleo bashville jen chortle which is fairly polyglot       r l s     to william archer        saranac lake february 1888  my dear archerpretty sick in bed but necessary to protest and continue your education  why was jenkin an amateur in my eyes you think because not amusing i think he often was amusing the reason is this i never or almost never saw two pages of his work that i could not have put in one without the smallest loss of material that is the only test i know of writing if there is anywhere a thing said in two sentences that could have been as clearly and as engagingly and as forcibly said in one then its amateur work then you will bring me up with old dumas nay the object of a story is to be long to fill up hours the storytellers art of writing is to water out by continual invention historical and technical and yet not seem to water seem on the other hand to practise that same wit of conspicuous and declaratory condensation which is the proper art of writing that is one thing in which my stories fail i am always cutting the flesh off their bones  i would rise from the dead to preach  hope all well i think my wife better but shes not allowed to write and this only wrung from me by desire to boss and parsonise and dominate strong in sickness is my first letter for days and will likely be my last for many more not blame my wife for her silence doctors orders all much interested by your last and fragment from brother and anecdotes of tomarcherthe sick but still moral       r l s   tell shaw to hurry up i want another     to william archer      in early days in paris stevensons chivalrous feelings had once been    shocked by the scene in the demimonde of dumas fils where suzanne    dange is trapped by olivier de jalin his correspondent had asked    what exactly took place       saranac lake february 1888   my dear archerit happened thus i came forth from that performance in a breathing heat of indignation mind at this distance of time and with my increased knowledge i admit there is a problem in the piece but i saw none then except a problem in brutality and i still consider the problem in that case not established on my way down the fran√ßais stairs i trod on an old gentlemans toes whereupon with that suavity that so well becomes me i turned about to apologise and on the instant repenting me of that intention stopped the apology midway and added something in french to this effect no you are one of the l√¢ches who have been applauding that piece i retract my apology said the old frenchman laying his hand on my arm and with a smile that was truly heavenly in temperance irony goodnature and knowledge of the world ah monsieur vous √™tes bien jeuneyours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to e l burlingame        saranac lake february 1888  dear mr burlingamewill you send me from the library some of the works of my dear old g p r james with the following especially i

you to make an offer you may remember i thought the offer you made when i was still in england too small by which i did not at all mean i thought it less than it was worth but too little to tempt me to undergo the disagreeables of serial publication this tale if you want it you are to have for it is the least i can do for you and you are to observe that the sum you pay me for my articles going far to meet my wants i am quite open to be satisfied with less than formerly i tell you i do dislike this battle of the dollars i feel sure you all pay too much here in america and i beg you not to spoil me any more for i am getting spoiled i do not want wealth and i feel these big sums demoralise me  my wife came here pretty ill she had a dreadful bad night today she is better but now valentine

really breaks my spirit i do not like to fail and with glass i cannot reach the work of my high callingthe artists  i am as you may gather from this wonderfully better this harsh grey glum doleful climate has done me good you cannot fancy how sad a climate it is when the thermometer stays all day below 10¬∞ it is really cold and when the wind blows o commend me to the result pleasure in life is all delete there is no red spot left fires do not radiate you burn your hands all the time on what seem to be cold stones it is odd zero is like summer heat to us now and we like when the thermometer outside is really low a room at about 48¬∞ 60¬∞ we find oppressive yet the natives keep their holes at 90¬∞ or even 100¬∞  this was interrupted days ago by household labours since then i have had and i tremble to write it but it does seem as if i had beaten off an influenza the cold is exquisite valentine still in bed the proofs of the first part of the master of ballantrae begin to come in soon you shall have it in the pamphlet form and i hope you will like it the second part will not be near so good but therewe can but do as itll do with us i have every reason to believe this winter has done me real good so far as it has gone and if i carry out my scheme for next winter and succeeding years i should end by being a tower of strength i want you to save a good holiday for next winter i hope we shall be able to help you to some larks is there any greek isle you would like to explore or any creek in asia minoryours ever affectionately       r l s     to the rev dr charteris     the rev dr charteris of edinburgh had been one of the most    intimate and trusted friends of stevensons father and r l s    turns to him accordingly for memories and impressions       saranac lake winter 188788  my dear dr charterisi have asked douglas and foulis to send you my last volume so that you may possess my little paper on my father in a permanent shape not for what that is worth but as a tribute of respect to one whom my father regarded with such love esteem and affection besides as you will see i have brought you under contribution and i have still to thank you for your letter to my mother so more than kind in much so just it is my hope when time and health permit to do something more definite for my fathers memory you are one of the very few who can if you will help me pray believe that i lay on you no obligation i know too well you may believe me how difficult it is to put even two sincere lines upon paper where all too is to order but if the spirit should ever move you and you should recall something memorable of your friend his son will heartily thank you for a note of itwith much respect believe me yours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to edmund gosse      saranac lake march 31 1888  my dear gossewhy so plaintive either the postoffice has played us false or you were in my debt in case it should be my letter that has failed to come to post i must tell again the fate of mrs gosses thermometer it hangs in our sittingroom where it has often marked freezing point and below see what gosse says is a common word of command but the point is this in the verandah hangs another thermometer condemned to register minus 40¬∞ and that class of temperatures and to him we have given the name of the quarterly reviewer i hope the jape likes you  please tell the fortnightly man that i am sorry but i can do nothing of that sort this year as i am under a pledge to scribners and indeed my monthly articles take the best of my time it was a project i went into with horrid diffidence and lucre was my only motive i get on better than i expected but it is difficult to find an article of the sort required for each date and to vary the matter and keep up if possible the merit i do not know if you think i have at all succeeded it seemed to me this really worked paper was more moneys worth as well as probably better within my means than the lang business at the sign of the ship indeed i feel convinced i could never have managed that it takes a gift to do it here is lunchyours afftly       r l s     to henry james        saranac lake march 1888  my dear delightful jamesto quote your heading to my wife i think no man writes so elegant a letter i am sure none so kind unless it be colvin and there is more of the stern parent about him i was vexed at your account of my admired meredith i wish i could go and see him as it is i will try to write and yet do you understand me there is something in that potent genialisch affectation that puts one on the strain even to address him in a letter he is not an easy man to be yourself with there is so much of him and veracity and the high athletic intellectual humbug are so intermixed26 i read with indescribable admiration your emerson i begin to long for the day when these portraits of yours shall be collected do put me in but emerson is a higher flight have you a tourgueneff you have told me many interesting things of him and i seem to see them written and forming a graceful and bildend sketch i wonder whence comes this flood of germani havent opened a german book since i teethed my novel is a tragedy four parts out of six or seven are written and gone to burlingame five parts of it are sound human tragedy the last one or two i regret to say not so soundly designed i almost hesitate to write them they are very picturesque but they are fantastic they shame perhaps degrade the beginning i wish i knew that was how the tale came to me however i got the situation it was an old taste of mine the older brother goes out in the 45 the younger stays the younger of course gets title and estate and marries the bride designate of the eldera family match but he the younger had always loved her and she had really loved the elder do you see the situation then the devil and saranac suggested this d√©nouement and i joined the two ends in a day or two of constant feverish thought and began to write and nowi wonder if i have not gone too far with the fantastic the elder brother is an incubus supposed to be killed at culloden he turns up again and bleeds the family of money on that stopping he comes and lives with them whence flows the real tragedy the nocturnal duel of the brothers very naturally and indeed i think inevitably arising and second supposed death of the elder husband and wife now really make up and then the cloven hoof appears for the third supposed death and the manner of the third reappearance is steep steep sir it is even very steep and i fear it shames the honest stuff so far but then it is highly pictorial and it leads up to the death of the elder brother at the hands of the younger in a perfectly coldblooded murder of which i wish and mean the reader to approve you see how daring is the design there are really but six characters and one of these episodic and yet it covers eighteen years and will be i imagine the longest of my worksyours

notes and many other things are reserved for a book memorials of a scottish family if ever i can find time and opportunity i wish i could throw off all else and sit down to it today yes my father was a distinctly religious man but not a pious the distinction painfully and pleasurably recalls old conflicts it used to be my great gunand you who suffered for the whole church know how needful it was to have some reserve artillery his sentiments were tragic he was a tragic thinker now granted that life is tragic to the marrow it seems the proper function of religion to make us accept and serve in that tragedy as officers in that other and comparable one of war service is the word active service in the military sense and the religious mani beg pardon the pious manis he who has a military joy in

kirk at penicuikfor o man i cannae read your namethat i have been so long in answering your delightful letter sits on my conscience badly the fact is i let my correspondence accumulate until i am going to leave a place and then i pitch in overhaul the pile and my cries of penitence might be heard a mile about yesterday i despatched thirtyfive belated letters conceive the state of my conscience above all as the sins of omission see boyhoods guide the shorter catechism are in my view the only serious ones i call it my view but it cannot have escaped you that it was also christs however all that is not to the purpose which is to thank you for the sincere pleasure afforded by your charming letter i get a good few such how few that please me at all you would be surprised to learnor have a singularly just idea of the dulness of our race how few that please me as yours did i can tell you in one wordnone i am no great kirkgoer for many reasonsand the sermons one of them and the first prayer another but the chief and effectual reason is the stuffiness i am no great kirkgoer says i but when i read yon letter of yours i thought i would like to sit under ye and then i saw ye were to send me a bit buik and says i ill wait for the bit buik and then ill mebbe can read the mans name and anyway ill can kill twa birds wi ae stane and man the buik was neer heard tell o  that fact is an adminicle of excuse for my delay  and now dear minister of the illegible name thanks to you and greeting to your wife and may you have good guidance in your difficult labours and a blessing on your

ferrier        saranac lake april 1888  my dearest coggiei wish i could find the letter i began to you some time ago when i was ill but i cant and i dont believe there was much in it anyway we have all behaved like pigs and beasts and barndoor poultry to you but i have been sunk in work and the lad is lazy and blind and has been working too and as for fanny she has been and still is really unwell i had a mean hope you might perhaps write again before i got up steam i could not have been more ashamed of myself than i am and i should have had another laugh  they always say i cannot give news in my letters i shall shake off that reproach on monday if she is well enough fanny leaves for california to see her friends it is rather an anxiety to let her go alone but the doctor simply forbids it in my case and she is better anywhere than herea bleak blackguard beggarly climate of which i can say no good except that it suits me and some others of the same or similar persuasions whom by all rights it ought to kill it is a form of arctic st andrews i should imagine and the miseries of forty degrees below zero with a high wind have to be felt to be appreciated the greyness of the heavens here is a circumstance eminently revolting to the soul i have near forgot the aspect of the suni doubt if this be news it is certainly no news to us my mother suffers a little from the inclemency of the place but less on the whole than would be imagined among other wild schemes we have been projecting yacht voyages and i beg to inform you that cogia hassan was cast for the part of passenger they may come offagain this is not news the lad well the lad wrote a tale this winter which appeared to me so funny that i have taken it in hand and some of these days you will receive a copy of a work entitled a game of bluff by lloyd osbourne and robert louis stevenson  otherwise he the lad is much as usual there remains i believe to be considered only r l s the housebond prop pillar breadwinner and bully of the establishment well i do not think him much better he is making piles of money the hope of being able to hire a yacht ere long dances before his eyes otherwise he is not in very high spirits at this particular moment though compared with last year at bournemouth an angel of joy  and now is this news cogia or is it not it all depends upon the point of view and i call it news the devil of it is that i can think of nothing else except to send you all our loves and to wish exceedingly you were here to cheer us all up but well see about that on board the yachtyour affectionate friend       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      the mutiny novel here foreshadowed never got written       saranac lake april 9th 1888  my dear colvini have been long without writing to you but am not to blame i had some little annoyances quite for a private eye but they ran me so hard that i could not write without lugging them in which for several reasons i did not choose to do fanny is off to san francisco and next week i myself flit to new york address scribners where we shall go i know not nor i was going to say care so bald and bad is my frame of mind do you know ourahemfellow clubman colonel majendie i had such an interesting letter from him did you see my sermon it has evoked the worst feeling i fear people dont care for the truth or else i dont tell it suffer me to wander without purpose i have sent off twenty letters today and begun and stuck at a twentyfirst and taken a copy of one which was on business and corrected several galleys of proof and sorted about a bushel of old letters so if any one has a right to be romantically stupid it is iand i am really deeply stupid and at that stage when in old days i used to pour out words without any meaning whatever and with my mind taking no part in the performance i suspect that is now the case i am reading with extraordinary pleasure the life of lord lawrence lloyd and i have a mutiny novel  next morning after twelve other lettersmutiny novel on handa tremendous workso we are all at indian books the idea of the novel is lloyds i call it a novel tis a tragic romance of the most tragic sort i believe the end will be almost too much for human endurancewhen the hero is thrown to the ground with one of his own sepoy soldiers knees upon his chest and the cries begin in the beebeeghar o truly you know it is a howler the whole last part iswell the difficulty is that short of resuscitating shakespeare i dont know who is to write it  i still keep wonderful i am a great

it with great feeling and conviction to me it seemed bracing and healthful it is in such a world so seen by me that i am very glad to fight out my battle and see some fine sunsets and hear some excellent jests between whiles round the camp fire but i find that to some people this vision of mine is a nightmare and extinguishes all ground of faith in god or pleasure in man truth i think not so much of for i do not know it and i could wish in my heart that i had not published this paper if it troubles folk too much all have not the same digestion nor the same sight of things and it came over me with special pain that perhaps this article which i was at the pains to send to her might give dismalness to my gamekeeper at home well i cannot take back what i have said but yet i may add this if my view be everything but the nonsense that it may beto me it seems selfevident and blinding truthsurely of all things it makes this world holier there is nothing in it but the moral sidebut the great battle and the breathing times with their refreshments i see no more and no less and if you look again it is not ugly and it is filled with promise  pray excuse a desponding author for this apology my wife is away off to the uttermost parts of the states all by herself i shall be off i hope in a week but where ah that i know not i keep wonderful and my wife a little better and the lad flourishing we now perform duets on two d tin whistles it is no joke to make the bass i think i must really send you one which i wish you would correct i may be said to live for these instrumental labours now but i have always some childishness on handi am dear gamekeeper your indulgent but intemperate squire       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      having spent the last fortnight of april at new york stevenson and    his stepson moved at the beginning of may to the small new jersey    wateringplace from whence the following few letters are dated his    wife having meanwhile gone to san

french place the only people in the house a catboat at our disposal the sea always audible on the outer beach the lagoon as smooth as glass all the little queer many coloured villas standing shuttered and empty in front of ours across the lagoon two long wooden bridges one for the rail one for the road sounding with intermittent traffic it is highly pleasant and a delightful change from saranac my health is much better for the change i am sure i walked about four miles yesterday one time with anotherwell say three and a half and the day before i was out for four hours in the catboat and was as stiff as a board in consequence more letters callyours ever       r l s     to charles baxter     union house manasquan n j but address to      scribners 11th may 1888  my dear charlesi have found a yacht and we are going the full pitch for seven months if i cannot get my health back more or less tis madness but of course there is the hope and i will play big if this business fails to set me up well ¬£2000 is gone and i know i cant get better we sail from san francisco june 15th for the south seas in the yacht cascowith a million thanks for all your dear friendliness ever yours affectionately       robert louis stevenson     to lady taylor        manasquan may 1888  my dear lady taylori have to announce our great news on june 15th we sail from san francisco in the schooner yacht casco for a seven months cruise in the south seas you can conceive what a state of excitement we are in lloyd perhaps first but this is an old dream of mine which actually seems to be coming true and i am sunstruck it seems indeed too good to be true and that we have not deserved so much good fortune from skerryvore to the galapagos is a far cry and from poking in a sickroom all winter to the deck of ones own ship is indeed a heavenly change  all these seven months i doubt if we can expect more than three mails at the best of it and i do hope we may hear something of your news by each i have no very clear views as to where the three addresses ought to be but if you hear no later news charles scribners sons will always have the run of our intended movements and an early letter there would probably catch us at the sandwich islands tahiti will probably be the second point and as i roughly guess quito the third but the whole future is invested with heavenly clouds  i trust you are all well and content and have good news of the shelleys to whom i wish you would pass on ours they should be able to sympathise with our delight  now i have all my miserable scribner articles to rake together in the inside of a fortnight so you must not expect me to be more copious i have you all in the kindest memory and am your affectionate friend       robert louis stevenson   remember me to aubrey de vere     to homer st gaudens      the following is addressed from manasquan to a boy the son of the    writers friend the sculptor st gaudens for the rest it explains    itself       manasquan new jersey 27th may 1888  dear homer st gaudensyour father has brought you this day to see me and he tells me it is his hope you may remember the occasion i am going to do what i can to carry out his wish and it may amuse you years after to see this little scrap of paper and to read what i write i must begin by testifying that you yourself took no interest whatever in the introduction and in the most proper spirit displayed a singleminded ambition to get back to play and this i thought an excellent and admirable point in your character you were also i use the past tense with a view to the time when you shall read rather than to that when i am writing a very pretty boy and to my european views startlingly selfpossessed my time of observation was so limited that you must pardon me if i can say no more what else i marked what restlessness of foot and hand what graceful clumsiness what experimental designs upon the furniture was but the common inheritance of human youth but you may perhaps like to know that the lean flushed man in bed who interested you so little was in a state of mind extremely mingled and unpleasant harassed with work which he thought he was not doing well troubled with difficulties to which you will in time succeed and yet looking forward to no less a matter than a voyage to the south seas and the visitation of savage and desert islandsyour fathers friend       robert louis stevenson     to henry james        manasquan ahem new jersey may 28th 1888  my dear jameswith what a torrent it has come at last up to now what i like best is the first number of a london life you have never done anything better and i dont know if perhaps you have ever done anything so good as the girls outburst tiptop i have been preaching your later works in your native land i had to present the beltraffio volume to low and it has brought him to his knees he was amazed at the first part of georginas reasons although like me not so well satisfied with part ii it is annoying to find the american public as stupid as the english but they will waken up in time i wonder what they will think of two nations  this dear james is a valedictory on june 15th the schooner yacht casco will weather and a jealous providence permitting steam through the golden gates for honolulu tahiti the galapagos guayaquil andi hope not the bottom of the pacific it will contain your obedient umble servant and party it seems too good to be true and is a very good way of getting through the greensickness of maturity which with all its accompanying ills is now declaring itself in my mind and life they tell me it is not so severe as that of youth if i and the casco are spared i shall tell you more exactly as i am one of the few people in the world who do not forget their own lives  goodbye then my dear fellow and please write us a word we expect to have three mails in the next two months honolulu tahiti and guayaquil but letters will be forwarded

which reached stevensons correspondents in england and the united states at intervals necessarily somewhat rare during the eighteen months of his pacific voyages it was on the 28th of june 1888 that he started from the harbour of san francisco on what was only intended to be a health and pleasure excursion of a few months duration but turned into a voluntary exile prolonged until the hour of his death his company consisted besides himself of his wife his mother his stepson mr lloyd osbourne and the servant valentine roch they sailed on board the schooner yacht casco captain otis and made straight for the marquesas dropping anchor on the 28th of july in anaho bay the harbour of the island of nukahiva the magic effect of this first island landfall on his mind he has described in the opening chapter of his book in the south seas after spending six weeks in this group they sailed southeastwards visiting a sufficiently perilous piece of navigation several of the coral atolls of the paumotus or low archipelago thence they arrived in the first week of october at the tahitian group or society islands in these their longest stay was not at the chief town papeete where stevenson fell sharply ill but in a more secluded and very beautiful station tautira whither he went to recruit and where they were detained by the necessity of remasting the schooner here stevenson and one of the local chiefs ori a ori made special friends and parted with heartfelt mutual regret mrs stevenson is good enough to allow me to supplement the somewhat fragmentary account of these adventures given in his letters with one or two of her own in which they are told with full vividness and detail  sailing from tahiti due northwards through forty degrees of latitude the party arrived about christmas at honolulu the more than semicivilised capital of the hawaiian group sandwich islands where they paid off the yacht casco and made a stay of nearly six months here stevenson finished the master of ballantrae and the wrong box and hence his mother returned for a while to scotland to rejoin her sons household when it was fairly installed two years later at vailima from honolulu stevenson made several excursions including one which profoundly impressed him to the leper settlement at molokai the scene of father damiens ministrations and death  this first year of cruising and residence among the pacific islands had resulted in so encouraging a renewal of health with so keen a zest added to life by the restored capacity for outdoor activity and adventure that stevenson determined to prolong his experiences in yet more remote archipelagoes of the same ocean he started accordingly from honolulu in june 1889 on a trading schooner the equator bound to the gilberts one of the least visited and most primitively mannered of all the island groups of the western pacific emerged towards christmas of the same year into semicivilisation again at apia on the island of upolu in samoa where he wrote his first polynesian story the bottle imp enchanted with the scenery and the people he stayed for six weeks first in the house of mr h j moors a leading american trader then with his family in a separate cottage not far off bought an estate on the densely wooded mountain side above apia with the notion of making there if not a home at least a place of rest and call on later projected excursions among the islands and began to make collections for his studies in recent samoan history in february he went on to sydney to find his correspondence and consider future plans it was during this stay at sydney that he was moved to give expression to his righteous indignation at the terms of a letter concerning father damien by the rev dr hyde of honolulu here also he fell once more seriously ill with a renewal of all his old symptoms and the conclusion was forced upon him that he must take up his residence for the rest of his life in the tropicsthough with occasional excursions as he then hoped at least halfway homeward to places where it might be possible for friends from england to meet him in order to shake off the effects of this attack he started with his party on a fresh sea voyage from sydney this time on a trading steamer the janet nicoll which took him by a very devious course to the gilberts again the marshalls and among many other remote islands during the months of aprilaugust 1890 during the voyage he began to put into shape the notes for a volume on the south seas which he had been compiling ever since he left san francisco unfortunately he persisted in the endeavour to make his work impersonal and full of information or what he called serious interest exactly in the manner which his wife had foreseen before they left honolulu and from which she had wisely tried to dissuade him see her letter printed on pp 347 foll on the return voyage stevenson left the janet nicoll to land in new caledonia staying for some days at noumea before he went on to sydney where he spent four or five weeks of later august and september thence he returned in october to take up his abode for good on his samoan property where the work of clearing planting and building a habitable cottage had been going on busily during his absence     to sidney colvin      it should be remembered that the marquesas the paumotus and the    tahitian group are all dependencies of france       yacht casco anaho bay nukahiva marquesas islands july 1888  my dear colvinfrom this somewhat ahem out of the way place i write to say how dye do it is all a swindle i chose these isles as having the most beastly population and they are far better and far more civilised than we i know one old chief kooamua a great cannibal in his day who ate his enemies even as he walked home from killing em and he is a perfect gentleman and exceedingly amiable and simpleminded no fool though  the climate is delightful and the harbour where we lie one of the loveliest spots imaginable yesterday evening we had near a score natives on board lovely parties we have a native god very rare now very rare and equally absurd to view  this sort of work is not favourable to correspondence it takes me all the little strength i have to go about and see and then come home and note the strangeness around us i shouldnt wonder if there came trouble here some day all the same i could name a nation that is not beloved in certain islandsand it does not know it strange like ourselves perhaps in india love to all and much to yourself       r l s     to charles baxter     yacht casco at sea near the paumotus     7 am september 6th 1888 with a dreadful pen  my dear charleslast night as i lay under my blanket in the cockpit courting sleep i had a comic seizure there was nothing visible but the southern stars and the steersman there out by the binnacle lamp we were all looking forward to a most deplorable landfall on the morrow praying god we should fetch a tuft of palms which are to indicate the dangerous archipelago the night was as warm as milk and all of a sudden i had a vision ofdrummond street it came on me like a flash of lightning i simply returned thither and into the past and when i remember all i hoped and feared as i pickled about rutherfords in the rain and the east wind how i feared i should make a mere shipwreck and yet timidly hoped not how i feared i should never have a friend far less a wife and yet passionately hoped i might how i hoped if i did not take to drink i should possibly write one little book etc etc and then nowwhat a change i feel somehow as if i should like the incident set upon a brass plate at the corner of that dreary thoroughfare for all students to read poor devils when their hearts are down and i felt i must write one word to you excuse me if i write little when i am at sea it gives me a headache when i am in port i have my diary crying give give i shall have a fine book of travels i feel sure and will tell you more of the south seas after very few months than any other writer has doneexcept herman melville perhaps who is a howling cheese good luck to you god bless youyour affectionate friend       r l s     to sidney colvin      the signature used at foot of this letter and occasionally elsewhere    the old man virulent alludes to the fits of uncontrollable anger    to which he was

ashore it looks pretty bald in the atlas not in fact nor i trust in the 130 odd pages of diary which i have just been looking up for these dates the interest indeed has been incredible i did not dream there were such places or such races my health has stood me splendidly i am in for hours wading over the knees for shells i have been five hours on horseback i have been up pretty near all night waiting to see where the casco would go ashore and with my diary all readysimply the most entertaining night of my life withal i still have colds i have one now and feel pretty sick too but not as at home instead of being in bed for instance i am at this moment sitting snuffling and writing in an undershirt and trousers and as for colour hands arms feet legs and face i am browner than the berry only my trunk and the aristocratic spot on which i sit retain the vile whiteness of the north  please give my news and kind love to henley henry james and any whom you see of wellwishers accept from me the very best of my affection and believe me ever yours       the old man virulent        papeete taiti october 7th 1888  never having found a chance to send this off i may add more of my news my cold took a very bad turn and i am pretty much out of sorts at this particular living in a little bare onetwentiethfurnished house surrounded by mangoes etc all the rest are well and i mean to be soon but these taiti colds are very severe and to children often fatal so they were not the thing for me yesterday the brigantine came in from san francisco so we can get our letters off soon there are in papeete at this moment in a little wooden house with grated verandahs two people who love you very much and one of them is       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter        taiti as ever was 6th october 1888  my dear charles  you will receive a lot of mostly very bad proofs of photographs the paper was so bad please keep them very private as they are for the book we send them having learned so dread a fear of the sea that we wish to put our eggs in different baskets we have been thrice within an ace of being ashore we were lost  for about twelve hours in the low archipelago but by gods blessing had quiet weather all the time and once in a squall we cam so near gaun heels ower hurdies that i really dinnae ken why we didnae athegither hence as i say a great desire to put our eggs in different baskets particularly on the pacific awhawhaw pacific ocean  you can have no idea what a mean time we have had owing to incidental beastlinesses nor what a glorious owing to the intrinsic interest of these isles i hope the book will be a good one nor do i really very much doubt thatthe stuff is so curious what i wonder is if the public will rise to it a copy of my journal or as much of it as is made shall go to you also it is of course quite imperfect much being to be added and corrected but o for the eggs in the different baskets  all the rest are well enough and all have enjoyed the cruise so far in spite of its drawbacks we have had an awfae time in some ways mr baxter and if i wasnae sic a verra patient man when i ken that i have to be there wad hae been a braw row and ance if i hadnae happened to be on deck about three in the marnin i think there would have been murder done the american mairchant marine is a kent service yell have heard its praise im

affectionate friend       robert louis stevenson     to miss adelaide boodle      this lady as we have seen had made stevenson a present of a    papercutter when he left bournemouth and it is in the character of    the papercutter that he now writes       taiti october 10th 1888  dear giveri am at a loss to conceive your object in giving me to a person so locomotory as my proprietor the number of thousand miles that i have travelled the strange bedfellows with which i have been made acquainted i lack the requisite literary talent to make clear to your imagination i speak of bedfellows pocketfellows would be a more exact expression for the place of my abode is in my masters righthand trouserpocket and there as he waded on the resounding beaches of nukahiva or in the shallow tepid water on the reef of fakarava i have been overwhelmed by and buried among all manner of abominable south sea shells beautiful enough in their way i make no doubt but singular company for any selfrespecting papercutter he my masteror as i more justly call him my bearer for although i occasionally serve him does not he serve me daily and all day long carrying me like an african potentate on my subjects legshe is delighted with these isles and this climate and these savages and a variety of other things he now blows a flageolet with singular effects sometimes the poor thing appears stifled with shame sometimes it screams with agony he pursues his career with truculent insensibility health appears to reign in the party i was very nearly sunk in a squall i am sorry i ever left england for here there are no books to be had and without books there is no stable situation for dear giver your affectionate       wooden papercutter   a neighbouring pair of scissors snips a kiss in your direction     to sidney colvin      the ballad referred to in the letter which follows is the feast of    famine published with others in the collection of 1890 ballads    chatto  windus i never very much admired his south sea ballads    for any quality except their narrative vigour thinking them unequal    and uncertain both in metre and style       taiti october 16th 1888  my dear colvinthe cruiser for san francisco departs tomorrow morning bearing you some kind of a scratch this much more important packet will travel by way of auckland it contains a ballant and i think a better ballant than i expected ever to do i can imagine how you will wag your pow over it and how ragged you will find it etc but has it not spirit all the same and though the verse is not all your fancy painted it has it not some life and surely as narrative the thing has considerable merit read it get a typewritten copy taken and send me that and your opinion to the sandwiches i know i am only courting the most excruciating mortification but the real cause of my sending the thing is that i could bear to go down myself but not to have much ms go down with me to say truth we are through the most dangerous but it has left in all minds a strong sense of insecurity and we are all for putting eggs in various baskets  we leave here soon bound for uahiva raiatea borabora and the sandwiches    o how my spirit languishes   to step ashore on the sanguishes   for there my letters wait   there shall i know my fate   o how my spirit languidges   to step ashore on the sanguidges  18thi think we shall leave here if all is well on monday i am quite recovered astonishingly recovered it must be owned these climates and this voyage have given me more strength than i could have thought possible and yet the sea is a terrible place stupefying to the mind and poisonous to the temper the sea the motion the lack of space the cruel publicity the villainous tinned foods the sailors the captain the passengersbut you are amply repaid when you sight an island and drop anchor in a new world much trouble has attended this trip but i must confess more pleasure nor should i ever complain as in the last few weeks with the curing of my illness indeed as if that were the bursting of an abscess the cloud has risen from my spirits and to some degree from my temper do you know what they called the casco at fakarava the silver ship is that not pretty pray tell mrs jenkin die silberne frau as i only learned it since i wrote her i think of calling the book by that name the cruise of the silver shipso there will be one poetic page at leastthe title at the sandwiches we shall say farewell to the s s with mingled feelings she is a lovely creature the most beautiful thing at this moment in taiti  well i will take another sheet though i know i have nothing to say you would think i was bursting but the voyage is all stored up for the book which is to pay for it we fondly hope and the troubles of the time are not worth telling and our news is little  here i conclude oct 24th i think for we are now stored and the blue peter metaphorically flies       r l s     to william and thomas archer      stevenson addresses a part of this letter as well as the whole of    another later on to a young son of mr archers but rather to amuse    himself than his nominal correspondent who was then aged three       taiti october 17th 1888  dear archerthough quite unable to write letters i nobly send you a line signifying nothing the voyage has agreed well with all it has had its pains and its extraordinary pleasures nothing in the world can equal the excitement of the first time you cast anchor in some bay of a tropical island and the boats begin to surround you and the tattooed people swarm aboard tell tomarcher with my respex that hideandseek is not equal to it no nor hideeinthedark which for the matter of that is a game for the unskilful the artist prefers daylight a goodsized garden some shrubbery an open paddock andcome on macduff  tomarcher i am now a distinguished litterytour but that was not the real bent of my genius i was the best player of hideandseek going not a good runner i was up to every shift and dodge i could jink very well i could crawl without any noise through leaves i could hide under a carrot plant it used to be my favourite boast that i always walked into the den you may care to hear tomarcher about the children in these parts their parents obey them they do not obey their parents and i am sorry to tell you for i dare say you are already thinking the idea a good one that it does not pay one halfpenny there are three sorts of civilisation tomarcher the real oldfashioned one in which children either had to find out how to please their dear papas or their dear papas cut their heads off this style did very well but is now out of fashion then the modern european style in which children have to behave reasonably well and go to school and say their prayers or their dear papas will know the reason why this does fairly well then there is the south sea island plan which does not do one bit the children beat their parents here it does not make their parents any better so do not try it  dear tomarcher i have forgotten the address of your new house but will send this to one of your papas publishers remember us all to all of you and believe me yours respectably       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter      tautira the garden of the world otherwise called       hanschristianandersenville november 1888  my dear charleswhether i have a penny left in the wide world i know not nor shall know till i get to honolulu where i anticipate a devil of an awakening it will be from a mighty pleasant dream at least tautira being mere heaven but suppose for the sake of argument any money to be left in the hands of my painful doer what is to be done with it save us from exile would be the wise mans choice i suppose for the exile threatens to be eternal but yet i am of opinionin case there should be some dibbs in the hand of the pd ie painful doer because if there be none i shall take to my flageolet on the highroad and work home the best way i can having previously made away with my familyi am of opinion that if  and his are in the customary state and you are thinking of an offering and there should be still some funds over you would be a real good pd to put some in with yours and tak the credit ot like a wee man i know its a beastly thing to ask but it after all does no earthly harm only that much good and besides like enough theres nothing in the till and there is an end yet i live here in the full lustre of millions it is thought i am the richest son of man that has yet been to tautira iand i am secretly eaten with the fear of lying in pawn perhaps for the remainder of my days in san francisco as usual my colds have much hashed my finances  do tell henley i write this just after having dismissed ori the subchief in whose house i live mrs ori and pairai their adopted child from the evening hour of music during which i publickly with a k blow on the flageolet these are words of truth yesterday i told ori about w e h counterfeited his playing on the piano and the pipe and succeeded in sending the six feet four there is of that subchief somewhat sadly to his bed feeling that his was not the genuine article after all ori is exactly like a colonel in the guardsi am dear charles ever yours affectionately       r l s     to charles baxter      the stanzas which end this letter are well known having been

addington symonds      the following is the draft of a proposed dedication to the south sea    travelbook which was to be the fruit of the present voyages as is    explained in a note at the end       november 11th 1888  one november night in the village of tautira we sat at the high table in the hall of assembly hearing the natives sing it was dark in the hall and very warm though at times the land wind blew a little shrewdly through the chinks and at times through the larger openings we could see the moonlight on the lawn as the songs arose in the rattling tahitian chorus the chief translated here and there a verse farther on in the volume you shall read the songs themselves and i am in hopes that not you only but all who can find a savour in the ancient poetry of places will read them with some pleasure you are to conceive us therefore in strange circumstances and very pleasing in a strange land and climate the most beautiful on earth surrounded by a foreign race that all travellers have agreed to be the most engaging and taking a double interest in two foreign arts  we came forth again at last in a cloudy moonlight on the forest lawn which is the street of tautira the pacific roared outside upon the reef here and there one of the scattered palmbuilt lodges shone out under the shadow of the wood the lamplight bursting through the crannies of the wall we went homeward slowly ori a ori carrying behind us the lantern and the chairs properties with which we had just been enacting our part of the distinguished visitor it was one of those moments in which minds not altogether churlish recall the names and deplore the absence of congenial friends and it was your name that first rose upon our lips how symonds would have enjoyed this evening said one and then another the word caught in my mind i went to bed and it was still there the glittering frosty solitudes in which your days are cast arose before me i seemed to see you walking there in the late night under the pinetrees and the stars and i received the image with something like remorse  there is a modern attitude towards fortune in this place i will not use a graver name staunchly to withstand her buffets and to enjoy with equanimity her favours was the code of the virtuous of old our fathers it should seem wondered and doubted how they had merited their misfortunes we rather how we have deserved our happiness and we stand often abashed and sometimes revolted at those partialities of fate by which we profit most it was so with me on that november night i felt that our positions should be changed it was you dear symonds who should have gone upon that voyage and written this account with your rich stores of knowledge you could have remarked and understood a thousand things of interest and beauty that escaped my ignorance and the brilliant colours of your style would have carried into a thousand sickrooms the sea air and the strong sun of tropic islands it was otherwise decreed but suffer me at least to connect you if only in name and only in the fondness of imagination with the voyage of the silver ship       robert louis stevenson   dear symondsi send you this november 11th the morning of its completion if i ever write an account of this voyage may i place this letter at the beginning it representsi need not tell you for you too are an artista most genuine feeling which kept me long awake last night and though perhaps a little elaborate i think it a good piece of writing we are in heaven here do not forget       r l s   please keep this i have no perfect copy  tautira on the peninsula of taiti     to thomas archer        tautira island of taiti november 1888  dear tomarcherthis is a pretty state of things seven oclock and no word of breakfast and i was awake a good deal last night for it was full moon and they had made a great fire of cocoanut husks down by the sea and as we have no blinds or shutters this kept my room very bright and then the rats had a wedding or a schoolfeast under my bed and then i woke early and i have nothing to read except virgils √Üneid which is not good fun on an empty stomach and a latin dictionary which is good for naught and by some humorous accident your dear papas article on skerryvore and i read the whole of that and very impudent it is but you must not tell your dear papa i said so or it might come to a battle in which you might lose either a dear papa or a valued correspondent or both which would be prodigal and still no breakfast so i said lets write to tomarcher  this is a much better place for children than any i have hitherto seen in these seas the girls and sometimes the boys play a very elaborate kind of hopscotch the boys play horses exactly as we do in europe and have very good fun on stilts trying to knock each other down in which they do not often succeed the children of all ages go to church and are allowed to do what they please running about the aisles rolling balls stealing mammas bonnet and publicly sitting on it and at last going to sleep in the middle of the floor i forgot to say that the whips to play horses and the balls to roll about the churchat least i never saw them used elsewheregrow ready made on trees which is rough on toyshops the whips are so good that i wanted to play horses myself but no such luck my hair is grey and i am a great big ugly man the balls are rather hard but very light and quite round when you grow up and become offensively rich you can charter a ship in the port of london and have it come back to you entirely loaded with these balls when you could satisfy your mind as to their character and give them away when done with to your uncles and aunts but what i really wanted to tell you was this besides the treetop toys hushaby toyshop on the treetop i have seen some real made toys the first hitherto observed in the south seas  this was how you are to imagine a fourwheeled gig one horse in the front seat two tahiti natives in their sunday clothes blue coat white shirt kilt a little longer than the scotch of a blue stuff with big white or yellow flowers legs and feet bare in the back seat me and my wife who is a friend of yours under our feet plenty of lunch and things among us a great deal of fun in broken tahitian one of the natives the subchief of the village being a great ally of mine indeed we have exchanged names so that he is now called rui the nearest they can come to louis for they have no l and no s in their language rui is six feet three in his stockings and a magnificent man we all have straw hats for the sun is strong we drive between the sea which makes a great noise and the mountains the road is cut through a forest mostly of fruit trees the very creepers which take the place of our ivy heavy with a great and delicious fruit bigger than your head and far nicer called barbedine presently we came to a house in a pretty garden quite by itself very nicely kept the doors and windows open no one about and no noise but that of the sea it looked like a house in a fairytale and just beyond we must ford a river and there we saw the inhabitants just in the mouth of the river where it met the sea waves they were ducking and bathing and screaming together like a covey of birds seven or eight little naked brown boys and girls as happy as the day was long and on the banks of the stream beside them real toystoy ships full rigged and with their sails set though they were lying in the dust on their beam ends and then i knew for sure they were all children in a fairystory living alone together in that lonely house with the only toys in all the island and that i had myself driven in my fourwheeled gig into a corner of the fairystory and the question was should i get out again but it was all right i guess only one of the wheels of the gig had got into the fairystory and the next jolt the whole thing vanished and we drove on in our seaside forest as before and i have the honour to be tomarchers valued correspondent teriitera which he was previously known as       robert louis stevenson     mrs r l stevenson to sidney colvin      this letter from mrs stevenson serves to fill out and explain    allusions in the three or four preceding the beautiful brown    princess is princess mo√´ exqueen of raiatea well known to readers    of pierre loti and miss gordon cumming the move away from papeete    where stevenson had fallen seriously ill had been made in hopes of    finding on the island a climate that would suit him better       tautira tahiti dec 4th 1888  dear long neglected though never forgotten custodian i write you from fairyland where we are living in a fairy story the guests of a beautiful brown princess we came to stay a week five weeks have passed and we are still indefinite as to our time of leaving it was chance brought us here for no one in papeete could tell us a word about this part of the island except that it was very fine to look at and inhabited by wild peoplealmost as wild as the people of anaho that touch about the people of anaho inclined our hearts this way so we finally concluded to take a look at the other side of tahiti the place of our landing was windy uninhabited except by mosquitoes and louis was ill the first day lloyd and the captain made an exploration but came back disgusted they had found a chinaman a long way off who seemed to have some horses but no desire to hire them to strangers and they had found nothing else whatever the next morning i took valentine and went on a prospecting tour of my own i found the chinaman persuaded him to let me have two horses and a wagon and went back for the rest of my family when asked where i wished to go i could only say to the largest native village and the most wild ill as louis was i brought him the next day and shall never cease to be thankful for my courage for he has gained health and strength every day he takes sea baths and swims and lives almost entirely in the open air as nearly without clothes as possible a simple pyjama suit of striped light flannel his only dress as to shoes and stockings we all have scorned them for months except mrs stevenson who often goes barefoot and never i believe wears stockings lloyds costume in which he looks remarkably well consists of a striped flannel shirt and a pareu the pareu is no more or less than a large figured blue and white cotton window curtain twisted about the waist and hanging a little below the bare knees both louis and lloyd wear wreaths of artificial flowers made of the dried pandanus leaf on their hats  mo√´ has gone to papeete by the command of the king whose letter was addressed to the great princess at tautira pv pv stands for pomar√© 5th every evening before she went we played van john lying in a circle on pillows in the middle of the floor with our heads together and hardly an evening passed but it struck us afresh how very much you would like mo√´ and we told her of you again the house really here a palace in which we live belongs to the subchief ori a subject and relation of the princess he and his whole family consisting of his wife his two little adopted sons his daughter and her two young babies turned out to live in a little birdcage hut of one room ori is the very finest specimen of a native we have seen yet he is several inches over six feet of perfect though almost gigantic proportions and looks more like a roman emperor in bronze than words can express one day when mo√´ gave a feast it being the correct thing to do we all wore wreaths of golden yellow leaves on our heads when ori walked in and sat down at the table as with one voice we all cried out in admiration his manners and i might say his habit of thought are english in some ways he is so like a colonel of the guards that we often call him colonel it was either the day before or the morning of our public feast that louis asked the princess if she thought ori would accept his name she was sure of it and much pleased at the idea i wish you could have seen louis blushing like a schoolgirl when ori came in and the brotherhood was offered so now if you please louis is no more louis having given that name away in the tahitian form of rui but is known as teriitera pronounced tereeterah that being oris christian name ori a ori is his clan name  let me tell you of our village feast the chief who was our guide in the matter found four large fat hogs which louis bought and four cases of ships biscuit were sent over from the casco which is lying at papeete for repairs our feast cost in all about eighty dollars every sunday all things of public interest are announced in the farehau an enormous public bird cage and the news of the week read aloud from the papeete journal if it happens to turn up our feast was given on a wednesday and was announced by the chief the sunday before who referred to louis as the rich one our hogs were killed in the morning washed in the sea and roasted whole in a pit with hot stones when done they were laid on their stomachs in neat open coffins of green basket work each hog with his case of biscuits beside him early in the morning the entire population began bathing a bath being the preliminary to everything at about three oclockfour was the hour setthere was a general movement towards our premises so that i had to hurry louis into his clothes all white even to his shoes lloyd was also in white but barefoot i was not prepared so had to appear in a red and white muslin gown also barefoot as mrs stevenson had had a feast of her own conducted on religious principles she kept a little in the background so that her dress did not matter so much the chief who speaks french very well stood beside louis to interpret for him by the time we had taken our respective places on the veranda in front of our door an immense crowd had assembled they came in five instead of four detachments which was what the chief expected and he was a little confused at first as he and louis had been arranging a speech to four sets of people which ran in this order the clergyman at the head of the protestants the chief council and irreligiousone of the council at their head the schoolmaster with the schoolchildren the catechist and the catholics but there was another very small sect by some strange mischance called mormons which it was supposed would be broken up and swallowed by the others but no the mormons came in a body alone marshalled by the best and wittiest speakerbar ruiin tautira each set of people came bending under the weight of bamboo poles laden with fruits pigs fowls etc all were dressed in their gayest pareus and many had wreaths of leaves or flowers on their heads the prettiest sight of all was the children who came marching two and two abreast the bamboo poles lying lengthwise across their shoulders  when all the offerings had been piled in five great heaps upon the ground louis made his oration to the accompaniment of the squealing of pigs the cackling of hens and the roar of the surf which beats manhigh upon the roof a speech was made in return on behalf of the village and then each section sent forth its orator the speeches following in the order i have given above each speaker finished by coming forward with one of the smaller things in his hand which he offered personally to louis and then shook hands with us all and retired among these smaller presents were many fishhooks for large fishing laboriously carved from motherofpearl shell one man came with one egg in each hand saying carry these to scotland with you let them hatch into cocks and their song shall remind you of tautira the schoolmaster with a leafbasket of rose apples made his speech in french somehow the whole effect of the scene was like a story out of the bible and i am not ashamed that louis and i both shed tears when we saw the enchanting procession of schoolchildren the catholic priest father bruno a great friend of ours said that for the next fifty years the time of the feast of the rich one will be talked of which reminds me of our friend donat of fakarava who was temporary resident at the time we were there i am so glad he said that the casco came in just now otherwise i should be forgotten but now the people will always say this or that happened so long beforeor so long afterthe coming of the silver ship when donat represented the government  in front of our house is a broad stretch of grass dotted with cocoanuts breadfruits mangoes and the strange pandanus tree i wish you could have seen them their lower branches glowing with the rich colours of the fruits hung upon them by ori and his men and great heaps lying piled against their roots on the evening of our feast from the bamboo poles that they were carried upon a pen was made for the ten pigs and a fowl house for the twentythree fowls that were among the presents but there was a day of reckoning at hand time after time we ran down to the beach to look for the casco until we were in despair for over a month we had lived in oris house causing him infinite trouble and annoyance and not even his at that areia the chiefareia means the prince went to papeete and came back with a letter to say that more work had to be done upon the casco and it might be any time before she could get to tautira we had used up all our stores and had only a few dollars of money left in tautira and not very much in papeete could we stand the journey to papeete we could not live upon the yacht in the midst of the workmen and we had not money enough left to live at an hotel we were playing cards on the floor as usual when this message came and you can imagine its effect i knew perfectly well that rui would force us to stay on with him but what depressed me the most of all was the fact of louis having made brothers with him just before this took place had there been a shadow of doubt on our dear ruis face i should have fled from before him sitting there on the floor waiting for him was too much for my nerves and i burst into tears upon which the princess wept bitterly in the meantime the priest had dropped in so that we had him and mo√´ and areia as witnesses to our humiliating position first came madame rui who heard the story and sat down on the floor in silence which was very damping for a beginning and then ori of ori the magnificent who listened to the tale of the shipwrecked mariners with serious dignity asking one or two questions and then spoke to this effect you are my brother all that i have is yours i know that your food is done but i can give you plenty of fish and taro we like you and wish to have you here stay where you are till the casco comes be happyet ne pleurez pas louis dropped his head into his hands and wept and then we all went up to rui and shook hands with him and accepted his offer madame rui who had been silent only as a dutiful wife that her husband might speak first poured forth manifold reasons for our staying on as long as we could possibly manage during all this scene an attendant of the princess had been sitting on the floor behind us a baby in his arms where he had ensconced himself for the purpose of watching the game he understood nothing of what was going on we wondered afterwards what he thought of it reduced as we were we still had a few bottles of champagne left champagne being an especial weakness of our gigantic friend it occurred to some one that this was a proper occasion to open a couple of bottles louis the princess and i were quite as the scotch so well say begrutten areias immense eyes were fairly melting out of his head with emotion the priest was wiping his eyes and blowing his nose and then for no apparent cause we suddenly fell to drinking and clinking glasses quite merrily the bewildered attendant clinked and drank too and then sat down and waited in case there should be any repetition of the drinking part of the performance and sure enough there was for in the midst of an animated discussion as to ways and means mrs stevenson announced that it was st andrews day so again the attendant clinked and drank with oris mad foreigners  it is quite true that we live almost entirely upon native food our luncheon today consisted of raw fish with sauce made of cocoanut milk mixed with sea water and lime juice taro poipoi and bananas roasted in hot stones in a little pit in the ground with cocoanut cream to eat with them still we like coffee in the evening a little wine at dinner and a few other products of civilisation it would be possible the chief said to send a boat but that would cost sixty dollars a final arrangement which we were forced to accept was that rui should go in his own boat and the chief would appoint a substitute for some public work that he was then engaged upon early the next morning amidst a raging sea and a storming wind rui departed with three men to help him it is forty miles to papeete and rui starting in the early morning arrived there at nine oclock but alas the wind was against him and it was altogether six days before he got back  louis has done a great deal of work on his new story the master of ballantrae almost finished it in fact while mrs stevenson and i are deep in the mysteries of hatmaking which is a ladies accomplishment taking the place of watercolour drawing in england it is a small compliment to present a hat to an acquaintance altogether we have about thirteen next door to us is areias outofdoor house where he and the ladies of his family sleep and eat it has a thatched roof of palm branches and a floor of boards the sides and ends being open to the world on the floor are spread mats plaited of pandanus leaves and pillows stuffed with silk cotton from the cotton tree we make little calls upon the ladies lie upon the mats and smoke cigarettes made of tobacco leaves rolled in a bit of dried pandanus and admire their work or get a lesson or they call upon us and lie upon our mats one day there was an election in the farehau it takes place all over the island once a year and among others the subchief and headcouncillor is chosen for the latter our rui was a candidate in the beginning the french deposed the born chiefs and told the people to elect men for themselves the choice of tautira fell upon rui who declined the honour saying that areia was his natural chief and he could not take a position that should belong to his superior upon which the people elected areia chief and rui subchief and headcouncillor we all went over to the farehau where areia sat in the middle of his councillors on a dais behind a long table the farehau is an immense birdcage of bamboos tied together with pandanus fibre and thatched with palms in front of the dais the ground is deeply covered with dried leaves the costume of the dignitaries was rather odd areia wore a white shirt and blue flannel coat which was well enough but on his plump legs were a pair of the most incredible trousers light blue calico with a small red pattern such as servant girls wear for gowns in england on his feet were neat little shoes and stockings rui was a fine sight and we were very proud of him he sat exactly like an english gentleman holding himself well in hand alert as a fox and keen as a greyhound several men spoke from the farther end of the hall making objections of some sort we could see rui listened with a half satirical half kindly smile in his eyes and then dropped a quiet answer without rising from his seat which had the effect of raising a shout of laughter and quite demolishing his opponent voters came up to the table and dropped their bits of paper into a slit in a box some led children by the hand and some carried babies in their arms across the centre of the great room children and dogs ran chasing each other and playing i noticed two little maids who walked up and down for a long time with their arms intertwined about each others waists near where we sat we were on the dais above the common herd a pretty young lady having tied up her dogs mouth with a tuft of grass industriously caught and cracked fleas from its back both lloyd and i grew very sleepy and as we did not like to leave till the election was decided we just threw ourselves down and took a nap at the feet of the councillors nor did we wake till the chief called out to us in english it is finished i never thought i should be able to calmly sleep at a public meeting on a platform in the face of several hundred people but it is wonderful how quickly one takes up the ways of a people when you live with them as intimately as we do  i hear dinner coming on the table so with much love from us all to you and other dear ones including our dear friend henry james believe me affectionately yours       fanny v de g stevenson     to sidney colvin        yacht casco at sea 14th january 1889  my dear colvintwenty days out from papeete yes sir all that and only for a guess in 4¬∞ north or at the best 4¬∞30 though already the wind seems to smell a little of the north pole my handwriting you must take as you get for we are speeding along through a nasty swell and i can only keep my place at the table by means of a foot against the divan the unoccupied hand meanwhile gripping the inkbottle as we begin so very slowly to draw near to seven months of correspondence we are all in some fear and i want to have letters written before i shall be plunged into that boiling pot of disagreeables which i constantly expect at honolulu what is needful can be added there  we were kept two months at tautira in the house of my dear old friend ori a ori till both the masts of this invaluable yacht had been repaired it was all for the best tautira being the most beautiful spot and its people the most amiable i have ever found besides which the climate suited me to the ground i actually went seabathing almost every day and in our feasts we are all huge eaters in taiarapu have been known to apply four times for pig and then again i got wonderful materials for my book collected songs and legends on the spot songs still sung in chorus by perhaps a hundred persons not two of whom can agree on their translation legends on which i have seen half a dozen seniors sitting in conclave and debating what came next once i went a days journey to the other side of the island to tati the high chief of the tevasmy chief that is for i am now a teva and teriitera at your serviceto collect more and correct what i had already in the meanwhile i got on with my work almost finished the master of ballantrae which contains more human work than anything of mine but kidnapped and wrote the half of another ballad the song of rahero on a taiarapu legend of my own clan sirnot so much fire as the feast of famine but promising to be more even and correct but the best fortune of our stay at tautira was my knowledge of ori himself one of the finest creatures extant the day of our parting was a sad one we deduced from it a rule for travellers not to stay two months in one placewhich is to cultivate regrets  at last our contemptible ship was ready to sea we went bound for honolulu and the letterbag on christmas day and from then to now have experienced every sort of minor misfortune squalls calms contrary winds and seas pertinacious rains declining stores till we came almost to regard ourselves as in the case of vanderdecken three days ago our luck seemed to improve we struck a leading breeze got creditably through the doldrums and just as we looked to have the ne trades and a straight run the rains and squalls and calms began again about midnight and this morning though there is breeze enough to send us along we are beaten back by an obnoxious swell out of the north here is a page of complaint when a verse of thanksgiving had perhaps been more in place for all this time we must have been skirting past dangerous weather in the tail and circumference of hurricanes and getting only annoyance where we should have had peril and illhumour instead of fear  i wonder if i have managed to give you any news this time or whether the usual damn hangs over my letter the midwife whispered be thou dull or at least inexplicit anyway i have tried my best am exhausted with the effort and fall back into the land of generalities i cannot tell you how often we have planned our arrival at the monument two nights ago the 12th january we had it all planned out arrived in the lights and whirl of waterloo hailed a hansom span up waterloo road over the bridge etc etc and hailed the monument gate in triumph and with indescribable delight my dear custodian i always think we are too sparing of assurances cordelia is only to be excused by regan and goneril in the same nursery i wish to tell you that the longer i live the more dear do you become to me nor does my heart own any stronger sentiment if the bloody schooner didnt send me flying in every sort of direction at the same time i would say better what i feel so much but really if you were here you would not be writing letters i believe and even i though of a more marine constitution am much perturbed by this bobbery and wisho ye gods how i wishthat it was done and we had arrived and i had pandoras box my mailbag in hand and was in the lively hope of something eatable for dinner instead of salt horse tinned mutton duff without any plums and pie fruit which now make up our whole repertory o pandoras box i wonder what you will contain as like as not you will contain but little money if that be so we shall have to retire to frisco in the casco and thence by sea via panama to southampton where we should arrive in april i would like fine to see you on the tug ten years older both of us than the last time you came to welcome fanny and me to england if we have money however we shall do a little differently send the casco away from honolulu empty of its highborn lessees for that voyage to frisco is one long dead beat in foul and at last in cold weather stay awhile behind follow by steamer cross the states by train stay awhile in new york on business and arrive probably by the german line in southampton but all this is a question of money we shall have to lie very dark awhile to recruit our finances what comes from the book of the cruise i do not want to touch until the capital is repaid       r l s     to e l burlingame        honolulu january 1889  my dear burlingamehere at last i have arrived we could not get away from tahiti till christmas day and then had thirty days of calms and squalls a deplorable passage this has thrown me all out of gear in every way i plunge into business  1 the master herewith go three more parts you see he grows in bulk this making ten already and i am not yet sure if i can finish it in an eleventh which shall go to you quam primumi hope by next mail  2 illustrations to m i totally forgot to try to write to hole it was just as well for i find it impossible to forecast with sufficient precision you had better throw off all this and let him have it at once please do all and at once see further and i should hope he would still be in time for the later numbers the three pictures i have received are so truly good that i should bitterly regret having the volume imperfectly equipped they are the best illustrations i have seen since i dont know when  3 money tomorrow the mail comes in and i hope it will bring me money either from you or home but i will add a word on that point  4 my address will be honoluluno longer yacht casco which i am packing offtill probably april  5 as soon as i am through with the master i shall finish the game of bluffnow rechristened the wrong box this i wish to sell cash down it is of course copyright in the states and i offer it to you for five thousand dollars please reply on this by return also please tell the typewriter who was so good as to be amused by our follies that i am filled with admiration for his piece of work  6 master again please see that i havent the name of the governor of new york wrong 1764 is the date in part ten i have no book of reference to put me right observe you now have up to august inclusive in hand so you should begin to feel happy  is this all i wonder and fear not henry the trader has not yet turned up i hope he may tomorrow when we expect a mail not one word of business have i received either from the states or england nor anything in the shape of coin which leaves me in a fine uncertainty and quite penniless on these islands hm27 who is a gentleman of a courtly order and much tinctured with letters is very polite i may possibly ask for the position of palace doorkeeper my voyage has been a singular mixture of good and ill fortune as far as regards interest and material the fortune has been admirable as far as regards time money and impediments of all kinds from squalls and calms to rotten masts and sprung spars simply detestable i hope you will be interested to hear of two volumes on the wing the cruise itself you are to know will make a big volume with appendices some of it will first appear as what they call letters in some of mclures papers i believe the book when ready will have a fair measure of serious interest i have had great fortune in finding old songs and ballads and stories for instance and have many singular instances of life in the last few years among these islands  the second volume is of ballads you know ticonderoga i have written another the feast of famine a marquesan story a third is half done the song of rahero a genuine tahitian legend a fourth dances before me a hawaiian fellow this the priests drought or some such name if as i half suspect i get enough subjects out of the islands ticonderoga shall be suppressed and well call the volume south sea ballads in health spirits renewed interest in life and i do believe refreshed capacity for work the cruise has proved a wise folly still were not home and although the friend of a crowned head are penniless upon these as one of my correspondents used to call them lovely but fatil islands by the way who wrote the lion of the nile my dear sir that is something like overdone in bits it has a true thought and a true ring of language beg the anonymous from me to delete when he shall republish the two last verses and end on the lion of the nile one lampman has a good sonnet on a winter evening in i think the same number he seems ill named but i am tempted to hope a man is not always answerable for his name28 for instance you would think you knew mine no such matter it isat your service and mr scribners and that of all of the faithfulteriitera pray pronounce tayreetayra or gallic√© t√©rit√©ra       r l s  more when the mail shall come   i am an idiot i want to be clear on one point some of holes drawings must of course be too late and yet they seem to me so excellent i would fain have the lot complete it is one thing for you to pay for drawings which are to appear in that soulswallowing machine your magazine quite another if they are only to illustrate a volume i wish you to take a brisk even a fiery decision on the point and let hole know to resume my desultory song i desire you would carry the same fire hereinbefore suggested into your decision on the wrong box for in my present state of benighted ignorance as to my affairs for the last seven monthsi know not even whether my house or my mothers house have been leti desire to see something definite in front of meoutside the lot of palace doorkeeper i believe the said wrong box is a real lark in which of course i may be grievously deceived but the typewriter is with me i may also be deceived as to the numbers of the master now going and already gone but to me they seem first chop sir first chop i hope i shall pull off that damned ending but it still depresses me this is your doing mr burlingame you would have it there and then and i fear iti fear that ending       r l s     to charles baxter        honolulu february 8th 1889  my dear charleshere we are at honolulu and have dismissed the yacht and lie here till april anyway in a fine state of haze which i am yet in hopes some letter of yours still on the way may dissipate no money and not one word as to money however i have got the yacht paid off in triumph i think and though we stay here impignorate it should not be for long even if you bring us no extra help from home the cruise has been a great success both as to matter fun and health and yet lord man were pleased to be ashore yon was a very fine voyage from tahiti up here butthe dry lands a fine place too and we dont mind squalls any longer and eh man thats a great thing blow blow thou wintry wind thou hast done me no appreciable harm beyond a few grey hairs altogether this foolhardy venture is achieved and if i have but nine months of life and any kind of health i shall have both eaten my cake and got it back again with usury but man there have been days when i felt guilty and thought i was in no position for the head of a house  your letter and accounts are doubtless at s f and will reach me in course my wife is no great shakes she is the one who has suffered most my mother has had a huge old time lloyd is first chop i so well that i do not know myselfseabathing if you please and what is far more dangerous entertaining and being entertained by his majesty here who is a very fine intelligent fellow but o charles what a crop for the drink he carries it too like a mountain with a sparrow on its shoulders we calculated five bottles of champagne in three hours and a half afternoon and the sovereign quite presentable although perceptibly more dignified at the end  the extraordinary health i enjoy and variety of interests i find among these islands would tempt me to remain here only for lloyd who is not well placed in such countries for a permanency and a little for colvin to whom i feel i owe a sort of filial duty and these two considerations will no doubt bring me backto go to bed againin englandyours ever affectionately       r l s     to r a m stevenson     honolulu hawaiian islands february 1889  my dear bobmy extremely foolhardy venture is practically over how foolhardy it was i dont think i realised we had a very small schooner and like most yachts overrigged and oversparred and like many american yachts on a very dangerous sail plan the waters we sailed in are of course entirely unlighted and very badly charted in the dangerous archipelago through which we were fools enough to go we were perfectly in ignorance of where we were for a whole night and half the next day and this in the midst of invisible islands and rapid and variable currents and we were lucky when we found our whereabouts at last we have twice had all we wanted in the way of squalls once as i came on deck i found the green sea over the cockpit coamings and running down the companion like a brook to meet me at that same moment the foresail sheet jammed and the captain had no knife this was the only occasion on the cruise that ever i set a hand to a rope but i worked like a trojan judging the possibility of hemorrhage better than the certainty of drowning another time i saw a rather singular thing our whole ships company as pale as paper from the captain to the cook we had a black squall astern on the port side and a white squall ahead to starboard the complication passed off innocuous the black squall only fetching us with its tail and the white one slewing off somewhere else twice we were a long while days in the close vicinity of hurricane weather but again luck prevailed and we saw none of it these are dangers incident to these seas and small craft what was an amazement and at the same time a powerful stroke of luck both our masts were rotten and we found it outi was going to say in time but it was stranger and luckier than that the head of the mainmast hung over so that hands were afraid to go to the helm and less than three weeks beforei am not sure it was more than a fortnightwe had been nearly twelve hours beating off the lee shore of eimeo or moorea next island to tahiti in half a gale of wind with a violent head sea she would neither tack nor wear once and had to be boxed off with the mainsailyou can imagine what an ungodly show of kites we carriedand yet the mast stood the very day after that in the southern bight of tahiti we had a near squeak the wind suddenly coming calm the reefs were close in with my eye what a surf the pilot thought we were gone and the captain had a boat cleared when a lucky squall came to our rescue my wife hearing the order given about the boats remarked to my mother isnt that nice we shall soon be ashore thus does the female mind unconsciously skirt along the verge of eternity our voyage up here was most disastrouscalms squalls head sea waterspouts of rain hurricane weather all about and we in the midst of the hurricane season when even the hopeful builder and owner of the yacht had pronounced these seas unfit for her we ran out of food and were quite given up for lost in honolulu people had ceased to speak to belle29 about the casco as a deadly subject  but the perils of the deep were part of the programme and though i am very glad to be done with them for a while and comfortably ashore where a squall does not matter a snuff to any one i feel pretty sure i shall want to get to sea again ere long the dreadful risk i took was financial and doubleheaded first i had to sink a lot of money in the cruise and if i didnt get health how was i to get it back i have got health to a wonderful extent and as i have the most interesting matter for my book bar accidents i ought to get all i have laid out and a profit but second what i own i never considered till too late there was the danger of collisions of damages and heavy repairs of disablement towing and salvage indeed the cruise might have turned round and cost me double nor will this danger be quite over till i hear the yacht is in san francisco for though i have shaken the dust of her deck from my feet i fear as a point of law she is still mine till she gets there  from my point of view up to now the cruise has been a wonderful success i never knew the world was so amusing on the last voyage we had grown so used to sealife that no one wearied though it lasted a full month except fanny who is always ill all the time our visits to the islands have been more like dreams than realities the people the life the beachcombers the old stories and songs i have picked up so interesting the climate the scenery and in some places the women so beautiful the women are handsomest in tahiti the men in the marquesas both as fine types as can be imagined lloyd reminds me i have not told you one characteristic incident of the cruise from a seminaval point of view one night we were going ashore in anaho bay the most awful noise on deck the breakers distinctly audible in the cabin and there i had to sit below entertaining in my best style a negroid native chieftain much the worse for rum you can imagine the evenings pleasure  this naval report on cruising in the south seas would be incomplete without one other trait on our voyage up here i came one day into the diningroom the hatch in the floor was open the ships boy was below with a baler and two of the hands were carrying buckets as for a fire this meant that the pumps had ceased working  one stirring day was that in which we sighted hawaii it blew fair but very strong we carried jib foresail and mainsail all singlereefed and she carried her lee rail under water and flew the swell the heaviest i have ever been out ini tried in vain to estimate the height at least fifteen feetcame tearing after us about a point and a half off the wind we had the best handold louisat the wheel and really he did nobly and had noble luck for it never caught us once at times it seemed we must have it old louis would look over his shoulder with the queerest look and dive down his neck into his shoulders and then it missed us somehow and only sprays came over our quarter turning the little outside lane of deck into a mill race as deep as to the cockpit coamings i never remember anything more delightful and exciting pretty soon after we were lying absolutely becalmed under the lee of hawaii of which we had been warned and the captain never confessed he had done it on purpose but when accused he smiled really i suppose he did quite right for we stood committed to a dangerous race and to bring her to the wind would have been rather a heartsickening manoeuvre       r l s     to marcel schwob      at honolulu stevenson found awaiting him among the accumulations of    the mailbag two letters of friendly homagethe first i think he    had received from any foreign confr√®readdressed to him by the    distinguished young french scholar and man of letters m marcel    schwob since deceased       honolulu sandwich islands february 8th 1889  dear siri thank youfrom the midst of such a flurry as you can imagine with seven months accumulated correspondence on my tablefor your two friendly and clever letters pray write me again i shall be home in may or june and not improbably shall come to paris in the summer then we can talk or in the interval i may be able to write which is today out of the question pray take a word from a man of crushing occupations and count it as a volume your little conte is delightful ah yes you are right i love the eighteenth century and so do you and have not listened to its voice in vainthe hunted one       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter        honolulu 8th march 1889  my dear charlesat last i have the accounts the doer has done excellently and in the words of  i reciprocate every step of your behaviour i send a letter for bob in your care as i dont know his liverpool address30 by which for he is to show you part of it you will see we have got out of this adventureor hope to havewith wonderful fortune i have the retrospective horrors on me when i think of the liabilities i incurred but thank god i think im in port again and i have found one climate in which i can enjoy life even honolulu is too cold for me but the south isles were a heaven upon earth to a puir catarrhal party like johnsone we think as tahiti is too complete a banishment to try madeira its only a week from england good communications and i suspect in climate and scenery not unlike our dear islands in people alas there can be no comparison but friends could go and i could come in summer so i should not be quite cut off  lloyd and i have finished a story the wrong box if it is not funny i am sure i do not know what is i have split over writing it since i have been here i have been toiling like a galley slave three numbers of the master to rewrite five chapters of the wrong box to write and rewrite and about five hundred lines of a narrative poem to write rewrite and rerewrite now i have the master waiting me for its continuation two numbers more when thats done i shall breathe this spasm of activity has been chequered with champagne parties happy and glorious hawaii ponoi paua kou moinative hawaiians dote upon your monarch hawaiian god save the king in addition to my other labours i am learning the language with a native moonshee kalakaua is a terrible companion a bottle of fizz is like a glass of

robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      illhealth and pressing preoccupations together with uncertainty as    to when and where letters would reach him had kept me from writing    during the previous autumn and winter       honolulu march 1889  my dear colvinstill not a word from you i am utterly cast down but i will try to return good for evil and for once give you news we are here in the suburb of honolulu in a rambling house or set of houses in a great garden  illustration a a a stairs up to balcony  1 lloyds room 2 my mothers room 3 a room kept dark for photographs 4 the kitchen 5 balcony 6 the lanai an open room or summer parlour partly surrounded with venetian shutters in part quite open which is the livingroom 7 a crazy dirty cottage used for the arts 8 another crazy dirty cottage where fanny and i live the town is some three miles away but the house is connected by telephone with the chief shops and the tramway runs to within a quarter of a mile of us i find honolulu a beastly climate after tahiti and have been in bed a little but my colds took on no catarrhal symptom which is staggeringly delightful i am studying hawaiian with a native a mr joseph poepoe a clever fellow too the tongue is a little bewildering i am reading a pretty story in nativeno really it is pretty although wandering and wordy highly pretty with its continual traffic from one isle to another of the soothsayer pursuing rainbows fanny is i think a good deal better on the whole having profited like me by the tropics my mother and lloyd are firstrate i do not think i have heard from you since last may certainly not since june and this really frightens me do write even now scribners sons it should be we shall probably be out of this some time in april home some time in june but the world whirls to me perceptibly a mass of times and seasons and places and engagements and seas to cross and continents to traverse so that i scarce know where i am well i have had a brave time et ego in arcadiathough i dont believe arcadia was a spot upon tahiti i have written another long narrative poem the song of rahero privately i think it good but your ominous silence over the feast of famine leads me to fear we shall not be agreed is it possible i have wounded you in some way i scarce like to dream that it is possible and yet i know too well it may be so if so dont write and you can pitch into me when we meet i am admittedly as mild as london stout now and the old man virulent much a creature of the past my dear colvin i owe you and fleeming jenkin the two older men who took the trouble and knew how to make a friend of me everything that i have or am if i have behaved ill just hold on and give me a chance you shall have the slanging of me and i bet i shall prefer it to this silenceever my dear colvin your most affectionate       r l s     mrs r l stevenson to mrs sitwell      this letter brought to friends in england the first news of the    intended prolongation of the cruise among the remoter islands of the    pacific       honolulu towards the end of march 1889  my dear friendlouis has improved so wonderfully in the delicious islands of the south seas that we think of trying yet one more voyage we are a little uncertain as to how we shall go whether in a missionary ship or by hiring schooners from point to point but the unregenerate islands we must see i suppose we shall be off some time in june which will fetch us back to england in another years time you could hardly believe it if you could see louis now he looks as well as he ever did in his life and has had no sign of cough or hemorrhage begging pardon of nemesis for many months it seems a pity to return to england until his health is firmly reestablished and also a pity not to see all that we can see quite easily starting from this place and which will be our only opportunity in life of course there is the usual risk from hostile natives and the horrible sea but a positive risk is so much more wholesome than a negative one and it is all such joy to louis and lloyd as for me i hate the sea and am afraid of it though no one will believe that because in time of danger i do not make an outcrynevertheless i am afraid of it and it is not kind to me but i love the tropic weather and the wild people and to see my two boys so happy mrs stevenson is going back to scotland in may as she does not like to be longer away from her old sister who has been very ill and besides we do not feel justified in taking her to the sort of places we intend to visit as for me i can get comfort out of very rough surroundings for my people i can work hard and enjoy it i can even shoot pretty well and though i dont want to fight by jingo if i must why i can i dont suppose there will be any occasion for that sort of thingonly in case  i am not quite sure of the names but i think our new cruise includes the gilberts the fijis and the solomons a letter might go from the fijis louis will write the particulars of which i am not sure as for myself i have had more cares than i was really fit for to keep house on a yacht is no easy thing when louis and i broke loose from the ship and lived alone amongst the natives i got on very well it was when i was deathly seasick and the question was put to me by the cook what shall we have for the cabin dinner what for tomorrows breakfast what for lunch and what about the sailors food please come and look at the biscuits for the weevils have got into them and show me how to make yeast that will rise of itself and smell the pork which seems pretty high and give me directions about making a pudding with molassesand what is to be done about the bugsetc etc in the midst of heavy dangerous weather when i was lying on the floor clutching a basin down comes the mate with a cracked head and i must needs cut off the hair matted with blood wash and dress the wound and administer restoratives i do not like being the lady of the yacht but ashore o then i felt i was repaid for all i wonder did any of my letters from beautiful tautira ever come to hand with the descriptions of our life with louiss adopted brother ori a ori ori wrote to us if no one else did and i mean to give you a translation of his letter it begins with our native names        tautira 26 dec 1888  to teriitera louis and tapina tutu myself and aromaiterai lloyd and teiriha mrs stevenson salutation in the true jesus  i make you to know my great affection at the hour when you left us i was filled with tears my wife rui tehini also and all of my household when you embarked i felt a great sorrow it is for this that i went upon the road and you looked from that ship and i looked at you on the ship with great grief until you had raised the anchor and hoisted the sails when the ship started i ran along the beach to see you still and when you were on the open sea i cried out to you farewell louis and when i was coming back to my house i seemed to hear your voice crying rui farewell afterwards i watched the ship as long as i could until the night fell and when it was dark i said to myself if i had wings i should fly to the ship to meet you and to sleep amongst you so that i might be able to come back to shore and to tell rui tehini i have slept upon the ship of teriitera after that we passed that night in the impatience of grief towards eight oclock i seemed to hear your voice teriiteraruihere is the hour for putter and tiro cheese and syrup i did not sleep that night thinking continually of you my very dear friend until the morning being then awake i went to see tapina tutu on her bed and alas she was not there afterwards i looked into your rooms they did not please me as they used to do i did not hear your voice crying hail rui i thought then that you had gone and that you had left me rising up i went to the beach to see your ship and i could not see it i wept then till the night telling myself continually teriitera returns into his own country and leaves his dear rui in grief so that i suffer for him and weep for him i will not forget you in my memory here is the thought i desire to meet you again it is my dear teriitera makes the only riches i desire in this world it is your eyes that i desire to see again it must be that your body and my body shall eat together at our table there is what would make my heart content but now we are separated may god be with you all may his word and his mercy go with you so that you may be well and we also according to the words of paul    ori a ori that is to say rui   after reading this to me louis has left in tears saying that he is not worthy that such a letter should be written to him we hope to so manage that we shall stop at tahiti and see rui once more i tell myself that pleasant story when i wake in the night  i find my head swimming so that i cannot write any more i wish some rich catholic would send a parlour organ to p√®re bruno of tautira i am going to try and save money to do it myself but he may die before i have enough i feel ashamed to be sitting here when i think of that old man who cannot draw because of scriveners paralysis who has no one year in and year out to speak to but natives our rui is a protestant not bigoted like the rest of thembut still a protestant and the only pastime he has is playing on an old broken parlour organ whose keys are mostly dumb i know no more pathetic figure have you no rich catholic friends who would send him an organ that he could play upon of course i am talking nonsense and yet i know somewhere that person exists if only i knew the place  our dearest love to you all       fanny     to henry james        honolulu march 1889  my dear jamesyesi own upi am untrue to friendship and what is less but still considerable to civilisation i am not coming home for another year there it is cold and bald and now you wont believe in me at all and serve me right says you and the devil take me but look here and judge me tenderly i have had more fun and pleasure of my life these past months than ever before and more health than any time in ten long years and even here in honolulu i have withered in the cold and this precious deep is filled with islands which we may still visit and though the sea is a deathful place i like to be there and like squalls when they are over and to draw near to a new island i cannot say how much i like in short i take another year of this sort of life and mean to try to work down among the poisoned arrows and mean if it may be to come back again when the thing is through and converse with henry james as heretofore and in the meanwhile issue directions to h j to write to me once more let him address here at honolulu for my views are vague and if it is sent here it will follow and find me if i am to be found and if i am not to be found the man james will have done his duty and we shall be at the bottom of the sea where no postoffice clerk can be expected to discover us or languishing on a coral island the philosophic drudges of some barbarian potentate perchance of an american missionary my wife has just sent to mrs sitwell a translation tant bien que mal of a letter i have had from my chief friend in this part of the world go and see her and get a hearing of it it will do you good it is a better method of correspondence than even henry jamess i jest but seriously it is a strange thing for a tough sick middleaged scrivener like r l s to receive a letter so conceived from a man fifty years old a leading politician a crack orator and the great wit of his village boldly say the highly popular mp of tautira my nineteenth century strikes here and lies alongside of something beautiful and ancient i think the receipt of such a letter might humble shall i say even  and for me i would rather have received it than written redgauntlet or the sixth √Üneid all told if my books have enabled or helped me to make this voyage to know rui and to have received such a letter they have in the old prefatorial expression not been writ in vain it would seem from this that i have been not so much humbled as puffed up but i assure you i have in fact been both a little of what that letter says is my own earning not all but yet a little and the little makes me proud and all the rest ashamed and in the contrast how much more beautiful altogether is the ancient man than him of today  well well henry james is pretty good though he is of the nineteenth century and that glaringly and to curry favour with him i wish i could be more explicit but indeed i am still of necessity extremely vague and cannot tell what i am to do nor where i am to go for some while yet as soon as i am sure you shall hear all are fairly wellthe wife your countrywoman least of all troubles are not entirely wanting but on the whole we prosper and we are all affectionately yours       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        honolulu april 2nd 1889  my dear colvini am beginning to be ashamed of writing on to you without the least acknowledgment like a tramp but i do not carei am hardened and whatever be the cause of your silence i mean to write till all is blue i am outright ashamed of my news which is that we are not coming home for another year i cannot but hope it may continue the vast improvement of my health i think it good for fanny and lloyd and we have all a taste for this wandering and dangerous life my mother i send home to my relief as this part of our cruise will be if we can carry it out rather difficult in places here is the idea about the middle of june unless the boston board objects we sail from honolulu in the missionary ship barquentine auxiliary steamer morning star she takes us through the gilberts and marshalls and drops us this is my great idea on ponape one of the volcanic islands of the carolines here we stay marooned among a doubtful population with a spanish vicegovernor and five native kings and a sprinkling of missionaries all at loggerheads on the chance of fetching a passage to sydney in a trader a labour ship or maybe but this appears too bright a ship of war if we cant get the morning star and the board has many reasons that i can see for refusing its permission i mean to try to fetch fiji hire a schooner there do the fijis and friendlies hit the course of the richmond at tonga tabu make back by tahiti and so to s f and home perhaps in june 1890 for the latter part of the cruise will likely be the same in either case you can see for yourself how much variety and adventure this promises and that it is not devoid of danger at the best but if we can pull it off in safety gives me a fine book of travel and lloyd a fine lecture and diorama which should vastly better our finances  i feel as if i were untrue to friendship believe me colvin when i look forward to this absence of another year my conscience sinks at thought of the monument but i think you will pardon me if you consider how much this tropical weather mends my health remember me as i was at home and think of me seabathing and walking about as jolly as a sandboy you will own the temptation is strong and as the scheme bar fatal accidents is bound to pay into the bargain sooner or later it seems it would be madness to come home now with an imperfect book no illustrations to speak of no diorama and perhaps fall sick again by autumn i do not think i delude myself when i say the tendency to catarrh has visibly diminished  it is a singular thing that as i was packing up old papers ere i left skerryvore i came on the prophecies of a drunken highland sibyl when i was seventeen she said i was to be very happy to visit america and to be much upon the sea it seems as if it were coming true with a vengeance also do you remember my strong old rooted belief that i shall die by drowning i dont want that to come true though it is an easy death but it occurs to me oddly with these long chances in front i cannot say why i like the sea no man is more cynically and constantly alive to its perils i regard it as the highest form of gambling and yet i love the sea as much as i hate gambling fine clean emotions a world all and always beautiful air better than wine interest unflagging there is upon the whole no better lifeyours ever       r l s     to e l burlingame        honolulu april 1889  my dear burlingamethis is to announce the most prodigious change of programme i have seen so much of the south seas that i desire to see more and i get so much health here that i dread a return to our vile climates i have applied accordingly to the missionary folk to let me go round in the morning star and if the boston board should refuse i shall get somehow to fiji hire a trading schooner and see the fijis and friendlies and samoa he would be a south seayer mr burlingame of course if i go in the morning star i see all the eastern or western islands  before i sail i shall make out to let you have the last of the master though i tell you it sticksand i hope to have had some proofs forbye of the verses anyway and now to business  i want if you can find them in the british sixpenny edition if not in some equally compact and portable shapeseaside library for instancethe waverley novels entire or as entire as you can get em and the following of marryat phantom ship peter simple percival keene privateersman children of the new forest frank mildmay newton forster dog fiend snarleyyow also midshipman easy kingsburn carlyles french revolution motleys dutch republic langs letters on literature a complete set of my works jenkin in duplicate also familiar studies ditto  i have to thank you for the accounts which are satisfactory indeed and for the cheque for 1000 another account will have come and gone before i see you i hope it will be equally roseate in colour i am quite worked out and this cursed end of the master hangs over me like the arm of the gallows but it is always darkest before dawn and no doubt the clouds will soon rise but it is a difficult thing to write above all in mackellarese and i cannot yet see my way clear if i pull this off the master will be a pretty good novel or i am the more deceived and even if i dont pull if off itll still have some stuff in it  we shall remain here until the middle of june anyway but my mother leaves for europe early in may hence our mail should continue to come here but not hers i will let you know my next address which will probably be sydney if we get on the morning star i propose at present to get marooned on ponape and take my chance of getting a passage to australia it will leave times and seasons mighty vague and the cruise is risky but i shall know something of the south seas when it is done or else the south seas will contain all there is of me it should give me a fine book of travels anyway  low will probably come and ask some dollars of you pray let him have them they are for outfit o another complete set of my books should go to captain a h otis care of dr merritt yacht casco oakland calin haste       r l s     to miss adelaide boodle        honolulu april 6th 1889  my dear miss boodlenobody writes a better letter than my gamekeeper so gay so pleasant so engagingly particular answering by some delicate instinct all the questions she suggests it is a shame you should get such a poor return as i can make from a mind essentially and originally incapable of the art epistolary i would let the papercutter take my place but i am sorry to say the little wooden seaman did after the manner of seamen and deserted in the societies the place he seems to have stayed atseems for his absence was not observed till we were near the equatorwas tautira and i assure you he displayed good taste tautira being as nigh hand heaven as a papercutter or anybody has a right to expect  i think all our friends will be very angry with us and i give the grounds of their probable displeasure bluntlywe are not coming home for another year my mother returns next month fanny lloyd and i push on again among the islands on a trading schooner the equatorfirst for the gilbert group which we shall have an opportunity to explore thoroughly then if occasion serve to the marshalls and carolines and if occasion or money fail to samoa and back to tahiti i own we are deserters but we have excuses you cannot conceive how these climates agree with the wretched houseplant of skerryvore he wonders to find himself seabathing and cutting about the world loose like a grownup person they agree with fanny too who does not suffer from her rheumatism and with lloyd also and the interest of the islands is endless and the sea though i own it is a fearsome place is very delightful we had applied for places in the american missionary ship the morning star but this trading schooner is a far preferable idea giving us more time and a thousandfold more liberty so we determined to cut off the missionaries with a shilling  the sandwich islands do not interest us very much we live here oppressed with civilisation and look for good things in the future but it would surprise you if you came out tonight from honolulu all shining with electric lights and all in a bustle from the arrival of the mail which is to carry you these lines and crossed the long wooden causeway along the beach and came out on the road through kapiolani park and seeing a gate in the palings with a tub of goldfish by the wayside entered casually in the buildings stand in three groups by the edge of the beach where an angry little spitfire sea continually spirts and thrashes with impotent irascibility the big seas breaking further out upon the reef the first is a small house with a very large summer parlour or lanai as they call it here roofed but practically open there you will find the lamps burning and the family sitting about the table dinner just done my mother my wife lloyd belle my wifes daughter austin her child and tonight by way of rarity a guest all about the walls our south sea curiosities war clubs idols pearl shells stone axes etc and the walls are only a small part of a lanai the rest being glazed or latticed windows or mere open space you will see there no sign of the squire however and being a person of a humane disposition you will only glance in over the balcony railing at the merrymakers in the summer parlour and proceed further afield after the exile you look round there is beautiful green turf many trees of an outlandish sort that drop thornslook out if your feet are bare but i beg your pardon you have not been long enough in the south seasand many oleanders in full flower the next group of buildings is ramshackle and quite dark you make out a coachhouse door and look inonly some cocoanuts you try round to the left and come to the sea front where venus and the moon are making luminous tracks on the water and a great swell rolls and shines on the outer reef and here is another doorall these places open from the outsideand you go in and find photography tubs of water negatives steeping a tap and a chair and an inkbottle where my wife is supposed to write round a little further a third door entering which you find a picture upon the easel and a table sticky with paints a fourth door admits you to a sort of court where there is a hen sittingi believe on a fallacious egg no sign of the squire in all this but right opposite the studio door you have observed a third little house from whose open door lamplight streams and makes hay of the strong moonlight shadows you had supposed it made no part of the grounds for a fence runs round it lined with oleander but as the squire is nowhere else is it not just possible he may be here it is a grim little wooden shanty cobwebs bedeck it friendly mice inhabit its recesses the mailed cockroach walks upon the wall so also i regret to say the scorpion herein are two pallet beds two mosquito curtains strung to the pitchboards of the roof two tables laden with books and manuscripts three chairs and in one of the beds the squire busy writing to yourself as it chances and just at this moment somewhat bitten by mosquitoes he has just set fire to the insect powder and will be all right in no time but just now he contemplates large white blisters and would like to scratch them but knows better the house is not bare it has been inhabited by kanakas andyou know what children arethe bare wood walls are pasted over with pages from the graphic harpers weekly etc the floor is matted and i am bound to say the matting is filthy there are two windows and two doors one of which is condemned on the panels of that last a sheet of paper is pinned up and covered with writing i cull a few plums    a duckhammock for each person    a patent organ like the commandants at taiohae    cheap and bad cigars for presents    revolvers    permanganate of potass    liniment for the head and sulphur    fine toothcomb  what do you think this is simply life in the south seas foreshortened these are a few of our desiderata for the next trip which we jot down as they occur  there i have really done my best and tried to send something like a letterone letter in return for all your dozens pray remember us all to yourself mrs boodle and the rest of your house i do hope your mother will be better when this comes i shall write and give you a new address when i have made up my mind as to the most probable and i do beg you will continue to write from time to time and give us airs from home tomorrowthink of iti must be off by a quarter to eight to drive in to the palace and breakfast with his hawaiian majesty at 830 i shall be dead indeed please give my news to scott i trust he is better give him my warm regards to you we all send all kinds of things and i am the absentee squire       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter        honolulu april 1889  my dear charlesas usual your letter is as good as a cordial and i thank you for it and all your care kindness and generous and thoughtful friendship from my heart i was truly glad to hear a word of colvin whose long silence has terrified me and glad to hear that you condoned the notion of my staying longer in the south seas for i have decided in that sense the first idea was to go in the morning star missionary ship but now i have found a trading schooner the equator which is to call for me here early in june and carry us through the gilberts what will happen then the lord knows my mother does not accompany us she leaves here for home early in may and you will hear of us from her but not i imagine anything more definite we shall get dumped on butaritari and whether we manage to go on to the marshalls and carolines or whether we fall back on samoa heaven must decide but i mean to fetch back into the course of the richmondto think you dont know what the richmond isthe steamer of the eastern south seas joining new zealand tongatabu the samoas taheite and rarotonga and carrying by last advices sheep in the salooninto the course of the richmond and make tahiti again on the home track would i like to see the scots observer wouldnt i not but whaur im direckit at space they have nae post offishes at the gilberts and as for the carlines ye see mr baxter were no just in the punkshewal centre o civlisation but pile them up for me and when ive decided on an address ill let you ken and yell can send them stavin after meever your affectionate       r l s     to charles baxter      the reference in the first paragraph is to the publication in the    press which mr baxter had permitted of one of stevensons letters    written during the earlier part of his voyage r l s had    remonstrated always greatly disliking the publication of private    letters during the writers lifetime and now writes to soften the    effect of his remonstrance       honolulu 10th may 1889  my dear charlesi am appalled to gather from your last just to hand that you have felt so much concern about the letter pray dismiss it from your mind but i think you scarce appreciate how disagreeable it is to have your private affairs and private unguarded expressions getting into print it would soon sicken any one of writing letters i have no doubt that letter was very wisely selected but it just shows how things crop up there was a raging jealousy between the two yachts our captain was nearly in a fight over it however no more and whatever you think my dear fellow do not suppose me angry with you or  although i was annoyed at the circumstancea very different thing but it is difficult to conduct life by letter and i continually feel i may be drifting into some matter of offence in which my heart takes no part  i must now turn to a point of business this new cruise of ours is somewhat venturesome and i think it needful to warn you not to be in a hurry to suppose us dead in these illcharted seas it is quite on the cards we might be cast on some unvisited or very rarely visited island that there we might lie for a long time even years unheard of and yet turn up smiling at the hinder end so do not let me be rowpit till you get some certainty we have gone to davie jones in a squall or graced the feast of some barbarian in the character of long pig  i have just been a week away alone on the lee coast of hawaii the only white creature in many miles riding five and a half hours one day living with a native seeing four lepers shipped off to molokai hearing native causes and giving my opinion as amicus curi√¶ as to the interpretation of a statute in english a lovely week among gods bestat least gods sweetest workspolynesians it has bettered me greatly if i could only stay there the time that remains i could get my work done and be happy but the care of my family keeps me in vile honolulu where i am always out of sorts amidst heat and cold and cesspools and beastly haoles31 what is a haole you are one and so i am sorry to say am i after so long a dose of whites it was a blessing to get among polynesians again even for a week  well charles there are waur haoles than yoursel ill say that for ye and trust before i sail i shall get another letter with more about yourselfever your affectionate friend       r l s     to w h low      the allusions in the latter half of this letter are to the departure    for europe of the young hawaiian princess kaiulani see the poem    beginning when from her land to mine she goes in songs of    travel and to the circumstances of the great hurricane at apia on    march 15th 1889       honolulu about 20th may 89  my dear low  the goods have come many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them alli have at length finished the master it has been a sore cross to me but now he is buried his bodys under hatcheshis soul if there is any hell to go to gone to hell and i forgive him it is harder to forgive burlingame for having induced me to begin the publication or myself for suffering the inductionyes i think hole has done finely it will be one of the most adequately illustrated books of our generation he gets the note he tells the storymy story i know only one failurethe master standing on the beachyou must have a letter for me at sydneytill further notice remember me to mrs will h the godlike sculptor and any of the faithful if you want to cease to be a republican see my little kaiulani as she goes throughbut she is gone already you will die a red i wear the colours of that little royal maiden nous allons chanter √† la ronde si vous voulez only she is not blonde by several chalks though she is but a halfblood and the wrong half edinburgh scots like mysel but o low i love the polynesian this civilisation of ours is a dingy ungentlemanly business it drops out too much of man and too much of that the very beauty of the poor beast who has his beauties in spite of zola and co as usual here is a whole letter with no news i am a bloodless inhuman dog and no doubt zola is a better correspondentlong live your fine old english admiralyours i meanthe usa one at samoa i wept tears and loved myself and mankind when i read of him he is not too much civilised and there was gordon too and there are others beyond question but if you could live the only white folk in a polynesian village and drink that warm light vin du pays of human affection and enjoy that simple dignity of all about youi will not gush for i am now in my fortieth year which seems highly unjust but there it is mr low and the lord enlighten your affectionate       r l s     mrs r l stevenson to sidney colvin      this letter shows the writer in her character of wise and anxious    critic of her husbands work the result in the judgment of most of    his friends went far to justify her misgivings       honolulu may 21st 1889  best of friendsit was a joy inexpressible to get a word from you at last fortunately for our peace of mind we were almost positive that your letters had been sent to the places we had already left still it was a bitter disappointment to get nothing from you when we arrived here i wish you could have seen us both throwing over the immense package of letters searching for your handwriting now that we know you have been ill please do let some one send us a line to our next address telling us how you are what that next address may be we do not yet know as our final movements are a little uncertain to begin with a trading schooner the equator will come along some time in the first part of june lie outside the harbour here and signal to us within fortyeight hours we shall pack up our possessions our barrel of sauer kraut our barrel of salt onions our bag of cocoanuts our native garments our tobacco fish hooks red combs and turkey red calicoes all the latter for trading purposes our hand organ photograph and painting materials and finally our magic lanternall these upon a large whaleboat and go out to the equator lloyd also takes a fiddle a guitar a native instrument something like a banjo called a taropatch fiddle and a lot of song books we shall be carried first to one of the gilberts landing at butaritari the equator is going about amongst the gilbert group and we have the right to keep her over when we like within reasonable limits finally she will leave us and we shall have to take the chances of what happens next we hope to see the marshalls the carolines the fijis tonga and samoa also other islands that i do not remember perhaps staying a little while in sydney and stopping on our way home to see our friends in tahiti and the marquesas i am very much exercised by one thing louis has the most enchanting material that any one ever had in the whole world for his book and i am afraid he is going to spoil it all he has taken into his scotch stevenson head that a stern duty lies before him and that his book must be a sort of scientific and historical impersonal thing comparing the different languages of which he knows nothing really and the different peoples the object being to settle the question as to whether they are of common malay origin or not also to compare the protestant and catholic missions etc and the whole thing to be impersonal leaving out all he knows of the people themselves and i believe there is no one living who has got so near to them or who understands them as he does think of a small treatise on the polynesian races being offered to people who are dying to hear about ori a ori the making of brothers with cannibals the strange stories they told and the extraordinary adventures that befell ussuppose herman melville had given us his theories as to the polynesian language and the probable good or evil results of the missionary influence instead of omoo and typee or kinglake32 instead of eothen louis says it is a stern sense of duty that is at the bottom of it which is more alarming than anything else i am so sure that you will agree with me that i am going to ask you to throw the weight of your influence as heavily as possible in the scales with me please refer to the matter in the letters we shall receive at our first stopping place otherwise louis will spend a great deal of time in sydney actually reading up other peoples books on the islands what a thing it is to have a man of genius to deal with it is like managing an overbred horse why with my own feeble hand i could write a book that the whole world would jump at please keep any letters of mine that contain any incidents of our wanderings they are very exact as to facts and louis may in this conscientious state of mind indeed i am afraid he has put nothing in his diary but statistics even if i thought it a desirable thing to write what he proposes i should still think it impossible unless after we had lived and studied here some twenty years or more  now i am done with my complaining and shall turn to the pleasanter paths louis went to one of the other islands a couple of weeks ago quite alone got drenched with rain and surf rode over mountain pathsfive and a half hours one dayand came back none the worse for it today he goes to molokai the leper island he never has a sign of hemorrhage the air cushion is a thing of the past and altogether he is a new man how he will do in the english climate again i do not know but in these latitudes he is very nearly a well man nothing seems to do him harm but overwork that of course is sometimes difficult to prevent now however the master is done we have enough money to go upon and there is no need to work at all i must stop my dear love to you all       fanny v de g stevenson     to mrs r l stevenson      the following two letters were written during and immediately after    stevensons trip to the noted leper settlement the scene of father    damiens labours at molokai       kalawao molokai may 1889  dear fannyi had a lovely sail up captain cameron and mr gilfillan both born in the states yet the first still with a strong highland and the second still with a strong lowland accent were good company the night was warm the victuals plain but good mr gilfillan gave me his berth and i slept well though i heard the sisters sick in the next stateroom poor souls heavy rolling woke me in the morning i turned in all standing so went right on the upper deck the day was on the peep out of a low morning bank and we were wallowing along under stupendous cliffs as the lights brightened we could see certain abutments and buttresses on their front where wood clustered and grass grew brightly but the whole brow seemed quite impassable and my heart sank at the sight two thousand feet of rock making 19¬∞ the captain guesses seemed quite beyond my powers however i had come so far and to tell you the truth i was so cowed with fear and disgust that i dared not go back on the adventure in the interests of my own selfrespect presently we came up with the leper promontory lowland quite bare and bleak and harsh a little town of wooden houses two churches a landingstair all unsightly sour northerly lying athwart the sunrise with the great wall of the pali cutting the world out on the south our lepers were sent on the first boat about a dozen one poor child very horrid one white man leaving a large grown family behind him in honolulu and then into the second stepped the sisters and myself i do not know how it would have been with me had the sisters not been there my horror of the horrible is about my weakest point but the moral loveliness at my elbow blotted all else out and when i found that one of them was crying poor soul quietly under her veil i cried a little myself then i felt as right as a trivet only a little crushed to be there so uselessly i thought it was a sin and a shame she should feel unhappy i turned round to her and said something like this ladies god himself is here to give you welcome im sure it is good for me to be beside you i hope it will be blessed to me i thank you for myself and the good you do me it seemed to cheer her up but indeed i had scarce said it when we were at the landingstairs and there was a great crowd hundreds of god save us pantomime masks in poor human flesh waiting to receive the sisters and the new patients  every hand was offered i had gloves but i had made up my mind on the boats voyage not to give my hand that seemed less offensive than the gloves so the sisters and i went up among that crew and presently i got aside for i felt i had no business there and set off on foot across the promontory carrying my wrap and the camera all horror was quite gone from me to see these dread creatures smile and look happy was beautiful on my way through kalaupapa i was exchanging cheerful alohas with the patients coming galloping over on their horses i was stopping to gossip at housedoors i was happy only ashamed of myself that i was here for no good one woman was pretty and spoke good english and was infinitely engaging and in the old phrase towardly she thought i was the new white patient and when she found i was only a visitor a curious change came in her face and voicethe only sad thing morally sad i meanthat i met that morning but for all that they tell me none want to leave beyond kalaupapa the houses became rare dry stone dykes grassy stony land one sick pandanus a dreary country from overhead in the little clinging wood shogs of the pali chirruping of birds fell the low sun was right in my face the trade blew pure and cool and delicious i felt as right as ninepence and stopped and chatted with the patients whom i still met on their horses with not the least disgust about halfway over i met the superintendent a leper with a horse for me and o wasnt i glad but the horse was one of those curious dogged cranky brutes that always dully want to go somewhere else and my traffic with him completed my crushing fatigue i got to the guesthouse an empty house with several rooms kitchen bath etc there was no one there and i let the horse go loose in the garden lay down on the bed and fell asleep  dr swift woke me and gave me breakfast then i came back and slept again while he was at the dispensary and he woke me for dinner and i came back and slept again and he woke me about six for supper and then in about an hour i felt tired again and came up to my solitary guesthouse played the flageolet and am now writing to you as yet you see i have seen nothing of the settlement and my crushing fatigue though i believe that was moral and a measure of my cowardice and the doctors opinion make me think the pali hopeless you dont look a strong man said the doctor but are you sound i told him the truth then he said it was out of the question and if i were to get up at all i must be carried up but as it seems men as well as horses continually fall on this ascent the doctor goes up with a change of clothesit is plain that to be carried would in itself be very fatiguing to both mind and body and i should then be at the beginning of thirteen miles of mountain road to be ridden against time how should i come through i hope you will think me right in my decision i mean to stay and shall not be back in honolulu till saturday june first you must all do the best you can to make ready  dr swift has a wife and an infant son beginning to toddle and run and they live here as composed as brick and mortarat least the wife does a kentucky german a fine enough creature i believe who was quite amazed at the sisters shedding tears how strange is mankind gilfillan too a good fellow i think and far from a stupid kept up his hard lowland scottish talk in the boat while the sister was covering her face but i believe he knew and did it partly in embarrassment and part perhaps in mistaken kindness and that was one reason too why i made my speech to them partly too i did it because i was ashamed to do so and remembered one of my golden rules when you are ashamed to speak speak up at once but mind you that rule is only golden with strangers with your own folks there are other considerations this is a strange place to be in a bell has been sounded at intervals while i wrote now all is still but a musical humming of the sea not unlike the sound of telegraph wires the night is quite cool and pitch dark with a small fine rain one light over in the leper settlement one cricket whistling in the garden my lamp here by my bedside and my pen cheeping between my inky fingers  next day lovely morning slept all night 80¬∞ in the shade strong sweet anaho tradewind       louis     to sidney colvin        honolulu june 1889  my dear colvini am just home after twelve days journey to molokai seven of them at the leper settlement where i can only say that the sight of so much courage cheerfulness and devotion strung me too high to mind the infinite pity and horror of the sights i used to ride over from kalawao to kalaupapa about three miles across the promontory the cliffwall ivied with forest and yet inaccessible from steepness on my left go to the sisters home which is a miracle of neatness play a game of croquet with seven leper girls 90¬∞ in the shade got a little oldmaid meal served me by the sisters and ride home again tired enough but not too tired the girls have all dolls and love dressing them you who know so many ladies delicately clad and they who know so many dressmakers please make it known it would be an acceptable gift to send scraps for doll dressmaking to the reverend sister maryanne bishop home kalaupapa molokai hawaiian islands  i have seen sights that cannot be told and heard stories that cannot be repeated yet i never admired my poor race so much nor strange as it may seem loved life more than in the settlement a horror of moral beauty broods over the place thats like bad victor hugo but it is the only way i can express the sense that lived with me all these days and this even though it was in great part catholic and my sympathies flow never with so much difficulty as towards catholic virtues the passbook kept with heaven stirs me to anger and laughter one of the sisters calls the place the ticket office to heaven well what is the odds they do their darg and do it with kindness and efficiency incredible and we must take folks virtues as we find them and love the better part of old damien whose weaknesses and worse perhaps i heard fully i think only the more it was a european peasant dirty bigoted untruthful unwise tricky but superb with generosity residual candour and fundamental goodhumour convince him he had done wrong it might take hours of insult and he would undo what he had done and like his corrector better a man with all the grime and paltriness of mankind but a saint and hero all the more for that the place as regards scenery is grand gloomy and bleak mighty mountain walls descending sheer along the whole face of the island into a sea unusually deep the front of the mountain ivied and furred with clinging forest one viridescent cliff about halfway from east to west the low bare stony promontory edged in between the cliff and the ocean the two little towns kalawao and kalaupapa seated on either side of it as bare almost as bathing machines upon a beach and the populationgorgons and chimaeras dire all this tear of the nerves i bore admirably and the day after i got away rode twenty miles along the opposite coast and up into the mountains they call it twenty i am doubtful of the figures i should guess it nearer twelve but let me take credit for what residents allege and i was riding again the day after so i need say no more about health honolulu does not agree with me at all i am always out of sorts there with slight headache blood to the head etc i had a good deal of work to do and did it with miserable difficulty and yet all the time i have been gaining strength as you see which is highly encouraging by the time i am done with this cruise i shall have the material for a very singular book of travels names of strange stories and characters cannibals pirates ancient legends old polynesian poetrynever was so generous a farrago i am going down now to get the story of a shipwrecked family who were fifteen months on an island with a murderer there is a specimen the pacific is a strange place the nineteenth century only exists there in spots all round it is a no mans land of the ages a stirabout of epochs and races barbarisms and civilisations virtues and crimes  it is good of you to let me stay longer but if i had known how ill you were i should be now on my way home i had chartered my schooner and made all arrangements before at last we got definite news i feel highly guilty i should be back to insult and worry you a little our address till further notice is to be co r towns  co sydney that is final i only got the arrangement made yesterday but you may now publish it abroadyours ever       r l s     to james payn      the following was written to his old friend of cornhill magazine    days mr james payn on receiving in hawaii news of that gentlemans    ill health and gathering deafness       honolulu hi june 13th 1889  my dear james payni get sad news of you here at my offsetting for further voyages i wish i could say what i feel sure there was never any man less deserved this calamity for i have heard you speak time and again and i remember nothing that was unkind nothing that was untrue nothing that was not helpful from your lips it is the illtalkers that should hear no more god knows i know no word of consolation but i do feel your trouble you are the more open to letters now let me talk to you for two pages i have nothing but happiness to tell and you may bless god you are a man so soundhearted that even in the freshness of your calamity i can come to you with my own good fortune unashamed and secure of sympathy it is a good thing to be a good man whether deaf or whether dumb and of all our fellowcraftsmen whom yet they count a jealous race i never knew one but gave you the name of honesty and kindness come to think of it gravely this is better than the finest hearing we are all on the march to deafness blindness and all conceivable and fatal disabilities we shall not all get there with a report so good my good news is a health astonishingly reinstated this climate these voyagings these landfalls at dawn new islands peaking from the morning bank new forested harbours new passing alarms of squalls and surf new interests of gentle nativesthe whole tale of my life is better to me than any poem  i am fresh just now from the leper settlement of molokai playing croquet with seven leper girls sitting and yarning with old blind leper beachcombers in the hospital sickened with the spectacle of abhorrent suffering and deformation amongst the patients touched to the heart by the sight of lovely and effective virtues in their helpers no stranger time have i ever had nor any so moving i do not think it a little thing to be deaf god knows and god defend me from the samebut to be a leper or one of the selfcondemned how much more awful and yet theres a way there also there are molokais everywhere said mr dutton father damiens dresser you are but new landed in yours and my dear and kind adviser i wish you with all my soul that patience and courage which you will require think of me meanwhile on a trading schooner bound for the gilbert islands thereafter for the marshalls with a diet of fish and cocoanut before me bound on a cruise ofwell of investigation to what islands we can reach and to get some day or other to sydney where a letter addressed to the care of r towns  co will find me sooner or later and if it contain any good news whether of your welfare or the courage with which you bear the contrary will do me goodyours affectionately although so near a stranger       robert louis stevenson     to lady taylor        honolulu june 19th 1889  my dear lady taylorour new home the equator trading schooner rides at the buoy tonight and we are for sea shortly all your folk of the roost held us for phantoms and things of the night from our first appearance but i do wish you would try to believe in our continued existence as flesh and blood obscurely tossed in the pacific or walking coral shores and in our affection which is more constant than becomes the breasts of such absconders my good health does not cease to be wonderful to myself fanny is better in these warm places it is the very thing for lloyd and in the matter of interest the spice of life etc words cannot depict what fun we have try to have a little more patience with the fugitives and think of us now and again among the gilberts where we ought to be about the time when you receive this scrap they make no great figure on the atlas i confess but you will see the name there if you lookwhich i wish you would and try to conceive us as still extant we all send the kindest remembrances to all of you please make one of the girls write us the news to the care of r towns  co sydney new south wales where we hope to bring up about the end of the yearor later do not forget yours affectionately       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      stevenson and his party sailed accordingly on the trading schooner    equator on a certain bright june day in 1889 for the gilbert    islands a scattered group of atolls in the western pacific their    expectation was to come back into civilisation again by way of the    carolines manila and the china ports but instead of this    circumstances which occurred to change the traders course took them    southwards to samoa where they arrived in december of the same year    their second voyage was thus of six months duration in the course    of it they spent two periods of about six weeks each on land first    at one and then at another of the two island capitals butaritari and    apemama the following letter is the first which reached stevensons    friends from this part of his voyage and was written in two    instalments the first from on board the equator in the lagoon of    the island of apaiang the second six weeks later from the    settlement on shore at apemama which the king his friend temhinoka    allowed him and his party to occupy during their stay the account of    this stay at apemama and of the character of the king is far the most    interesting and attractive part of the volume called in the south    seas which was the literary result of these voyages       schooner equator apaiang lagoon august 22nd 1889  my dear colvinthe missionary ship is outside the reef trying vainly to get in so i may have a chance to get a line off i am glad to say i shall be home by june next for the summer or we shall know the reason why for gods sake be well and jolly for the meeting i shall be i believe a different character from what you have seen this long while this cruise is up to now a huge success being interesting pleasant and profitable the beachcomber is perhaps the most interesting character here the natives are very different on the whole from polynesians they are moral standoffish for good reasons and protected by a dark tongue it is delightful to meet the few hawaiians mostly missionaries that are dotted about with their italian brio and their ready friendliness the whites are a strange lot many of them good kind pleasant fellows others quite the lowest i have ever seen even in the slums of cities i wish i had time to narrate to you the doings and character of three white murderers more or less proven i have met one the only undoubted assassin of the lot quite gained my affection in his big home out of a wreck with his new hebrides wife in her savage turban of hair and yet a perfect lady and his three adorable little girls in rob roy macgregor dresses dancing to the hand organ performing circus on the floor with startling effects of nudity and curling up together on a mat to sleep three sizes three attitudes three rob roy dresses and six little clenched fists the murderer meanwhile brooding and gloating over his chicks till your whole heart went out to him and yet his crime on the face of it was dark disembowelling in his own house an old man of seventy and him drunk  it is lunchtime i see and i must close up with my warmest love to you i wish you were here to sit upon me when required ah if you were but a good sailor i will never leave the sea i think it is only there that a briton lives my poor grandfather it is from him i inherit the taste i fancy and he was round many islands in his day but i please god shall beat him at that before the recall is sounded would you be surprised to learn that i contemplate becoming a shipowner i do but it is a secret life is far better fun than people dream who fall asleep among the chimney stacks and telegraph wires  love to henry james and others nearever yours my dear fellow       robert louis stevenson        equator town apemama october 1889  no morning star came however and so now i try to send this to you by the schooner j l tiernan we have been about a month ashore camping out in a kind of town the king set up for us on the idea that i was really a big chief in england he dines with us sometimes and sends up a cook for a share of our meals when he does not come himself this sounds like high living alas undeceive yourself salt junk is the mainstay a low island except for cocoanuts is just the same as a ship at sea brackish water no supplies and very little shelter the king is a great charactera thorough tyrant very much of a gentleman a poet a musician a historian or perhaps rather more a genealogistit is strange to see him lying in his house among a lot of wives nominal wives writing the history of apemama in an accountbook his description of one of his own songs which he sang to me himself as about sweethearts and trees and the seaand no true allthesame lie seems about as compendious a definition of lyric poetry as a man could ask tembinoka is here the great attraction all the rest is heat and tedium and villainous dazzle and yet more villainous mosquitoes we are like to be here however many a long week before we get away and then whither a strange trade this voyaging so vague so bounddown so helpless fanny has been planting some vegetables and we have actually onions and radishes coming up ah oniondespiser were you but a while in a low island how your heart would leap at sight of a costers barrow i think i could shed tears over a dish of turnips no doubt we shall all be glad to say farewell to low islandsi had near said for ever they are very tame and i begin to read up the directory and pine for an island with a profile a running brook or were it only a well among the rocks the thought of a mango came to me early this morning and set my greed on edge but you do not know what a mango is so  i have been thinking a great deal of you and the monument of late and even tried to get my thoughts into a poem hitherto without success god knows how you are i begin to weary dreadfully to see youwell in nine months i hope but that seems a long time i wonder what has befallen me too that flimsy part of me that lives or dwindles in the public mind and what has befallen the master and what kind of a box the merry box has been found it is odd to know nothing of all this we had an old woman to do devilwork for you about a month ago in a chinamans house on apaiang august 23rd or 24th you should have seen the crone with a noble masculine face like that of an old crone sic a body like a mans naked all but the feathery female girdle knotting cocoanut leaves and muttering spells fanny and i and the good captain of the equator and the chinaman and his native wife and sisterinlaw all squatting on the floor about the sibyl and a crowd of dark faces watching from behind her shoulder she sat right in the doorway and tittering aloud with strange appalled embarrassed laughter at each fresh adjuration she informed us you were in england not travelling and now no longer sick she promised us a fair wind the next day and we had it so i cherish the hope she was as right about sidney colvin the shipownering has rather petered out since i last wrote and a good many other plans beside  health fanny very soso i pretty right upon the whole and getting through plenty work i know not quite how but it seems to me not bad and in places funny  south sea yarns    1 the wrecker            r l s   2 the pearl fisher   by    and   3 the beachcombers       lloyd o  the pearl fisher part done lies in sydney it is the wrecker we are now engaged upon strange ways of life i think they set forth things that i can scarce touch upon or even not at all in my travel book and the yarns are good i do believe the pearl fisher is for the new york ledger the yarn is a kind of monte cristo one the wrecker is the least good as a story i think but the characters seem to me good the beachcombers is more sentimental these three scarce touch the outskirts of the life we have been viewing a hotbed of strange characters and incidents lord how different from europe or the pallid states farewell heaven knows when this will get to you i burn to be in sydney and have news       r l s     to sidney colvin      the following written in the last days of the sail southwards from    the gilberts to samoa contains the full plan of the south sea book    as it had now been conceived in the issue part i so far as i    know was never written parts ii and iii appeared serially in the    new york sun and were reprinted with corrections in the volume    called in the south seas part iv was never written part v was    written but has not been printed at least in this country part vi    and far the most successful closes the volume in the south seas    part vii developed itself into a footnote to history the verses    at the end of this letter have already been printed songs of    travel vol xiv p 244 but i give them here with the context    as in similar instances above the allusion is to the two colossal    images from easter island which used to stand under the portico to    the right hand of the visitor entering the museum were for some    years removed and are now restored to their old

great square crowded with wet human beings and the rain avalanching on the deck and the leaks dripping everywhere fanny in the midst of fifteen males bearing up wonderfully but such voyages are at the best a trial we had one particularity coming down on winslow reef p d position doubtful two positions in the directory a third if you cared to count that on the chart heavy sea running and the night due the boats were cleared bread put on board and we made up our packets for a boat voyage of four or five hundred miles and turned in expectant of a crash needless to say it did not come and no doubt we were far to leeward if we only had twopenceworth of wind we might be at dinner in apia tomorrow evening but no such luck here we roll dead before a light airand that is no point of sailing at all

astern we are all pretty gay on board and have been photographing and draughtplaying and skylarking like anything i am minded to stay not very long in samoa and confine my studies there as far as any one can forecast to the history of the late war my book is now practically modelled if i can execute what is designed there are few better books now extant on this globe bar the epics and the big tragedies and histories and the choice lyric poetics and a novel or sonone but it is not executed yet and let not him that putteth on his armour vaunt himself at least nobody has had such stuff such wild stories such beautiful scenes such singular intimacies such manners and traditions so incredible a mixture of the beautiful and horrible the savage and civilised i will give you here some idea of the table of contents which ought to make your mouth water i propose to call the book the south seas it is rather a large title but not many people have seen more of them than i perhaps no

possible though unlikely that i may add a passing visit to fiji or tonga or even both but i am growing impatient to see yourself and i do not want to be later than june of coming to england anyway you see it will be a large work and as it will be copiously illustrated the lord knows what it will cost we shall return god willing by sydney ceylon suez and i guess marseilles the manymasted copyright epithet i shall likely pause a day or two in paris but all that is too far aheadalthough now it begins to look nearso near and i can hear the rattle of the hansom up endell street and see the gates swing back and feel myself jump out upon the monument stepshosannahome again my dear fellow now that my father is done with his troubles and 17 heriot row no more than a mere shell you and that gaunt old monument in bloomsbury are all that i have in view when i use the word home some passing thoughts there may be of the rooms at skerryvore and the blackbirds in the chine on a may morning but the essence is sc and the museum suppose by some damned accident you were no more well i should return just the same because of my mother and lloyd whom i now think to send to cambridge but all the spring would have gone out of me and ninety per cent of the attraction lost i will copy for you here a copy of verses made in apemama    i heard the pulse of the besieging sea   throb far away all night i heard the wind   fly crying and convulse tumultuous palms   i rose and strolled the isle was all bright sand   and flailing fans and shadows of the palm   the heaven all moon and wind and the blind vault   the keenest planet slain for venus slept   the king my neighbour with his host of wives   slept in the precinct of the palisade   where single in the wind under the moon   among the slumbering cabins blazed a fire   sole streetlamp and the only sentinel     to other lands and nights my fancy turned   to london first and chiefly to your house   the manypillared and the wellbeloved   there yearning fancy lighted there again   in the upper room i lay and heard far off   the unsleeping city murmur like a shell   the muffled tramp of the museum guard   once more went by me i beheld again   lamps vainly brighten the dispeopled street   again i longed for the returning morn   the awaking traffic the bestirring birds   the consentancous trill of tiny song   that weaves round monumental cornices   a passing charm of beauty most of all   for your light foot i wearied and your knock   that was the glad r√©veill√© of my day     lo now when to your task in the great house   at morning through the portico you pass   one moment glance where by the pillared wall   farvoyaging island gods begrimed with smoke   sit now unworshipped the rude monument   of faiths forgot and races undivined   sit now disconsolate remembering well   the priest the victim and the songful crowd   the blaze of the blue noon and that huge voice   incessant of the breakers on the shore   as far as these from their ancestral shrine   so far so foreign your divided friends   wander estranged in body not in mind       r l s     to e l burlingame     schooner equator at sea wednesday 4th december 1889  my dear burlingamewe are now about to rise like whales from this long dive and i make ready a communication which is to go to you by the first mail from samoa how long we shall stay in that group i cannot forecast but it will be best still to address at sydney where i trust when i shall arrive perhaps in one month from now more probably in two or three to find all news  businesswill you be likely to have a space in the magazine for a serial story which should be ready i believe by april at latest by autumn it is called the wrecker and in book form will appear as number 1 of south sea yarns by r l s and lloyd osbourne here is the table as far as fully conceived and indeed executed33  the story is founded on fact the mystery i really believe to be insoluble the purchase of a wreck has never been handled before no more has san francisco these seem all elements of success there is besides a character jim pinkerton of the advertising american on whom we build a good deal and some sketches of the american merchant marine opium smuggling in honolulu etc it should run to about three hundred pages of my ms i would like to know if this tale smiles upon you if you will have a vacancy and what you will be willing to pay it will of course be copyright in both the states and england i am a little anxious to have it tried serially as it tests the interest of the mystery  pleasurewe have had a fine time in the gilbert group though four months on low islands which involves low diet is a largeish order and my wife is rather down i am myself up to now a pillar of health though our long and vile voyage of calms squalls cataracts of rain sails carried away foretopmast lost boats cleared and packets made on the approach of a p d reef etc has cured me of salt brine and filled me with a longing for beef steak and mangoes not to be depicted the interest has been immense old king tembinoka of apemama the napoleon of the group poet tyrant altogether a man of mark gave me the woven corselets of his grandfather his father and his uncle and what pleased me more told me their singular story then all manner of strange tales facts and experiences for my south sea book which should be a tearer mr burlingame no one at least has had such stuff  we are now engaged in the hell of a dead calm the heat is cruelit is the only time when i suffer from heat i have nothing on but a pair of serge trousers and a singlet without sleeves of oxford gauzeo yes and a red sash about my waist and yet as i sit here in the cabin sweat streams from me the rest are on deck under a bit of awning we are not much above a hundred miles from port and we might as well be in kamschatka however i should be honest this is the first calm i have endured without the added bane of a heavy swell and the intoxicated bluebottle wallowings and knockings of the helpless ship  i wonder how you liked the end of the master that was the hardest job i ever had to do did i do it  my wife begs to be remembered to yourself and mrs burlingame remember all of us to all friends particularly low in case i dont get a word through for himi am yours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter     the following was written soon after the termination of the voyage of    the equator and stevensons first landing in samoa where he was    engaged in collecting materials for the account then intended to be    the concluding part of his great projected south sea book of the war    and hurricane of the previous year       samoa december 1889  my dear baxter  i cannot return until i have seen either tonga or fiji or both and i must not leave here till i have finished my collections on the wara very interesting bit of history the truth often very hard to come at and the search for me much complicated by the german tongue from the use of which i have desisted i suppose these fifteen years the last two days i have been mugging with a dictionary from five to six hours a day besides this i have to call upon keep sweet and judiciously interview all sorts of personsenglish american german and samoan it makes a hard life above all as after every interview i have to come and get my notes straight on the nail i believe i should have got my facts before the end of january when i shall make for tonga or fiji i am down right in the hurricane season but they had so bad a one last year i dont imagine there will be much of an edition this say that i get to sydney some time in april and i shall have done well and be in a position to write a very singular and interesting book or rather two for i shall begin i think with a separate opuscule on the samoan trouble about as long as kidnapped not very interesting but valuableand a thing proper to be done and then hey for the big south sea book a devil of a big one and full of the finest sport  this morning as i was going along to my breakfast a little before seven reading a number of blackwoods magazine i was startled by a soft talofa alii note for my mother they are quite courteous here in the european style quite unlike tahiti right in my ear it was mataafa coming from early mass in his white coat and white linen kilt with three fellows behind him mataafa is the nearest thing to a hero in my history and really a fine fellow plenty sense and the most dignified quiet gentle manners talking of blackwooda file of which i was lucky enough to find here in the lawyersmrs oliphant seems in a staggering state from the wrong box to the master i scarce recognise either my critic or myself i gather that the master should do well and at least that notice is agreeable reading i expect to be home in june you will have gathered that i am pretty well in addition to my labours i suppose i walk five or six miles a day and almost every day i ride up and see fanny and lloyd who are in a house in the bush with ah fu i live in apia for historys sake with moors an american trader day before yesterday i was arrested and fined for riding fast in the street which made my blood bitter as the wife of the manager of the german firm has twice almost ridden me down and there seems none to say her nay the germans have behaved pretty badly here but not in all ways so ill as you may have gathered they were doubtless much provoked and if the insane knappe had not appeared upon the scene might have got out of the muddle with dignity i write along without rhyme or reason as things occur to me  i hope from my outcries about printing you do not think i want you to keep my news or letters in a blue beard closet i like all friends to hear of me they all should if i had ninety hours in the day and strength for all of them but you must have gathered how hard worked i am and you will understand i go to bed a pretty tired man        29th december 1889  tomorrow monday i wont swear to my day of the month this is the sunday between christmas and new year i go up the coast with mr clarke one of the london society missionaries in a boat to examine schools see tamasese etc lloyd comes to photograph pray heaven we have good weather this is the rainy season we shall be gone four or five days and if the rain keep off i shall be glad of the change if it rain it will be beastly this explains still further how hard pressed i am as the mail will be gone ere i return and i have thus lost the days i meant to write in i have a boy henry who interprets and copies for me and is a great nuisance he said he wished to come to me in order to learn long explessions henry goes up along with us and as i am not fond of him he may before the trip is over hear some stlong explessions i am writing this on the back balcony at moors palms and a hill like the hill of kinnoull looking in at me myself lying on the floor and like the parties in handels song clad in robes of virgin white the ink is dreadful the heat delicious a fine going breeze in the palms and from the other side of the house the sudden angry splash and roar of the pacific on the reef where the warships are still piled from last years hurricane some under water one high and dry upon her side the strangest figure of a ship was ever witnessed the narrow bay there is full of ships the menofwar covered with sail after the rains and especially the german ship which is fearfully and awfully top heavy rolling almost yards in in what appears to be calm water  samoa apia at least is far less beautiful than the marquesas or tahiti a more gentle scene gentler acclivities a tamer face of nature and this much aided for the wanderer by the great german plantations with their countless regular avenues of palms the island has beautiful rivers of about the bigness of our waters in the lothians with pleasant pools and waterfalls and overhanging verdure and often a great volume of sound so that once i thought i was passing near a mill and it was only the voice of the river i am not specially attracted by the people but they are courteous the women very attractive and dress lovely the men purposelike well set up tall lean and dignified as i write the breeze is brisking up doors are beginning to slam and shutters a strong draught sweeps round the balcony it looks doubtful for tomorrow here i shut upever your affectionate       r l stevenson     to lady taylor      this letter contains the first announcement of the purchase of the    vailima estate not yet so named sir percy shelley had died in the    previous december       apia samoa jan 20th 1890  my dear lady taylori shall hope to see you in some months from now when i come hometo break up my establishmenti know no diminutive of the word your daughters cast a spell upon me they were always declaring i was a winged creature and would vanish into the uttermost isle and they were right and i have made my preparations i am now the owner of an estate upon upolu some two or three miles behind and above apia three streams two waterfalls a great cliff an ancient native fort a view of the sea and lowlands or to be more precise several views of them in various directions are now mine it would be affectation to omit a good many head of cattle above all as it required much diplomacy to have them thrown in for the gentleman who sold to me was staunch besides all this there is a great deal more forest than i have any need for or to be plain the whole estate is one impassable jungle which must be cut down and through at considerable expense then the house has to be built and then as a climax we may have to stand a siege in it in the next native war  i do feel as if i was a coward and a traitor to desert my friends only my dear lady you know what a miserable corrhyzal is that how it is spelt creature i was at home and here i have some real health i can walk i can ride i can stand some exposure i am up with the sun i have a real enjoyment of the world and of myself it would be hard to go back again to england and to bed and i think it would be very silly i am sure it would and yet i feel shame and i know i am not writing like myself i wish you knew how much i admired you and when i think of those i must leave how early a place your name occupies i have not had the pleasure to know you very long and yet i feel as if my leaving england were a special treachery to you and my leaving you a treachery to myself i will only ask you to try to forgive me for i am sure i will never quite forgive myself somebody might write to me in the care of r towns  co sydney new south wales to tell me if you can forgive but you will do quite right if you cannot only let me come and see you when we do return or it will be a lame homecoming  my wife suffered a good deal in our last somewhat arduous voyage all our party indeed suffered except myself fanny is now better but she is still no very famous success in the way of health  all the while i have been writing i have had another matter in my eye of which i scarce like to speak you know of course that i am thinking of sir percy and his widow the news has reached me in the shape of a newspaper cutting i have no particulars he had a sweet original nature i think i liked him better than ever i should have liked his father i am sorry he was always a little afraid of me if i had had more chance he would have liked me too we had so much in common and i valued so much his fine soul as honest as a dogs and the romance of him which was like a dogs too and like a poets at the same time if he had not been shelleys son people would have thought more of him and yet he was the better of the two bar verses  please tell my dear ida and una that we think much of them as well as of your dear self and believe me in words which you once allowed me to use and i was very much affected when you did so your affectionate friend       robert louis stevenson     to dr scott      this gentleman is the physician to whose assiduous care and kindness    as recorded in the dedication to underwoods stevenson owed so much    during his invalid years at bournemouth       apia samoa january 20th 1890  my dear scottshameful indeed that you should not have heard of me before i have now been some twenty months in the south seas and am up to date a person whom you would scarce know i think nothing of long walks and rides i was four hours and a half gone the other day partly riding partly climbing up a steep ravine i have stood a six months voyage on a copra schooner with about three months ashore on coral atolls which means except for cocoanuts to drink no change whatever from ships food my wife suffered badlyit was too rough a business altogetherlloyd sufferedand in short i was the only one of the party who kept my end up  i am so pleased with this climate that i have decided to settle have even purchased a piece of land from three to four hundred acres i know not which till the survey is completed and shall only return next summer to wind up my affairs in england thenceforth i mean to be a subject of the high commissioner  now you would have gone longer yet without news of your truant patient but that i have a medical discovery to communicate i find i can almost immediately fight off a cold with liquid extract of coca two or if obstinate three teaspoonfuls in the day for a variable period of from one to five days sees the cold generally to the door i find it at once produces a glow stops rigour and though it makes one very uncomfortable prevents the advance of the disease hearing of this influenza it occurred to me that this might prove remedial and perhaps a stronger exhibitioninjections of cocaine for instancestill better  if on my return i find myself let in for this epidemic which seems highly calculated to nip me in the bud i shall feel very much inclined to make the experiment see what a gulf you may save me from if you shall have previously made it on anima vili on some less important sufferer and shall have found it worse than useless  how is miss boodle and her family greeting to your brother and all friends in bournemouthyours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter      after a stay of four or five weeks at apia during which he had    fallen more and more in love with samoa and the samoans stevenson    took steamer again this time for sydney where he had ordered his    letters to await him this and the two following letters were written    during the passage i again print in their original place a set of    verses separately published in songs of travel       februar den 3en 1890         dampfer l√ºbeck zwischen apia und sydney  my dear charlesi have got one delightful letter from you and heard from my mother of your kindness in going to see her thank you for that you can in no way more touch and serve me ay ay it is sad to sell 17 sad and fine were the old days when i was away in apemama i wrote two copies of verse about edinburgh and the past so ink black so golden bright i will send them if i can find them for they will say something to you and indeed one is more than half addressed to you this is it    to my old comrades    do you remembercan we eer forget   how in the coiled perplexities of youth   in our wild climate in our scowling town   we gloomed and shivered sorrowed sobbed and feared   the belching winter wind the missile rain   the rare and welcome silence of the snows   the laggard morn the haggard day the night   the grimy spell of the nocturnal town   do you rememberah could one forget   as when the fevered sick that all night long   listed the wind intone and hear at last   the everwelcome voice of the chanticleer   sing in the bitter hour before the dawn   with sudden ardour these desire the day  here a squall sends all flying    so sang in the gloom of youth the bird of hope   so we exulting hearkened and desired   for lo as in the palace porch of life   we huddled with chimeras from within   how sweet to hearthe music swelled and fell   and through the breach of the revolving doors   what dreams of splendour blinded us and fled   i have since then contended and rejoiced   amid the glories of the house of life   profoundly entered and the shrine beheld   yet when the lamp from my expiring eyes   shall dwindle and recede the voice of love   fall insignificant on my closing ears   what sound shall come but the old cry of the wind   in our inclement city what return   but the image of the emptiness of youth   filled with the sound of footsteps and that voice   of discontent and rapture and despair   so as in darkness from the magic lamp   the momentary pictures gleam and fade   and perish and the night resurgesthese   shall i remember and then all forget  theyre pretty secondrate but felt i cant be bothered to copy the other  i have bought 31412 acres of beautiful land in the bush behind apia when we get the house built the garden laid and cattle in the place it will be something to fall back on for shelter and food and if the island could stumble into political quiet it is conceivable it might even bring a little income we range from 600 to 1500 feet have five streams waterfalls precipices profound ravines rich tablelands fifty head of cattle on the ground if any one could catch them a great view of forest sea mountains the warships in the haven really a noble place some day you are to take a long holiday and come and see us it has been all planned  with all these irons in the fire and cloudy prospects you may be sure i was pleased to hear a good account of business i believed the master was a sure card i wonder why henley thinks it grimy grim it is god knows but sure not grimy else i am the more deceived i am sorry he did not care for it i place it on the line with kidnapped myself well see as time goes on whether it goes above or falls below       r l s     to e l burlingame      the editor of scribners magazine had written asking him for fresh    contributions and he sends the set of verses addressed to    tembinoka the king at butaritari and afterwards reprinted in    songs of travel beginning let us who part like brothers part like    bards       ss l√ºbeck between apia and sydney february 1890  my dear burlingamei desire nothing better than to continue my relation with the magazine to which it pleases me to hear i have been useful the only thing i have ready is the enclosed barbaric piece as soon as i have arrived in sydney i shall send you some photographs a portrait of tembinoka perhaps a view of the palace or of the matted men at their singing also ts flag which my wife designed for him in a word what i can do best for you it will be thus a foretaste of my book of travels i shall ask you to let me have if i wish it the use of the plates made and to make up a little tract of the verses and illustrations of which you might send six copies to hm tembinoka king of apemama via butaritari gilbert islands it might be best to send it by crawford  co sf there is no postal service and schooners must take it how they may and when perhaps some such note as this might be prefixed  at my departure from the island of apemama for which you will look in vain in most atlases the king and i agreed since we both set up to be in the poetical way that we should celebrate our separation in verse whether or not his majesty has been true to his bargain the laggard posts of the pacific may perhaps inform me in six months perhaps not before a year the following lines represent my part of the contract and it is hoped by their pictures of strange manners they may entertain a civilised audience nothing throughout has been invented or exaggerated the lady herein referred to as the authors muse has confined herself to stringing into rhyme facts and legends that i saw or heard during two months residence upon the island       r l s   you will have received from me a letter about the wrecker no doubt it is a new experiment for me being disguised so much as a study of manners and the interest turning on a mystery of the detective sort i think there need be no hesitation about beginning it in the fall of the year lloyd has nearly finished his part and i shall hope to send you very soon the ms of about the first foursevenths at the same time i have been employing myself in samoa collecting facts about the recent war and i propose to write almost at once and to publish shortly a small volume called i know not whatthe war in samoa the samoa trouble an island war the war of the three consuls i know notperhaps you can suggest it was meant to be a part of my travel book but material has accumulated on my hands until i see myself forced into volume form and i hope it may be of use if it come soon i have a few photographs of the war which will do for illustrations it is conceivable you might wish to handle this in the magazine although i am inclined to think you wont and to agree with you but if you think otherwise there it is the travel letters fifty of them are already contracted for in papers these i was quite bound to let mclure handle as the idea was of his suggestion and i always felt a little sore as to one trick i played him in the matter of the endpapers the warvolume will contain some very interesting and picturesque details more i cant promise for it of course the fifty newspaper letters will be simply patches chosen from the travel volume or volumes as it gets written but you see i have in hand    say half done                 1 the wrecker    lloyds copy half done mine   2 the pearl fisher a novel promised   not touched                        to the ledger and which will form                                       when it comes in book form no 2

the letters    you know how they stand       5 the ballads  excusez du peu and you see what madness it would be to make any fresh engagements at the same time you have the wrecker and the war volume if you like eitheror bothto keep my name in the magazine  it begins to look as if i should not be able to get any more ballads done this somewhile i know the book would sell better if it were all ballads and yet i am growing half tempted to fill up with some other verses a good few are connected with my voyage such as the home of tembinoka sent herewith and would have a sort of slight affinity to the south sea ballads you might tell me how that strikes a stranger  in all this my real interest is with the travel volume which ought to be of a really extraordinary interest  i am sending you tembinoka as he stands but there are parts of him that i hope to better particularly in stanzas iii and ii i scarce feel intelligent enough to try just now and i thought at any rate you had better see it set it up if you think well and let me have a proof so at least we shall get the bulk of it straight i have spared you te√±koruti tembaitake tembinatake and other barbarous names because i thought the dentists in the states had work enough without my assistance but my chiefs name is tembinoka pronounced according to the present quite modern habit in the gilberts tembinok compare in the margin tengkorootch a singular new trick setting at defiance all south sea analogy for nowhere else do they show even the ability far less the will to end a word upon a consonant loia is lloyds name ship becomes ship√© teapot tipot√© etc our admirable friend herman melville of whom since i could judge i have thought more than ever had no ear for languages whatever his hapar tribe should be hapaa etc

hydes dr not mr letter about damien that has been one of my concerns i have an answer in the press and have just written a difficult letter to damon trying to prepare him for what i fear must be to him extremely painful the answer is to come out as a pamphlet of which i make of course a present to the publisher i am not a cannibal i would not eat the flesh of dr hydeand it is conceivable it will make a noise in honolulu i have struck as hard as i knew how nor do i think my answer can fail to do away in the minds of all who see it with the effect of hydes incredible and really villainous

been long at sydneyjust long enough to write and    print the famous letter to dr hyde in defence of father    damienwhen to his heavy disappointment he fell ill again with one    of his old bad attacks of fever and hemorrhage from the lungs it was    this experience which finally determined him to settle for good on    his new island property in samoa which at first he had thought of    rather as an occasional refuge and restingplace in the intervals    between future projected yachting voyages       union club sydney march 7th 1890  my dear charlesi did not send off the enclosed before from laziness having gone quite sick and being a blooming prisoner here in the club and indeed in my bedroom i was in receipt of your letters and your ornamental photo and was delighted to see how well you looked and how reasonably well i stood i am sure i shall never come back home except to die i may do it but shall always think of the move as suicidal unless a great change comes over me of which as yet i see no symptom this visit to sydney has smashed me handsomely and yet i made myself a prisoner here in the club upon my first arrival this is not encouraging for further ventures sydney winteror i might almost say sydney spring for i came when the worst was overis so small an affair comparable to our june depression at home in scotland the pipe is right again it was the springs that had rusted and ought to have been oiled its voice is now that of an angel but lord here in the club i dare not wake it conceive my impatience to be in my own backwoods and raise the sound

recover from the effects of his illness at sydney    stevenson determined to take another voyage and started accordingly    in april with his party on a trading steamer the janet nicoll    which took him by a long and devious course among many groups of    islands that he had not yet visited returning to sydney in august by    way of new caledonia on the first night out of auckland harbour the    voyage nearly came to a premature end through the blowing up of some    trade fireworks or materials for fireworks which had been packed in    the stateroom       ss janet nicoll off upolu spring 1890  my dearest colvini was sharply ill at sydney cut off right out of bed in this steamer on a fresh island cruise and have already reaped the benefit we are excellently found this time on a spacious vessel with an excellent table the captain supercargo our one fellowpassenger etc very nice and the charterer mr henderson the very man i could have chosen the truth is i fear this life is the only one that suits me so long as i cruise in the south seas i shall be well and happyalas no i do not mean that and absit omeni mean that so soon as i cease from cruising the nerves are strained the decline commences and i steer slowly but surely back to bedward we left sydney had a cruel rough passage to auckland for the janet is the worst roller i was ever aboard of i was confined to my cabin ports closed self shied out of the berth stomach pampered till the day i left on a diet of perpetual eggnogg revolted at ships food and ship eating in a frowsy bunk clinging with one hand to the plate with the other to the glass and using the knife and fork except at intervals with the eyelid no matter i picked up hand over hand after a day in auckland we set sail again were blown up in the main cabin with calcium fires as we left the bay let no man say i am unscientific when i ran on the alert out of my stateroom and found the main cabin incarnadined with the glow of the last scene of a pantomime i stopped dead what is this said i this ship is on fire i see that but why a pantomime and i stood and reasoned the point until my head was so muddled with the fumes that i could not find the companion a few seconds later the captain had to enter crawling on his belly and took days to recover if he has recovered from the fumes by singular good fortune we got the hose down in time and saved the ship but lloyd lost most of his clothes and a great part of our photographs was destroyed fanny saw the native sailors tossing overboard a blazing trunk she stopped them in time and behold it contained my manuscripts thereafter we had three or two days fine weather then got into a gale of wind with rain and a vexatious sea as we drew into our anchorage in a bight of savage island a man ashore told me afterwards the sight of the janet nicoll made him sick and indeed it was rough play though nothing to the night before all through this gale i worked four to six hours per diem spearing the inkbottle like a flying fish and holding my papers together as i might for of all things what i was at was historythe samoan businessand i had to turn from one to another of these piles of manuscript notes and from one page to another in each until i should have found employment for the hands of briareus all the same this history is a godsend for a voyage i can put in time getting events coordinated and the narrative distributed when my muchheaving numskull would be incapable of finish or fine style at savage we met the missionary barque john williams i tell you it was a great day for savage island the path up the cliffs was crowded with gay islandresses i like that feminine plural who wrapped me in their embraces and picked my pockets of all my tobacco with a manner which a touch would have made revolting but as it was was simply charming like the golden age one pretty little stalwart minx with a red flower behind her ear had searched me with extraordinary zeal and when soon after i missed my matches i accused her she still following us of being the thief after some delay and with a subtle smile she produced the box gave me one match and put the rest away again too tired to add moreyour most affectionate       r l s     to e l burlingame      the idea here discussed of a further series of essays to be    contributed to scribners magazine was never carried out       ss janet nicoll off peru island kingsmills         group july 13th 90  my dear burlingamei am moved to write to you in the matter of the end papers i am somewhat tempted to begin them again follow the reasons pro and con  1st i must say i feel as if something in the nature of the end paper were a desirable finish to the number and that the substitutes of occasional essays by occasional contributors somehow fail to fill the bill should you differ with me on this point no more is to be said and what follows must be regarded as lost words  2nd i am rather taken with the idea of continuing the work for instance should you have no distaste for papers of the class called random memories i should enjoy continuing them of course at intervals and when they were done i have an idea they might make a readable book on the other hand i believe a greater freedom of choice might be taken the subjects more varied and more briefly treated in somewhat approaching the manner of andrew lang in the sign of the ship it being well understood that the broken sticks34 method is one not very suitable as colonel burke would say to my genius and not very likely to be pushed far in my practice upon this point i wish you to condense your massive brain in the last lot i was promised and i fondly expected to receive a vast amount of assistance from intelligent and genial correspondents i assure you i never had a scratch of a pen from any one above the level of a village idiot except once when a lady sowed my head full of grey hairs by announcing that she was going to direct her life in future by my counsels will the correspondents be more copious and less irrelevant in the future suppose that to be the case will they be of any use to me in my place of exile is it possible for a man in samoa to be in touch with the great heart of the people and is it not perhaps a mere folly to attempt from so hopeless a distance anything so delicate as a series of papers upon these points perpend and give me the results of your perpensions  3rd the emolument would be agreeable to your humble servant  i have now stated all the pros and the most of the cons are come in by the way there follows however one immense con with a capital c which i beg you to consider particularly i fear that to be of any use for your magazine these papers should begin with the beginning of a volume even supposing my hands were free this would be now impossible for next year you have to consider whether supposing you have no other objection it would be worth while to begin the series in the middle of a volume or desirable to delay the whole matter until the beginning of another year  now supposing that the cons have it and you refuse my offer let me make another proposal which you will be very inclined to refuse at the first offgo but which i really believe might in time come to something you know how the penny papers have their answers to correspondents why not do something of the same kind for the culchawed why not get men like stimson brownell professor james goldwin smith and others who will occur to you more readily than to me to put and to answer a series of questions of intellectual and general interest until at last you should have established a certain standard of matter to be discussed in this part of the magazine  i want you to get me bound volumes of the magazine from its start the lord knows i have had enough copies where they are i know not a wandering author gathers no magazines  the wrecker is in no forrader state than in last reports i have indeed got to a period when i cannot well go on until i can refresh myself on the proofs of the beginning my respected collaborator who handles the machine which is now addressing you has indeed carried his labours farther but not i am led to understand with what we used to call a blessing at least i have been refused a sight of his latest labours however there is plenty of time ahead and i feel no anxiety about the tale except that it may meet with your approval  all this voyage i have been busy over my travels which given a very high temperature and the saloon of a steamer usually going before the wind and with the cabins in front of the engines has come very near to prostrating me altogether you will therefore understand that there are no more poems i wonder whether there are already enough and whether you think that such a volume would be worth the publishing i shall hope to find in sydney some expression of your opinion on this point living as i do amongnot the most cultured of mankind splendidly educated and perfect gentlemen when soberi attach a growing importance to friendly criticisms from yourself  i believe that this is the most of our business as for my health i got over my cold in a fine style but have not been very well of late to my unaffected annoyance the bloodspitting has started again i find the heat of a steamer decidedly wearing and trying in these latitudes and i am inclined to think the superior expedition rather dearly paid for still the fact that one does not even remark the coming of a squall nor feel relief on its departure is a mercy not to be acknowledged without gratitude the rest of the family seem to be doing fairly well both seem less run down than they were on the equator and mrs stevenson very much less so we have now been three months away have visited about thirtyfive islands many of which were novel to us and some extremely entertaining some also were old acquaintances and pleasant to revisit in the meantime we have really a capital time aboard ship in the most pleasant and interesting society and with considering the length and nature of the voyage an excellent table please remember us all to mr scribner the young chieftain of the house and the lady whose health i trust is better to mrs burlingame we all desire to be remembered and i hope you will give our news to low st gaudens faxon and others of the faithful in the city i shall probably return to samoa direct having given up all idea of returning to civilisation in the meanwhile there on my ancestral acres which i purchased six months ago from a blind scots blacksmith you will please address me until further notice the name of the ancestral acres is going to be vailima but as at the present moment nobody else knows the name except myself and the copatentees it will be safer if less ambitious to address r l s apia samoa the ancestral acres run to upwards of three hundred they enjoy the ministrations of five streams whence the name they are all at the present moment under a trackless covering of magnificent forest which would be worth a great deal if it grew beside a railway terminus to me as it stands it represents a handsome deficit obliging natives from the cannibal islands are now cutting it down at my expense you would be able to run your magazine to much greater advantage if the terms of authors were on the same scale with those of my cannibals we have also a house about the size of a manufacturers lodge tis but the egg of the future palace over the details of which on paper mrs stevenson and i have already shed real tears what it will be when it comes to paying for it i leave you to imagine but if it can only be built as now intended it will be with genuine satisfaction and a growunded pride that i shall welcome you at the steps of my old colonial home when you land from the steamer on a longmerited holiday i speak much at my ease yet i do not know i may be now an outlaw a bankrupt the abhorred of all good men i do not know you probably do has hyde35 turned upon me have i fallen like danvers carew  it is suggested to me that you might like to know what will be my future society three consuls all at loggerheads with one another or at the best in a clique of two against one three different sects of missionaries not upon the best of terms and the catholics and protestants in a condition of unhealable illfeeling as to whether a wooden drum ought or ought not to be beaten to announce the time of school the native population very genteel very songful very agreeable very goodlooking chronically spoiling for a fight a circumstance not to be entirely neglected in the design of the palace as for the white population of technically the beach i dont suppose it is possible for any person not thoroughly conversant with the south seas to form the smallest conception of such a society with its grogshops its apparently unemployed hangerson its merchants of all degrees of respectability and the reverse the paper of which i must really send you a copyif yours were really a live magazine you would have an exchange with the editor i assure you it has of late contained a great deal of matter about one of your contributorsrejoices in the name of samoa times and south sea advertiser the advertisements in the advertiser are permanent being simply subsidies for its existence a dashing warfare of newspaper correspondence goes on between the various residents who are rather fond of recurring to one anothers antecedents but when all is said there are a lot of very nice pleasant people and i dont know that apia is very much worse than half a hundred towns that i could name       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter      as above indicated on the way between samoa and sydney stevenson    left the janet nicoll for a weeks stay in new caledonia during    which he was hospitably received by the french officials       hotel sebastopol noumea august 1890  my dear charlesi have stayed here a week while lloyd and my wife continue to voyage in the janet nicoll this i did partly to see the convict system partly to shorten my stay in the extreme coldhear me with my extreme moi qui suis originaire dedimbourgof sydney at this season i am feeling very seedy utterly fatigued and overborne with sleep i have a fine old gentleman of a doctor who attends and cheers and entertains if he does not cure me but even with his ministrations i am almost incapable of the exertion sufficient for this letter and i am really as i write falling down with sleep what is necessary to say i must try to say shortly lloyd goes to clear out our establishments pray keep him in funds if i have any if i have not pray try to raise them here is the idea to install ourselves at the risk of bankruptcy in samoa it is not the least likely it will pay although it may but it is almost certain it will support life with very few external expenses if i die it will be an endowment for the survivors at least for my wife and lloyd and my mother who might prefer to go home has her own hence i believe i shall do well to hurry my installation the letters are already in part done in part done is a novel for scribner in the course of the next twelve months i should receive a considerable amount of money i am aware i had intended to pay back to my capital some of this i am now of opinion i should act foolishly better to build the house and have a roof and farm of my own and thereafter with a livelihood assured save and repay there is my livelihood all but books and wine ready in a nutshell and it ought to be more easy to save and to repay afterwards excellent say you but will you save and will you repay i do not know said the bell of old bow it seems clear to me the deuce of the affair is that i do not know when i shall see you and colvin i guess you will have to come and see me many a time already we have arranged the details of your visit in the yet unbuilt house on the mountain i shall be able to get decent wine from noumea we shall be able to give you a decent welcome and talk of old days apropos of old days do you remember still the phrase we heard in waterloo place i believe you made a piece for the piano on that phrase pray if you remember it send it me in your next if you find it impossible to write correctly send it me √† la r√©citative and indicate the accents do you feel you must how strangely heavy and stupid i am i must at last give up and go sleep i am simply a rag  the morrowi feel better but still dim and groggy

cannot say what i would give if there came a knock now at the door and you came in i guess noelpardon would go begging and we might burn the fr 200 dress clothes in the back garden for a bonfire or what would be yet more expensive and more humorous get them once more expanded to fit you and when that was done a second time cut down for my gossamer dimensions  i hope you never forget to remember me to your father who has always a place in my heart as i hope i have a little in his his kindness helped me infinitely when you and i were young i recall it with gratitude and affection in this town of convicts at the worlds end there are very few things my dear charles worth mention on a retrospect of life the days flash and colour one day with another flames dazzles and puts to sleep and when the days are gone like a fastflying thaumatrope they make but a single pattern only a few things stand out and among thesemost plainly to merutland squareever my dear charles your affectionate friend

to e l burlingame      proceeding from new caledonia to sydney stevenson again made a stay    there of about a month before going to settle in his new island home    and superintend the operations of planting and building the next    letter is in acknowledgment of proofs received from messrs scribner    of a proposed volume of verse to contain besides ticonderoga and    the two ballads on marquesan and tahitian legends a number of the    other miscellaneous verses which he had written in the course of his    travels in the end the ballads only stood for publication at this    time the other verses were reserved and have been posthumously    published under the title songs of travel       union club sydney august 1890  my dear burlingame    ballads  the deuce is in this volume it has cost me more botheration and dubiety than any other i ever took in hand on one thing my mind is made up the verses at the end have no business there and throw them down many of them are bad many of the rest want nine years keeping and the remainder are not relevantthrow them down some i never want to hear of more others will grow in time towards decent items in a second underwoodsand in the meanwhile down with them at the same time i have a sneaking idea the ballads are not altogether without meriti dont know if theyre poetry but theyre good narrative or im deceived youve never said one word about them from which i astutely gather you are dead set against he was a diplomatic manextract from epitaph of e l band remained on good terms with minor poets you will have to judge one of the gladstonian trinity of paths must be chosen 1st either publish the five ballads such as they are in a volume called ballads in which case pray send sheets at once to chatto and windus or 2nd write and tell me you think the book too small and ill try and get into the mood to do some more or 3rd write and tell me the whole thing is a blooming illusion in which case draw off some twenty copies for my private entertainment and charge me with the expense of the whole dream  in the matter of rhyme no man can judge himself i am at the worlds end have no one to consult and my publisher holds his tongue i call it unfair and almost unmanly i do indeed begin to be filled with animosity lord wait till you see the continuation of the wrecker when i introduce some new york publishers its a good scene the quantities you drink and the really hideous language you are represented as employing may perhaps cause you one tithe of the pain you have inflicted by your silence on sir the poetaster       r l s   lloyd is off home my wife and i dwell sundered she in lodgings preparing for the move i here in the club and at my old tradebedridden naturally the visit home is given up we only wait our opportunity to get to samoa where please address me  have i yet asked you to despatch the books and papers left in your care to me at apia samoa i wish you would quam primum       r l s     to henry james        union club sydney august 1890  my dear henry jameskipling is too clever to live the b√™te humaine36 i had already perused in noumea listening the while to the strains of the convict band he is a beast but not human and to be frank not very interesting nervous maladies the homicidal ward would be the better name o this game gets very tedious  your two long and kind letters have helped to entertain the old familiar sickbed so has a book called the bondman by hall caine i wish you would look at it i am not halfway through yet read the book and communicate your views hall caine by the way appears to take hugos view of history and chronology later the book doesnt keep up it gets very wild  i must tell you plainlyi cant tell colvini do not think i shall come to england more than once and then itll be to die health i enjoy in the tropics even here which they call sub or semitropical i come only to catch cold i have not been out since my arrival live here in a nice bedroom by the fireside and read books and letters from henry james and send out to get his tragic muse only to be told they cant be had as yet in sydney and have altogether a placid time but i cant go out the thermometer was nearly down to 50¬∞ the other dayno temperature for me mr james how should i do in england i fear not at all am i very sorry i am sorry about seven or eight people in england and one or two in the states and outside of that i simply prefer samoa these are the words of honesty and soberness i am fasting from all but sin coughing the bondman a couple of eggs and a cup of tea i was never fond of towns houses society or it seems civilisation nor yet it seems was i ever very fond of what is technically called gods green earth the sea islands the islanders the island life and climate make and keep me truly happier these last two years i have been much at sea and i have never wearied sometimes i have indeed grown impatient for some destination more often i was sorry that the voyage drew so early to an end and never once did i lose my fidelity to blue water and a ship it is plain then that for me my exile to the place of schooners and islands can be in no sense regarded as a calamity  goodbye just now i must take a turn at my proofs   nbeven my wife has weakened about the sea she wearied the last time we were ashore to get afloat againyours ever       r l s     to marcel schwob        union club sydney august 19th 1890  my dear mr schwobmais alors vous avez tous les bonheurs vous more about villon it seems incredible when it is put in order pray send it me  you wish to translate the black arrow dear sir you are hereby authorised but i warn you i do not like the work ah if you who know so well both tongues and have taste and instructionif you would but take a fancy to translate a book of mine that i myself admiredfor we sometimes admire our ownor i dowith what satisfaction would the authority be granted but these things are too much to expect vous ne d√©testez pas alors mes bonnes femmes moi je les d√©teste i have never pleased myself with any women of mine save two character parts one of only a few linesthe countess of rosen and madame desprez in the treasure of franchard  i had indeed one moment of pride about my poor black arrow dickon crookback i did and i do think is a spirited and possible figure shakespeareso if we can call that cocoon shakespeareshakespeares is spiritedone likes to see the untaught athlete butting against the adamantine ramparts of human nature head down breech up it reminds us how trivial we are today and what safety resides in our triviality for spirited it may be but o sure not possible i love dumas and i love shakespeare you will not mistake me when i say that the richard of the one reminds me of the porthos of the other and if by any sacrifice of my own literary baggage i could clear the vicomte de bragelonne of porthos jekyll might go and the master and the black arrow you may be sure and i should think my life not lost for mankind if half a dozen more of my volumes must be thrown in  the tone of your pleasant letters makes me egotistical you make me take myself too gravely comprehend how i have lived much of my time in france and loved your country and many of its people and all the time was learning that which your country has to teachbreathing in rather that atmosphere of art which can only there be breathed and all the time knewand raged to knowthat i might write with the pen of angels or of heroes and no frenchman be the least the wiser and now steps in m marcel schwob writes me the most kind encouragement and reads and understands and is kind enough to like my work  i am just now overloaded with work i have two huge novels on handthe wrecker and the pearl fisher37 in collaboration with my stepson the latter the pearl fisher i think highly of for a black ugly trampling violent story full of strange scenes and striking characters and then i am about waistdeep in my big book on the south seas the big book on the south seas it ought to be and shall and besides i have some verses in the press which however i hesitate to publish for i am no judge of my own verse selfdeception is there so facile all this and the cares of an impending settlement in samoa keep me very busy and a cold as usual keeps me in bed  alas i shall not have the pleasure to see you yet awhile if ever you must be content to take me as a wandering voice and in the form of occasional letters from recondite islands and address me if you will be good enough to write to apia samoa my stepson mr osbourne goes home meanwhile to arrange some affairs it is not unlikely he may go to paris to arrange about the illustrations to my south seas in which case i shall ask him to call upon you and give you some word of our outlandish destinies you will find him intelligent i think and i am sure if par hasard you should take any interest in the islands he will have much to tell youherewith i conclude and am your obliged and interested correspondent       robert louis stevenson   psthe story you refer to has got lost in the post     to andrew lang        union club sydney august 1890  my dear langi observed with a great deal of surprise and interest that a controversy in which you have been taking sides at home in yellow london hinges in part at least on the gilbert islanders and their customs in burial nearly six months of my life has been passed in the group i have revisited it but the other day and i make haste to tell you what i know the upright stonesi enclose you a photograph of one on apemamaare certainly connected with religion i do not think they are adored they stand usually on the windward shore of the islands that is to say apart from habitation on enclosed islands where the people live on the sea side i do not know how it is never having lived on one i gathered from tembinoka rex apemamae that the pillars were supposed to fortify the island from invasion spiritual martellos i think he indicated they were connected with the cult of tentipronounce almost as chintz in english the t being explosive but you must take this with a grain of salt for i knew no word of gilbert island and the kings english although creditable is rather vigorous than exact now here follows the point of interest to you such pillars or standing stones have no connection with graves the most elaborate grave that i have ever seen in the groupto be certainis in the form of a raised border of gravel usually strewn with broken glass one of which i cannot be sure that it was a grave for i was told by one that it was and by another that it was notconsisted of a mound about breast high in an excavated taro swamp on the top of which was a childs house or rather maniapathat is to say shed or open house such as is used in the group for social or political gatheringsso small that only a child could creep under its eaves i have heard of another great tomb on apemama which i did not see but here again by all accounts no sign of a standing stone my report would beno connection between standing stones and sepulture i shall however send on the terms of the problem to a highly intelligent resident trader who knows more than perhaps any one living white or native of the gilbert group and you shall have the result in samoa whither i return for good i shall myself make inquiries up to now i have neither seen nor heard of any standing stones in that groupyours       r l stevenson     to miss adelaide boodle      exactly what tale of doings in the garret at skerryvore had been    related to stevenson in the character of robin lewison by his    correspondent in the character of miss green cannot well be    gathered from this reply but the letter is interesting as containing    the only mention of certain schemes of romance afterwards abandoned       union club sydney 1st september 1890  my dear miss boodlei find you have been behaving very ill been very ill in fact i find this hard to forgive probably should not forgive it at all if robin lewison had not been sick himself and a wretched sickroom prisoner in this club for near a month well the best and bravest sometimes fail but who is miss green dont know her i knew a lady of an exceedingly generous and perfervid natureworthy to be suspected of scotch blood for the pertervidnessequipped with a coupleperhaps a brace sounds better englishof perfervid eyeswith a certain graceful gaucherie of manner almost like a childs and that is at once the highest point of gaucherie and gracea friend everybody i ever saw was delighted to see come and sorry to see go yes i knew that lady and can see her now but who was miss green there is something amiss here either the robin lewisons have been very shabbily treated orand this is the serious part of the affairsomebody unknown to me has been entrusted with the key of the skerryvore garret this may go as far as the old bailey maam  but why should i gird at you or anybody when the truth is we are the most miserable sinners in the world for we are not coming home i dare not even coming to sydney has made me quite ill and back i go to samoa whither please addressapia samoaand remember it is s√°m√≥a a spondee to begin with or sahmoa if you prefer that writingback i and my wife go to samoa to live on our landed estate with four black labour boys in a kind of a sort of house which lloyd will describe to you for he has gone to england receive him like a favour and a piece of cake he is our greeting to friends  i paused here to put in the date on the first page i am precious nearly through my fortieth year thinks i to myself must be nearly as old as miss green thinks i o come i exclaimed not as bad as that some lees of youth about the old remnant yet  my amiable miss green i beg you to give me news of your health and if it may be good news and when you shall have seen lloyd to tell me how his reports of the south seas and our new circumstances strike such an awfully old person as yourself and to tell me if you ever received a letter i sent you from hawaii i remember thinkingor remember remembering ratherit was for me quite a long respectable communication also you might tell me if you got my warwhoop and scalpingknife assault on le nomm√© hyde  i ought not to forget to say your tale fetched me miss green by its really vile probability if we had met that man in honolulu he would have done it and miss green would have done it only alas there is no completed novel lying in the garret would there were it should be out tomorrow with the name to it and relieve a kind of tightness in the money market much deplored in our immediate circle to be sure now i come to think of it there are some seven chapters of the great north road three i think of robin run the hedge given up when some nefarious person preempted the name and either thereor somewhere elselikely new yorkone chapter of david balfour and five or six of the memoirs of henry shovel thats all but lloyd and i have onehalf of the wrecker in type and a good part of the pearl fisher o a great and grisly tale that in ms and i have a projected entirely planned lovestoryeverybody will think it dreadfully improper im afraidcalled cannonmills and ive a vague rosy haze before mea lovestory too but not impropercalled the rising sun its the name of the wayside inn where the story or much of the story runs but its a kind of a pun it means the stirring up of a boy by falling in love and how he rises in the estimation of a girl who despised him though she liked him and had befriended him i really scarce see beyond their childhood yet but i want to go beyond and make each outtop the other by successions it should be pretty and true if i could do it also i have my big book the south seas always with me and a sair handfuif i may be allowed to speak scotch to miss greena sair handfu it is likely to be all this literary gossip i bestow upon you entre confr√®res miss green which is little more than fair miss green  allow me to remark that it is now halfpast twelve oclock of the living night i should certainly be ashamed of myself and you also for this is no time of the night for miss green to be colloguing with a comparatively young gentleman of forty so with all the kindest wishes to yourself and all at lostock and all friends in hants or over the borders in dorset i bring my folly to an end please believe even when i am silent in my real affection i need not say the same for fanny more obdurately silent not less affectionate than iyour friend       robertrobin lewison   nearly had it wrongforce of habit     to mrs charles fairchild        union club sydney september 1890  my dear mrs fairchildi began a letter to you on board the janet nicoll on my last cruise wrote i believe two sheets and ruthlessly destroyed the flippant trash your last has given me great pleasure and some pain for it increased the consciousness of my neglect now this must go to you whatever it is like   it is always harshness that one regrets i regret also my letter to dr hyde yes i do i think it was barbarously harsh if i did it now i would defend damien no less well and give less pain to those who are alive these promptings of goodhumour are not all sound the three times three cheer boys cheer and general amiability business rests on a sneaking love of popularity the most insidious enemy of virtue on the whole it was virtuous to defend damien but it was harsh to strike so hard at dr hyde when i wrote the letter i believed he would bring an action in which case i knew i could be beggared and as yet there has come no action the injured doctor has contented himself up to now with the truly innocuous vengeance of calling me a bohemian crank and i have deeply wounded one of his colleagues whom i esteemed and liked  well such is life you are quite right our civilisation is a hollow fraud all the fun of life is lost by it all it gains is that a larger number of persons can continue to be contemporaneously unhappy on the surface of the globe o unhappythere is a big word and a falsecontinue to be not nearlyby about twenty per centso happy as they might be that would be nearer the mark  whenobserve that word which i will write again and largerwhen you come to see us in samoa you will see for yourself a healthy and happy people  you see you are one of the very few of our friends rich enough to come and see us and when my house is built and the road is made and we have enough fruit planted and poultry and pigs raised it is undeniable that you must comemust is the word that is the way in which i speak to ladies you and fairchild anywayperhaps my friend blairwell arrange details in good time it will be the salvation of your souls and make you willing to die  let me tell you this in 74 or 5 there came to stay with my father and mother a certain mr seed a prime minister or something of new zealand he spotted what my complaint was told me that i had no business to stay in europe that i should find all i cared for and all that was good for me in the navigator islands sat up till four in the morning persuading me demolishing my scruples and i resisted i refused to go so far from my father and mother o it was virtuous and o wasnt it silly but my father who was always my dearest got to his grave without that pang and now in 1890 i or what is left of me go at last to the navigator islands god go with us it is but a pisgah sight when all is said i go there only to grow old and die but when you come you will see it is a fair place for the purpose  flaubert38 has not turned up i hope he will soon i knew of him only through maxime descampswith kindest messages to yourself and all of
