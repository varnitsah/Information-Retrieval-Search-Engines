      limberham   the extreme indelicacy of this play would in the present times furnish ample and most just grounds for the unfavourable reception it met with from the public but in the reign of charles ii many plays were applauded in which the painting is at least as coarse as that of dryden bellamira or the mistress a gross translation by sir charles sedley of terences eunuchus had been often represented with the highest approbation but the satire of dryden was rather accounted too personal than too loose the character of limberham has been supposed to represent lauderdale whose age and uncouth figure rendered ridiculous his ungainly affectation of fashionable vices mr malone intimates a suspicion that shaftesbury was the person levelled at whose lameness and infirmities made the satire equally poignant in either supposition a powerful and leading nobleman was offended to whose party all seem to have drawn whose loose conduct in that loose age exposed them to be duped like the hero of the play it is a singular mark of the dissolute manners of those times that an audience to whom matrimonial infidelity was nightly held out not only as the most venial of trespasses but as a matter of triumphant applause were unable to brook any ridicule upon the mere transitory connection formed betwixt the keeper and his mistress dryden had spared neither kind of union and accordingly his opponents exclaimed that he lampooned the court to oblige his friends in the city and ridiculed the city to secure a promising lord at court exposed the kind keepers of covent garden to please the cuckolds of cheapside and drolled on the city dolittles to tickle the coventgarden limberhams1 even langbaine relentless as he is in criticism seems to have considered the condemnation of limberham as the vengeance of the faction ridiculed  in this play which i take to be the best comedy of his he so much exposed the keeping part of the town that the play was stopt when it had but thrice appeared on the stage but the author took a becoming care that the things that offended on the stage were either altered or omitted in the press one of our modern writers in a short satire against keeping concludes thus    dryden good man thought keepers to reclaim   writ a kind satire calld it limberham   this all the herd of letchers straight alarms   from charingcross to bow was up in arms   they damnd the play all at one fatal blow   and broke the glass that did their picture show  mr malone mentions his having seen a ms copy of this play found by lord bolingbroke among the sweepings of popes study in which there occur several indecent passages not to be found in the printed copy these doubtless constituted the castrations which in obedience to the public voice our author expunged from his play after its condemnation it is difficult to guess what could be the nature of the indecencies struck out when we consider those which the poet deemed himself at liberty to retain  the reader will probably easily excuse any remarks upon this comedy it is not absolutely without humour but is so disgustingly coarse as entirely to destroy that merit langbaine with his usual anxiety of research traces back a few of the incidents to the novels of cinthio giraldi and to those of some forgotten french authors  plays even of this nature being worth preservation as containing genuine traces of the manners of the age in which they appear i cannot but remark the promiscuous intercourse which in this comedy and others is represented as taking place betwixt women of character and those who made no pretensions to it bellamira in sir charles sedleys play and mrs tricksy in the following pages are admitted into company with the modest female characters without the least hint of exception or impropriety such were actually the manners of charles the iids time where we find the mistresses of the king and his brothers familiar in the highest circles it appears from the evidence in the case of the duchess of norfolk for adultery that nell gwyn was living with her grace in familiar habits her society doubtless paving the way for the intrigue by which the unfortunate lady lost her rank and reputation2 it is always symptomatic of a total decay of morals where female reputation neither confers dignity nor excites pride in its possessor but is consistent with her mingling in the society of the libertine and the profligate  some of drydens libellers draw an invidious comparison betwixt his own private life and this satire and exhort him to    be to vices which he practised kind  but of the injustice of this charge on drydens character we have spoken fully elsewhere undoubtedly he had the licence of this and his other dramatic writings in his mind when he wrote the following verses where the impurity of the stage is traced to its radical source the debauchery of the court    then courts of kings were held in high renown   ere made the common brothels of the town   there virgins honourable vows received   but chaste as maids in monasteries lived   the king himself to nuptial rites a slave   no bad example to his poets gave   and they not bad but in a vicious age   had not to please the prince debauched the stage                                    wife of baths tale  limberham was acted at the dukes theatre in dorsetgarden for being a satire upon a court vice it was deemed peculiarly calculated for that playhouse the concourse of the citizens thither is alluded to in the prologue to marriagealamode ravenscroft also in his epilogue to the citizen turned gentleman acted at the same theatre disowns the patronage of the courtiers who kept mistresses probably because they constituted the minor part of his audience    from the court party we hope no success   our author is not one of the noblesse   that bravely does maintain his miss in town   whilst my great lady is with speed sent down   and forced in country mansionhouse to fix   that miss may rattle here in coachandsix  the stage for introducing limberham was therefore judiciously chosen although the piece was ill received and withdrawn after being only thrice represented it was printed in 1678

                  john                           lord vaughan c1   my lord  i cannot easily excuse the printing of a play at so unseasonable a time2 when the great plot of the nation like one of pharaohs lean kine has devoured its younger brethren of the stage but however weak my defence might be for this i am sure i should not need any to the world for my dedication to your lordship and if you can pardon my presumption in it that a bad poet should address himself to so great a judge of wit i may hope at least to escape with the excuse of catullus when he writ to cicero    gratias tibi maximas catullus   agit pessimus omnium poeta   tanto pessimus omnium poeta   quanto tu optimns omnium patronus  i have seen an epistle of flecknoes to a nobleman who was by some extraordinary chance a scholar and you may please to take notice by the way how natural the connection of thought is betwixt a bad poet and flecknoe where he begins thus quatuordecim jam elapsi sunt anni c his latin it seems not holding out to the end of the sentence but he endeavoured to tell his patron betwixt two languages which he understood alike that it was fourteen years since he had the happiness to know him it is just so long and as happy be the omen of dulness to me as it is to some clergymen and statesmen since your lordship has known that there is a worse poet remaining in the world than he of scandalous memory who left it last3 i might enlarge upon the subject with my author and assure you that i have served as long for you as one of the patriarchs did for his oldtestament mistress but i leave those flourishes when occasion shall serve for a greater orator to use and dare only tell you that i never passed any part of my life with greater satisfaction or improvement to myself than those years which i have lived in the honour of your lordships acquaintance if i may have only the time abated when the public service called you to another part of the world which in imitation of our florid speakers i might if i durst presume upon the expression call the parenthesis of my life  that i have always honoured you i suppose i need not tell you at this time of day for you know i staid not to date my respects to you from that title which now you have and to which you bring a greater addition by your merit than you receive from it by the name but i am proud to let others know how long it is that i have been made happy by my knowledge of you because i am sure it will give me a reputation with the present age and with posterity and now my lord i know you are afraid lest i should take this occasion which lies so fair for me to acquaint the world with some of those excellencies which i have admired in you but i have reasonably considered that to acquaint the world is a phrase of a malicious meaning for it would imply that the world were not already acquainted with them you are so generally known to be above the meanness of my praises that you have spared my evidence and spoiled my compliment should i take for my common places your knowledge both of the old and the new philosophy should i add to these your skill in mathematics and history and yet farther your being conversant with all the ancient authors of the greek and latin tongues as well as with the moderni should tell nothing new to mankind for when i have once but named you the world will anticipate all my commendations and go faster before me than i can follow be therefore secure my lord that your own fame has freed itself from the danger of a panegyric and only give me leave to tell you that i value the candour of your nature and that one character of friendliness and if i may have leave to call it kindness in you before all those other which make you considerable in the nation4  some few of our nobility are learned and therefore i will not conclude an absolute contradiction in the terms of nobleman and scholar but as the world goes now tis very hard to predicate one upon the other and tis yet more difficult to prove that a nobleman can be a friend to poetry were it not for two or three instances in whitehall and in the town the poets of this age would find so little encouragement for their labours and so few understanders that they might have leisure to turn pamphleteers and augment the number of those abominable scribblers who in this time of licence abuse the press almost every day with nonsense and railing against the government  it remains my lord that i should give you some account of this comedy which you have never seen because it was written and acted in your absence at your government of jamaica it was intended for an honest satire against our crying sin of keeping how it would have succeeded i can but guess for it was permitted to be acted only thrice the crime for which it suffered was that which is objected against the satires of juvenal and the epigrams of catullus that it expressed too much of the vice which it decried your lordship knows what answer was returned by the elder of those poets whom i last mentioned to his accusers    castum esse decet pium poetam   ipsum versiculos nihil necesse est   qui tum denique habent salem ac leporem   si sint molliculi et parum pudici  but i dare not make that apology for myself and therefore have taken a becoming care that those things which offended on the stage might be either altered or omitted in the press for their authority is and shall be ever sacred to me as much absent as present and in all alterations of their fortune who for those reasons have stopped its farther appearance on the theatre and whatsoever hindrance it has been to me in point of profit many of my friends can bear me witness that i have not once murmured against that decree the same fortune once happened to moliere on the occasion of his tartuffe which notwithstanding afterwards has seen the light in a country more bigot than ours and is accounted amongst the best pieces of that poet i will be bold enough to say that this comedy is of the first rank of those which i have written and that posterity will be of my opinion it has nothing of particular satire in it for whatsoever may have been pretended by some critics in the town i may safely and solemnly affirm that no one character has been drawn from any single man and that i have known so many of the same humour in every folly which is here exposed as may serve to warrant it from a particular reflection it was printed in my absence from the town this summer much against my expectation otherwise i had overlooked the press and been yet more careful that neither my friends should have had the least occasion of unkindness against me nor my enemies of upbraiding me but if it live to a second impression i will faithfully perform what has been wanting in this in the mean time my lord i recommend it to your protection and beg i may keep still that place in your favour which i have hitherto enjoyed and which i shall reckon as one of the greatest blessings which can befall    my lord      your lordships most obedient       faithful servant         john dryden   footnotes 1 john lord vaughan was the eldest surviving son of richard earl    of carbery to which title he afterwards succeeded he was a man of    literature and president of the royal society from 1686 to 1689    dryden was distinguished by his patronage as far back as 1664    being fourteen years before the acting of this play lord vaughan    had thus the honour of discovering and admiring the poets genius    before the public applause had fixed his fame and probably better    deserved the panegyric here bestowed than was usual among drydens    patrons he wrote a recommendatory copy of verses which are    prefixed to the conquest of granada mr malone informs us that    this accomplished nobleman died at chelsea on 16th january    171213  2 the great popish plot that scene of mystery and blood broke out    in august 1678  3 flecknoe was a roman catholic priest very much addicted to    scribbling verses his name has been chiefly preserved by our    authors satire of mackflecknoe in which he has depicted    shadwell as the literary son and heir of this wretched poetaster    a few farther particulars concerning him may be found prefixed to    that poem flecknoe from this dedication appears to have been    just deceased the particular passage referred to has not been    discovered even langbaine had never seen it but mr malone points    out a letter of flecknoe to the cardinal barberini whereof the    first sentence is in latin and the next in english our author in    an uncommon strain of selfdepreciation or rather to give a neat    turn to his sentence has avouched himself to be a worse poet than    flecknoe but expressions of modesty in a dedication like those of    panegyric are not to be understood literally as in the latter    dryden often strains a note beyond ela so on the present    occasion he has certainly sounded the very base string of    humility poor flecknoe indeed seems to have become proverbial    as the worst of poets the earl of dorset thus begins a satire on    edward howard       those damned antipodes to common sense      those toils to flecknoe prythee tell me whence      does all this mighty mass of dulness spring      which in such loads thou to the stage dost bring  4 there is a very flat and prosaic imitation of this sentiment in the    duke of buckinghams lines to pope       and yet so wondrous so sublime a thing      as the great iliad scarce could make me sing      except i justly could at once commend      a good companion and as firm a friend      one moral or a mere wellnatured deed      does all desert in sciences exceed     thus prose may be humbled as well as exalted into

subject of this piece has been celebrated by several ancient and modern dramatists of seven tragedies of sophocles which have reached our times two are founded on the history of oedipus the first of these called oedipus tyrannus has been extolled by every critic since the days of aristotle for the unparalleled art with which the story is managed the dreadful secret the existence of which is announced by the pestilence and by the wrath of the offended deities seems each moment on the verge of being explained yet till the last act the reader is still held in horrible suspense every circumstance resorted to for the purpose of evincing the falsehood of the oracle tends gradually to confirm the guilt of oedipus and to accelerate the catastrophe while his own supposed consciousness of innocence at once interests us in his favour and precipitates the horrible discovery dryden who arranged the whole plan of the following tragedy although assisted by lee in the execution was fully aware of the merit of the oedipus tyrannus and with the addition of the underplot of adrastus and eurydice has traced out the events of the drama in close imitation of sophocles the grecian bard however in concurrence with the history or tradition of greece has made oedipus survive the discovery of his unintentional guilt and reserved him in blindness and banishment for the subject of his second tragedy of oedipus coloneus this may have been well judged considering that the audience were intimately acquainted with the important scenes which were to follow among the descendants of oedipus with the first and second wars against thebes and her final conquest by the ancestors of those athenians before whom the play was rehearsed led on by their demigod theseus they were also prepared to receive with reverence and faith the belief on which the whole interest turns that if oedipus should be restored to thebes the vengeance of the gods against the devoted city might be averted and to applaud his determination to remain on athenian ground that the predestined curse might descend on his unnatural sons and ungrateful country but while the modern reader admires the lofty tone of poetry and high strain of morality which pervades oedipus coloneus it must appear more natural to his feelings that the life of the hero stained with unintentional incest and parricide should be terminated as in drydens play upon the discovery of his complicated guilt and wretchedness yet there is something awful in the idea of the monarch blind and exiled innocent in intention though so horribly criminal in fact devoted as it were to the infernal deities and sacred from human power and violence by the very excess of his guilt and misery the account of the death of oedipus coloneus reaches the highest tone of sublimity while the lightning flashes around him he expresses the feeling that his hour is come and the reader anticipates that like malefort in the unnatural combat he is to perish by a thunderbolt yet for the awful catastrophe which we are artfully led to expect is substituted a mysterious termination still more awful oedipus arrays himself in splendid apparel and dismisses his daughters and the attending athenians theseus alone remains with him the storm subsides and the attendants return to the place but oedipus is there no longerhe had not perished by water by sword nor by fireno one but theseus knew the manner of his death with an impressive hint that it was as strange and wonderful as his life had been dismally eventful the poet drops a curtain over the fate of his hero this last sublime scene dryden has not ventured to imitate and the rants of lee are a poor substitute for the calm and determined despair of the oedipus coloneus  seneca perhaps to check the seeds of vice in nero his pupil to whom incest and blood were afterwards so familiar1 composed the latin tragedy on the subject of oedipus which is alluded to by dryden in the following preface the cold declamatory rhetorical stile of that philosopher was adapted precisely to counteract the effect which a tale of terror produces on the feelings and imagination his taste exerted itself in filling up and garnishing the more trifling passages which sophocles had passed over as unworthy of notice and in adjusting incidents laid in the heroic age of grecian simplicity according to the taste and customs of the court of nero2 yet though devoid of dramatic effect of fancy and of genius the oedipus of seneca displays the masculine eloquence and high moral sentiment of its author and if it does not interest us in the scene of fiction it often compels us to turn our thoughts inward and to study our own hearts  the oedipe of corneille is in all respects unworthy of its great author the poet considering as he states in his introduction that the subject of oedipus tearing out his eyes was too horrible to be presented before ladies qualifies its terrors by the introduction of a love intrigue betwixt theseus and dirce the unhappy propensity of the french poets to introduce long discussions upon la belle passion addressed merely to the understanding without respect to feeling or propriety is nowhere more ridiculously displayed than in oedipe the play opens with the following polite speech of theseus to dirce    necoutez plus madame une pitie cruelle   qui dun fidel amant vous ferait un rebelle   la gloire dobeir na rien que me soit doux   lorsque vous mordonnez de meloigner de vous   quelque ravage affreux quetale ici la peste   labsence aux vrais amans est encore plus funeste   et dun si grand peril limage soffre en vain   quand ce peril douteux epargne un mal certain                                    act premiere scene premiere  it is hardly possible more prettily to jingle upon the peril douteux and the mal certain but this is rather an awkward way of introducing the account of the pestilence with which all the other dramatists have opened their scene oedipus however is at once sensible of the cause which detained theseus at his melancholy court amidst the horrors of the plague    je lavais bien juge qu un interet damour   fermait ici vos yeux aux perils de ma cour  oedipo conjectere opus estit would have been difficult for any other person to have divined such a motive the conduct of the drama is exactly suitable to its commencement the fate of oedipus and of thebes the ravages of the pestilence and the avenging of the death of laius are all secondary and subordinate considerations to the loves of theseus and dirce as flat and uninteresting a pair as ever spoke platitudes in french hexameters so much is this the engrossing subject of the drama that oedipus at the very moment when tiresias is supposed to be engaged in raising the ghost of laius occupies himself in a long scene of scolding about love and duty with dirce and it is not till he is almost bullied by her off the stage that he suddenly recollects as an apology for his retreat    mais il faut aller voir ce qua fait tiresias  considering however the declamatory nature of the french dialogue and the peremptory rule of their drama that love or rather gallantry must be the moving principle of every performance it is more astonishing that corneille should have chosen so masculine and agitating a subject than that he should have failed in treating it with propriety or success  in the following tragedy dryden has avowedly adopted the greek model qualified however by the under plot of adrastus and eurydice which contributes little either to the effect or merit of the play creon in his ambition and his deformity is a poor copy of richard iii without his abilities his plots and treasons are baffled by the single appearance of oedipus and as for the loves and woes of eurydice and the prince of argos they are lost in the horrors of the principal story like the moonlight amid the glare of a conflagration in other respects the conduct of the piece closely follows the oedipus tyrannus and in some respects even improves on that excellent model the tiresias of sophocles for example upon his first introduction denounces oedipus as the slayer of laius braves his resentment and prophesies his miserable catastrophe in drydens play the first anathema of the prophet is levelled only against the unknown murderer and it is not till the powers of hell have been invoked that even the eye of the prophet can penetrate the horrible veil and fix the guilt decisively upon oedipus by this means the striking quarrel betwixt the monarch and tiresias is with great art postponed to the third act and the interest of course is more gradually heightened than in the grecian tragedy  the first and third acts which were wholly written by dryden maintain a decided superiority over the rest of the piece yet there are many excellent passages scattered through lees scenes and as the whole was probably corrected by dryden the tragedy has the appearance of general consistence and uniformity there are several scenes in which dryden seems to have indulged his newly adopted desire of imitating the stile of shakespeare such are in particular the scene of oedipus walking in his sleep which bears marks of drydens pen and such also is the incantation in the third act seneca and corneille have thrown this last scene into narrative yet by the present large size of our stages and the complete management of light and shade the incantation might be represented with striking effect an advantage which i fear has been gained by the sacrifice of others much more essential to the drama considered as a dignified and rational amusement the incantation itself is nobly written and the ghost of laius can only be paralleled in shakespeare  the language of oedipus is in general nervous pure and elegant and the dialogue though in so high a tone of passion is natural and affecting some of lees extravagancies are lamentable exceptions to this observation this may be instanced in the passage where jocasta threatens to fire olympus destroy the heavenly furniture and smoke the deities like bees out of their ambrosial hives and such is the still more noted wish of oedipus    through all the inmost chambers of the sky   may there not be a glimpse one starry spark   but gods meet gods and jostle in the dark  these blemishes however are entitled to some indulgence from the reader when they occur in a work of real genius those who do not strive at excellence will seldom fall into absurdity as he who is contented to walk is little liable to stumble  notwithstanding the admirable disposition of the parts of this play the gradual increase of the interest and the strong impassioned language of the dialogue the disagreeable nature of the plot forms an objection to its success upon a british stage distress which turns upon the involutions of unnatural or incestuous passion carries with it something too disgusting for the sympathy of a refined age whereas in a simple state of society the feelings require a more powerful stimulus as we see the vulgar crowd round an object of real horror with the same pleasure we reap from seeing it represented on a theatre besides in ancient times in those of the roman empire at least such abominations really occurred as sanctioned the story of oedipus but the change of manners has introduced not only greater purity of moral feeling but a sensibility which retreats with abhorrence even from a fiction turning upon such circumstances hence garrick who well knew the taste of an english audience renounced his intention of reviving the excellent old play of king and no king and hence massingers still more awful tragedy of the unnatural combat has been justly deemed unfit for a modern stage independent of this disgusting circumstance it may be questioned whether the horror of this tragedy is not too powerful for furnishing mere amusement it is said in the companion to the playhouse that when the piece was performing at dublin a musician in the orchestra was so powerfully affected by the madness of oedipus as to become himself actually delirious and though this may be exaggerated it is certain that when the play was revived about thirty years ago the audience were unable to support it to an end the boxes being all emptied before the third act was concluded among all our english plays there is none more determinedly bloody than oedipus in its progress and conclusion the entrance of the unfortunate king with his eyes torn from their sockets is too disgusting for representation3 of all the persons of the drama scarce one survives the fifth act oedipus dashes out his brains jocasta stabs herself their children are strangled creon kills eurydice adrastus kills creon and the insurgents kill adrastus when we add to this that the conspirators are hanged the reader will perceive that the play which began with a pestilence concludes with a massacre    and darkness is the burier of the dead  another objection to oedipus has been derived from the doctrine of fatalism inculcated by the story there is something of cant in talking much upon the influence of a theatre on public morals yet i fear though the most moral plays are incapable of doing much good the turn of others may make a mischievous impression by embodying in verse and rendering apt for the memory maxims of an impious or profligate tendency in this point of view there is at least no edification in beholding the horrible crimes unto which oedipus is unwillingly plunged and in witnessing the dreadful punishment he sustains though innocent of all moral or intentional guilt corneille has endeavoured to counterbalance the obvious conclusion by a long tirade upon freewill which i have subjoined as it contains some striking ideas4 but the doctrine which it expresses is contradictory of the whole tenor of the story and the correct deduction is much more justly summed up by seneca in the stoical maxim of necessity    fatis agimur cedite fatis   non solicitæ possunt curæ   mutare rati stamina fusi   quicquid patimur mortale genus   quicquid facimus venit ex alto   servatque sua decreta colus   lachesis dura revoluta manu  some degree of poetical justice might have been preserved and a valuable moral inculcated had the conduct of oedipus in his combat with laius been represented as atrocious or at least unwarrantable as the sequel would then have been a warning how impossible it is to calculate the consequences or extent of a single act of guilt but after all dryden perhaps extracts the true moral while stating our insufficiency to estimate the distribution of good and evil in human life in a passage which in excellent poetry expresses more sound truth than a whole shelf of philosophers    the gods are just   but how can finite measure infinite   reason alas it does not know itself   yet man vain man would with this shortlined plummet   fathom the vast abyss of heavenly justice   whatever is is in its causes just   since all things are by fate but purblind man   sees but a part othe chain the nearest links   his eyes not carrying to that equal beam   that poises all above  the prologue states that the play if damned may be recorded as the first buried since the woollen act this enables us to fix the date of the performance by the 30th charles ii cap 3 all persons were appointed to be buried in woollen after 1st august 1678 the play must therefore have been represented early in the season 16789 it was not printed until 1679   footnotes 1 nero is said to have represented the character of oedipus amongst    others of the same horrible castsuetonius lib vi cap 21  2 thus seneca is justly ridiculed by dacier for sending laius forth    with a numerous party of guards to avoid the indecorum of a king    going abroad too slenderly attended the guards lose their way    within a league of their masters capital and by this awkward    contrivance their absence is accounted for when he is met by    oedipus  3 voltaire however held a different opinion he thought a powerful    effect might be produced by the exhibition of the blind king    indistinctly seen in the back ground amid the shrieks of jocasta    and the exclamations of the thebans provided the actor was capable    of powerful gesture and of expressing much passion with little    declamation  4   quoi la necessite des vertus et des vices      dun astre imperieux doit suivre les caprices      et delphes malgré nous conduit nos actions      au plus bizarre

raise too great an expectation especially in works of this nature where we are to please an insatiable audience yet it is reasonable to prepossess them in favour of an author and therefore both the prologue and epilogue informed you that oedipus was the most celebrated piece of all antiquity that sophocles not only the greatest wit but one of the greatest men in athens made it for the stage at the public cost and that it had the reputation of being his masterpiece not only among the seven of his which are still remaining but of the greater number which are perished aristotle has more than once admired it in his book of poetry horace has mentioned it lucullus julius cæsar and other noble romans have written on the same subject though their poems are wholly lost but senecas is still preserved in our own age corneille has attempted it and it appears by his preface with great success but a judicious reader will easily observe how much the copy is inferior to the original he tells you himself that he owes a great part of his success to the happy episode of theseus and dirce which is the same thing as if we should acknowledge that we were indebted for our good fortune to the underplot of adrastus eurydice and creon the truth is he miserably failed in the character of his hero if he desired that oedipus should be pitied he should have made him a better man he forgot that sophocles had taken care to show him in his first entrance a just a merciful a successful a religious prince and in short a father of his country instead of these he has drawn him suspicious designing more anxious of keeping the theban crown than solicitous for the safety of his people hectored by theseus condemned by dirce and scarce maintaining a second part in his own tragedy this was an error in the first concoction and therefore never to be mended in the second or the third he introduced a greater hero than oedipus himself for when theseus was once there that companion of hercules must yield to none the poet was obliged to furnish him with business to make him an equipage suitable to his dignity and by following him too close to lose his other king of brentford in the crowd seneca on the other side as if there were no such thing as nature to be minded in a play is always running after pompous expression pointed sentences and philosophical notions more proper for the study than the stage the frenchman followed a wrong scent and the roman was absolutely at cold hunting all we could gather out of corneille was that an episode must be but not his way and seneca supplied us with no new hint but only a relation which he makes of his tiresias raising the ghost of laius which is here performed in view of the audiencethe rites and ceremonies so far his as he agreed with antiquity and the religion of the greeks but he himself was beholden to homers tiresias in the odysses for some of them and the rest have been collected from heliodores ethiopiques and lucans erictho1 sophocles indeed is admirable everywhere and therefore we have followed him as close as possibly we could but the athenian theatre whether more perfect than ours is not now disputed had a perfection differing from ours you see there in every act a single scene or two at most which manage the business of the play and after that succeeds the chorus which commonly takes up more time in singing than there has been employed in speaking the principal person appears almost constantly through the play but the inferior parts seldom above once in the whole tragedy the conduct of our stage is much more difficult where we are obliged never to lose any considerable character which we have once presented custom likewise has obtained that we must form an underplot of second persons which must be depending on the first and their bywalks must be like those in a labyrinth which all of them lead into the great parterre or like so many several lodging chambers which have their outlets into the same gallery perhaps after all if we could think so the ancient method as it is the easiest is also the most natural and the best for variety as it is managed is too often subject to breed distraction and while we would please too many ways for want of art in the conduct we please in none2 but we have given you more already than was necessary for a preface and for aught we know may gain no more by our instructions than that politic nation is like to do who have taught their enemies to fight so long that at last they are in a condition to invade them3   footnotes 1 heliodorus bishop of trica wrote a romance in greek called the    ethiopiques containing the amours of theagenes and chariclea he    was so fond of this production that the option being proposed to    him by a synod he rather chose to resign his bishopric than    destroy his work there occurs a scene of incantation in this    romance the story of lucans witch occurs in the sixth book of the    pharsalia     dryden has judiciously imitated seneca in representing necromancy    as the last resort of tiresias after all milder modes of augury    had failed  2 it had been much to be wished that our author had preferred his    own better judgment and the simplicity of the greek plot to    compliance with this foolish custom  3 this seems to allude to the french who after having repeatedly    reduced the dutch to extremity were about

is a common idea that falling stars as they are called are    converted into a sort of jelly among the rest i had often the    opportunity to see the seeming shooting of the stars from place to    place and sometimes they appeared as if falling to the ground    where i once or twice found a white jellylike matter among the    grass which i imagined to be distilled from them and hence    foolishly conjectured that the stars themselves must certainly    consist of a like substance  7 serpens serpentem vorans fit draco peccata peccatis    superaddita monstra fiunt hieroglyphica

time to solace the    king with this long description of a place which he doubtless knew    as well as creon himself dryden on the contrary has with great    address rendered the description necessary

a pope in effigy was a ceremony performed upon the    anniversary of queen elizabeths coronation when parties ran high    betwixt the courtiers and opposition in the latter part of charles    the ii reign these antipapal solemnities were conducted by the    latter with great state and expence and employed as engines to    excite the popular resentment against the duke of york and his    religion the following curious description of one of these    tumultuary processions in 1679 was extracted by ralph from a    very scarce pamphlet it is the ceremony referred to in the    epilogue and it shall be given at length as the subject is    frequently alluded to by dryden     illustration     the solemn mock procession of the pope cardinals jesuits       friars c     through the city of london november 17th 1679      london published january 1808 by william miller albemarle street     dryden works to face vol 6th page 223     on the said 17th of november 1679 the bells generally about    the town began to ring at three oclock in the morning at the    approach of the evening all things being in readiness the solemn    procession began setting forth from moregate and so passed first    to aldgate and thence through leadenhallstreet by the royal    exchange through cheapside and so to templebar in the ensuing    order viz     1 came six whifflers to clear the way in pioneer caps and red        waistcoats     2 a bellman ringing and with a loud but doleful voice crying        out all the way remember justice godfrey     3 a dead body representing justice godfrey in a decent black        habit carried before a jesuit in black on horseback in        like manner as he was carried by the assassins to primrose        hill     4 next after sir edmonbury so mounted came a priest in a        surplice with a cope embroidered with dead bones skeletons        skulls and the like giving pardons very plentifully to all        those who should murder protestants and proclaiming it        meritorious     5 then a priest in black alone with a great silver cross     6 four carmelites in white and black habits     7 four greyfriars in the proper habits of their order     8 six jesuits with bloody daggers     9 a concert of wind music     10 four bishops in purple and lawn sleeves with a golden        crosier on their breast and crosierstaves in their hands     11 four other bishops in pontificalibus with surplices and        rich embroidered copes and golden mitres on their heads     12 six cardinals in scarlet robes and caps     13 the popes doctor ie wakemana with jesuitspowder in        one hand and an urinal in the other     14 two priests in surplices with two golden crosses     lastly the pope in a lofty glorious pageant representing a    chair of state covered with scarlet richly embroidered and    fringed and bedecked with golden balls and crosses at his feet a    cushion of state and two boys in surplices with white silk    banners and bloody crucifixes and daggers with an incense pot    before them censing his holiness who was arrayed in a splendid    scarlet gown lined through with ermin and richly daubed with gold    and silver lace on his head a triple crown of gold and a glorious    collar of gold and precious stones st peters keys a number of    beads agnus deis and other catholic trumpery at his back his    holinesss privy counsellor the degraded seraphim anglice the    devil frequently caressing hugging and whispering him and oft    times instructing him aloud to destroy his majesty to forge a    protestant plot and to fire the city again to which purpose he    held an infernal torch in his hand     the whole procession was attended with 150 flambeaux and lights    by order but so many more came in volunteers as made up some    thousands     never were the balconies windows and houses more numerously    lined or the streets closer throngd with multitudes of people    all expressing their abhorrence of popery with continual shouts    and exclamations so that tis modestly computed that in the    whole progress there could not be fewer than two hundred thousand    spectators     thus with a slow and solemn state they proceeded to temple bar    where with innumerable swarms the houses seemed to be converted    into heaps of men and women and children for whose diversion    there were provided great variety of excellent fireworks     temple bar being since its rebuilding adorned with four stately    statues viz those of queen elizabeth and king james on the    inward or eastern side fronting the city and those of king    charles the i of blessed memory and our present gracious    sovereign whom god in mercy to these nations long preserve on    the outside facing towards westminster and the statue of queen    elizabeth in regard to the day having on a crown of gilded laurel    and in her hand a golden shield with this motto inscribed the    protestant religion and magna charta and flambeaux placed before    it the pope being brought up near thereunto the following song    alluding to the posture of those statues was sung in parts    between one representing the english cardinal howardb and    others acting the people             cardinal norfolk       from york to london town we come        to talk of popish ire      to reconcile you all to rome        and prevent smithfield

entertained the thronging spectators for some time    with the ingenious fireworks a vast bonfire being prepared just    over against the inner temple gate his holiness after some    compliments and reluctancies was decently toppled from all his    grandeur into the impartial flames the crafty devil leaving his    infallibilityship in the lurch and laughing as heartily at his    deserved ignominious end as subtle jesuits do at the ruin of    bigotted lay catholics whom themselves have drawn in or as    credulous colemans abettors did when with pretences of a    reprieve at last gasp

of troilus and cressida was one of the more modern fables engrafted during the dark ages on the tale of troy divine chaucer who made it the subject of a long and somewhat dull poem professes to have derived his facts from an author of the middle ages called lollius to whom he often refers and who he states to have written in latin tyrwhitt disputes the existence of this personage and supposes chaucers original to have been the philostrato dell amorose fatiche de troilo a work of boccacio but chaucer was never reluctant in acknowledging obligations to his contemporaries when such really existed and mr tyrwhitts opinion seems to be successfully combated by mr godwin in his life of chaucer the subject whencesoever derived was deemed by shakespeare worthy of the stage and his tragedy of troilus and cressida contains so many scenes of distinguished excellence that it could have been wished our author had mentioned it with more veneration in truth even the partiality of an editor must admit that on this occasion the modern improvements of dryden shew to very little advantage beside the venerable structure to which they have been attached the arrangement of the plot is indeed more artificially modelled but the preceding age during which the infidelity of cressida was proverbially current could as little have endured a catastrophe turning upon the discovery of her innocence as one which should have exhibited helen chaste or hector a coward in drydens time the prejudice against this unfortunate female was probably forgotten as her history had become less popular there appears however something too nice and fastidious in the critical rule which exacts that the hero and heroine of the drama shall be models of virtuous perfection in the most interesting of the ancient plays we find this limitation neglected with great success and it would have been more natural to have brought about the catastrophe on the plan of shakespeare and chaucer than by the forced mistake in which drydens lovers are involved and the stale expedient of cressidas killing herself to evince her innocence for the superior order and regard to the unity of place with which dryden has newmodelled the scenes and entries he must be allowed the full praise which he claims in the preface  in the dialogue considered as distinct from the plot dryden appears not to have availed himself fully of the treasures of his predecessor he has pitilessly retrenched the whole scene in the 3d act between ulysses and achilles full of the purest and most admirable moral precept expressed in the most poetical and dignified language1 probably this omission arose from drydens desire to simplify the plot by leaving out the intrigues of the grecian chiefs and limiting the interest to the amours of troilus and cressida but he could not be insensible to the merit of this scene though he has supplied it by one far inferior in which ulysses is introduced using gross flattery to the buffoon thersites in the latter part of the play dryden has successfully exerted his own inventive powers the quarrelling scene between hector and troilus is very impressive and no bad imitation of that betwixt brutus and cassius with which dryden seems to have been so much charmed and which he has repeatedly striven to emulate the parting of hector and andromache contains some affecting passages some of which may be traced back to homer although the pathos upon the whole is far inferior to that of the noted scene in the iliad and destitute of the noble simplicity of the grecian bard  mr godwin has justly remarked that the delicacy of chaucers ancient tale has suffered even in the hands of shakespeare but in those of dryden it has undergone a far deeper deterioration whatever is coarse and naked in shakespeare has been dilated into ribaldry by the poet laureat of charles the second and the character of pandarus in particular is so grossly heightened as to disgrace even the obliging class to whom that unfortunate procurer has bequeathed his name so far as this play is to be considered as an alteration of shakespeare i fear it must be allowed that our author has suppressed some of his finest poetry and exaggerated some of his worst faults  troilus and cressida was published in 1679   footnote 1 i need only recall to the readers remembrance the following

promise you much of poetry in my play it is but reasonable that i should secure you from any part of it in my dedication and indeed i cannot better distinguish the exactness of your taste from that of other men than by the plainness and sincerity of my address i must keep my hyperboles in reserve for men of other understandings an hungry appetite after praise and a strong digestion of it will bear the grossness of that diet but one of so critical a judgment as your lordship who can set the bounds of just and proper in every subject would give me small encouragement for so bold an undertaking i more than suspect my lord that you would not do common justice to yourself and therefore were i to give that character of you which i think you truly merit i would make my appeal from your lordship to the reader and would justify myself from flattery by the public voice whatever protestation you might enter to the contrary but i find i am to take other measures with your lordship i am to stand upon my guard with you and to approach you as warily as horace did augustus    cui malè si palpere recalcitrat undique tutus  an illtimed or an extravagant commendation would not pass upon you but you would keep off such a dedicator at armsend and send him back with his encomiums to this lord or that lady who stood in need of such trifling merchandise you see my lord what an awe you have upon me when i dare not offer you that incense which would be acceptable to other patrons but am forced to curb myself from ascribing to you those honours which even an enemy could not deny you yet i must confess i never practised that virtue of moderation which is properly your character with so much reluctancy as now for it hinders me from being true to my own knowledge in not witnessing your worth and deprives me of the only means which i had left to shew the world that true honour and uninterested respect which i have always paid you i would say somewhat if it were possible which might distinguish that veneration i have for you from the flatteries of those who adore your fortune but the eminence of your condition in this particular is my unhappiness for it renders whatever i would say suspected professions of service submissions and attendance are the practice of all men to the great and commonly they who have the least sincerity perform them best as they who are least engaged in love have their tongues the freest to counterfeit a passion for my own part i never could shake off the rustic bashfulness which hangs upon my nature but valuing myself at as little as i am worth have been afraid to render even the common duties of respect to those who are in power the ceremonious visits which are generally paid on such occasions are not my talent they may be real even in courtiers but they appear with such a face of interest that a modest man would think himself in danger of having his sincerity mistaken for his design my congratulations keep their distance and pass no farther than my heart there it is that i have all the joy imaginable when i see true worth rewarded and virtue uppermost in the world  if therefore there were one to whom i had the honour to be known and to know him so perfectly that i could say without flattery he had all the depth of understanding that was requisite in an able statesman and all that honesty which commonly is wanting that he was brave without vanity and knowing without positiveness that he was loyal to his prince and a lover of his country that his principles were full of moderation and all his counsels such as tended to heal and not to widen the breaches of the nation that in all his conversation there appeared a native candour and a desire of doing good in all his actions if such an one whom i have described were at the helm if he had risen by his merits and were chosen out in the necessity and pressures of affairs to remedy our confusions by the seasonableness of his advice and to put a stop to our ruin when we were just rolling downward to the precipice i should then congratulate the age in which i live for the common safety i should not despair of the republic though hannibal were at the gates i should send up my vows for the success of such an action as virgil did on the like occasion for his patron when he was raising up his country from the desolations of a civil war    hunc saltem everso juvenem succurrere seclo   ne superi prohibete  i know not whither i am running in this extacy which is now upon me i am almost ready to reassume the ancient rights of poetry to point out and prophecy the man who was born for no less an undertaking and whom posterity shall bless for its accomplishment methinks i am already taking fire from such a character and making room for him under a borrowed name amongst the heroes of an epic poem neither could mine or some more happy genius want encouragement under such a patron    pollio amat nostram quamvis sit rustica musam  but these are considerations afar off my lord the former part of the prophecy must be first accomplished the quiet of the nation must be secured and a mutual trust betwixt prince and people be renewed and then this great and good man will have leisure for the ornaments of peace and make our language as much indebted to his care as the french is to the memory of their famous richelieu2 you know my lord how low he laid the foundations of so great a work that he began it with a grammar and a dictionary without which all those remarks and observations which have since been made had been performed to as little purpose as it would be to consider the furniture of the rooms before the contrivance of the house propriety must first be stated ere any measures of elegance can be taken neither is one vaugelas sufficient for such a work3 it was the employment of the whole academy for many years for the perfect knowledge of a tongue was never attained by any single person the court the college and the town must be joined in it and as our english is a composition of the dead and living tongues there is required a perfect knowledge not only of the greek and latin but of the old german the french and the italian and to help all these a conversation with those authors of our own who have written with the fewest faults in prose and verse but how barbarously we yet write and speak your lordship knows and i am sufficiently sensible in my own english for i am often put to a stand in considering whether what i write be the idiom of the tongue or false grammar and nonsense couched beneath that specious name of anglicism and have no other way to clear my doubts but by translating my english into latin and thereby trying what sense the words will bear in a more stable language i am desirous if it were possible that we might all write with the same certainty of words and purity of phrase to which the italians first arrived and after them the french at least that we might advance so far as our tongue is capable of such a standard it would mortify an englishman to consider that from the time of boccace and of petrarch the italian has varied very little and that the english of chaucer their contemporary is not to be understood without the help of an old dictionary but their goth and vandal had the fortune to be grafted on a roman stock ours has the disadvantage to be founded on the dutch4 we are full of monosyllables and those clogged with consonants and our pronunciation is effeminate all which are enemies to a sounding language it is true that to supply our poverty we have trafficked with our neighbour nations by which means we abound as much in words as amsterdam does in religions but to order them and make them useful after their admission is the difficulty a greater progress has been made in this since his majestys return than perhaps since the conquest to his time but the better part of the work remains unfinished and that which has been done already since it has only been in the practice of some few writers must be digested into rules and method before it can be profitable to the general will your lordship give me leave to speak out at last and to acquaint the world that from your encouragement and patronage we may one day expect to speak and write a language worthy of the english wit and which foreigners may not disdain to learn your birth your education your natural endowments the former employments which you have had abroad and that which to the joy of good men you now exercise at home seem all to conspire to this design the genius of the nation seems to call you out as it were by name to polish and adorn your native language and to take from it the reproach of its barbarity it is upon this encouragement that i have adventured on the following critique which i humbly present you together with the play in which though i have not had the leisure nor indeed the encouragement to proceed to the principal subject of it which is the words and thoughts that are suitable to tragedy yet the whole discourse has a tendency that way and is preliminary to it in what i have already done i doubt not but i have contradicted some of my former opinions in my loose essays of the like nature but of this i dare affirm that it is the fruit of my riper age and experience and that selflove or envy have no part in it the application to english authors is my own and therein perhaps i may have erred unknowingly but the foundation of the rules is reason and the authority of those living critics who have had the honour to be known to you abroad as well as of the ancients who are not less of your acquaintance whatsoever it be i submit it to your lordships judgment from which i never will appeal unless it be to your good nature and your candour if you can allow an hour of leisure to the perusal of it i shall be fortunate that i could so long entertain you if not i shall at least have the satisfaction to know that your time was more usefully employed upon the public i am    my lord      your lordships most obedient       humble servant         john dryden   footnotes 1 this was the famous earl of sunderland who being a tory under the    reign of charles a papist in that of his successor and a whig in    that of william was a favourite minister of all these monarchs he    was a man of eminent abilities and our author shews a high opinion    of his taste by abstaining from the gross flattery which was then    the fashionable stile of dedication  2 alluding to the institution of an academy for fixing the language    often proposed about this period  3 author of a treatise on the french language  4 dutch is here used generally for the high dutch or german                                      the                                 preface   the poet Æschylus was held in the same veneration by the athenians of afterages as shakespeare is by us and longinus has judged in favour of him that he had a noble boldness of expression and that his imaginations were lofty and heroic but on the other side quintilian affirms that he was daring to extravagance it is certain that he affected pompous words and that his sense was obscured by figures notwithstanding these imperfections the value of his writings after his decease was such that his countrymen ordained an equal reward to those poets who could alter his plays to be acted on the theatre with those whose productions were wholly new and of their own the case is not the same in england though the difficulties of altering are greater and our reverence for shakespeare much more just than that of the grecians for Æschylus in the age of that poet the greek tongue was arrived to its full perfection they had then amongst them an exact standard of writing and of speaking the english language is not capable of such a certainty and we are at present so far from it that we are wanting in the very foundation of it a perfect grammar yet it must be allowed to the present age that the tongue in general is so much refined since shakespeares time that many of his words and more of his phrases are scarce intelligible and of those which we understand some are ungrammatical others coarse and his whole style is so pestered with figurative expressions that it is as affected as it is obscure it is true that in his latter plays he had worn off somewhat of the rust but the tragedy which i have undertaken to correct was in all probability one of his first endeavours on the stage  the original story was written by one lollius a lombard in latin verse and translated by chaucer into english intended i suppose a satire on the inconstancy of women i find nothing of it among the ancients not so much as the name cressida once mentioned shakespeare as i hinted in the apprenticeship of his writing modelled it into that play which is now called by the name of troilus and cressida but so lamely is it left to us that it is not divided into acts which fault i ascribe to the actors who printed it after shakespeares death and that too so carelessly that a more uncorrected copy i never saw for the play itself the author seems to have begun it with some fire the characters of pandarus and thersites are promising enough but as if he grew weary of his task after an entrance or two he lets them fall and the latter part of the tragedy is nothing but a confusion of drums and trumpets excursions and alarms the chief persons who give name to the tragedy are left alive cressida is false and is not punished yet after all because the play was shakespeares and that there appeared in some places of it the admirable genius of the author i undertook to remove that heap of rubbish under which many excellent thoughts lay wholly buried accordingly i new modelled the plot threw out many unnecessary persons improved those characters which were begun and left unfinished as hector troilus pandarus and thersites and added that of andromache after this i made with no small trouble an order and connection of all the scenes removing them from the places where they were inartificially set and though it was impossible to keep them all unbroken because the scene must be sometimes in the city and sometimes in the camp yet i have so ordered them that there is a coherence of them with one another and a dependence on the main design no leaping from troy to the grecian tents and thence back again in the same act but a due proportion of time allowed for every motion i need not say that i have refined his language which before was obsolete but i am willing to acknowledge that as i have often drawn his english nearer to our times so i have sometimes conformed my own to his and consequently the language is not altogether so pure as it is significant the scenes of pandarus and cressida of troilus and pandarus of andromache with hector and the trojans in the second act are wholly new together with that of nestor and ulysses with thersites and that of thersites with ajax and achilles  i will not weary my reader with the scenes which are added of pandarus and the lovers in the third and those of thersites which are wholly altered but i cannot omit the last scene in it which is almost half the act betwixt troilus and hector the occasion of raising it was hinted to me by mr betterton the contrivance and working of it was my own they who think to do me an injury by saying that it is an imitation of the scene betwixt brutus and cassius do me an honour by supposing i could imitate the incomparable shakespeare but let me add that if shakespeares scene or that faulty copy of it in amintor and melantius had never been yet euripides had furnished me with an excellent example in his iphigenia between agamemnon and menelaus and from thence indeed the last turn of it is borrowed the occasion which shakespeare euripides and fletcher have all taken is the samegrounded upon friendship and the quarrel of two virtuous men raised by natural degrees to the extremity of passion is conducted in all three to the declination of the same passion and concludes with a warm renewing of their friendship but the particular groundwork which shakespeare has taken is incomparably the best because he has not only chosen two of the greatest heroes of their age but has likewise interested the liberty of rome and their own honours who were the redeemers of it in this debate and if he has made brutus who was naturally a patient man to fly into excess at first let it be remembered in his defence that just before he has received the news of portias death whom the poet on purpose neglecting a little chronology supposes to have died before brutus only to give him an occasion of being more easily exasperated add to this that the injury he had received from cassius had long been brooding in his mind and that a melancholy man upon consideration of an affront especially from a friend would be more eager in his passion than he who had given it though naturally more choleric euripides whom i have followed has raised the quarrel betwixt two brothers who were friends the foundation of the scene was this the grecians were windbound at the port of aulis and the oracle had said that they could not sail unless agamemnon delivered up his daughter to be sacrificed he refuses his brother menelaus urges the public safety the father defends himself by arguments of natural affection and hereupon they quarrel agamemnon is at last convinced and promises to deliver up iphigenia but so passionately laments his loss that menelaus is grieved to have been the occasion of it and by a return of kindness offers to intercede for him with the grecians that his daughter might not be sacrificed but my friend mr rymer has so largely and with so much judgment described this scene in comparing it with that of melantius and amintor that it is superfluous to say more of it i only named the heads of it that any reasonable man might judge it was from thence i modelled my scene betwixt troilus and hector i will conclude my reflections on it with a passage of longinus concerning platos imitation of homer we ought not to regard a good imitation as a theft but as a beautiful idea of him who undertakes to imitate by forming himself on the invention and the work of another man for he enters into the lists like a new wrestler to dispute the prize with the former champion this sort of emulation says hesiod is honourable greek agathê d eris esti brotoisinwhen we combat for victory with a hero and are not without glory even in our overthrow those great men whom we propose to ourselves as patterns of our imitation serve us as a torch which is lifted up before us to enlighten our passage and often elevate our thoughts as high as the conception we have of our authors genius  i have been so tedious in three acts that i shall contract myself in the two last the beginning scenes of the fourth act are either added or changed wholly by me the middle of it is shakespeare altered and mingled with my own three or four of the last scenes are altogether new and the whole fifth act both the plot and the writing are my own additions  but having written so much for imitation of what is excellent in that part of the preface which related only to myself methinks it would neither be unprofitable nor unpleasant to inquire how far we ought to imitate our own poets shakespeare and fletcher in their tragedies and this will occasion another inquiry how those two writers differ between themselves but since neither of these questions can be solved unless some measures be first taken by which we may be enabled to judge truly of their writings i shall endeavour as briefly as i can to discover the grounds and reason of all criticism applying them in this place only to tragedy aristotle with his interpreters and horace and longinus are the authors to whom i owe my lights and what part soever of my own plays or of this which no mending could make regular shall fall under the condemnation of such judges it would be impudence in me to defend i think it no shame to retract my errors and am well pleased to suffer in the cause if the art may be improved at my expence i therefore proceed to                   the grounds of criticism in tragedy  tragedy is thus defined by aristotle omitting what i thought unnecessary in his definition it is an imitation of one entire great and probable action not told but represented which by moving in us fear and pity is conducive to the purging of those two passions in our minds more largely thus tragedy describes or paints an action which action must have all the properties above named first it must be one or single that is it must not be a history of one mans life suppose of alexander the great or julius cæsar but one single action of theirs this condemns all shakespeares historical plays which are rather chronicles represented than tragedies and all double action of plays as to avoid a satire upon others i will make bold with my own marriage alamode where there are manifestly two actions not depending on one another but in oedipus there cannot properly be said to be two actions because the love of adrastus and eurydice has a necessary dependence on the principal design into which it is woven the natural reason of this rule is plain for two different independent actions distract the attention and concernment of the audience and consequently destroy the intention of the poet if his business be to move terror and pity and one of his actions he comical the other tragical the former will divert the people and utterly make void his greater purpose therefore as in perspective so in tragedy there must be a point of sight in which all the lines terminate otherwise the eye wanders and the work is false this was the practice of the grecian stage but terence made an innovation in the roman all his plays have double actions for it was his custom to translate two greek comedies and to weave them into one of his yet so that both their actions were comical and one was principal the other but secondary or subservient and this has obtained on the english stage to give us the pleasure of variety  as the action ought to be one it ought as such to have order in it that is to have a natural beginning a middle and an end a natural beginning says aristotle is that which could not necessarily have been placed after another thing and so of the rest this consideration will arraign all plays after the new model of spanish plots where accident is heaped upon accident and that which is first might as reasonably be last an inconvenience not to be remedied but by making one accident naturally produce another otherwise it is a farce and not a play of this nature is the slighted maid where there is no scene in the first act which might not by as good reason be in the fifth and if the action ought to be one the tragedy ought likewise to conclude with the action of it thus in mustapha the play should naturally have ended with the death of zanger and not have given us the gracecup after dinner of solymans divorce from roxolana  the following properties of the action are so easy that they need not my explaining it ought to be great and to consist of great persons to distinguish it from comedy where the action is trivial and the persons of inferior rank the last quality of the action is that it ought to be probable as well as admirable and great it is not necessary that there should be historical truth in it but always necessary that there should be a likeness of truth something that is more than barely possible probable being that which succeeds or happens oftener than it misses to invent therefore a probability and to make it wonderful is the most difficult undertaking in the art of poetry for that which is not wonderful is not great and that which is not probable will not delight a reasonable audience this action thus described must be represented and not told to distinguish dramatic poetry from epic but i hasten to the end or scope of tragedy which is to rectify or purge our passions fear and pity  to instruct delightfully is the general end of all poetry philosophy instructs but it performs its work by precept which is not delightful or not so delightful as example to purge the passions by example is therefore the particular instruction which belongs to tragedy rapin a judicious critic has observed from aristotle that pride and want of commiseration are the most predominant vices in mankind therefore to cure us of these two the inventors of tragedy have chosen to work upon two other passions which are fear and pity we are wrought to fear by their setting before our eyes some terrible example of misfortune which happened to persons of the highest quality for such an action demonstrates to us that no condition is privileged from the turns of fortune this must of necessity cause terror in us and consequently abate our pride but when we see that the most virtuous as well as the greatest are not exempt from such misfortunes that consideration moves pity in us and insensibly works us to be helpful to and tender over the distressed which is the noblest and most godlike of moral virtues here it is observable that it is absolutely necessary to make a man virtuous if we desire he should be pitied we lament not but detest a wicked man we are glad when we behold his crimes are punished and that poetical justice is done upon him euripides was censured by the critics of his time for making his chief characters too wicked for example phædra though she loved her soninlaw with reluctancy and that it was a curse upon her family for offending venus yet was thought too ill a pattern for the stage shall we therefore banish all characters of villainy i confess i am not of that opinion but it is necessary that the hero of the play be not a villain that is the characters which should move our pity ought to have virtuous inclinations and degrees of moral goodness in them as for a perfect character of virtue it never was in nature and therefore there can be no imitation of it but there are allays of frailty to be allowed for the chief persons yet so that the good which is in them shall outweigh the bad and consequently leave room for punishment on the one side and pity on the other  after all if any one will ask me whether a tragedy cannot be made upon any other grounds than those of exciting pity and terror in usbossu the best of modern critics answers thus in general that all excellent arts and particularly that of poetry have been invented and brought to perfection by men of a transcendent genius and that therefore they who practise afterwards the same arts are obliged to tread in their footsteps and to search in their writings the foundation of them for it is not just that new rules should destroy the authority of the old but rapin writes more particularly thus that no passions in a story are so proper to move our concernment as fear and pity and that it is from our concernment we receive our pleasure is undoubted when the soul becomes agitated with fear for one character or hope for another then it is that we are pleased in tragedy by the interest which we take in their adventures  here therefore the general answer may be given to the first question how far we ought to imitate shakespeare and fletcher in their plots namely that we ought to follow them so far only as they have copied the excellencies of those who invented and brought to perfection dramatic poetry those things only excepted which religion custom of countries idioms of languages c have altered in the superstructures but not in the foundation of the design  how defective shakespeare and fletcher have been in all their plots mr rymer has discovered in his criticisms neither can we who follow them be excused from the same or greater errors which are the more unpardonable in us because we want their beauties to countervail our faults the best of their designs the most approaching to antiquity and the most conducing to move pity is the king and no king which if the farce of bessus were thrown away is of that inferior sort of tragedies which end with a prosperous event it is probably derived from the story of oedipus with the character of alexander the great in his extravagances given to arbaces the taking of this play amongst many others i cannot wholly ascribe to the excellency of the action for i find it moving when it is read it is true the faults of the plot are so evidently proved that they can no longer be denied the beauties of it must therefore lie either in the lively touches of the passion or we must conclude as i think we may that even in imperfect plots there are less degrees of nature by which some faint emotions of pity and terror are raised in us as a less engine will raise a less proportion of weight though not so much as one of archimedess making for nothing can move our nature but by some natural reason which works upon passions and since we acknowledge the effect there must be something in the cause  the difference between shakespeare and fletcher in their plottings seems to be this that shakespeare generally moves more terror and fletcher more compassion for the first had a more masculine a bolder and more fiery genius the second a more soft and womanish in the mechanic beauties of the plot which are the observation of the three unities time place and action they are both deficient but shakespeare most ben jonson reformed those errors in his comedies yet one of shakespeares was regular before him which is the merry wives of windsor for what remains concerning the design you are to be referred to our english critic that method which he has prescribed to raise it from mistake or ignorance of the crime is certainly the best though it is not the only for amongst all the tragedies of sophocles there is but one oedipus which is wholly built after that model  after the plot which is the foundation of the play the next thing to which we ought to apply our judgment is the manners for now the poet comes to work above ground the groundwork indeed is that which is most necessary as that upon which depends the firmness of the whole fabric yet it strikes not the eye so much as the beauties or imperfections of the manners the thoughts and the expressions  the first rule which bossu prescribes to the writer of an heroic poem and which holds too by the same reason in all dramatic poetry is to make the moral of the work that is to lay down to yourself what that precept of morality shall be which you would insinuate into the people as namely homers which i have copied in my conquest of granada was that union preserves a commonwealth and discord destroys it sophocles in his oedipus that no man is to be accounted happy before his death it is the moral that directs the whole action of the play to one centre and that action or fable is the example built upon the moral which confirms the truth of it to our experience when the fable is designed then and not before the persons are to be introduced with their manners characters and passions  the manners in a poem are understood to be those inclinations whether natural or acquired which move and carry us to actions good bad or indifferent in a play or which incline the persons to such or such actions i have anticipated part of this discourse already in declaring that a poet ought not to make the manners perfectly good in his best persons but neither are they to be more wicked in any of his characters than necessity requires to produce a villain without other reason than a natural inclination to villainy is in poetry to produce an effect without a cause and to make him more a villain than he has just reason to be is to make an effect which is stronger than the cause  the manners arise from many causes and are either distinguished by complexion as choleric and phlegmatic or by the differences of age or sex of climates or quality of the persons or their present condition they are likewise to be gathered from the several virtues vices or passions and many other commonplaces which a poet must be supposed to have learned from natural philosophy ethics and history of all which whosoever is ignorant does not deserve the name of poet  but as the manners are useful in this art they may be all comprised under these general heads first they must be apparent that is in every character of the play some inclinations of the person must appear and these are shown in the actions and discourse secondly the manners must be suitable or agreeing to the persons that is to the age sex dignity and the other general heads of manners thus when a poet has given the dignity of a king to one of his persons in all his actions and speeches that person must discover majesty magnanimity and jealousy of power because these are suitable to the general manners of a king1 the third property of manners is resemblance and this is founded upon the particular characters of men as we have them delivered to us by relation or history that is when a poet has the known character of this or that man before him he is bound to represent him such at least not contrary to that which fame has reported him to have been thus it is not a poets choice to make ulysses choleric or achilles patient because homer has described them quite otherwise yet this is a rock on which ignorant writers daily split and the absurdity is as monstrous as if a painter should draw a coward running from a battle and tell us it was the picture of alexander the great  the last property of manners is that they be constant and equal that is maintained the same through the whole design thus when virgil had once given the name of pious to Æneas he was bound to show him such in all his words and actions through the whole poem all these properties horace has hinted to a judicious observer1 notandi sunt tibi mores 2 aut famam sequere 3 aut sibi concenientia finge 4 sercetur ad imum qualis ab incepto processerit et sibi constet  from the manners the characters of persons are derived for indeed the characters are no other than the inclinations as they appear in the several persons of the poem a character being thus definedthat which distinguishes one man from another not to repeat the same things over again which have been said of the manners i will only add what is necessary here a character or that which distinguishes one man from all others cannot be supposed to consist of one particular virtue or vice or passion only but it is a composition of qualities which are not contrary to one another in the same person thus the same man may be liberal and valiant but not liberal and covetous so in a comical character or humour which is an inclination to this or that particular folly falstaff is a liar and a coward a glutton and a buffoon because all these qualities may agree in the same man yet it is still to be observed that one virtue vice and passion ought to be shown in every man as predominant over all the rest as covetousness in crassus love of his country in brutus and the same in characters which are feigned  the chief character or hero in a tragedy as i have already shown ought in prudence to be such a man who has so much more of virtue in him than of vice that he may be left amiable to the audience which otherwise cannot have any concernment for his sufferings and it is on this one character that the pity and terror must be principally if not wholly founded a rule which is extremely necessary and which none of the critics that i know have fully enough discovered to us for terror and compassion work but weakly when they are divided into many persons if creon had been the chief character in oedipus there had neither been terror nor compassion moved but only detestation of the man and joy for his punishment if adrastus and eurydice had been made more appearing characters then the pity had been divided and lessened on the part of oedipus but making oedipus the best and bravest person and even jocasta but an underpart to him his virtues and the punishment of his fatal crime drew both the pity and the terror to himself  by what has been said of the manners it will be easy for a reasonable man to judge whether the characters be truly or falsely drawn in a tragedy for if there be no manners appearing in the characters no concernment for the persons can be raised no pity or horror can be moved but by vice or virtue therefore without them no person can have any business in the play if the inclinations be obscure it is a sign the poet is in the dark and knows not what manner of man he presents to you and consequently you can have no idea or very imperfect of that man nor can judge what resolutions he ought to take or what words or actions are proper for him most comedies made up of accidents or adventures are liable to fall into this error and tragedies with many turns are subject to it for the manners can never be evident where the surprises of fortune take up all the business of the stage and where the poet is more in pain to tell you what happened to such a man than what he was it is one of the excellencies of shakespeare that the manners of his persons are generally apparent and you see their bent and inclinations fletcher comes far short of him in this as indeed he does almost in every thing there are but glimmerings of manners in most of his comedies which run upon adventures and in his tragedies rollo otto the king and no king melantius and many others of his best are but pictures shown you in the twilight you know not whether they resemble vice or virtue and they are either good bad or indifferent as the present scene requires it but of all poets this commendation is to be given to ben jonson that the manners even of the most inconsiderable persons in his plays are every where apparent  by considering the second quality of manners which is that they be suitable to the age quality country dignity c of the character we may likewise judge whether a poet has followed nature in this kind sophocles and euripides have more excelled among the greeks than Æschylus and terence more than plautus among the romans thus sophocles gives to oedipus the true qualities of a king in both those plays which bear his name but in the latter which is the oedipus coloneus he lets fall on purpose his tragic style his hero speaks not in the arbitrary tone but remembers in the softness of his complaints that he is an unfortunate blind old man that he is banished from his country and persecuted by his next relations the present french poets are generally accused that wheresoever they lay the scene or in whatsoever age the manners of their heroes are wholly french racines bajazet is bred at constantinople but his civilities are conveyed to him by some secret passage from versailles into the seraglio but our shakespeare having ascribed to henry the fourth the character of a king and of a father gives him the perfect manners of each relation when either he transacts with his son or with his subjects fletcher on the other side gives neither to arbaces nor to his king in the maids tragedy the qualities which are suitable to a monarch though he may be excused a little in the latter for the king there is not uppermost in the character it is the lover of evadne who is king only in a second consideration and though he be unjust and has other faults which shall be nameless yet he is not the hero of the play it is true we find him a lawful prince though i never heard of any king that was in rhodes and therefore mr rymers criticism stands goodthat he should not be shown in so vicious a character sophocles has been more judicious in his antigona for though he represents in creon a bloody prince yet he makes him not a lawful king but an usurper and antigona herself is the heroine of the tragedy but when philaster wounds arethusa and the boy and perigot his mistress in the faithful shepherdess both these are contrary to the character of manhood nor is valentinian managed much better for though fletcher has taken his picture truly and shown him as he was an effeminate voluptuous man yet he has forgotten that he was an emperor and has given him none of those royal marks which ought to appear in a lawful successor of the throne if it be enquired what fletcher should have done on this occasion ought he not to have represented valentinian as he wasbossu shall answer this question for me by an instance of the like nature mauritius the greek emperor was a prince far surpassing valentinian for he was endued with many kingly virtues he was religious merciful and valiant but withal he was noted of extreme covetousness a vice which is contrary to the character of a hero or a prince therefore says the critic that emperor was no fit person to be represented in a tragedy unless his good qualities were only to be shown and his covetousness which sullied them all were slurred over by the artifice of the poet to return once more to shakespeare no man ever drew so many characters or generally distinguished them better from one another excepting only jonson i will instance but in one to show the copiousness of his invention it is that of caliban or the monster in the tempest he seems there to have created a person which was not in nature a boldness which at first sight would appear intolerable for he makes him a species of himself begotten by an incubus on a witch but this as i have elsewhere proved is not wholly beyond the bounds of credibility at least the vulgar still believe it we have the separated notions of a spirit and of a witch and spirits according to plato are vested with a subtle body according to some of his followers have different sexes therefore as from the distinct apprehensions of a horse and of a man imagination has formed a centaur so from those of an incubus and a sorceress shakespeare has produced his monster whether or no his generation can be defended i leave to philosophy but of this i am certain that the poet has most judiciously furnished him with a person a language and a character which will suit him both by fathers and mothers side he has all the discontents and malice of a witch and of a devil besides a convenient proportion of the deadly sins gluttony sloth and lust are manifest the dejectedness of a slave is likewise given him and the ignorance of one bred up in a desert island his person is monstrous and he is the product of unnatural lust and his language is as hobgoblin as his person in all things he is distinguished from other mortals the characters of fletcher are poor and narrow in comparison of shakspeares i remember not one which is not borrowed from him unless you will except that strange mixture of a man in the king and no king so that in this part shakespeare is generally worth our imitation and to imitate fletcher is but to copy after him who was a copyer  under this general head of manners the passions are naturally included as belonging to the characters i speak not of pity and of terror which are to be moved in the audience by the plot but of anger hatred love ambition jealousy revenge c as they are shown in this or that person of the play to describe these naturally and to move them artfully is one of the greatest commendations which can be given to a poet to write pathetically says longinus cannot proceed but from a lofty genius a poet must be born with this quality yet unless he help himself by an acquired knowledge of the passions what they are in their own nature and by what springs they are to be moved he will be subject either to raise them where they ought not to be raised or not to raise them by the just degrees of nature or to amplify them beyond the natural bounds or not to observe the crisis and turns of them in their cooling and decay all which errors proceed from want of judgment in the poet and from being unskilled in the principles of moral philosophy nothing is more frequent in a fanciful writer than to foil himself by not managing his strength therefore as in a wrestler there is first required some measure of force a wellknit body and active limbs without which all instruction would be vain yet these being granted if he want the skill which is necessary to a wrestler he shall make but small advantage of his natural robustuousness so in a poet his inborn vehemence and force of spirit will only run him out of breath the sooner if it be not supported by the help of art the roar of passion indeed may please an audience three parts of which are ignorant enough to think all is moving which is noisy and it may stretch the lungs of an ambitious actor who will die upon the spot for a thundering clap but it will move no other passion than indignation and contempt from judicious men longinus whom i have hitherto followed continues thusif the passions be artfully employed the discourse becomes vehement and lofty if otherwise there is nothing more ridiculous than a great passion out of season and to this purpose he animadverts severely upon Æschylus who writ nothing in cold blood but was always in a rapture and in fury with his audience the inspiration was still upon him he was ever tearing it upon the tripos or to run off as madly as he does from one similitude to another he was always at highflood of passion even in the dead ebb and lowest watermark of the scene he who would raise the passion of a judicious audience says a learned critic must be sure to take his hearers along with him if they be in a calm tis in vain for him to be in a huff he must move them by degrees and kindle with them otherwise he will be in danger of setting his own heap of stubble on fire and of burning out by himself without warming the company that stand about him they who would justify the madness of poetry from the authority of aristotle have mistaken the text and consequently the interpretation i imagine it to be false read where he says of poetry that it is greek euphuous ê manikou that it had always somewhat in it either of a genius or of a madman tis more probable that the original ran thus that poetry was greek euphuous ou manikou that it belongs to a witty man but not to a madman thus then the passions as they are considered simply and in themselves suffer violence when they are perpetually maintained at the same height for what melody can be made on that instrument all whose strings are screwed up at first to their utmost stretch and to the same sound but this is not the worst for the characters likewise bear a part in the general calamity if you consider the passions as embodied in them for it follows of necessity that no man can be distinguished from another by his discourse when every man is ranting swaggering and exclaiming with the same excess as if it were the only business of all the characters to contend with each other for the prize at billingsgate or that the scene of the tragedy lay in bethlem suppose the poet should intend this man to be choleric and that man to be patient yet when they are confounded in the writing you cannot distinguish them from one another for the man who was called patient and tame is only so before he speaks but let his clack be set agoing and he shall tongue it as impetuously and as loudly as the arrantest hero in the play by this means the characters are only distinct in name but in reality all the men and women in the play are the same person no man should pretend to write who cannot temper his fancy with his judgment nothing is more dangerous to a raw horseman than a hotmouthed jade without a curb  it is necessary therefore for a poet who would concern an audience by describing of a passion first to prepare it and not to rush upon it all at once ovid has judiciously shown the difference of these two ways in the speeches of ajax and ulysses ajax from the very beginning breaks out into his exclamations and is swearing by his makeragimus proh jupiter inquit ulysses on the contrary prepares his audience with all the submissiveness he can practise and all the calmness of a reasonable man he found his judges in a tranquillity of spirit and therefore set out leisurely and softly with them till he had warmed them by degrees and then he began to mend his pace and to draw them along with his own impetuousness yet so managing his breath that it might not fail him at his need and reserving his utmost proofs of ability even to the last the success you see was answerable for the crowd only applauded the speech of ajax    vulgique secutum ultima murmur erat  but the judges awarded the prize for which they contended to ulysses    mota manus procerum est et quid facundia posset   tum patuit fortisque viri tulit arma disertus  the next necessary rule is to put nothing into the discourse which may hinder your moving of the passions too many accidents as i have said incumber the poet as much as the arms of saul did david for the variety of passions which they produce are ever crossing and justling each other out of the way he who treats of joy and grief together is in a fair way of causing neither of those effects there is yet another obstacle to be removed which ispointed wit and sentences affected out of season these are nothing of kin to the violence of passion no man is at leisure to make sentences and similes when his soul is in an agony i the rather name this fault that it may serve to mind me of my former errors neither will i spare myself but give an example of this kind from my indian emperor montezuma pursued by his enemies and seeking sanctuary stands parleying without the fort and describing his danger to cydaria in a simile of six lines    as on the sands the frighted traveller   sees the high seas come rolling from afar c  my indian potentate was well skilled in the sea for an inland prince and well improved since the first act when he sent his son to discover it the image had not been amiss from another man at another time sed nunc non erat his locus he destroyed the concernment which the audience might otherwise have had for him for they could not think the danger near when he had the leisure to invent a simile  if shakespeare be allowed as i think he must to have made his characters distinct it will easily be inferred that he understood the nature of the passions because it has been proved already that confused passions make distinguishable characters yet i cannot deny that he has his failings but they are not so much in the passions themselves as in his manner of expression he often obscures his meaning by his words and sometimes makes it unintelligible i will not say of so great a poet that he distinguished not the blown puffy stile from true sublimity but i may venture to maintain that the fury of his fancy often transported him beyond the bounds of judgment either in coining of new words and phrases or racking words which were in use into the violence of a catachresis it is not that i would explode the use of metaphors from passion for longinus thinks them necessary to raise it but to use them at every word to say nothing without a metaphor a simile an image or description is i doubt to smell a little too strongly of the buskin i must be forced to give an example of expressing passion figuratively but that i may do it with respect to shakespeare it shall not be taken from any thing of his it is an exclamation against fortune quoted in his hamlet but written by some other poet    out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods   in general synod take away her power   break all the spokes and felleys from her wheel   and bowl the round nave down the hill of heavn   as low as to the fiends  and immediately after speaking of hecuba when priam was killed before her eyes    but who ah woe had seen the mobled queen   run barefoot up and down threatening the flame   with bisson rheum a clout about that head   where late the diadem stood and for a rob   about her lank and all oerteemed loins   a blanket in th alarm of fear caught up   who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd   gainst fortunes state would treason have pronouncd   but if the gods themselves did see her then   when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport   in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs   the instant burst of clamour that she made   unless things mortal move them not at all   would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven   and passion in the gods  what a pudder is here kept in raising the expression of trifling thoughts would not a man have thought that the poet had been bound prentice to a wheelwright for his first rant and had followed a ragman for the clout and blanket in the second fortune is painted on a wheel and therefore the writer in a rage will have poetical justice done upon every member of that engine after this execution he bowls the nave downhill from heaven to the fiends an unreasonable long mark a man would think tis well there are no solid orbs to stop it in the way or no element of fire to consume it but when it came to the earth it must be monstrous heavy to break ground as low as the center his making milch the burning eyes of heaven was a pretty tolerable flight too and i think no man ever drew milk out of eyes before him yet to make the wonder greater these eyes were burning such a sight indeed were enough to have raised passion in the gods but to excuse the effects of it he tells you perhaps they did not see it wise men would be glad to find a little sense couched under all these pompous words for bombast is commonly the delight of that audience which loves poetry but understands it not and as commonly has been the practice of those writers who not being able to infuse a natural passion into the mind have made it their business to ply the ears and to stun their judges by the noise but shakespeare does not often thus for the passions in his scene between brutus and cassius are extremely natural the thoughts are such as arise from the matter the expression of them not viciously figurative i cannot leave this subject before i do justice to that divine poet by giving you one of his passionate descriptions tis of richard the second when he was deposed and led in triumph through the streets of london by henry of bolingbroke the painting of it is so lively and the words so moving that i have scarce read any thing comparable to it in any other language suppose you have seen already the fortunate usurper passing through the crowd and followed by the shouts and acclamations of the people and now behold king richard entering upon the scene consider the wretchedness of his condition and his carriage in it and refrain from pity if you can    as in a theatre the eyes of men   after a wellgracd actor leaves the stage   are idly bent on him that enters next   thinking his prattle to be tedious   even so or with much more contempt mens eyes   did scowl on richard no man cryd god save him   no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home   but dust was thrown upon his sacred head   which with such gentle sorrow he shook off   his face still combating with tears and smiles   the badges of his grief and patience   that had not god for some strong purpose steeld   the hearts of men they must perforce have melted   and barbarism itself have pitied him  to speak justly of this whole matter it is neither height of thought that is discommended nor pathetic vehemence nor any nobleness of expression in its proper place but it is a false measure of all these something which is like them and is not them it is the bristolstone which appears like a diamond it is an extravagant thought instead of a sublime one it is roaring madness instead of vehemence and a sound of words instead of sense if shakespeare were stripped of all the bombasts in his passions and dressed in the most vulgar words we should find the beauties of his thoughts remaining if his embroideries were burnt down there would still be silver at the bottom of the meltingpot but i fear at least let me fear it for myself that we who ape his sounding words have nothing of his thought but are all outside there is not so much as a dwarf within our giants clothes therefore let not shakespeare suffer for our sakes it is our fault who succeed him in an age which is more refined if we imitate him so ill that we copy his failings only and make a virtue of that in our writings which in his was an imperfection  for what remains the excellency of that poet was as i have said in the more manly passions fletchers in the softer shakespeare writ better betwixt man and man fletcher betwixt man and woman consequently the one described friendship better the other love yet shakespeare taught fletcher to write love and juliet and desdemona are originals it is true the scholar had the softer soul but the master had the kinder friendship is both a virtue and a passion essentially love is a passion only in its nature and is not a virtue but by accident good nature makes friendship but effeminacy love shakespeare had an universal mind which comprehended all characters and passions fletcher a more confined and limited for though he treated love in perfection yet honour ambition revenge and generally all the stronger passions he either touched not or not masterly to conclude all he was a limb of shakespeare  i had intended to have proceeded to the last property of manners which is that they must be constant and the characters maintained the same from the beginning to the end and from thence to have proceeded to the thoughts and expressions suitable to a tragedy but i will first see how this will relish with the age it is i confess but cursorily written yet the judgment which is given here is generally founded upon experience but because many men are shocked at the name of rules as if they were a kind of magisterial prescription upon poets i will conclude with the words of rapin in his reflections on aristotles work of poetry if the rules be well considered we shall find them to be made only to reduce nature into method to trace her step by step and not to suffer the least mark of her to escape us it is only by these that probability in fiction is maintained which is the soul of poetry they are founded upon good sense and sound reason rather than on authority for though aristotle and horace are produced yet no man must argue that what they write is true because they writ it but tis evident by the ridiculous mistakes and gross absurdities which have been made by those poets who have taken their fancy only for their guide that if this fancy be not regulated it is a mere caprice and utterly incapable to produce a reasonable and judicious poem   footnote 1 the dictum of rymer concerning the royal prerogative in poetry    is thus expressed we are to presume the highest virtues where we    find the highest of rewards and though it is not necessary that    all heroes should be kings yet undoubtedly all crowned heads by    poetical right are heroes this character is a flower a    prerogative so certain so inseparably annexed to the crown as by    no parliament of poets ever to be invaded the tragedies of the    last age considered p 61 dryden has elsewhere given his assent    to this maxim that a king in poetry as in our constitution can    do no wrong the only apology for introducing a tyrant upon the    stage was to make him at the same time an usurper

remarks particularly happy for the coincidence and coalition of the tragic and comic plots the grounds for this eminent critics encomium will be found to lie more deep than appears at first sight it was indeed a sufficiently obvious connection to make the gay lorenzo an officer of the conquering army and attached to the person of torrismond this expedient could hardly have escaped the invention of the most vulgar playwright that ever dovetailed tragedy and comedy together the felicity of drydens plot therefore does not consist in the ingenuity of his original conception but in the minutely artificial strokes by which the reader is perpetually reminded of the dependence of the one part of the play on the other these are so frequent and appear so very natural that the comic plot instead of diverting our attention from the tragic business recals it to our mind by constant and unaffected allusion no great event happens in the higher region of the camp or court that has not some indirect influence upon the intrigues of lorenzo and elvira and the part which the gallant is called upon to act in the revolution that winds up the tragic interest while it is highly in character serves to bring the catastrophe of both parts of the play under the eye of the spectator at one and the same time thus much seemed necessary to explain the felicity of combination upon which dryden justly valued himself and which johnson sanctioned by his high commendation but although artfully conjoined the different departments of this tragicomedy are separate subjects of critical remark  the comic part of the spanish friar as it gives the first title to the play seems to claim our first attention indeed some precedence is due to it in another point of view for though the tragic scenes may be matched in all for love don sebastian and else where the spanish friar contains by far the most happy of drydens comic effusions it has comparatively speaking this high claim to commendation that although the intrigue is licentious according to the invariable licence of the age the language is in general free from the extreme and disgusting coarseness which our author too frequently mistook for wit or was contented to substitute in its stead the liveliness and even brilliancy of the dialogue shows that dryden from the stores of his imagination could when he pleased command that essential requisite of comedy and that if he has seldom succeeded it was only because he mistook the road or felt difficulty in travelling it the character of dominic is of that broadly ludicrous nature which was proper to the old comedy it would be difficult to show an ordinary conception more fully brought out he is like falstaff a compound of sensuality and talent finely varied by the professional traits with which it suited the authors purpose to adorn his character such an addition was it is true more comic than liberal but dryden whose constant dislike to the clerical order glances out in many of his performances was not likely to be scrupulous when called upon to pourtray one of their members in his very worst colours to counterbalance the friars scandalous propensities of every sort and to render him an object of laughter rather than abhorrence the author has gifted this reprobate churchman with a large portion of wit by means of which and by a ready presence of mind always indicative of energy he preserves an ascendence over the other characters and escapes detection and disgrace until poetical justice and the conclusion of the play called for his punishment we have a natural indulgence for an amusing libertine and i believe that as most readers commiserate the disgrace of falstaff a few may be found to wish that dominics penance had been of a nature more decent and more theatrical than the poet has assigned him1 from the dedication as well as the prologue it appears that dryden however contrary to his sentiments at a future period was at present among those who held up to contempt and execration the character of the roman catholic priesthood by one anonymous lampoon this is ascribed to a temporary desertion of the court party in resentment for the loss or discontinuance of his pension this allowance during the pressure upon the exchequer was at least irregularly paid of which dryden repeatedly complains and particularly in a letter to the earl of rochester but the hardship was owing entirely to the poverty of the public purse and when the anonymous libeller affirms that drydens pension was withdrawn on account of his share in the essay on satire he only shows that his veracity is on a level with his poverty2 the truth seems to be that dryden partook in some degree of the general ferment which the discovery of the popish plot had excited and we may easily suppose him to have done so without any impeachment to his monarchial tenets since north himself admits that at the first opening of the plot the chiefs of the loyal party joined in the cry indeed that mysterious transaction had been investigated by none more warmly than by danby the kings favourite minister and a high favourer of the prerogative even when writing absalom and achitophel our author by no means avows an absolute disbelief of the whole plot while condemning the extraordinary exaggerations by which it had been rendered the means of much bloodshed and persecution3 it seems therefore fair to believe that without either betraying or disguising his own principles he chose as a popular subject for the drama an attack upon an obnoxious priesthood whom he in common with all the nation believed to have been engaged in the darkest intrigues against the king and government i am afraid that this task was the more pleasing from that prejudice against the clergy of all countries and religions which as already noticed our author displays in common with other wits of that licentious age4 the character of the spanish friar was not however forgotten when dryden became a convert to the roman catholic persuasion and in many instances as well as in that just quoted it was assumed as the means of fixing upon him a charge of inconsistency in politics and versatility in religion5  the tragic part of the spanish friar has uncommon merit the opening of the drama and the picture of a besieged town in the last extremity is deeply impressive while the description of the noise of the night attack and the gradual manner in which the intelligence of its success is communicated arrests the attention and prepares expectation for the appearance of the hero with all the splendour which ought to attend the principal character in tragedy the subsequent progress of the plot is liable to a capital objection from the facility with which the queen amiable and virtuous as we are bound to suppose her consents to the murder of the old dethroned monarch we question if the operation of any motive however powerful could have been pleaded with propriety in apology for a breach of theatrical decorum so gross and so unnatural but in fact the queen is only actuated by a sort of reflected ambition a desire to secure to her lover a crown which she thought in danger but which according to her own statement she only valued on his account this is surely too remote and indirect a motive to urge a female to so horrid a crime there is also something vilely coldhearted in her attempt to turn the guilt and consequences of her own crime upon bertran who whatever faults he might have to others was to the queen no otherwise obnoxious than because the victim of her own inconstancy the gallant virtuous and enthusiastic character of torrismond must be allowed in some measure to counterbalance that of his mistress however unhappily he has placed his affections but the real excellence of these scenes consists less in peculiarity of character than in the vivacity and power of the language which seldom sinking into vulgarity or rising into bombast maintains the mixture of force and dignity best adapted to the expression of tragic passion upon the whole as the comic part of this play is our authors masterpiece in comedy the tragic plot may be ranked with his very best efforts of that kind whether in don sebastian or all for love  the spanish friar appears to have been brought out shortly after mr thynnes murder which is alluded to in the prologue probably early in 16812 the whimsical caricature which it presented to the public in father dominic was received with rapture by the prejudiced spectators who thought nothing could be exaggerated in the character of a roman catholic priest yet the satire was still more severe in the first edition and afterwards considerably softened6 it was as dryden himself calls it a protestant play and certainly as jeremy collier somewhere says was rare protestant diversion and much for the credit of the reformation accordingly the spanish friar was the only play prohibited by james ii after his accession an interdict which may be easily believed no way disagreeable to the author now a convert to the roman church it is very remarkable that after the revolution it was the first play represented by order of queen mary and honoured with her presence a choice of which she had abundant reason to repent as the serious part of the piece gave as much scope for malicious application against herself as the comic against the religion of her father7   footnotes 1 collier remarks the injustice of punishing the agent of lorenzos    vice while he was himself brought off with flying colours he    observes tis not the fault which is corrected but the priest    the authors discipline is seldom without a bias he commonly gives    the laity the pleasure of an ill action and the clergy the    punishment view of the immorality and profaneness of the stage    p 100   2   to satire next thy talent was addressed      fell foul on all thy friends among the rest      nay

naugeria by    name was wont every year to sacrifice a martial to the manes of    catullus in imitation of this a celebrated poet in the preface    before the spanish friar is pleased to acquaint the world that he    has indignation enough to burn a bussy damboys annually to the    memory of ben jonson since the modern ceremony of offering up one    author at the altar of another is likely to advance into a    fashion and having already the authority of two such great men to    recommend it the courteous reader may be pleased to take notice    that the author of the following dialogue is resolved god    willing on the festival of the seven sleepers as long as he    lives to sacrifice the hind and panther to the memory of mr    quarels and john bunyan or if a writer that has notoriously    contradicted himself and espoused the quarrel of two different    parties may be considered under two distinct characters he    designs to deliver up the author of the hind and panther to be    lashed severely by and to beg pardon of the worthy gentleman that    wrote the spanish friar and the religion laici the reason of mr    bayes changing his religion preface  6 the revolter a tragicomedy 1687 p 29  7 it is impossible to avoid transcribing the whole account of this    representation with some other curious particulars contained in a    letter from the earl of nottingham published by sir john    dalrymple from a copy given him by the bishop of dromore and also    inserted by mr malone in his third volume of drydens prose works     i am loth to send blank paper by a carrier but am rather willing    to send some of the tattle of the town than nothing at all which    will at least serve for an hours chatand then convert the    scrawl to its proper use     the only day her majesty gave herself the diversion of a play and    that on which she designed to see another has furnished the town    with discourse for near a month the choice of the play was the    spanish friar the only play forbid by the late king some    unhappy expressions among which those that follow put her in some    disorder and forced her to hold up her fan and often look behind    her and call for her palatine and hood and any thing she could    next think of while those who were in the pit before her turned    their heads over their shoulders and all in general directed their    looks towards her whenever their fancy led them to make any    application of what was said in one place where the queen of    arragon is going to church in procession tis said by a spectator    very good she usurps the throne keeps the old king in prison    and at the same time is praying for a blessing on her armyand    when said that tis observed at court who weeps and who wears    black for good king sanchos death tis said who is that that    can flatter a court like this can i sooth tyranny seem pleasd to    see my royal master murthered his crown usurped a distaff in the    throneand what title has this queen but lawless force and    force must pull her downtwenty more things are said which may    be wrested to what they were never designed but however the    observations then made furnished the town with talk till something    else happened which gave it much occasion for discourse for    another play being ordered to be acted the queen came not being    taken up with other diversion she dined with mrs gradens the    famous woman in the hall that sells fine laces and headdresses    from thence she went to the jews that sells indian things to mrs    fergusons de vetts mrs harrisons and other indian houses but    not to mrs potters though in her way which caused mrs potter to    say that she might as well have hoped for that honour as others    considering that the whole design of bringing the queen and king    was managed at her house and the consultations held there so that    she might as well have thrown away a little money in raffling    there as well as at the other houses but it seems that my lord    devonshire has got mrs potter to be laundress she has not much    countenance of the queen her daughter still keeping the indian    house her mother had the same day the queen went to one mrs    wises a famous woman for telling fortunes but could not prevail    with her to tell anything though to others she has been very true    and has foretold that king james shall came in again and the duke    of norfolk shall lose his head the last i suppose will naturally    be the consequence of the first these things however innocent    have passed the censure of the town and besides a private    reprimand given the king gave one in public saying to the    queen that he heard she dined at a bawdyhouse and desired the    next time she went he might go she said she had done nothing but    what the late queen had done he asked her if she meant to make    her her example more was said on this occasion than ever was    known before but it was borne with all the submission of a good    wife who leaves all to the direction of the k and diverts    herself with walking six or seven miles aday and looking after    her buildings making of fringes and such like innocent things    and does not meddle in government though she has better title to    do it than the late queen had                                       to                           the right honourable                                  john                            lord haughton1   my lord  when i first designed this play i found or thought i found somewhat so moving in the serious part of it and so pleasant in the comic as might deserve a more than ordinary care in both accordingly i used the best of my endeavour in the management of two plots so very different from each other that it was not perhaps the talent of every writer to have made them of a piece neither have i attempted other plays of the same nature in my opinion with the same judgment though with like success and though many poets may suspect themselves for the fondness and partiality of parents to their youngest children yet i hope i may stand exempted from this rule because i know myself too well to be ever satisfied with my own conceptions which have seldom reached to those ideas that i had within me and consequently i may presume to have liberty to judge when i write more or less pardonably as an ordinary marksman may know certainly when he shoots less wide at what he aims besides the care and pains i have bestowed on this beyond my other tragicomedies may reasonably make the world conclude that either i can do nothing tolerably or that this poem is not much amiss few good pictures have been finished at one sitting neither can a true just play which is to bear the test of ages be produced at a heat or by the force of fancy without the maturity of judgment for my own part i have both so just a diffidence of myself and so great a reverence for my audience that i dare venture nothing without a strict examination and am as much ashamed to put a loose indigested play upon the public as i should be to offer brass money in a payment for though it should be taken as it is too often on the stage yet it would be found in the second telling and a judicious reader will discover in his closet that trashy stuff whose glittering deceived him in the action i have often heard the stationer sighing in his shop and wishing for those hands to take off his melancholy bargain which clapped its performance on the stage in a playhouse every thing contributes to impose upon the judgment the lights the scenes the habits and above all the grace of action which is commonly the best where there is the most need of it surprise the audience and cast a mist upon their understandings not unlike the cunning of a juggler who is always staring us in the face and overwhelming us with gibberish only that he may gain the opportunity of making the cleaner conveyance of his trick but these false beauties of the stage are no more lasting than a rainbow when the actor ceases to shine upon them when he gilds them no longer with his reflection they vanish in a twinkling i have sometimes wondered in the reading what was become of those glaring colours which amazed me in bussy damboys upon the theatre but when i had taken up what i supposed a fallen star i found i had been cozened with a jelly2 nothing but a cold dull mass which glittered no longer than it was shooting a dwarfish thought dressed up in gigantic words repetition in abundance looseness of expression and gross hyperboles the sense of one line expanded prodigiously into ten and to sum up all uncorrect english and a hideous mingle of false poetry and true nonsense or at best a scantling of wit which lay gasping for life and groaning beneath a heap of rubbish a famous modern poet used to sacrifice every year a statius to virgils manes3 and i have indignation enough to burn a dambois annually to the memory of jonson4 but now my lord i am sensible perhaps too late that i have gone too far for i remember some verses of my own maximin and almanzor which cry vengeance upon me for their extravagance and which i wish heartily in the same fire with statius and chapman all i can say for those passages which are i hope not many is that i knew they were bad enough to please even when i wrote them but i repent of them amongst my sins and if any of their fellows intrude by chance into my present writings i draw a stroke over all those dalilahs of the theatre and am resolved i will settle myself no reputation by the applause of fools it is not that i am mortified to all ambition but i scorn as much to take it from halfwitted judges as i should to raise an estate by cheating of bubbles neither do i discommend the lofty style in tragedy which is naturally pompous and magnificent but nothing is truly sublime that is not just and proper if the antients had judged by the same measure which a common reader takes they had concluded statius to have written higher than virgil for    quæ superimposito moles geminata colosso  carries a more thundering kind of sound than    tityre tu patulæ recubans sub tegmine fagi  yet virgil had all the majesty of a lawful prince and statius only the blustering of a tyrant but when men affect a virtue which they cannot easily reach they fall into a vice which bears the nearest resemblance to it thus an injudicious poet who aims at loftiness runs easily into the swelling puffy style because it looks like greatness i remember when i was a boy i thought inimitable spencer a mean poet in comparison of sylvesters dubartas and was wrapt into an ecstasy when i read these lines    now when the winters keener breath began   to crystalize the baltic ocean   to glaze the lakes to bridle up the floods   and periwig with snow the baldpate woods5  i am much deceived if this be not abominable fustian that is thoughts and words illsorted and without the least relation to each other yet i dare not answer for an audience that they would not clap it on the stage so little value there is to be given to the common cry that nothing but madness can please madmen and the poet must be of a piece with the spectators to gain a reputation with them but as in a room contrived for state the height of the roof should bear a proportion to the area so in the heightenings of poetry the strength and vehemence of figures should be suited to the occasion the subject and the persons all beyond this is monstrous it is out of nature it is an excrescence and not a living part of poetry i had not said thus much if some young gallants who pretend to criticism had not told me that this tragicomedy wanted the dignity of style but as a man who is charged with a crime of which he thinks himself innocent is apt to be too eager in his own defence so perhaps i have vindicated my play with more partiality than i ought or than such a trifle can deserve yet whatever beauties it may want it is free at least from the grossness of those faults i mentioned what credit it has gained upon the stage i value no farther than in reference to my profit and the satisfaction i had in seeing it represented with all the justness and gracefulness of action but as it is my interest to please my audience so it is my ambition to be read that i am sure is the more lasting and the nobler design for the propriety of thoughts and words which are the hidden beauties of a play are but confusedly judged in the vehemence of action all things are there beheld as in a hasty motion where the objects only glide before the eye and disappear the most discerning critic can judge no more of these silent graces in the action than he who rides post through an unknown country can distinguish the situation of places and the nature of the soil the purity of phrase the clearness of conception and expression the boldness maintained to majesty the significancy and sound of words not strained into bombast but justly elevated in short those very words and thoughts which cannot be changed but for the worse must of necessity escape our transient view upon the theatre and yet without all these a play may take for if either the story move us or the actor help the lameness of it with his performance or now and then a glittering beam of wit or passion strike through the obscurity of the poem any of these are sufficient to effect a present liking but not to fix a lasting admiration for nothing but truth can long continue and time is the surest judge of truth i am not vain enough to think that i have left no faults in this which that touchstone will not discover neither indeed is it possible to avoid them in a play of this nature there are evidently two actions in it but it will be clear to any judicious man that with half the pains i could have raised a play from either of them for this time i satisfied my humour which was to tack two plays together and to break a rule for the pleasure of variety the truth is the audience are grown weary of continued melancholy scenes and i dare venture to prophecy that few tragedies except those in verse shall succeed in this age if they are not lightened with a course of mirth for the feast is too dull and solemn without the fiddles but how difficult a task this is will soon be tried for a several genius is required to either way and without both of them a man in my opinion is but half a poet for the stage neither is it so trivial an undertaking to make a tragedy end happily for it is more difficult to save than it is to kill the dagger and the cup of poison are always in a readiness but to bring the action to the last extremity and then by probable means to recover all will require the art and judgement of a writer and cost him many a pang in the performance  and now my lord i must confess that what i have written looks more like a preface than a dedication and truly it was thus far my design that i might entertain you with somewhat in my own art which might be more worthy of a noble mind than the stale exploded trick of fulsome panegyrics it is difficult to write justly on any thing but almost impossible in praise i shall therefore wave so nice a subject and only tell you that in recommending a protestant play to a protestant patron as i do myself an honour so i do your noble family a right who have been always eminent in the support and favour of our religion and liberties and if the promises of your youth your education at home and your experience abroad deceive me not the principles you have embraced are such as will no way degenerate from your ancestors but refresh their memory in the minds of all true englishmen and renew their lustre in your person which my lord is not more the wish than it is the constant expectation of    your lordships     most obedient faithful servant       john dryden   footnotes 1 john lord haughton
