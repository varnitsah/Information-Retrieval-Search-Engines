16278413	dr jonathan  by winston churchill   a play in three acts      preface   this play was written during the war but owing to the fact that several managers politely declined to produce it it has not appeared on any stage now perhaps its theme is more timely more likely to receive the attention it deserves when the smoke of battle has somewhat cleared even when the struggle with germany and her allies was in progress it was quite apparent to the discerning that the true issue of the conflict was one quite familiar to american thought of selfdetermination on returning from abroad toward the end of 1917 i ventured into print with the statement that the great war had every aspect of a race with revolution subliminal desires subliminal fears when they break down the censor of law are apt to inspire fanatical creeds to wind about their victims the flaming flag of a false martyrdom today it is on the knees of the gods whether the insuppressible impulses for human freedom that come roaring up from the subliminal chaos fanned by hunger and hate are to thrash themselves out in anarchy and insanity or to take an ordered intelligent and conscious course of the twentieth century industrial democracy is the watchword even as political democracy was the watchword of the two centuries that preceded it economic power is at last realized to be political power no man owns himself no woman owns herself if the individual is not economically free perhaps the most encouraging omen of the day is the fact that many of our modern employers and even our modern financiers and bankers seem to be recognizing this truth to be growing aware of the danger to civilization of its continued suppression educators and sociologists may supply the theories but by experiment by trial and erroryes and by prayerthe solution must be found in the practical domain of industry      dr jonathan     act i  scene   the library of asher pindars house in foxon falls a new england    village of some three thousand souls over the destinies of which    the pindars for three generations have presided it is a large    dignified room built early in the nineteenth century with white    doors and gloss woodwork at the rear of the stagewhich is the    front of the houseare three high windows with small square panes    of glass and embrasures into which are fitted white inside    shutters these windows reach to within a foot or so of the floor    a person walking on the lawn or the sidewalk just beyond it may be    seen through them the trees bordering the common are also seen    through these windows and through a gap in the foliage a glimpse of    the terraced steeple of the pindar church the architecture of which    is of the same period as the house upper right at the end of the    wall is a glass door looking out on the lawn there is another    door lower right and a door lower left leading into asher    pindars study a marble mantel which holds a clock and certain    ornaments is just beyond this door the wall spaces on the right    and left are occupied by high bookcases filled with respectable    volumes in calf and dark cloth bindings over the mantel is an    oil painting of the bierstadt school cherished by asher as an    inheritance from his father a huge landscape with a selfconscious    sky mountains plains rivers and waterfalls and two small figures    of indianswho seem to have been talking to a missionary in the    spaces between the windows are two steel engravings the death of    wolfe on the plains of abraham and washington crossing the    delaware the furniture with the exception of a few heirlooms    such as the stiff sofa is mostly of the richardson period of the    80s and 90s on a table middle rear are neatly spread out    several conservative magazines and periodicals including a    religious publication  time a bright morning in october 1917      george pindar in the uniform of a first lieutenant of the army    enters by the doorway upper right he is a well set up young man    of about twentyseven bronzed from his life in a training camp of    an adventurous and social nature he glances about the room and    then lights a cigarette     asher pindar his father enters lower right he is a tall    strongly built man of about sixty with iron grey hair and beard    his eyes are keen shadowed by bushy brows and his new england    features bear the stamp of inflexible character he wears a black    cutaway coat and dark striped trousers his voice is strong and    resonant but he is evidently preoccupied and worried though he    smiles with affection as he perceives george georges fondness for    him is equally apparent  george hello dad  asher oh youre here george  george looking at asher something troubling you  asher attempting dissimulation well youre going off to france theyve only given you two days leave and ive scarcely seen anything of you isnt that enough  george i know how busy youve been with that government contract on your hands i wish i could help  asher youre in the army now my boy you can help me again when you come back  george i want to get time to go down to the shops and say goodbye to some of the men  asher no i shouldnt do that george  george surprised why not i used to be pretty chummy with them you knowsmoke a pipe with them occasionally in the noon hour  asher i know but it doesnt do for an employer to be too familiar with the hands in these days  george i guess ive got a vulgar streak in me somewhere i get along with the common people therell be lots of them in the trenches dad  asher under military discipline  george laughing were supposed to be fighting a war for democracy i was talking to old bains yesterdayhes still able to run a lathe and he was in the civil war you know he was telling me how the boys in his regiment stopped to pick blackberries on the way to the battle of bull run  asher thats democracy its what were doing right nowstopping to pick blackberries this countrys been in the war six months since april and no guns no munitions a handful of men in francewhile the worlds burning  george well we wont sell uncle sam short yet something is bothering you dad  asher nono but the people in washington change my specifications every week and jonathans arriving today of all days  george has dr jonathan turned up  asher i havent seen him yet it seems he got here this morning no telegram nothing and he had his house fixed up without consulting me he must be queer like his father your great uncle henry pindar  george tell me about dr jonathan a scientistisnt he suddenly decided to come back to live in the old homestead  asher on account of his health he was delicate as a boy he must have been about eight or nine years old when uncle henry left foxon falls for the westthat was before you were born uncle henry died somewhere in iowa he and my father never got along uncle henry had as much as your grandfather to begin with and let it slip through his fingers he managed to send jonathan to a medical school and it seems that hes had some sort of a position at johns hopkinssresearch work i dont know what hes got to live on  george uncle henry must have been a philanthropist  asher its all very well to be a philanthropist when you make more than you give away otherwise youre a sentimentalist  george or a christian  asher we cant take christianity too literally  george smiling thats its great advantage as a religion  asher george i dont like to say anything just as youre going to fight for your country my boy but your attitude of religious skepticism has troubled me as well as your habit of intimacy with the shop hands i confess to you that ive been a little afraid at times that youd take after jonathans father he never went to church he forgot that he owed something to his position as a pindar he used to have that house of his overrun with all sorts of people and the yard full of dirty children eating his fruit and picking his flowers theres such a thing as being too democratic i hope im as good an american as anybody i believe that any man with brains who has thrift ought to risebut wait until they do rise youre going to command men and when you come back here into the business again youll be in a position of authority remember what i say if you give these working people an inch theyll take all you have  george laying his hand on ashers shoulder something is worrying you dad weve always been pretty good pals havent we  asher yes ever since you were a little shaver well george i didnt want to bother you with ittoday it seems theres trouble in the shopsin our shops of all placesits been going on for some time grumbling dissatisfaction and theyre getting higher wages than ever beforeruinous wages they want me to recognize the union  george well that beats me i thought we were above the labourtrouble line away up here in new england  asher grimly oh i can handle them  george ill bet you can youre a regular old war horse when you get started its your capital its your business youve put it all at the disposal of the government what right have they to kick up a row now with this war on i must say i havent any sympathy with that  asher proudly i guess youre a real pindar after all george     enter an elderly maid lower right  maid timothy farrell the foremans here     enter lower right timothy a big irishman of about sixty in    working clothes  timothy here i am sir theyre after sending word you wanted me  george going up to timothy and shaking his hand warmly old timothy im glad to get sight of you before i go  timothy and its glad i am to see you mr george before you leave and he an officer now sure i mind him as a baby being wheeled up and down under the trees out there my boy bert was saying only this morning how wed missed the sight of him in the shops this summer you have a way with the men mr george of getting into their hearts like i was thinking just now if mr george had only been home in the shops maybe we wouldnt be having all this complaint and trouble  george whos at the bottom of this timothy rench hillman i thought so well theyre not bad chaps when you get under their skins     he glances at his wrist watch  let me go down and talk with them dadive got time my train doesnt leave until one thirty  asher impatiently almost savagely no ill settle this george this is my job i wont have any humoring come into my study timothy     timothy shaking his head follows asher out of the door left     after a moment george goes over to the extreme left hand corner of    the room where several articles are piled he drags out a kit bag    then some necessary wearing apparel underclothes socks a sweater    etc then a large and rather luxurious lunch kit a pin cushion    with his monogram a small travelling pillow with his monogram a    linen toilet case embroidered in blue to hang on the wallthese    last evidently presents from admiring lady friends finally he    brings forth a large rubber life preserving suit he makes a show    of putting all these things in the bag including the life    preserving suit and reveals a certain sentiment not too deep for    the pillow the pincushion and the toilet case at length he strews    everything over the floor and is surveying the litter with mock    despair when a girl appears on the lawn outside through one of the    windows she throws into the room a small parcel wrapped in tissue    paper and disappears george picks up the parcel and looks    surprised and suddenly runs out of the door upper right he    presently returns dragging the girl by the wrists she resisting     minnie farrell is about twenty one with black hair and an abundant    vitality her costume is a not wholly ineffective imitation of    those bought at a great price at certain metropolitan    establishments a string of imitation pearls gleams against her    ruddy skin  minnie cut it out george glancing around apprehensively say if your mother was to find me here shed want to send me up to the reformatory she frees herself  george where the deuce did you blow in from regarding her with admiration is this the little minnie farrell who left foxon falls two years ago gee whiz arent we smart  minnie do you like me im making good money since the war  george do i like you what are you doing here  minnie my brother berts out therehe aint working today mr pindar sent for father and we walked up here with him where is he  george nodding toward the study in there but what are you doing back in foxon falls  minnie oh visiting the scenes of my childhood  george tearing open the tissue paper from the parcel did you make these for me   he holds up a pair of grey woollen wristlets  minnie well i wanted to do something for a soldier and when i heard you was going to france i thought you might as well have em  george how did you hear i was going  minnie bert told me when i came home yesterday they say its cold in the trenches and nothing keeps the hands so warm as wristlets i know because ive had em on winter mornings early when i was going to work will you wear em george  george will i wear them he puts then on his wrists ill never take them off till the wars over  minnie pleased you always were a josher  george tell me minnie why did you run away from me two years ago  minnie run away from you i left because i couldnt stand this village any longer it was too quiet for me  george youre a josher you went off while i was away without telling me you were going and then when i found out where you were and hustled over to newcastle in my car you turned me down hard  minnie you didnt have a mortgage on me there were plenty of girls of your own kind at that house party you went to i guess you made love to them too  george they werent in the same class with you youve got the ginger  minnie ive still got the ginger all right  george i thought you cared for me  minnie you always had the nerve george  george you acted as if you did  minnie im a good actor say what was there in it for mepacking tools in the pindar shops and you the son of my boss you didnt want nothing from me except what all men want and you wouldnt have wanted that long  george i was crazy about you  minnie her eyes falling on the travelling pillow and the pincushion picking theron up in turn i guess you told them that too  george embarrassed oh im popular enough when im going away they dont care anything about me  minnie indicating the wristlets you dont want themill give em to bert  george no you wont  minnie i was silly but we had a good time while it lasteddidnt we george     she evades him deftly and picks up the lifepreserving suit  whats thisa full dress uniform  george when a submarine gets you all youve got to do is to jump overboard and blow this     he draws the siren from the pocket and starts to blow it but she    seizes his hand and float around until a destroyer picks you up     takes from another pocket a metal lunch box  this is for pate de foie gras sandwiches and theres room in here     indicating another pocket for a bottle of fizz come along with me minnie ship as a red cross nurse and ill buy you one the atlantic wouldnt be such a bad place with youand we wouldnt be in a hurry to blow the siren youd look like a peach in a white costume too  minnie dont you like me in this  george sure but id like that better  minnie id make a good nurse if i do say it myself and id take good care of you georgeas good as any of them     she nods toward the pillow and pincushion  george better     he seizes her hands and attempts to draw her toward him  you used to let me  minnie that aint any reason  george just once minnieim going away  minnie no i didnt mean to come in herei just wanted to see what you looked like in your uniform     she draws away from him just as dr jonathan appears in the    doorway lower right  goodbye george     she goes out through the doorway upper right     dr jonathan may be almost any agein reality about thirty five    his head is that of the thinker high above the eyes his face    bears evidence in its lines of years of labour and service as well    as of a triumphant struggle against ill health in his eyes is a    thoughtful yet illuminating smile now directed toward george who    when he perceives him is taken aback  dr jonathan hello i was told to come in herei hope im not intruding  george not at all howhow long have you been here  dr jonathan just long enough to get my bearings i came this morning  george oh are youare you dr jonathan  dr jonathan im jonathan and youre george i suppose  george yes he goes to him and shakes hands im sorry to be leaving just as you come  dr jonathan ill be here when you return  george i hope so a pause you wont find foxon falls a bad old town  dr jonathan and it will be a better one when you come back  george why do you say that  dr jonathan smiling it seems a safe conjecture     dr jonathan is looking at the heap of articles on the floor  george grinning and not quite at ease you might imagine i was embarking in the gents furnishing business instead of going to war he picks up the lifepreserving suit some friend of mothers told her about this and she insisted upon sending for it i dont want to hurt her feelings but i cant take it of course     he rolls it up and thrusts it under the sofa upper left  you wont give me away  dr jonathan never  george dad ought to be here in a minute hes in there with old timothy farrell the moulder foreman it seems that things are in a mess at the shops rotten of the men to make trouble nowdont you thinkwhen the countrys at war darned unpatriotic i say  dr jonathan i saw a good many stars in your service flag as i passed the office door this morning  george yes over four hundred of our men have enlisted i dont understand it  dr jonathan perhaps you will george when you come home  george you mean     george is interrupted by the entrance lower right of his mother    augusta pindar she is now in the fifties and her hair is turning    grey her uneventful provincial existence as ashers wife has    confirmed and crystallized her traditional new england views her    conviction that her mission is to direct for good the lives of the    less fortunate by whom she is surrounded she carries her knitting    in her handa pair of socks for george and she goes at once to    dr jonathan  augusta so you are jonathan they told me youd arrivedwhy didnt you come to us do you think its wise to live in that old house of your fathers before its been thoroughly heated for a few days  dr jonathan taking her hand oh im going to live with the doors and windows open  augusta dear me i understand youve been quite ill and you were never very strong as a child i made it my business to go through the house yesterday and i must say it looks comfortable but the carpenters and plumbers have ruined the parlour with that bench and the sink in the corner what are you going to do there  dr jonathan im having it made into a sort of laboratory  augusta you dont mean to say you intend to do any work  dr jonathan work ought to cure me in this climate  augusta you mean to practise medicine you ought to have consulted us im afraid you wont find it remunerative jonathanbut your father was impractical too foxon falls is still a small place in spite of the fact that the shops have grown workmens families cant afford to pay big fees you know  dr jonathan smiling i know  augusta and we already have an excellent physician here dr senn  dr jonathan i shant interfere with dr senn  george laying his hand on augustas shoulder apologetically mother feels personally responsible for every man woman and child in foxon falls i shouldnt worry about dr jonathan if i were you mother ive got a notion he can take care of himself  augusta a little baffled by dr jonathans selfcommand sits down and begins to knit i must get these socks finished for you to take with you my dear to dr jonathan i cant realize hes going to george you havent got all your things in your bag wheres the lifepreserving suit i sent for  george glancing at dr jonathan oh thats gone mother  augusta he always took cold so easily and that will keep him warm and dry if those terrible germans sink his ship but your presents george to dr jonathan made for him by sisters of his college friends  george amused but embarrassed i cant fit up a section of the trenches as a boudoir  augusta such nice girls i wish hed marry one of them who made you the wristlets i hadnt seen them  george taking of the wristlets and putting them in his bag oh i cant give her away i wasjust trying them on to see if they fitted  augusta when did they come  george glancing at dr jonathan erthis morning     enter asher and timothy from the study left asher is evidently    wrought up from his talk with timothy  asher remember timothy i rely on sensible men like you to put a stop to this nonsense  augusta asher heres jonathan  asher oh he goes up to dr jonathan and takes his hand though it is quite evident that his mind is still on the trouble in the shops glad to see you back in foxon falls jonathan i heard youd arrived and would have dropped in on you but things are in a muddle here just now  dr jonathan not only here but everywhere  asher youre right the countrys going to the dogs i dont know what will straighten it out  dr jonathan intelligence openmindedness cooperation asher  asher arrested looking at him hum  dr jonathan leaving him and

the battle lines  augusta you think the germans will come over here  dr jonathan no but the issue is over here already     dr jonathan picks up her ball of wool which has fallen to the    floor  augusta looking at him apprehensively puzzled thank you jonathan     she turns to timothy who has started toward the door lower right  wait a moment timothy i want to ask you about your children what do you hear from minnie i always took an interest in her you knowespecially when she was in the tool packing department of the shops and i had her in my bible class i appreciated your letting her comean irishman and a catholic as you are  timothy the church has given me up as a heathen maam when i married your cook and she a protestant  augusta ive been worried about minnie since she went to newcastle she has so much vitality and im afraid shes pleasure loving though she seemed to take to religion with her whole soul and wheres jamesy  timothy jamesy is it its gone to the bad entirely he is with the drink he left the shops when the twelvehour shifts beganwherever hes at now its home minnie came from newcastle yesterday maam for a visitshes outside there now with bertthey walked along

right george who has been    palpably ill at ease during this conversation now makes for the    door lower right  augusta where are you going my dear  george halting i thought id look around and see if id forgotten anything mother  augusta stay with ustheres plenty of time     timothy returns through the doorway upper right with bert but    without minnie  timothy its disappeared entirely she is maamhere one minute and there the next the way with young people nowadays and shes going back to newcastle this afternoon to her job at the wire works  augusta i must see her before she goes i feel in a measure responsible for her youll tell her  timothy ill tell her  augusta how are you getting along bert  bert very well thank you mrs pindar     the maid enters lower right  maid miss thorpe wishes to speak with you maam  augusta gathering up her knitting its about the wool for the red cross     exit lower right  george shaking hands with bert hello berthow goes it  bert all right thank you lieutenant  george oh cut out the title     bert farrell is about twenty three he wears a brown flannel shirt    and a blue fourinhand tie and a good readymade suit he holds    his hat in front of him he is a selfrespecting able young irish    american of the blueeyed type that have died by thousands on the    battle fields of france and whose pictures may be seen in our    newspapers  asher youre not working today bert  bert ive left the shops mr pindari got through last night  asher left the shops you didnt say anything about this timothy  timothy no siryou have trouble enough today  asher to bert why did you leave  bert im going to enlist mr pindarwith the marines from what ive heard of that corps i think id like to join it  asher exasperated but why do you do a thing like this when you must know i need every man here to help turn out these machines and especially young men like you good mechanics if you wanted to serve your country you were better off where you were i got you exemptedcatching himself i mean you were exempted from the draft  bert i didnt want to be exempted sir more than four hundred of the boys have gone from the shops as well as mr george here and i couldnt stand it no longer  asher whats mr george got to do with it the cases are different  bert stoutly i dont see that mr pindar every man no matter who he is has to decide a thing like this for himself  george berts right dad  asher you say hes right when you know that i need every hand i can get to carry out this contract  george hes going to make a contract too hes giving up all he has  asher and you approve of this timothy  timothy sure i couldnt stop him mr pindar and its proud i am of him the same as you are of mr george that hed be fighting for america and liberty  asher liberty license is what were getting now the workman thinks he can do as he pleases and after all ive done for my workmenbuilding them a club house with a piano in it and a library and a billiard table trying to do my best to make them comfortable and contented i pay them enough to buy pianos and billiard tables for themselves and you tell me they want still higher wages  timothy theyre saying they can go down to the shipyards where theyd be getting five dollars and thirty cents a day  asher let them go to the shipyards if they havent any sense of gratitude what else do they say  timothy that you have a contract sir and making millions out of it  asher what can they know about my profits  timothy its just that sirthey know nothing at all but theyre saying they ought to know since things is different now and theyre working for the war and the country the same as yourself  asher havent i established a system of bonuses to share my profits with the efficient and the industrious  timothy they dont understand the bonuseshow you come by them autocracy is the word they use and they say you put up a notice sudden like without asking them that thered be two long shifts instead of three eighthour ones theyre willing to work twelve hours on end for the war they say but theyd want to be consulted  asher what business is it of theirs  timothy well its them that has to do the hard work sir there was a meeting last night i understand with rench and hillman and a delegate come from newcastle making speeches the only way theyd get their rights would be for you to recognize the union  asher ill never recognize a union i wont have any outsiders meddlers and crooks dictating my business to me  timothy ive been with you thirty years come december mr pindar and youve been a good employer to me i dont hold with the unionsyou know it well sir or you wouldnt be asking me advice im telling you what theyre saying  asher i didnt mean to accuse youyouve been a good and loyal employeethats why i sent for you find out what their game is and let me know  timothy its not a detective i am mr pindar im a workman meself thats another thing theyre saying that youd pay detectives to go among them like workingmen  asher impatiently im not asking you to be a detectivei only want you to give me warning if we are to have a strike  timothy ive warned you sirif its only for the sake of beating the germans the dirty devils  george turning to bert well heres wishing you luck bert and hoping well meet over there i know how you feelyou want to be in it just as i do  asher turning perhaps i said more than i meant to bert ive got to turn out these machines in order that our soldiers may have shrapnel to fight with and what with enlistments and the determination of unscrupulous workmen to take advantage of the situation im pretty hard pressed i cant very well spare steady young men like you who have too much sense and too much patriotism to mix yourselves up with trouble makers but i too can understand your feelingid like to be going myself you might have consulted me but your place will be ready for you when you come back  bert thank you sir he turns his hat over in his hands maybe it would be fair to tell you mr pindar that ive got a union card in my pocket  asher you timothy farrells son  timothy whats that and never a word to me  bert to timothy why wouldnt i join the union i took out the card this morning when i see that thats the only way well get whats coming to us we aint got a chance against the employers without the union  timothy god help me to think my son would join the unionand he going to be a soldier  bert glancing at george i guess therell be other union men in the trenches besides me  asher soldier or no soldier ill never employ any man again whos joined a union  george perturbed hold on dad  asher i mean what i say i dont care who he is  bert who retains his selfpossession excuse me mr pindar but id like to ask you a questionive heard the men talking about this in the shops you dont like it if we go off tofight but if we join the union you fire us no matter how shorthanded you are  asher its a principle with mei wont have any outside agency dictating to me  bert but if it came to recognizing the union or shutting down  asher id shut down tomorrow     george who sees the point makes a gesture as if about to    interrupt  bert thats what im getting at mr pindar you say youd shut down for a principle whether the government gets the machines or not and the men say theyd join the union for a principle whether the government gets the machines or not it looks to me as if both was hindering the war for a principle and the question is which principle is it that agrees best with what were fighting for  asher no man joins a union for a principle but for extortion i cant discuss iti wont  bert im sorry sir     he turns to go out lower right  george overtaking him and grasping his hand so long bert ill look you up over there  bert gazing at him all right mr george  george goodbye timothy dont worry about the boy  timothy its proud i am to have him go mr georgebut i cant think why hed be joining the union and never telling me     he stands for a moment troubled glancing at asher torn between    loyalty to his employer and affection for his son then he goes out    slowly upper right all the while dr jonathan has stood in the    rear of the room occasionally glancing at george he now comes    forward unobtrusively yet withal impressively  asher i never expected to hear such talk from a son of timothy farrella boy i thought was levelheaded to dr jonathan what do you think of that you heard it  dr jonathan well he stated the issue asher  asher the issue of what  dr jonathan of the new century  george the issue of the new century  asher youre right weve got to put these people down after the war theyll come to heelwell have a cheap labour market then  dr jonathan humanity has always been cheap but were spending it rather lavishly just now  asher you mean that there will be a scarcity of labour and that they can continue to blackmail us into paying these outrageous wages  dr jonathan when you pay a man wages asher you own himuntil he is turned over to somebody else  asher puzzled a little suspicious for the first time i own his labour of course  dr jonathan then you own his body and his soul perhaps he resents being regarded as a commodity  asher what else is labour  dr jonathan how would you like to be a commodity  asher i i dont see what that has to do with it these men have no consideration no gratitude after the way ive treated them  dr jonathan isnt that what they object to  asher what  dr jonathan to being treated  asher object to kindness  dr jonathan to benevolence  asher well whats the difference  dr jonathan the difference between selfrespect and dependence  asher areare you a socialist  dr jonathan no im a scientist     asher is standing staring at him when the maid enters lower    right  maid your long distance call to washington sir  asher very well     as he starts to go out he halts and looks at dr jonathan again    and then abruptly leaves the room lower right following the maid  george who has been regarding dr jonathan after a moments hesitation you seem to think theres something to be said for the workmans attitude dr jonathan  dr jonathan what is his attitude george  george well you heard bert just now i thought he had poor old dad on the hip when he accused the employer of holding up the war too but after all what labour is after is more money isnt it and theyre taking advantage of a critical situation to get it and when they get money most of them blow it in on sprees  dr jonathan george what are you going to france to fight for  george germanys insulted our flag murdered our people on the high seas and wants to boss the world  dr jonathan smiling the issue then is human freedom  george sure thing  dr jonathan and you think every man and woman in this country is reasonably free  george every man can rise if he has the ability  dr jonathan what do you mean by rise  george he can make money set up for himself and be his own boss  dr jonathan in other words he can become free  george grinning i suppose thats one way of putting it  dr jonathan money gives him freedom doesnt it money gave you yoursto go to school and college until you were twenty four and get an educationsuch as it was  george such as it was  dr jonathan money gave you the choice of engaging in an occupation in which you could take an interest and a pride and enabled you occasionally to go on a spree if you ever went on a spree george  george once in awhile  dr jonathan but this craving for amusement for excitement and adventure isnt peculiar to you and me workingmen have it tooand working girls  george youre a wise guy i guess  dr jonathan oh nonot that but ive found out that you and i are not so very different from timothy farrell and his childrenbert and jamesy andminnie  george startled and looking around to follow dr jonathans glance toward the windows what do you know about them  dr jonathan oh nothing

which    he acknowledges and then glances toward dr jonathan augusta    with her knitting seats herself in an armchair her attitude is    somewhat inquisitorial her tone as she addresses minnie non    committal she is clearly offended by minnies poise and good    natured selfassertion  augusta you remember mr pindar minnie  minnie demurely glad to meet you again mr pindar i hear youre going off to the war well thats great  george squeezing her hand she winces a little oh yesi remember minnie  augusta and this is dr jonathan pindar  minnie who has been eyeing dr jonathan as a possible enemy with

i came to see what the village looked like  dr jonathan a sort of sentimental journey minnie  minnie flashing a look at george and another at dr jonathan well you might call it that i get you  augusta minnie what church do you attend in newcastle  minnie well i havent got a seat in any particular church mrs pindar  augusta i didnt expect you to go to the expense of getting a seat i hope you

you  augusta knitting you drive about in automobiles  minnie oh sometimes i get a joy ride  augusta it grieves me to hear you talk in this way i knew you were pleasure loving i thought i saw certain tendencies in you yet you seemed to realize the grace of religion when you were in my bible class your brother jamesy took to drink  minnie and i took to religion you meant to be kind mrs pindar and i thank you but now i know why jamesy took to drinkit was for the same reason i took to religion  augusta scandalized minnie  minnie we were both trying to be free to escape  augusta to escape from what  minnie with a gesture indicating futility i guess it would be pretty hard to get it across to you mrs pindar but i was working ten hours a day packing tools in your shops and all you gave me when the whistle blew wasjesus     a pause george takes a step toward her  jamesy took to drink and i took to jesus im not saying anything against him he had his life but i wanted mine maybe he would have understood     turning impulsively toward dr jonathan  ive got a hunch that you understand  augusta minnie i cant let you talk about religion in this way in my presence  minnie im sorry mrs pindar i knew it wasnt no use to come and see youi told father so  augusta i suppose if youre determined to continue this life ofshe catches herself i cant stop you  minnie flaring up what life dont worry

good time on the side  augusta whose conceptions of what she believes to be minnies kind are completely upset you still work  minnie work sure i work i wouldnt let any man get a strangle hold on me and i dont kick at a little overtime neither im working for what hes going to fight forindicating george it aint for myself only but for everybody that aint been free all over the world to dr jonathan

the boys  augusta a nurse  minnie to dr jonathan if i was a man id have been a doctor like you sick people dont bother me i give myself to em before mother died when she was sick she always said id

tears if you wasnt ashamed why didnt you tell her before im not ashamed of it neither it was natural  augusta after a pause with a supreme effort to meet the situation well i suppose men are different but theres no excuse for you after all i tried to do for you  minnie thank god men are different     augusta rises the ball of wool drops to the floor again and dr    jonathan picks it up  george mother id like to tell you about it you dont understand  augusta im afraid i do understand dear     as she leaves the room with dignity george glances appealingly at    dr jonathan  dr jonathan going up to minnie and taking her hand do you think youd have time to drop in to see me minnie before your train goes  minnie gazing at him after a moment sure i guess id like to talk to you  dr jonathan its the little white house across the common  minnie oh i know thats been shut up all these years  dr jonathan and is open now again     he goes out lower right and there is a brief silence as the two    look after him  minnie say who is he  george why hes a cousin of mine  minnie i dont mean that hes somebody aint he  george by jingo im beginning to think he is     they stand gazing at one another  minnie remembering her grievance passionately now youve gone and done ittelling your mother we were friends  george but we arearent we you couldnt expect me to keep quiet under the circumstances  minnie she thinks im not fit to talk to you not that i care except that i was fond of her shes been good to me in her way and i felt real bad when i went off to newcastle with the letter to the minister i never laid eyes on shell believeyou know what shell believeitll trouble her shes your mother and youre going away you might have kept still  george i couldnt keep still what would you have thought of me  minnie it dont make any difference what id have thought of you  george it makes a difference to me and it makes some difference what i think of myself i seem to be learning a good many things this morning  minnie from him  george you mean dr jonathan  minnie yes  george reflecting i dont know im learning them from you from everybody  minnie maybe he put you wise  george well i dont feel wise and seeing you again this morning brought it all back to me  minnie you were only fooling  george i began that wayill own up but i told you id never met a girl like you youre full of pepcouragesomething i cant describe i was crazy about youthats straightbut i didnt realize it until you ran off and then i went after youbut it was no good i dont claim to have been square with you and ive been thinkingwell that im responsible  minnie responsible for what  george wellfor your throwing yourself away down there at newcastle youre too good  minnie with heat throwing myself away  george didnt you didnt you break loosehave a good time  minnie why wouldnt i have a good time thats what you were havinga good time with mewasnt it and say did you ever stop to think what one day of a working girls life was like  george one day  minnie with an alarm clock scaring you out of sweet dreams in the winter while its dark and you get up and dress in the cold and heat a little coffee over a lamp and beat it for the factoryand stand on your feet all morning in a noise that would deafen you feeding a thing you aint got no interest in it dont never need no rest by eleven oclock you think youre all in that the morningll never end but at noon you get a twenty five cent feed that lasts you until about five in the afternoonand then you dont know which way the machines headed ive often thought of one of them cutters at shales as a sort of monster watching you all day waiting to get you when youre too tired to care dreamily when it looks all blurred and you want to put your hand in it  george good god minnie  minnie and when the whistle blows at night all you have is your little hall bedroom in a rooming house that smells of stale smoke and cabbage theres no place to go except the streetsbut youve just got to go somewhere to break loose and have a little funeven though youre so tired you want to throw yourself on the bed and cry     a pause  maybe its because youre tired when youre tired that way is when you want a good time most its funny but its so     a pause  you aint got no friends except a few girls with hall bedrooms like yourself and if a chance comes along for a little excitement you dont turn it down i guess  george after a pause i never knew what your life was like  minnie why would youwith friends and everything you want only to buy it but since the war come on i tell you i aint kicking i can go to a movie or the theatre once in a while and buy nice clothes and i dont get so tired as i used to i dont want nothing from anybody i can take care of myself its money that makes you free  george money  minnie when i looked into this room this morning and saw you standing here in your uniform i says to myself hes changed not that you wasnt kind and good natured and generous george but you didnt know how could you youd never had a chance to learn anything  george bitterly yet smiling in spite of himself thats so  minnie i remember that first night i ran into youi was coming home from your shops and you made love to me right off the bat and after that we used to meet by the watering trough on the lindon road we were kids then and it didnt make no difference how tired i was id get over it as soon as i saw you you were the live wire  george minnie tell me what made you come back to foxon falls today     he seizes her hand  minnie struggling dont georgedont go and be foolish again     the shop whistle blows she pulls away from him and backs toward    the doorway upper right  theres the noon whistle goodbye ill be thinking of you over there  george ill write to you will you write to me minnie  minnie shaking her head dont lose any sleep about me good luck george     she goes to the doorway upper right turns kisses her hand to    george and disappears he goes to the doorway and gazes after her    presently he raises his hand and waves in answer to another signal    and smiles he remains there until minnie is out of sight and then    is about to come back into the room when a man appears on the    sidewalk seen through the windows the man is prag he is a gaunt    workman with high cheek bones and a rather fanatical light in his    blue eyes he stands motionless gazing at the house  george calling do you want anything prag  prag i joost come to look at your house where you live it is no harm is it  george none at all     prag continues to stare at the house and george obeys a sudden    impulse  wont you come in prag  prag looking fixedly at the house no i stay here  george come in a whiledont be unsociable     prag crosses the lawn and enters upper right he surveys the room    curiously defiantly and then george in uniform as he cones down    the stage  youre not working today  prag with bitter gloom i lose my job you dont hear no it is nothings to you and you go away to fight for libertyaint it  george how did you lose your job  prag the foreman come to me last night and says prag i hear you belong to the union you gets out  george after a moments hesitation butthere are plenty of other jobs these days you can go down to the coast and get more than five dollars a day at a shipyard  prag it is easy yes when you have a little home bought already and mortgaged and childrens who go to school here and a wife a long time sick  george im sorry but werent you getting along all right here except your wifes illness i dont want to be impertinenti recognize that its your affair but id like to know why you joined the union  prag why is it you join the army to fight for somethings you would give your life fornot so und you are a soldierwould you run away from your comrades to live safe and happy no that is like me i lose my job i go away from my wife and childrens but it is not for me it is for all to get better things for allfreedoms for all  george thenyou think this isnt a free country  prag when i sail up the harbour at new york twenty years ago and see that liberty shining in the sun i think so yes but now i know for the workmens she is like the iron woman of nuremberg with her spikes when she holds you in her arms you call me a traitor yes when i say that  george noi want to understand  prag i am born in bavaria but i am as good an american as anybetter than you because i know what i fight for what i suffer for i am not afraid of the junkers herei have spiritsbut the germans at home have no spirits you think you fight for freedoms for democracy but you fight for this he waves his hand to indicate the room if i had a million dollars maybe i fight for it tooi dont know  george so you think im going to fight for thisfor money  prag are you going to fight for me for the workmens and their childrens no you want to keep your money to make more of it from your war contracts it is for the capitalist system you fight  george come now capital has some rights  prag i know this that capital is power what is the workmens vote against it against your newspapers and your system america she will not be free until your money power is broken you dont like kings and emperors noyou say to us workmens you are not patriots you are traitors if you do not work and fight to win this war for democracy against kings are we fools that we should worry about kings kings will fall of themselves now you can put me in jail  george i dont want to put you in jail god knows how would you manage it  prag why does not the employer say to his workmens this is our war yours and mines here is my contract here is my profits we will have no secrets we will work together and talk together and win the war together to make the world brighter for our childrens und then we workmens say yes we will work night and day so hard as we can because we are free mens     a fanatical gleams comes into his eyes  but your employer he dont say thatno he says this is my contract this is my shop and if you join the unions to get your freedoms you cannot work with me you are traitors     he rises to a frenzy of exaltation  after this there will be another war and the capitalists will be swept away like the kings     he pauses george is silent  und now i go away and maybe my wife she die before i get to the shipyard at newcastle     he goes slowly out upper right and george does not attempt to    stay him enter asher lower right  asher ive just called up the department in washington and given them a piece of my mindtold em theyd have to conscript labour damn these unions making all this trouble and especially today when youre going off i havent had a chance to talk to you well you know that im proud of you my boy your grandfather went off to the civil war when he was just about your age  george and he knew what he was going to fight for  asher what  george i thought i knew this morning now im not so sure  asher you say that when germany intended to come over here and crush us when she got through with the allies  george no its not so simple as that dad its bigger than that  asher whos been talking to you jonathan pindar i wish to god hed never come to foxon falls i might have known what his opinions would be with his inheritance reproachfully i didnt suppose you could be so easily influenced by sentimentalism george id hoped youd got over that  george are you sure its sentimentalism dad dr jonathan didnt say much but ill admit he started me thinking ive begun to realize a few things  asher what things  george glancing at the clock on the mantel i havent got time to tell youim afraid i couldnt make it clear anywayit isnt clear in my own mind yet butgo slow with this labour business dad theres dynamite in it  asher dynamite  george human dynamite theyre full of itwere full of it too i guess theyre not so different from you and me though ill admit that many of them are ignorant prejudiced and bitter but this row isnt just the result of restlessness and discontentthats the smoke but the fires there too ive heard enough this morning to be convinced that theyre struggling for something fundamental that has to do with human progressthe issue behind the war its obscured now in the smoke now if thats so you cant ignore it dad you cant suppress it the only thing to do is to sit down with them and try to understand it if theyve got a case if the union has come to stay recognize it and deal with it  asher youyou my son are not advising me to recognize the union to give our employees a voice in our private affairs  george courageously but is the war our private affair dad hasnt it changed things already     asher makes a gesture of pain of repudiation george approaches    him appealingly  dad you know how much weve always been to each other id hate to have any misunderstanding between usespecially today ive always accepted your judgment but im over twenty one im going to fight this war ive got to make up my own mind about it  asher extending his arms and putting his hands on georges shoulders somethings upset you today my boyyou dont know what youre saying when you get over there and take command of your men youll see things in a truer proportion  george no i cant leave it this way dad ive come to feel this thing its got hold of me now i shant change and ill be thinking of it over there all the time if we dont talk it out  asher for gods sake george dont speak of it againdont think of it theres no sacrifice i wouldnt make for you in reason but youre asking me to go against my lifelong convictions as your father i forbid you to entertain such ideashe breaks off choking dont speak of them dont think of them     timothy farrell steps inside the doorway upper right followed by    bert and after a few moments by dr jonathan  timothy excuse me sir but you asked me to be letting you know if i heard anything theres a meeting called for tonight and theyll strike on monday morning its certain i am from the way the men are talkingunless yed agree to meet the committee this afternoon and come to an understanding like  asher let them strike if they burned down the shops this afternoon i wouldnt stop them he waves timothy off my boy is leaving for france and im going to new york with him  timothy with a sudden flaring up of sympathy its meself has a boy going too mr pindar and maybe its almost the last ill be seeing of him this noon hour just a word with ye before its too late sir  asher suppressing him no let them strike     he turns to hide his emotion and then rushes out of the door lower    right george and bert come forward and stand with timothy silent    after ashers dramatic exit when timothy perceives dr jonathan  timothy did you see my minnie doctor she went to your house  dr jonathan i met her on the street just now and left her with mrs prag  george prags wife youve been to see her  dr jonathan yes her condition is serious she needs a nurse and minnie volunteered  timothy my minnie is it then she wont be going back to newcastle  dr jonathan looking at george she wont be going back to newcastle  timothy thats minnie he turns to george well goodbye mr georgeill say god bless you again he looks at bert youll be fighting over there the pair of you for freedom have an eye on him sir if you cangive him some good advice  george his hand on berts shoulder bert can take care of himself i guess ill be needing the advice     he shakes hands with timothy                   curtain     act ii  scene   a fairly large room in dr jonathans house in foxon falls which    has been converted into a laboratory the house antedates the    pindar mansion having been built in the first decade of the    nineteenth century and though not large has a certain distinction    and charm the room has a panelled wainscoting and a carved wooden    mantel middle left painted white like the doors into the    fireplace is set a franklin stove the windows at the rear have    small panes the lower sashes are raised the tops of the hollyhocks    and foxgloves in the garden bed may be seen above the window sills    and the apple trees beyond under the windows is a long table on    which are chemical apparatus a white enamelled sink is in the rear    right corner the walls are whitewashed the wooden floor bare a    door left in the rear leads into dr jonathans office another    middle right into a little front hall  time a july morning 1918       minnie farrell in the white costume worn by nurses and laboratory    workers is at the bench pouring liquid into a test tube and    holding its up to the light when dr jonathan enters from the    right  dr jonathan has anyone been in minnie  minnie turning with the test tube in her hand now what a question to ask dr jonathan was there ever a morning or afternoon that somebody didnt stray in here with their troubles fiercely they dont think a scientist has a real jobthey dont understand if you put this acrossshe holds up the test tubeyoull save the lives of thousands of soldiers and a few ordinary folks too i guess but you wont let me tell anyone  dr jonathan it will be time enough to tell them when we do put it across  minnie but were going tothat is youre going to  dr jonathan youre too modest minnie  minnie me modest but what makes me sore is that they dont give you a chance to put this thing across dr senns a back number and if theyre sick they come here and expect you to cure em for nothing  dr jonathan but they cant complain if i dont cure them  minnie and half the time they aint sick at allthey only imagine it  dr jonathan well thats interesting toopart of a doctors business its pretty hard to tell in these days where the body ends and the soul begins  minnie it looks like youre cutting out the minister too youd ought to be getting his salary  dr jonathan then id have to do his job  minnie i get youyoud be paid to give em all the same brand of dope you wouldnt be free  dr jonathan to experiment  minnie you couldnt be a scientist say every time i meet the minister i want to cry he says to himself she ran away from jesus and went to the bad what right has she got to be happy and mrs pindars just the same if you leave the straight and narrow path you cant never get backthey keep pushing you off  dr jonathan who has started to work at the bench ive always had my doubts about your sins minnie  minnie oh i was a sinner all right theyll never get that out of their craniums but being a sinner isnt a patch on being a scientist its nearly a year now since you took me in the times flown when i was in the pindar shops and in the wire works at newcastle i could always beat the other girls to the main street when the whistle blew but now im sorry when night comes i cant hardly wait to get back herehonest to god say dr jonathan ive found out one thingits being in the right place that keeps a man or a woman straight if youre in the wrong place all the religion in the world wont help you if youre doing work you like that youve got an interest in and thats some use you dont need religion she pauses why thats religionit aint preaching and praying and reciting creeds its doingits fun theres no reason why religion oughtnt to be fun is there  dr jonathan none at all  minnie now if we could get everybody in the right job we wouldnt have any more wars i guess  dr jonathan the millennium always keeps a lap aheadwe never catch up with it  minnie well i dont want to catch up with it we wouldnt have anything more to do say its nearly eleven oclockwould you believe itand ive been expecting mr pindar to walk in here with the newspaper i forgot he was in washington  dr jonathan he was expected home this morning  minnie what gets me is the way he hangs around here too like everybody else and yet ive heard him call you a socialist and swear he hasnt any use for socialists  dr jonathan perhaps hes trying to find out what a socialist is nobody seems to know  minnie he dont know anyway if it hadnt been for you his shops would have been closed down last winter  dr jonathan it looks as if theyd be closed down now anyway  minnie concerned looking up is that so well he wont recognize the unionhe doesnt know what century hes living in but hes human all the same and hes good to the people hes fond of like my fatherand he sure loves george hes got georges letters all wore out reading them to people a pause he dont know where george is does he dr jonathan  dr jonathan somewhere in france  minnie we spotted bert because hes with the marines at that place where they put a crimp in the huns the other day when they were going to walk into paris  dr jonathan chateauthierry  minnie ill leave it to you but say dr jonathan things dont look good to meim scared we wont get enough of our boys over there before the deals closed up ive got so i dont want to look at a paper     a brief silence  i never told you george wrote me a couple of letters did i  dr jonathan no im quite sure you didnt  minnie i never told nobody his father and mother would be wild if they knew it i didnt answer themi just sent him two post cards with no writing on except the addressjust pictures  dr jonathan pictures  minnie one of the pindar church and the other of the pindar shops i guess hell understand they were from me all right you see when i ran away from the pindar shops and the pindar churchi always connect them togetheri was stuck on george thats why i ran away  dr jonathan i see  minnie oh i never let him know i dont know why i told youi had to tell somebodyand you wont give me away  dr jonathan you may count on me  minnie he didnt care nothing about me really but you cant help liking george hes human all right if he was boss of the pindar shops there wouldnt be any strike     a knock at the door right  i wonder whos butting in now     she goes to the door and jerks it open     a mans voice without good morning miss farrell is the doctor    in  minnie this is his busy day  dr jonathan going toward the door oh its you hillman come in  minnie i guess ill go for the mail     with a resigned expression she goes oust right as hillman comes in    followed by rench and fersen they are the strike committee    hillman is a little man with red hair and a stiff bristling red    moustache he holds himself erect and walks on the balls of his    feet quietly rench is tall and thin with a black moustache    like a seals he has a loud nasal voice and an assertive manner    fersen is a blond swede     dr jonathan puts one or two objects in place on the bench his    manner is casual but cordial despite the portentous air of the    committee     the men their hats in their hands go toward the bench and inspect    the test tubes and apparatus  rench new england twang always manage to have something on hand when you aint busy with the folks doctor it must be interestin to fool with these here chemicals  dr jonathan it keeps me out of mischief  hillman i guess you havent much time to get into mischief  fersen we dont like to bother you  dr jonathan no bother fersensit down he draws forward some chairs and they sit down how is the baby  fersen oh she is fine now since we keep her outside in the baby carriage like you tell us     fersen grins and immediately becomes serious again a brief    silence  hillman clearing his throat the fact is dr jonathan the boys have struckvoted last night to walk out at noon today  fersen we thought we tell you now you been such a good friend to us and our families  dr jonathan but isnt this rather sudden with mr pindar in washington  rench we couldnt wait no longerhes been standing us off for more than a year when he comes back from washington therell be nothing doing hes got to recognize the union or lose his contract  dr jonathan he may prefer to lose his contract  rench well he can afford to then he can go to hell  hillman hold on sam that aint no way to talk to the doctor  rench i didnt mean no disrespect to him he dont go round preachin like some fellers i could mention but actions is louder than words aint that the reason were here because he sympathizes with us and thinks were entitled to a little more of this freedom thats bein handed round we want you to help us doctor  dr jonathan it seems to me youve come a little late renchafter the event  hillman maybe if youd said a word theyd never have voted to strike  fersen but you never said nothing doctor  dr jonathan well when you get around to admitting doctors to your labour unions perhaps theyll talk  hillman if all the doctors was like you  dr jonathan give em a chance hillman  hillman we dont have to explain to you why we want the unionits the only way well ever get a say about the conditions in which we work and live now that the day of individual bargaining is gone by you understand mr pindar raised our wages when we threatened to strike last fall but he calculates to drop em again when the soldiers come home  fersen nodding sure thing  hillman its this way doctor we notice mr pindar comin in here to see you every day or solike the rest of foxon falls and we thought you could make him see this thing straight if any man could  dr jonathan so the shops will be idle  rench not a shaftll turn over till he recognizes the union  hillman we dont want to do nothin to obstruct the war but weve got to have our rights  dr jonathan can you get your rights now without obstructing the war  rench aggressively i get what youre driving at doctor youre going to say that weve just reached quantity production on these here machines and if labour gets from under now the huns win but tell me thiswherell labour be if america wins and our junkers he pronounces the j come out on topas they callate to  dr jonathan smiling when a building with dry rot catches fire rench can you put limit to how much of it will burn  rench after a pause maybe not i get youbut  dr jonathan no nation no set of men in any nation can quench that fire or make the world that is coming out of this war they may think they can but they cant  hillman thats so  dr jonathan germany will be beaten because it is the temper of the nation the temper of the timesyour temper you dont want germany to win rench  rench no i guess not  dr jonathan and if you dont work here youll go off to work somewhere else  rench where they recognize the union  dr jonathan a good many of your friends have enlisted havent they rench nods and what do you suppose they are fighting for  rench for the same thing as we want a square deal  dr jonathan and what do you think george pindar is fighting for  rench i aint got nothing to say against him  dr jonathan if you close down the pindar shops wont it mean that a few more of your friends will lose their lives these men are fighting for something they dont yet understand but when they come back theyll know more about it why not wait until george pindar comes back  rench he maynt never come back  dr jonathan give him the opportunity  rench i like georgehes always been friendlywhat we call a common man up here in new englandnaturally democratic but at bottom employers is all alike what makes you think he wont take his ideas about labour from the old man  dr jonathan because he belongs to the generation that fights this war  hillman shuffling it aint no use doctor unless you can bring mr pindar round the shopsll close down  dr jonathan i cant but something else can  hillman what  dr jonathan circumstances no man can swim up stream very long in these days hillman wait a while and see  rench rising weve voted to put this strike through and by god well do it  fersen rising and shaking hands with dr jonathan its fine weather doctor  rench bursting into a laugh hes like the man who said when congress declared war its a fine day for it its a fine day for a strike  hillman who has risen shaking hands with dr jonathan but youll talk to mr pindar anyway  dr jonathan smiling yes ill talk with him     enter timothy farrell right in working clothes  timothy good morning doctor surveying the committee so its here ye are after voting to walk out of the shops just when were beginning to turn out the machines for the soldiers  rench if wed done right wed have called the strike a year ago  timothy fine patriots ye areas im sure the doctor is after telling youto let the boys thats gone over there be murdered because ye must have your union  hillman if mr pindar recognizes the union timothy well go to work tomorrow  timothy he recognize the union hell recognize the devil first even dr jonathan with all the persuasion he has couldnt get mr pindar to recognize the union hell close down the shops and its hunting a job ill be and i here going on thirty years  rench if he closes the shopswhat then the blood of the soldiersll be on his head not ours if there were fewer scabs

bare fists im a workman meself but i dont hold with traitors  rench whos a traitor its you who are a traitor to your class if a union card makes a man a traitor your own son had one in his pocket the day he enlisted  timothy a traitor and he fighting for his country while youd be skulking here to make trouble for it     minnie appears on the threshold of the door right dr jonathan    who is the first to perceive from her expression that there is    something wrong takes a step toward her after a moments silence    she comes up to timothy and lays a hand on his arm  timothy bewildered what is

in silence  come with me as far as the shops minnie thank you doctoras dr jonathan gives him the hatits you ill be wanting to see when i get me mind again     dr jonathan goes with timothy and minnie as far as the door    right and then comes back thoughtfully to the bench takes up a    test tube and holds it to the light presently asher pindar    appears in the doorway right  asher good morning jonathan  dr jonathan good morning asher i didnt know youd got back from washington  asher i came in on the mail train  dr jonathan have you been to the office  asher no i stopped at the house to speak to augusta and thenhe speaks a trifle apologeticallywell i went for a little walk  dr jonathan a walk  asher ive been turning something over in my mind and the country looked so fine and fresh i crossed the covered bridge to the other side of the river when george was a child i used to go over there with him on summer afternoons he was such a companionable little shaverhed drop his toys when hed see me coming home from the office i can see him now running along that road over there stopping to pick funny little bouquetsthe kind a child makes you knowoxeyed daisies and red clover and buttercups all mixed up together and hed carry them home and put them in a glass on the desk in my study     a pause  it seems like yesterday its hard to realize that hes a grown man fighting over there in the trenches and that any moment i may get a telegram or be called to the telephonehave you seen todays paper  dr jonathan no  asher it looks like more bad newsthe germans have started another one of those offensives i was afraid they were getting ready for it west of verdun this time and george may be in that sector for all i know how is this thing going to end jonathan that damned military machine of theirs seems invincibleit keeps grinding on are we going to be able to stem the tide or to help stem it with a lot of raw youths theyve only had a years training  dr jonathan germany cant win asher  asher what makes you say that we started several years too late  dr jonathan and germany started several centuries too late  asher my god i hope youre right i dont know     he walks once or twice up and down the room  ive had another letter  dr jonathan this morning  asher noi got it before i left for washington but i didnt bring it in to you i wanted to think about it     he draws the letter together with a folded paper from his pocket    and lays the paper down on the bench then he adjusts his glasses    and begins to read  dear dad  the sky is the colour of smeared charcoal we havent been in the trenches long enough to evolve web feet so mine are resting on a duck board spread over a quagmire of pea soup the heinies are right here soaking in another ditch beyond a barbed wire fence about the distance of second base from the home plate such is modern war  but these arent the things that trouble me last night when i was wet to the skin and listening to the shellseach singing its own song in the darknessi was able to think with astonishing ease better than if i were sitting at a mahogany desk in a sound proof room i was thinking over the talk we had the day i left homedo you remember itabout the real issue of this war ive thought of it time and again but ive never written you about it since i have been in france i have had a liberal education gathered from all sorts and conditions of men right here in the trench near me are a street car conductor a haberdasher a swedish farm hand a grocery clerk a college professor a pole from the chicago stock yards an irish american janitor of a new york apartment house and grierson from cleveland whose father has an income of something like a million a year we have all decided that this is a war for the under dog whether he comes from belgium or armenia or that socalled land of democracy the united states of america the hope that spurs us on and makes us willing to endure these swinish surroundings and die here in the mud if need be is that the world will now be reorganized on some intelligent basis that grierson and i if we get back wont have to rot on a large income and petrified ideas but will have some interesting and creative work to do economic inequalities must be reduced and those who toil must be given a chance to live not merely to exist their lives must include a little leisure comfortable homes art and beauty and above all an education that none of us especially those of us who went to universities never gotbut which now should be available for all  the issue of this war is industrial democracy without which political democracy is a farce that sentence is dr jonathans but when i was learning how to use the bayonet from a british sergeant in picardy i met an english manufacturer from northumberland he is temporarily an officer i know your opinion of theorists but this man is working out the experiment with human chemicals after all the constitution of the united states now antiquated and revered once existed only in the brains of french theorists in the beginning was the word but the deed must follow this englishman whose name is wray has given me the little pamphlet he wrote from his experience and i shall send it to you  though i am writing this letter in what to me is a solemn and undoubtedly exalted hour i am sure that my mind was never clearer or saner dad i have set my heart on inaugurating an experiment in industrial democracy in foxon falls id like to be able to thinkif anything happened to methat the pindar shops were among the first in america to recognize that we are living in a new era and a changed world     asher walks over to the bench and lays down the open letter on it  if anything should happen to that boy jonathan there wouldnt be anything in life left for me industrial democracy so you put that into his head socialism i suppose  dr jonathan no experimental science  asher call it what you like what surprises me is when i look back over the months youve been here how well weve got along in spite of your views  dr jonathan why not say in spite of yours asher  asher smiling involuntarily well its been a comfort to drop in here and talk to you in spite of what you believe youve got the gift of sympathy jonathan but i dont approve of youre spending your time in this sort of workhe waves a hand toward the benchwhich may never come to anything and in doctoring people for nothing and patching up their troubles i daresay you enjoy it but what worries me is how you are going to live  dr jonathan by practising your cardinal virtue thrift  asher ive got a proposal to make to you part of a scheme ive been turning over in my mind for the last six monthsand when georges letter came i decided to put it through i went to new york and had sterry a corporation lawyer draw it up im going to prove im not a mossback it will reorganize the pindar shops  dr jonathan well thats good news  asher first with reference to your part in it i shall establish a free hospital for my employees and put you in charge of it at a salary of five thousand a year after all youre the only pindar left except george and im satisfied that as a doctor youre up to the job since youve driven dr senn out of business  dr jonathan practical proof asher fortunately dr senn has enough to live on  asher in offering you this position i have only one stipulation to makehe clears his throatits about minnie farrell i think the world of timothy i wouldnt willingly hurt his feelings but i cant have minnie with you in the hospital jonathan you deserve a great deal of credit for what youve done for the girl youve kept her out of mischief but considering her past her life at newcastlewell even if i approved of having her in the hospital augusta would never hear of it and then she had some sort of an affair with georgei daresay there was nothing wrong  dr jonathan wrong is a question of code asher weve all had pastswhat interests me is minnies future  asher of course you wouldnt decline my offer on minnies account  dr jonathan on my own account asher well say no more about minnie  asher you refuse to help me when im starting out on a liberal scheme which i thought you would be the first to endorse  dr jonathan i have not refused to help youbut you have not told me the scheme  asher well he taps the paper in his hand for those employees who serve me faithfully i have arranged pensions  dr jonathan for those in other words who refrain from taking their destinies in their own hands and who do as you wish  asher for those who are industrious and make no trouble and i have met the objection that they have no share in the enterprise by allowing them on favourable terms to acquire stock in the company  dr jonathan i see you will let them acquire half of the stock in order that they may have an equal voice  asher equal its my company isnt it  dr jonathan at present  asher i supply the capital furthermore i have arranged for a system of workmens committees which i recognize and with which i will continually consult thats democratic enoughisnt it if the men have any grievances these will be presented in an orderly manner through the committees  dr jonathan and if you find the demandsreasonable you grant them  asher certainly but one thing i set my face against as a matter of principle i wont recognize the unions  dr jonathan butwho is to enforce the mens side of this contract  asher what do you mean  dr jonathan what guarantee have they other than a union organization that you will keep faith  asher my word  dr jonathan oh  asher never in my life have i regarded my possessions as my own i am a trustee  dr jonathan the sole trustee  asher under god  dr jonathan and you have gods proxy well it seems to me that that is a very delightful arrangement asherwilliam appears to approve of it too  asher william william who  dr jonathan william hohenzollern  asher you compare me to the kaiser  dr jonathan only in so far as you have in common a certain benevolence asher wouldnt your little plan if your workmen accepted it keep you in as a benevolent autocrat  asher me an autocrat  dr jonathan you are preparing to give your men more privileges and perhaps more money on the condition that they will renounce rights to which they are entitled as free men you are ready to grant anything but a constitution so is william  asher do you seriously suggest that i give labour a voice in my business  dr jonathan doesnt george suggest it when he pleads for industrial democracy he seems to think that he is ready to give his life for it and bert farrell has already given his life for it  asher agitatedly what timothys boy bert is he dead why didnt you tell me  dr jonathan gently ive had no chance minnie and timothy were here just before you came in  asher oh god im sorryim sorry for timothy it might have beenill go and see timothy where is heat his house  dr jonathan no at the shops he wanted to keep working until they close down  asher who has started for the door right turns what do you mean     there is a knock at the door  dr jonathan i mean that the moment has come asher to remember george that your opportunity is hereheed it  asher i cant i wont desert my principles     the knock is repeated dr jonathan goes to the door and opens it    enter in the order named hillman rench and fersen  hillman beg your pardon mr pindar weve been waiting for you at the office and we heard you was here  asher  facing them with a defiance almost leonine well what is it  hillman glancing at dr jonathan theres a matter wed like to talk over with you mr pindar as soon as convenient  asher this is as convenient as any time right now  hillman the men voted to strike last night maybe dr jonathan has told you  asher voted to strike behind my back while i was in washington attending to the nations business  rench it aint as if this was anything new mr pindar as if we hadnt been discussing this here difference for near a year youve had your warning right along  asher didnt i raise your wages last january  hillman wait a minute mr pindar he looks at dr jonathan it oughtnt to be only what you saywhat capital says collective bargaining is only right and fair now that individual bargaining has gone by we want to be able to talk to you as man to manthats only selfrespecting on our part all youve got to do is to say one word that youll recognize the union and ill guarantee there wont be any trouble  rench if you dont we walk out at noon  hillman with an attempt at conciliation i know if we could sit down and talk this thing out with you mr pindar youd see it reasonable  asher reasonable treasonable you meanto strike when the lives of hundreds of thousands of your fellow countrymen depend on your labour  rench we aint strikingyoure striking  fersen nodding thats right  rench were ready to go back to work this afternoon if you treat us like americans fersen nods you say were obstructing the war by not giving inwhats the matter with you giving in aint the employers just as much traitors as we  hillman hold on samwe wont get nowhere by calling names lets discuss it cool  asher i refuse to discuss it     he takes the paper out of his docket and holds it up  do you see this paper its a plan i had made of my own free will for the betterment and advancement of the working class it was inspired by the suggestion of my son who is now fighting in france i came back to foxon falls this morning happy in the hope that i was to do something to encourage what was good in labourand how have i been met with a demand with a threat i was a fool to think you could stand decent treatment     he seizes the paper and tears it in two  hillman wait a minute mr pindar if you wont listen to us maybe dr jonathan would say a word for us he understands how we feel  asher savagely tearing the paper in two and then again in four thats my answer i wont have dr pindar or anyone else interfering in my private affairs  rench all righti guess were wasting time here boys we walk out and stay out threateningly not a shaftll turn over in them shops until you recognize the union and if thats treason go back to washington and tell em so come on boys     he walks out followed by fersen nodding and lastly by hillman    who glances at dr jonathan asher stares hard at them as they    leave then an expression of something like agony crosses his    face  asher my god its come my shops shut down for the first time in my life and when the government relies on me     dr jonathan stoops down and picks up the fragments of the document    from the floor  what are you doing  dr jonathan trying to save the pieces asher  asher ive got no use for them now  dr jonathan but history may have  asher history history will brand these men with shame for all time ill fix em ill go back to washington and if the government has any backbone if its still american theyll go to work or fight pointedly this is what comes of your utopian dreams of your socialism     a polak woman is seen standing in the doorway right  woman doctor  dr jonathan yes  woman my baby is seeki think maybe you come and see him mrs ladislaw she tell me you cure her little boy and that maybe you come if i ask you  dr jonathan yes ill come what is your name  woman sasenoshky  dr jonathan your husband is in the shops  woman he was doctor now he is in the american army  dr jonathan sasenoshkyin the american army  woman proudly yes he is good american nowhe fight to make them free in the old country too  dr jonathan well well have a look at the baby he may be in the white house some daypresident sasenoshky ill be back asher     the noon whistle blows  asher thats the signal ill get along too  dr jonathan where are you going  asher i guess it doesnt make much difference where i go     he walks out followed by dr jonathan and the woman the room is    empty for a moment and then minnie farrell enters through the    opposite door left from dr jonathans office she gazes around    the room and then goes resolutely to the bench and takes up several    test tubes in turn holding theme to the light suddenly her eye    falls on georges letter which asher has left open on the bench    with the envelope beside it minnie slowly reaches out and picks it    up and then holds it to her lips she still has the letter    in her hand gazing at it when augusta pindar enters right  augusta oh i thought mr pindar was here  minnie perhaps hes been herei dont know i just came in she hesitates a second then goes to the bench and lays the letter down  augusta he must have been herehe told me he was coming to talk with dr pindar     she approaches the bench and glances at the letter  isnt that a letter from my son  minnie a little defiantly yet almost in tears i guess it is  augusta it was written to you  minnie no  augusta then what were you doing with it  minnie i justpicked it up you think i was reading it well i wouldnt  augusta then how did you know it was written by my son     minnie is silent  you must be familiar with his handwriting i think id better take it she folds it up and puts it in the envelope does george write to you  minnie ive had letters from him  augusta since he went to france  minnie yes  augusta after a pause ive never approved of dr findar employing you here i warned him against youi told him that you would betray his kindness as you betrayed mine but he wouldnt listen to me i told him that a girl who was capable of drawing my son into an intrigue while she was a member of the church and of my bible class a girl who had the career you had in newcastle couldnt become a decent and trustworthy woman the very fact that you had the audacity to come back to foxon falls and impose on dr pindars simplicity proves it  minnie you know all about me mrs pindar  augusta i wasnt born yesterday  minnie oh ladies like you christian ladies are hard they wont believe nothing good of anybodyonly the bad youve always been sheltered youve always had everything youd want and you come and judge us working girls youd drive me out of the only real happiness i ever had being here with a man like dr jonathan doing work its a pleasure to doa pleasure every minutework that may do good to thousands of people to the soldiers over theremaybe to george for all you know she burst into tears you cant understandhow could you after all youre his mother i oughtnt to forget it  augusta yes im his mother and you you havent given up the idea that he may marry you some day if you stay here and pretend to have reformed you write to him george may have been foolish but he isnt as foolish as that  minnie he doesnt care about me  augusta im glad you realize it but you mean to stay here in foxon falls nevertheless you take advantage of dr pindar who is easily imposed upon as his father was before him but if i told you that you might harm dr pindar by staying here interfere with his career would you be willing to leave  minnie me me doing dr jonathan harm  augusta yes i happen to know that he has very little money he makes none he never asks anyone for a bill he spends what he has on this kind of thingresearch for the benefit of humanity as he thinksbut very little research work succeeds and even then it doesnt pay  minnie he doesnt care about money  augusta perhaps not he is one of those impractical persons who have to be looked out for if they are fortunate enough to have anyone to look out for them since he is a cousin of my husband mr pindar considers him as one of his many responsibilities mr pindar has always had in a practical way the welfare of his working people at heart and now he proposes to establish a free hospital for them and to put dr pindar in charge of it this will give him a good living as well as a definite standing in the community which he needs also  minnie hes the biggest man in foxon falls today  augusta that is as one thinks at any rate he has this opportunity are you going to stand in the way of it  minnie me stand in the way of it  augusta if dr pindar accepts the place you cant go with himyou will have to find some other position mr pindar is firm about that and rightly so but i believe dr pindar would be quite capable of refusing rather than inconvenience anyone with whom he is connected  minnie youre right there  augusta hes quixotic  minnie if thats a compliment youre right again  augusta it isnt exactly a compliment  minnie i guess you mean hes queerbut youre wrongyoure wrong hes the only man in foxon falls who knows what kind of a world were going to live in from now on why because hes a scientist because hes trained himself to think straight because he understands people like you and people like me he dont blame us for what we dohe knows why we do it     a pause  thats the reason i try not to blame you for being hardyou cant understand a girl like me you cant understand george  augusta white well leave my son out of the conversation if you please we were talking of dr pindar you seem to have some consideration for him at least  minnie id go to the electric chair for him  augusta im not asking you to do that  minnie you want me to go away and get another place i remember a lesson you gave us one day in bible class judge not that you be not judgedthat was what you talked about but youre judging me on what you think is my recordand youd warn people against hiring me if everybody was a christian like that these days id starve or go on the street  augusta we have to pay for what we do  minnie and you make it your business to see that we pay     a pause  well ill go i didnt know how poor dr jonathan washe never said anything about it to me ill disappear  augusta you have some good in you  minnie dont begin talking to me about good     timothy farrell enters right  timothy good morning maam looking at minnie and augusta i came to fetch minnie to pass an hour with me  augusta agitated and taken aback werewere having a little talk she goes up to timothy im distressed to hear about bert  timothy thank you for your sympathy maam     a brief silence enter asher right  asher surveying the group you here augusta he goes up to timothy and presses his hand i wanted to see you timothyi understand how you feel we both gave our sons in this war youve lost yours and i expect to lose mine  augusta asher  timothy dont say that mr pindar  asher why not what right have i to believe after what has happened in my shops today that hell come back  timothy god forbid that he should be lost too theres trouble enoughsorrow enough  asher sorrow enough but if a man has one friend left timothy its something  timothy surprised sure i hope its a friend i am sira friend this thirty years  asher were both old fashioned timothywe cant help that  timothy im old fashioned enough to want to be working and now that the strikes on whatever will i do well bert is after giving his life for human libertythe only thing a greathearted country like america would be fighting for theres some comfort in that i think of him as a little boy like when hed be carrying me dinner pail to the shops at noon runnin and leppin and callin out to me and he only that high  asher as a little boy  timothy yes sir its when i like to think of him best theres a great comfort in childher and when they grow up we lose them anyway but its fair beset ill be now with nothing to do but think of him  asher you can thank these scoundrels who are making this labour trouble for that  timothy scoundrels is it scoundrels is a hard word mr pindar  asher what else are they scoundrels and traitors dont tell me that youve gone over to them timothythat youve deserted me too that you sympathize with these agitators who incite class against class  timothy ive heard some of them saying sir that if the unions gain what theyre after therell be no classes at all at all and classes is what some of us didnt expect to find in this country but freedom  asher freedom theyre headed for anarchy and they havent an ounce of patriotism  timothy meaningly dont say that sir me own boy is after dying over there and plenty have gone out of your own shops as ye can see for yourself every time you pass under the office door with some of the stars in the flag turning to gold and those who stays at home and works through the night is patriots too the unions may be no better than they should be but the working man isnt wanting anyone to tell him whether hed be joining them or not  asher i never expected to hear you talk like this  timothy nor i sir but its the sons mr pindarthe childher that changes us ive been thinking this morning that bert had a union card in his pocket when he went awayand if he died for that kind of liberty its good enough for his old father to live for i see how wicked it was to be old fashioned  asher wicked  timothy isnt it the old fashioned nation were fighting with its kings and emperors and generals that would crush the life and freedom out of them that need life and why wouldnt the men have the right to organize sir the way that theyd have a word to say about what theyd be doing  asher youyou ask me to sacrifice my principles and yield to men who are deliberately obstructing the war  timothy often times principles is nothing but pride sir and it might be yourself thats obstructing the war when with a simple word from you theyd go on working  asher agitatedly i cant i wont recognize a labour union  timothy have patience sir i know yeve a kind heart and that yeve always acted according to your light the same as me but theres more light now sirits shining through the darkness brighter than the flashes of the cannon over there in the moulding room just now it seems to break all around me and me crying like a child because the boy was gone there was things i hadnt seen before or if i saw them it was only dimlike to trouble me asher turns away the same as you are troubled now and to think its me that would pity you mr pindar i says to myself ill talk to him i aint got no learning i cant find the words im afterbut maybe i can persuade him it aint the same world were living in  asher i was ready to recognize that before they came to me this morning i had made a plan to reorganize the shops to grant many privileges  timothy youll excuse me sir but its what they dont wantanyone to be granting them privileges but to stand on their own feet the same as you i never rightly understood until just nowand that because i was always looking up while youd be looking down and seeing nothing but the bent backs of them its inside we must be looking sirand god made us all the same you and me and mr george and my son bert and the polak and his wife and childher its the strike in every one of us sirand half the time wed not know why were striking  asher youre right there timothy  timothy but that makes no difference sir its what we cant be reasoning but the nature in us all     he flings his arm toward the open windows like the flowers and the trees in the doctors garden groping to the light of the sun maybe the onell die for lack of the proper soil and many is cruelly trampled on but the restll be growing and none to stop em  asher pacing to the end of the room and turning no i wont listen to it youyou ask me to yield to them when you have lost your son when theyre willing to sacrificeto murder my son on the field of battle     he pauses and looks toward the doorway right dr jonathan    standing there holding in his hand a yellow envelope asher    starts forward  a telegram for me  dr jonathan yes asher     after giving it to asher dr jonathan takes his stand beside    minnie who is at the back of the room near the bench he lays a    hand on her arm asher tears open the envelope and stares at the    telegram his hands trembling  asher exclaiming in a half whisper george  augusta oh asher notnot     she reaches for the telegram he gives it to her she reads captain george pindar severely wounded condition critical  timothy please god hell be spared to ye                   curtain     act iii  scene same as in act i the library of asher pindars house  time   the following day early afternoon a storm is raging with wind    and rain and occasional bright flashes of lightning and heavy peals    of thunder asher is pacing up and down the room folding and    unfolding his hands behind his back when augusta enters lower    right her knitting in her hand there is a flash and a peal of    thunder  augusta oh asher did you know that the elm at the end of the common was struck just nowthat splendid old landmark  asher all the old landmarks are being struck down one after another  augusta going up to him and putting her hand on his arm ive been so nervous all day do be careful how you go about during this strike those sullen and angry groups of men on the street this morning  asher oh they wouldnt dare touch me if we only had a state constabulary wed soon break that sort of thing up but the legislature trembles whenever a labour leader opens his mouth  augusta sitting down and taking up her knitting if only i could be of some help to you but its always been so  asher youve been a good wife augusta  augusta i dont know ive kept your house ive seen that you were well fed but ive been thinking lately how little that is for a womanfor a human being  asher surprised why augusta i cant remember the time when you havent been busy youve taken an active part in church work and looked out for the people of the village  augusta yes and what has it all amounted to the poor are ungrateful they wont go near the church and today theyre buying pianos soon there wont be any poor to help  asher thats so well be the paupers if this sort of thing keeps on  augusta ive tried to do my duty as a christian woman but the world has no use apparently for christians in these times and whenever you have any really serious trouble i seem to be the last person you take into your confidence  asher i dont worry you with business matters  augusta because you do not regard me as your intellectual equal  asher a woman has her sphere you have always filled it admirably  augusta adorn is the word i believe  asher to hear you talk one would think youd been contaminated by jonathan you of all people  augusta there seems to be no place for a woman like me in these daysi dont recognize the world im living in  asher you didnt sleep a wink last night thinking of george  augusta ive given up all hope of ever seeing him again alive     enter dr jonathan lower right his calmness is in contrast to    the storm and to the mental states of asher and augusta  why jonathan what are you doing out in this storm  dr jonathan i came to see you augusta  augusta knitting trying to hide her perturbation at his appearance did you you might have waited until the worst was over you still have to be careful of your health you know  dr jonathan sitting down there are other things more important than my health no later news about george i suppose  asher yes i got another telegram early this morning saying that he is on his way home on a transport  dr jonathan on his way home  asher if he lives to arrive ill show you the wire apparently they cant make anything out of his condition but think its shell shock this storm has been raging along the coast ever since nine oclock the wires are down but i did manage to telephone to new york and get hold of frye the shellshock specialist in case george should land today hell meet him  dr jonathan frye is a good man  asher george is hit by a shell and almost killed nearly a month ago and not a word do i hear of it until i get that message in your house yesterday then comes this other telegram this morning whats to be said about a government capable of such inefficiency of course the chances of his landing today are small but i cant leave for new york until tonight because that same government sends a labour investigator here to pry into my affairs and make a preliminary report theyre going to decide whether or not i shall keep my property or hand it over to them and whom do they send not a business man whos had practical experience with labour but a professor out of some universitya theorist  dr jonathan awkward people these professors but what would you do about it asher wall up the universities  asher their trustees who are business men should forbid professors meddling in government and politics this fellow had the impudence to tell me to my face that my own workmen whom i am paying arent working for me im only supposed to be supplying the capital we talk about germany being an autocracy its nothing to what this country has become  dr jonathan smiling an autocracy of professors instead of business men well every dog has his day and george is coming home  asher and what is there left to hand over to him if he lives what future has the pindar shopswhich i have spent my life to build up  dr jonathan if george lives as we hope you need not worry about the future of the pindar shops i think  augusta if god will only spare him  asher i guess ive about got to the point where i dont believe that a god exists     a flash and a loud peal of thunder  augusta asher  asher then let him strike me     he hurries abruptly out of the door left  augusta after a silence during all the years of our married life he has never said such a thing as that asher an atheist  dr jonathan so was job augustafor a while  augusta avoiding dr jonathans glance and beginning to knit you wanted to speak to me jonathan     the maid enters lower right  maid timothy farrell maam     exit maid enter timothy farrell  augusta im afraid mr pindar cant see you just now timothy  timothy its you ive come to see maam if youll bear with mewho once took an interest in minnie  augusta it is true that i once took an interest in her timothy but im afraid i have lost it i dislike to say this to you her father but its so  timothy dont be hard on her mrs pindar she may have been wildlike in newcastle but since she was back here to work for the doctor shes been a good girl and that happy i wouldnt know her and a comfort to me in me old agewhat with bert gone and jamesy taken to drink and now shes run away and left me alone entirely with the shops closed and no work to do  augusta knitting shes left foxon falls  timothy breaking down for a moment when i woke up this morning i found a letter beside me bedim not to worry she says and i know how fond of me she wasbe the care she took of me shes been keeping company with no young manthat i know if she wasnt working with the doctor on that discovery shed be home with me  augusta im sorry for you timothy but i dont see what i can do  timothy i minded that you were talking to her yesterday in the labratry before the telegram came about mr george  augusta well  timothy it was just a hope maam catching at a strawlike  augusta tightening her lips i repeat that im sorry for you timothy i have no idea where she has gone  timothy looking at her fixedly she pauses in her knitting and returns his look very well maamtheres no need of my bothering you youve heard nothing more of mr george  augusta with sudden tears theyre sending him home  timothy and now that yere getting him back maam ye might think with a little more charity of her that belongs to methe only one id have left     timothy goes out lower right augusta is blinded by tears she    lets fall her ball of wool dr jonathan picks it up  augusta i try to be fair in my judgments and true to my convictions but what minnie has done cannot be condoned  dr jonathan sitting down beside augusta and what has minnie done augusta  augusta you ask me that i try hard to give you credit jonathan for not knowing the ways of the worldbut its always been difficult to believe that minnie farrell had become wella bad woman  dr jonathan a bad woman i gather then that you dont believe in the christian doctrines of repentance and regeneration  augusta bridling the leopard doesnt change his spots and has she shown any sign of repentance has she come to me and asked my pardon for the way in which she treated me has she gone to church and asked gods forgiveness but i know you are an agnostic jonathanit grieves me i couldnt expect you to see the necessity of that  dr jonathan if it hadnt been for minnie i shouldnt have been able to achieve a discovery that may prove of value to our suffering soldiers as well as to injured operatives in factories in spite of the news of her brothers death minnie worked all afternoon and evening it was midnight when we made the successful test after eight months of experiment  augusta i hope the discovery may be valuable it seems to me that there is too much science in these days and too little religion ive never denied that the girl is clever  dr jonathan but you would deny her the opportunity to make something of her cleverness because in your opinion she has broken the seventh commandment is that it  augusta i cant listen to you when you talk in this way  dr jonathan but you listen every sunday to mosesif it was moseswhen he talks in this way you have made up your mind havent you that minnie has broken the commandment  augusta im not a fool jonathan  dr jonathan you are what is called a good woman have you proof that minnie is what you would call a bad one  augusta has she ever denied it and you heard her when she stood up in this room and spoke of her life in newcastle  dr jonathan but no court of law would convict her on that  augusta and she had an affair with george oh i cant talk about it  dr jonathan im afraid that george will wish to talk about it when he comes back  augusta shes been corresponding with georgescheming behind my back  dr jonathan are you sure of that  augusta she confessed to me that she had had letters from him  dr jonathan and that shed written letters in return  augusta what right have you to catechize me jonathan  dr jonathan the same right augusta that you have to catechize minnie only i wish to discover the truth and apparently you do not she left me a letter too in which she said dont try to find mei wouldnt come back if you did mrs pindar was right about me after alli had to break loose again now augusta id like to know what you make of that  augusta its pretty plain isnt it  dr jonathan if the girl were really bad as you insist would she say a thing like that  augusta im afraid im not an authority on minnies kind  dr jonathan well i am the only motive which could have induced her to leave my laboratory and foxon fallsher fatheris what you would call a christian motive  augusta what do you mean  dr jonathan an unselfish motive she went because she thought she could help someone by going  augusta whydo you discuss this with me  dr jonathan because ive come to the conclusion that you know something about minnies departure augusta  augusta again on the verge of tears well then i do i am responsible for her goingim not ashamed of it her remaining here was an affront to all right thinking people i appealed to her and she had the decency to leave  dr jonathan decency is a mild word to apply to her sacrifice  augusta i suppose with your extraordinary radical views you mean that she might have remained here and married george one never can predict the harm that a woman of that kind can do  dr jonathan rising the harm that a bad woman can do augusta is sometimes exceeded only by the harm a good woman can do you are unfortunately steeped in a religion which lacks the faith in humanity that should be its foundation the girl has just given you the strongest proof of an inherent goodness and you choose to call her bad but if you will not listen to moses and the prophets how will you listen to christ  augusta jonathan where are you going  dr jonathan to find minnie farrell and bring her back to foxon falls     he goes out lower right augusta sits for a while motionless    and then makes an attempt to go on with her knitting a mans face    is seen pressed against the glass of the middle window augusta    does not perceive him he disappears the glass door upper right    opens slowly and prag enters his clothes are wet he is unshaven    he is gaunt and ill and his eyed gleans he leaves the door open    behind him once inside the room he halts and stares at augusta    who gathers up her knitting and rises she does not lack courage  augusta what do you want  prag i come to see mr pindar  augusta the proper place to see mr pindar is in his office what do you mean by forcing your way into this house  prag advancing i have no right hereit is too fine for me yes     through the window the figure of a woman is seen running across the    lawn and a moment later minnie farrell comes in through the open    doorway upper right she is breathless and somewhat wet  augusta minnie  prag turning and confronting minnie so you come back to foxon falls too  minnie you guessed it  prag you follow me  minnie but youre some sprinter she seizes him by the arm come on pragyou havent got any business here and you know it  prag stubbornly i come to see mr pindar i vill see him  augusta he isnt home  prag then i vait for him  minnie glancing toward the study door where she suspects asher is no you dont either you come along with me     she pulls him and he resists they begin to struggle augusta    cries out and runs to minnies assistance  keep away mrs pindar if mr pindars home find him and tell him not to come in here this mans crazy  prag struggling with minnie crazy is it what is it to youwhat i do with mr pindar he is also your enemythe enemy of all workpeoples     augusta after a seconds indecision turns and runs toward the    door left that leads into ashers study minnie tries to push    prag toward the doorway upper right but she is no match for the    nervous strength he is able to summon up in his fanatical frenzy    just as augusta reaches the study door it is flung open and asher    appears  asher whats the matter     then he sees minnie and prag struggling and strides toward them    augusta tries to prevent him reaching them prag wrenches himself    free from minnie and draws a pistol front his pocket minnie flings    herself between him and asher who momentarily halts too astonished    to act  prag to minnie get avay he kill my wife he drive me out of my homehe will not have the unions i shoot him get oudt  asher stand aside minnie ill take care of him     augusta cries out asher advances seizes minnie by the shoulder    and thrusts her aside prag has the pistol levelled at him  prag recognize the unions or i shoot  asher lower that pistol do you think you can intimidate me  prag they can hang mei die for freedoms     he is apparently about to pull the trigger but he does not his    eyes are drawn away from asher toward the doorway lower right    where dr jonathan is seen standing gazing at him gradually his    arm drops to his side and dr jonathan goes up to him and takes the    pistol from his hand prag breaks down sobbing violently  it is no good i cantnow  dr jonathan his hand on prags shoulder come with me prag to my house     he leads prag shaken by sobs out of the doorway upper right    and they are seen through the windows crossing the lawn and    disappearing  augusta oh asher     she goes up to him and puts her hand on his arm and then turns to    minnie  you saved him  minnie dr jonathan saved him hed save everybody if theyd let him ever since he took care of prags wife when she died hes got him hypnotized  asher youve done a brave thing minnie i shant forget it  minnie i want you to forget it i wouldnt like to see anybody hurt  augusta buthow did you happen to be herein foxon falls  minnie oh i didnt mean to come back im going away again  augusta i have no right to ask you to go away now  asher whats this did you ask minnie to leave foxon falls  augusta asher id like to talk with minnie if you dont mind  asher glancing at the two women well i shant forget what youve done minnie     he goes out lower right  minnie who is on the verge of losing her selfcontrol i didnt come back to foxon falls to talk to you again mrs pindar im sorry but ive got to go  augusta where  minnie you didnt care yesterdaywhy should you care today  augusta with an effort i ought to tell you that dr pindar has declined mr pindars offer  minnie he isnt going to take charge of the hospital  augusta no  minnie but if hes so poor hows he going to live he cant afford to hire me to help him  augusta i dont know dr pindar was about to leave in search of you  minnie i was afraid of thatwhen he ought to be going to new york to test the discovery at the hospitals there he meant to  augusta you must see him  minnie oh ill see him now that was what hurt me most lying to him about why i was leavingletting him think i was sick of working with him  augusta minnie im willing to say that i was mistaken about you you may have been unwise but you never did anything wrong isnt it so  minnie why do you think that now what changed you just because i might have helped to keep mr pindar from being shot by a crazy manthat didnt change you did it  augusta i was mistaken  minnie if you thought i was bad yesterday im bad today  augusta a bad woman couldnt have done what you did just now  minnie dont you believe it mrs pindar i knew a woman in newcastlebut theres no use going into that i guess theres worse kinds of badness than what you call bad  augusta ii cant discuss it but i want to be just im convinced that i did you a wrongand im sorry wont you believe me  minnie but youll never forgive meeven if i hadnt done what you thoughton account of what happened with george  augusta iill try  minnie no dont tryforgiveness doesnt come that way mrs pindar with sudden acuteness it was on account of george not dr jonathan that you wanted to get me out of foxon falls  augusta i repeati shouldnt have asked you to go isnt that enough  minnie i told you not to worry about me and george i ran away from him oncei guess i wont have to do it again  augusta youyou ran away from him  minnie from the church too and from the bible class and from you and from the shops but im free now there isnt any danger of my going wrongi know what i can do ive learned my jobdr jonathans taught me you neednt have me on your conscience either ill go across and see if i can help dr jonathan take care of that poor wreck prag lifes been too tough for him  augusta starting forward to detain her wait a moment minnietell me how you happened to come back to be here soprovidentially  minnie there wasnt anything providential about it i took the six oclock train to newcastle this morning not that i had any notion of staying there i ran into prag at the station i nursed his wife you knowand he started in to tell me how he was coming up to foxon falls to shoot mr pindar because hed closed down the works rather than recognize the union i knew that prag was just about crazy enough to do it because ive heard dr jonathan talk about the mental disease hes got that was about ten and the train for foxon falls was leaving in a few minutes i ran into the booth to phone dr jonathan but the storm had begun down there and i couldnt get a connection so i caught the train and when it pulled in here i saw pray jump out of the smoking car and start to run i couldnt run as fast as he could and id only got to the other side of the common when i saw him walk into the house  augusta after a pause minnie youll stay here now your father needs youii should never forgive myself if you left  minnie tell me mrs pindarhave you heard anything more from george  augusta hesitating yesmr pindar got a telegram this morning  minnie hes coming home when will he get here  augusta idont know oh im afraid he may never get herealive  minnie dont say that george will livehes got to live  augusta gazing at her what makes you think so  minnie because hes needed so in the worldin foxon falls     she starts for the doorway upper right  augusta youre not going  minnie i couldnt stay herenow  augusta whywhy not  minnie in tears i should think youd know why not  augusta you meanyou careyou care that much  minnie im going     she turns to leave the room when the sound of an automobile is    heard without the brakes going on etc minnie who has got as far    as the doorway upper right halts and stares  augusta excitedly what is it  minnie an automobile oh mrs pindarits himits george     she draws back from the doorway her hands clasped  augusta george she hurries toward the doorway speaking as she goes where is he  why doesnt he come in  minnie staring out he cant oh ill get dr jonathan     she is speaking as augusta goes out     mingling with other voices ashers resonant and commanding voice    is heard  asher without bring him in through the libraryits easier for you george     minnie who obviously cannot now escape through the doorway upper    right without george seeing her after a seconds resolution dashes    across the room and out of the door lower right a moment later    george is brought in through the doorway upper right leaning    heavily on dr frye a capable looking man whose well fitting    business suit and general appearance indicate a prosperous city    practice george is in uniform he is much thinner and his face    betrays acute suffering his left arm hangs helpless at his side     asher and augusta follow asher with a look of pain which has been    increased by an incident which occurred at the automobile where    george refused to allow asher to help support him     george gets a little way into the room when he stops sways a    little and spasmodically puts his hand to his heart asher in a    frenzy of anxiety again approaches to help him but george repulses    him  george protesting with what strength he has as if in fear nno dad id rather notii can get along     asher halts and gazes at him mutely and then looks at augusta  dr frye youd better sit down here a minute and rest captain pindar     asher starts to pull up an armchair but augusta looks at him and    shakes her head and pulls it up herself george sinks into the    chair leans back his head and closes his eyes augusta hovers over    him smoothing his hair  augusta is there nothing we can do dr frye a little brandy  dr frye who is evidently trying to hide his own concern by a show of professional selfconfidence i think id wait a few moments  george murmuring iill be all right mother     dr frye stands gazing down at him a few seconds and then comes    forward into the room to join asher  asher for gods sake tell me what it is doctor why did you leave new york with him when he was in this condition was it because  dr frye speaking more rapidly than is his wont he was surprisingly well considering everything when we left new york and the army medical men advised taking him home i thought an automobile better than a slow train i tried to telephone you but the storm  asher i know  dr frye i sent you a wire  asher i didnt get it  dr frye it was impossible to get a good nurse on account of the influenza epidemic in fact i didnt think he needed onebut i thought youd feel more comfortable if i came he seemed extraordinary well even cheerful until we got right into foxon falls we were passing your shops and a big crowd of men were there making a noise shouting at a speaker is there a strike on here  asher yes you say he got like this when he saw the crowd  dr frye indicating george as you see he fell back on the cushions as though hed been hitit all happened in a second i have the history of the case from the army peoplehe had an attack something like this abroad  asher did you notice how he avoided me  dr frye with reluctance that may not be anything its his heart at presentand yet im convinced that this is a case for a psychologist as well as for a medical man i confess im puzzled and as soon as we can get a connection with new york i want to summon barnwell  asher ill see if i can get a wire through  dr frye telephone plaza 4632     asher hurries out lower right dr frye returns to george to take    his pulse when dr jonathan enters upper right he crosses the    room directly to george and stands looking down at him  augusta who is a little behind georges chair gives dr jonathan an agonized glance which she transfers to dr frye when he drops georges wrist george george dear     dr frye is silent then asher reenters  asher in a low tone to dr frye they think they can get new york within half an hour     dr frye nods his attention is now fixed upon dr jonathan whose    gaze is still focussed on george asher and augusta now begin to    look at dr jonathan gradually as though by the compulsion of dr    jonathans regard george slowly opens his eyes  george stammering dr jonathan  dr jonathan im here george  george is thereis there a strike in the shops     dr jonathan glances at asher  asher hesitating speaking with difficulty dont worry about that now george  george whywhy are they striking  asher ill tell you all about it laterwhen you feel better  george feebly yet insistent ii want to know  asher we cant talk about it now my boylater  george diddid you get my letterthe letter in which i begged you  asher yes yesill explain it all tomorrow  george ii may not be heretomorrow you didnt do whati asked itsso simplewhen youve thought about itwhen youve fought for it  asher ii had a plan george well go over it     he approaches george  george shrinking nono     asher recoils minnie farrell appears upper right from the    direction of the common she carries a phial a dropper and some    water in a glass seeing the group gathered about george she    hesitates but dr jonathan motions her to come forward  wwho is that minnie     george makes an attempt to sit up but his head falls back and his    eyes close again then dr jonathan lays his hand on dr fryes    arm as though to draw him aside  dr frye is this dr jonathan pindar i wondered if you were a relationhe glances at asherbut i wasnt looking for you in foxon falls if you have something to suggest  dr jonathan  taking the phial and the dropper from minnie with your permission in any case it can do no harm  dr frye by all means if i had realized you were here     asher looks on in astonishment dr jonathan measures out a few    drops of the liquid from the phial into the glass of water which    minnie holds  dr jonathan george will you take this     he holds the glass while george drinks to dr frye  theres a lounge in mr pindars study  to augusta get a blanket     augusta goes toward the door lower right while minnie starts to    retire  well need you minnie     he hands minnie the glass dropper and phial the two physicians    pick george up and carry him out left followed by minnie asher    goes a little way and then halts with a despairing gesture augusta    having gone for the blanket asher is left alone pacing until she    returns  augusta going through the room from right to left with the blanket ah asher     asher begins pacing again when dr frye reenters from the left  asher is thereis there any hope  dr frye his hand on ashers sleeve i can tell you more when i have had a chance to talk with dr pindar this seems to be one of his casesbut i confess when i mentioned barnwell i didnt think of him the situation came so suddenly and in spite of his name being yours i didnt expect to find him here  asher then you know of jonathan  dr frye i didnt know of him until i read the book which he published about a year ago when i was in baltimore in march i asked for him at johns hopkinss and they told me that he had gone to new england for his health extraordinary to meet him hereand today  asher what book hes never spoken to me of any book  dr frye on the physical effects of mental crises there has been a good deal of controversy about it in the profession but im one of those who believe that the physician must seek to cure not only the body but the soul we make a guessthough hes published no religionthe true scientist is the minister of the future  asher i never realized that jonathan  dr frye smiling a little no prophet is without honour save in his own country  asher what has he given george  dr frye i cant tell you exactly but i can make a guessthough hes published no account of his recent experiments     as dr jonathan reenters from the left  he will undoubtedly tell you himself exit dr frye left  asher will he live  dr jonathan ill be frank with you asheri dont know all we can do is to wait  asher i call god to witness theres nothing i wouldnt do no sacrifice i wouldnt make if that boy could be saved  dr jonathan remember that asher  asher remember what  dr jonathan if his life is saved you will be called upon to make a sacrifice to do your part  asher my part  dr jonathan yes what i have given himthe medicineis only half the battleshould it succeed my laboratory experiments were only completed last night  asher this is what you have been working on  dr jonathan it happens to be but i have had no chance to test itexcept on animals i meant to have gone to a war hospital in new york today if it works then we shall have to try the rest of the experimentyour half of it  asher whats that  dr jonathan you probably noticed that george avoided you  asher its more than i can bear you know what weve been to each other if he should diefeeling that way  dr jonathan george hasnt lost his affection for you if it were so we shouldnt have that symptom i will tell you briefly my theory of the case but first let me say in justice to frye that he was in no position to know certain facts that give the clue to georges condition the mental history  asher i dont understand  dr jonathan the day he left home for france certain things happened to him to arouse his sympathy with what we call working people their lives and aspirations as you know george has a very human sidehe loves his fellow men hed never thought of these things before he went with them naturally to you and i infer that you suppressed him  asher i told him i couldnt discuss certain aspects his emotional state troubled mehe was going away and i imagined he would get over it  dr jonathan he didnt get over it it was an emotional crisis he left home with a conflict in his minda conflict between his affection for you and that which he had suddenly come to see was right i mean right for today for the year and hour in which we are living this question of the emancipation of labour began a hundred years ago with the introduction of machinery and the rise of modern industry and in this war it has come to a head well as the time approached for george to risk his life for his new beliefs his mental conflict deepened he talked with other young men who believed they were fighting for the same cause and thenit must have been shortly before he was woundedhe wrote you that appeal  asher the letter i read to you  dr jonathan the fact that in his own home in the shops which bore his name no attempt had been made to meet the new issues for which he was going into battle weighed upon him then came the shell that shattered his body but the probabilities are that he was struck down unconscious at the very moment when the conflict in his mind was most acute he was thinking of you of the difference you and he had had he was lonely he was afraid for the bravest men feel fear to him the bursting of the shell was the bursting of the conflict within him i wont go into the professional side of the matter the influence of the mental state on the physicalbut after the wound healed whenever anything occurred to remind him of the conflicta letter from you the sight of the strikers this afternoon at the shops meeting you once more a repetition came of what happened when the shell struck him certain glands fail in their functions the heart threatens to stop and put an end to life if my theory is correct what i have given him may tide over that danger but only on one condition can he continue to live and become a useful member of society  asher what condition  dr jonathan that the mental conflict the real cause of the trouble he resolved the time has come asher when you must make your choice between your convictions and your son  asher speak out  dr jonathan i mean that you must be prepared to tell george if he recovers that you have abandoned your attitude toward the workmen that you are willing to recognize their union settle the strike and go even further than in their ignorance they ask you must try the experiment in the democratization of industry on which georges heart is set otherwise i will not answer for his sanity i cannot even give you the hope that he will live  asher i never heard of a mental conflict producing such a state  dr jonathan remember you have said that you will make any sacrifice to save georges life  asher turning on dr jonathan youre not trying to play on mymy superstitionat a time like this  dr jonathan im not dealing with superstition asher but with science if george revives he will wish to talk with you  asher when  dr jonathan probably this eveningor never i ask you the questionwill you yield your convictions     asher bows his head dr jonathan gazes at him for a moment    compassionately  ill go back to him now i think hed better be moved to his room and put to bed     exit dr jonathan left for a minute asher remains alone and    then dr jonathan and dr frye reappear carrying george the    blanket is flung over his knees and he seems lifeless they are    followed by minnie carrying the phial and the glass and by    augusta they cross the room and go out lower right asher walks    behind them as far as the door hesitates and then goes out      the curtain falls and remains down a minute to indicate a lapse of    three hours when it rises again night has come the lamps are    lighted and the window curtains drawn asher and augusta are    discovered standing together asher has a black leather covered    book in his hand with one finger in the place where he has been    reading both show the effects of a strain  augusta who has been speaking and when we took him upstairs i was sure he was going to dieit seemed to me as if nothing could save him hes been sitting up and talking to usof course hes pale and weak and wasted but in spite of that asher he seems to have a strength a force that he didnt have before he went away he isnt a boy any more i cant describe it but im almost afraid of him  asher hehe hasnt mentioned me  augusta no my dearand since jonathan warned me not to ive said nothing about you why is it  asher jonathans the master now  augusta in spite of what ive felt about him he has saved george for us it seems a miracle  asher a scientific miracle  augusta indicating the book asher holds and yet you were reading the bible  asher i just took it down he lays it on the table and touches augusta with an unwonted tenderness on the shoulder i think we may hope now augusta but before we can be sure that hell get well theres something else to be done  augusta anxiously what  asher go back to georgeill tell you later it seems that we must trust jonathan here he is now     enter dr jonathan lower right as augusta departs  dr jonathan george wants to get dressed and come down  asher you think it wise  dr jonathan under the circumstances yes the heart is practically normal again we have done all that is physically possible one half of the experiment seems to have succeeded and the sooner we try the other half the better are you still willing  asher im prepared ive carried out yourinstructionssent for the committee  dr jonathan looking at him good  asher with an effort jonathan ii guess i misjudged you  dr jonathan smiling wait until you are sure nothing matters if we can save that boy by the way he asked for timothy and ive sent for him  asher he asked for timothy and not for me  dr jonathan it seems he saw an officer of berts regiment after the boy was killed heres the committee i think     the maid enters lower right she does not speak but ushers in    hillman rench and fersen and retires  hillman  rench good evening mr pindar good evening doctor fersen   asher good evening     an awkward silence from habit asher stares at them defiantly as    dr jonathan goes out lower right  hillman going up to asher hows your son mr pindar  rench were real anxious about the captain  fersen nodding the boys think a whole lot of him mr pindar  asher hes better thank you the medicine dr pindar has given him  rench didnt i say so when i heard how he was when he got back i said to fred hillman hereif anybody can cure him its dr jonathan right here in foxon falls     a pause  im sorry this here difference came up just now mr pindar when the captain come home we was a little mite harshbut we was strung up i guess from the long shifts if wed known your son was comin  asher you wouldnt have struck  rench wed have agreed to put it off when a young man like that is near dying for his country whyanything can wait but what were asking is only right  asher well right or not right i sent for you to say so far as im concerned the strikes over  rench youllyoull recognize the union  asher i grant he catches himselfi consent to your demands     after a moment of stupefaction their faces light up and they    approach him  rench we appreciate it mr pindar thisll make a lot of families happy tonight  fersen it will that  hillman maybe you wont believe me mr pindar but it was hard to see the shops closed downas hard on us as it was on you we take pride in them too i guess you wont regret it  asher waving them away i hope not i ought to tell you that you may thank my son for thismy son and dr pindar  rench we appreciate itjust the same     asher makes a gesture as thought to dismiss the subject as well as    the committee they hesitate and are about to leave when george    followed by dr jonathan comes in lower right his entrance is    quite dramatic he walks with the help of a stick slowly but his    bearing is soldierly authoritative impressive he halts when he    perceives the committee  hillman going up to george how are you captain  fersen good to have you home once more  rench going up to george good to see you captain on a day like this as larz fersen said when we were going to strike its a fine day for it well this is a better dayyou home and well and the strike off  george glancing from one to the other and then at asher what do you mean  rench why mr pindaryour father heres just made everybody happy hes recognized the union and were going back to work well turn out machines to make shrapnel enough to kill every hun in franceget square with em for what they done to you     they all watch george absorbed in the effect this announcement has    on him an expression of happiness grows in his eyes after a    moment he goes up to asher  george dad why did you do this  asher ill tell you george when you came home this afternoon i realized something i hadnt realized before i saw that the tide was against me that i was like that old english king who set his throne on the sands and thought he could stay the waters ifif anything had happened to you i couldnt have fought on but now that youre here with me again now that youve risked your life and almost lost it for thisthis new order in which you believe why its enough for mei can surrender with honour im tired i need a rest id have gone down fighting but i guess youve saved me ive been true to my convictionsyou who belong to the new generation must be true to yours and as i told you once all i care about this business is to hand it over to you  george youll help me  asher this seems to be jonathans specialityscience but i never give my word half heartedly my boy and ill back you to my last dollar be prepared for disappointmentsbut if you accomplish something ill be glad and if you fail georgeany failure for a mans convictions is a grand failure  george well it means life to me dad i owe it to you  asher turning toward dr jonathan no you owe it to himto science     he puts one hand on georges shoulder and the other with an    abrupt movement on dr jonathans  and if science will do as much for democracy then  george then youre from missouri good old dad  asher huskily trying to carry it off and almost overcome by emotion at the reconciliation im from missouri my boy  dr jonathan then youre a true scientist asher for science too waits to be shown     asher goes out lower right dr jonathan evidently in support    and sympathy goes with him george and the committee look after    them and then george sits down and smiles at the men  george and weve got to be scientists too are you fellows willing to take your share in the experiment  hillman what experiments that captain  george now that youve got your union whats the good of it  rench after a pause why i thought wed made that pretty clear captain weve got something to fall back on in case the employers dont live up to their agreements im not speaking of you  george in other words youve got a weapon  rench well you might call it that  george but weapons imply warfaredont they  rench we wouldnt fight with you  george yes you wouldif our interests conflicted when i was in the trenches i kept thinking of the quotation lincoln used a house divided against itself cannot stand were going to try to perpetuate that house just as he did  hillman lincoln had common sense  george another name for intelligence and what weve got to decide is whether the old house will dofor democracyindustrial democracy can we shore up the timbersor shall we have to begin to build a new house  rench glancing at hillman the old one sure enough looks rotten to me ive said that all along  george it seems to have served its day has your union got the plans of a new house readyconsulted an architect  rench im afraid we dont get you captain  george you belong to the american federation of labour dont you has it got a new house ready to move into  rench well i havent seen any plans  george if the old structures too small one party or the other will have to be shoved out the capitalist or the employee which will it be  rench laughing if it comes to that  george smiling theres no question in your mind but you hadnt thought about ityour federation hasnt thought about it or doesnt want to think about it and your employers dont want to either  hillman stroking his moustache thats so  george ill tell you who have thought about itthe bolshevists and the i w w and because they have a programmesome programme any programme theyre more intelligent than we for the time  rench those guys  george exactlythose guys at least they see that the house isnt fit to live in they want to pull it down and go back to living in trees and caves  hillman thats about right  george but youre conservatives you labour union peoplethe aristocrats of labour which means that you dont think what you really object to when you come down to it is that men like my father and me and the bankerswere all in the same boat most of us own banks toocontrol the conditions of life for you and men like you  rench i never heard it put in those words but by gum its so  george and your confederation your unions are for the skilled workers whose conditions arent so badand theyre getting better every time you jack up the wages you complain that we employers arent thinking of you but are you thinking of the millions of the unskilled who live from hand to mouth the old structures good enough for you too but what will the miserable men who dont sit in be doing while were squabbling to see wholl have the best rooms  rench blow the house up i guess  george if theyre rough with it itll tumble down like a pack of cardssimply because were asses cant we build a house big enough for allfor a hundred million people and their descendants a house in which after a while there will be no capitalists and no exploiters and no wreckers only workerseach man and woman on the job they were fitted for its a mansized job but isnt it worth tackling  rench enthused its sure worth tackling captain  george and cant we begin it in a modest way by making a little model of the big house right here in foxon falls dr jonathan will help us  rench go to it captain well trust him and you  george trust is all right but youve got to go to it too and use your headpieces weve got to sit down together and educate ourselves who are now employers and employees get hold of all the facts the statisticsand all the elements the human nature side of it from the theorists the students whom weve despised  rench well its a fact i hadnt thought much of them intellectuals  george theyre part of the gametheir theories are the basis for an intelligent practice and what should we be able to do without their figures look at what weve worked out in large scale production and distribution in this war thats a new world problem shall we be pioneers here in foxon falls in the new experiment  rench an experiment in human chemicals as the doctor would say pioneers i kind of like that word you can put me in the wagon captain  george it will be a conestoga with the curtains rolled up so that everybody can see in no secrets and it will be a wagon with an industrial constitution  fersen excuse me captainbut whats that     rench laughs  george smiling hasnt it struck you fersen that unless a man has a voice and an interest in the industry in which he works his voice and interest in the government for which he votes is a mockery     fersen nods  rench well have to give larz a little education  george oh i guess hell make a good industrial citizen but thats part of the bargain  rench thats fair human nature aint so rotten when you give it a chance  george well then are you willing to try it out on the level  rench i callate well stick captain  hillman we sure will  fersen well be pioneers  george thats good american fersen not to be afraid of an ideal shake well sit down with it in a day or two     they all shake the members of the committee file out of the room    lower right george is left alone for a brief interval when    minnie in the white costume of a nurse enters lower right    with a glass of medicine in her hand  minnie halting youre all alone wheres dr jonathan  george hes gone off with dad  minnie its nine oclock     she hands him the glass he drinks the contents and sets the glass    on the table then he takes her hands and draws her to him and    kisses her she submits almost passively  why are you doing this george  george because i love you because i need you because im going to marry you  minnie shaking her head slowly no youre not  george why not  minnie you know why not as well as i do     she gazes up at him he is still holding her in his arms    suddenly she kisses him passionately breaks away from him and    starts to fly from the room when she runs into dr jonathan who is    entering lower right  dr jonathan where are you going minnie     minnie halts and is silent dr jonathan lays a detaining hand on    her arm and looks from one to the other comprehendingly  george ive asked her to marry me dr jonathan  dr jonathan and what are your objections minnie  minnie you know why i cant dr jonathan what kind of a wife would i make for him with his family and friends id do anything for him but that he wouldnt be happy  dr jonathan and whats your answer george  george i dont want her for my family and friendsi want

have i we start level there ive lived among people of culture and ive found out that culture chiefly consists of fixed ideas and obstruction to progress of hating the presidentof knowing the right people and eating fish with a fork  minnie smiling though in tears well i never ate fish with a knife anyway  george i spent my valuable youth learning greek and latin and i cant speak or read either of them i know that horace wrote odes and cicero made orations but i cant quote them all i remember about biology is that the fittest are supposed to survive and in this war ive seen the fittest killed off like flies youve had several years of useful work in the pindar shops and the wire works to say nothing of a course in biological chemistry psychology and sociology under dr jonathan ill leave it to him whether you dont know more about life than i doabout the life and problems of the great mass of people in this country and now that the strikes over  minnie the strikes over  george yes ive chosen my life it isnt going to be divided between a wall street office and newport and palm beach a girl out of a finishing school wouldnt be of any use to me im going to stay right here in foxon falls minnie ive got a real job on my hands and i need a real woman with special knowledge to help me i dont mean to say we wont have vacations and well sit down and get our education together dr jonathan will be the schoolmaster  minnie its a dream george  george well minnie if its a dream worth dying for its a dream worth living for your brother bert died for it                    curtain
