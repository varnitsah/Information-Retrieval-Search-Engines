499091	the voyage out 1915   by virginia woolf 18821941    chapter i   as the streets that lead from the strand to the embankment are very narrow it is better not to walk down them arminarm if you persist lawyers clerks will have to make flying leaps into the mud young lady typists will have to fidget behind you in the streets of london where beauty goes unregarded eccentricity must pay the penalty and it is better not to be very tall to wear a long blue cloak or to beat the air with your left hand  one afternoon in the beginning of october when the traffic was becoming brisk a tall man strode along the edge of the pavement with a lady on his arm angry glances struck upon their backs the small agitated figuresfor in comparison with this couple most people looked smalldecorated with fountain pens and burdened with despatchboxes had appointments to keep and drew a weekly salary so that there was some reason for the unfriendly stare which was bestowed upon mr ambroses height and upon mrs ambroses cloak but some enchantment had put both man and woman beyond the reach of malice and unpopularity in his guess one might guess from the moving lips that it was thought and in hers from the eyes fixed stonily straight in front of her at a level above the eyes of most that it was sorrow it was only by scorning all she met that she kept herself from tears and the friction of people brushing past her was evidently painful after watching the traffic on the embankment for a minute or two with a stoical gaze she twitched her husbands sleeve and they crossed between the swift discharge of motor cars when they were safe on the further side she gently withdrew her arm from his allowing her mouth at the same time to relax to tremble then tears rolled down and leaning her elbows on the balustrade she shielded her face from the curious mr ambrose attempted consolation he patted her shoulder but she showed no signs of admitting him and feeling it awkward to stand beside a grief that was greater than his he crossed his arms behind him and took a turn along the pavement  the embankment juts out in angles here and there like pulpits instead of preachers however small boys occupy them dangling string dropping pebbles or launching wads of paper for a cruise with their sharp eye for eccentricity they were inclined to think mr ambrose awful but the quickest witted cried bluebeard as he passed in case they should proceed to tease his wife mr ambrose flourished his stick at them upon which they decided that he was grotesque merely and four instead of one cried bluebeard in chorus  although mrs ambrose stood quite still much longer than is natural the little boys let her be some one is always looking into the river near waterloo bridge a couple will stand there talking for half an hour on a fine afternoon most people walking for pleasure contemplate for three minutes when having compared the occasion with other occasions or made some sentence they pass on sometimes the flats and churches and hotels of westminster are like the outlines of constantinople in a mist sometimes the river is an opulent purple sometimes mudcoloured sometimes sparkling blue like the sea it is always worth while to look down and see what is happening but this lady looked neither up nor down the only thing she had seen since she stood there was a circular iridescent patch slowly floating past with a straw in the middle of it the straw and the patch swam again and again behind the tremulous medium of a great welling tear and the tear rose and fell and dropped into the river then there struck close upon her ears       lars porsena of clusium      by the nine gods he swore  and then more faintly as if the speaker had passed her on his walk       that the great house of tarquin      should suffer wrong no more  yes she knew she must go back to all that but at present she must weep screening her face she sobbed more steadily than she had yet done her shoulders rising and falling with great regularity it was this figure that her husband saw when having reached the polished sphinx having entangled himself with a man selling picture postcards he turned the stanza instantly stopped he came up to her laid his hand on her shoulder and said dearest his voice was supplicating but she shut her face away from him as much as to say you cant possibly understand  as he did not leave her however she had to wipe her eyes and to raise them to the level of the factory chimneys on the other bank she saw also the arches of waterloo bridge and the carts moving across them like the line of animals in a shooting gallery they were seen blankly but to see anything was of course to end her weeping and begin to walk  i would rather walk she said her husband having hailed a cab already occupied by two city men  the fixity of her mood was broken by the action of walking the shooting motor cars more like spiders in the moon than terrestrial objects the thundering drays the jingling hansoms and little black broughams made her think of the world she lived in somewhere up there above the pinnacles where the smoke rose in a pointed hill her children were now asking for her and getting a soothing reply as for the mass of streets squares and public buildings which parted them she only felt at this moment how little london had done to make her love it although thirty of her forty years had been spent in a street she knew how to read the people who were passing her there were the rich who were running to and from each others houses at this hour there were the bigoted workers driving in a straight line to their offices there were the poor who were unhappy and rightly malignant already though there was sunlight in the haze tattered old men and women were nodding off to sleep upon the seats when one gave up seeing the beauty that clothed things this was the skeleton beneath  a fine rain now made her still more dismal vans with the odd names of those engaged in odd industriessprules manufacturer of sawdust grabb to whom no piece of waste paper comes amissfell flat as a bad joke bold lovers sheltered behind one cloak seemed to her sordid past their passion the flower women a contented company whose talk is always worth hearing were sodden hags the red yellow and blue flowers whose heads were pressed together would not blaze moreover her husband walking with a quick rhythmic stride jerking his free hand occasionally was either a viking or a stricken nelson the seagulls had changed his note  ridley shall we drive shall we drive ridley  mrs ambrose had to speak sharply by this time he was far away  the cab by trotting steadily along the same road soon withdrew them from the west end and plunged them into london it appeared that this was a great manufacturing place where the people were engaged in making things as though the west end with its electric lamps its vast plateglass windows all shining yellow its carefullyfinished houses and tiny live figures trotting on the pavement or bowled along on wheels in the road was the finished work it appeared to her a very small bit of work for such an enormous factory to have made for some reason it appeared to her as a small golden tassel on the edge of a vast black cloak  observing that they passed no other hansom cab but only vans and waggons and that not one of the thousand men and women she saw was either a gentleman or a lady mrs ambrose understood that after all it is the ordinary thing to be poor and that london is the city of innumerable poor people startled by this discovery and seeing herself pacing a circle all the days of her life round picadilly circus she was greatly relieved to pass a building put up by the london county council for night schools  lord how gloomy it is her husband groaned poor creatures  what with the misery for her children the poor and the rain her mind was like a wound exposed to dry in the air  at this point the cab stopped for it was in danger of being crushed like an eggshell the wide embankment which had had room for cannonballs and squadrons had now shrunk to a cobbled lane steaming with smells of malt and oil and blocked by waggons while her husband read the placards pasted on the brick announcing the hours at which certain ships would sail for scotland mrs ambrose did her best to find information from a world exclusively occupied in feeding waggons with sacks half obliterated too in a fine yellow fog they got neither help nor attention it seemed a miracle when an old man approached guessed their condition and proposed to row them out to their ship in the little boat which he kept moored at the bottom of a flight of steps with some hesitation they trusted themselves to him took their places and were soon waving up and down upon the water london having shrunk to two lines of buildings on either side of them square buildings and oblong buildings placed in rows like a childs avenue of bricks  the river which had a certain amount of troubled yellow light in it ran with great force bulky barges floated down swiftly escorted by tugs police boats shot past everything the wind went with the current the open rowingboat in which they sat bobbed and curtseyed across the line of traffic in midstream the old man stayed his hands upon the oars and as the water rushed past them remarked that once he had taken many passengers across where now he took scarcely any he seemed to recall an age when his boat moored among rushes carried delicate feet across to lawns at rotherhithe  they want bridges now he said indicating the monstrous outline of the tower bridge mournfully helen regarded him who was putting water between her and her children mournfully she gazed at the ship they were approaching anchored in the middle of the stream they could dimly read her nameeuphrosyne  very dimly in the falling dusk they could see the lines of the rigging the masts and the dark flag which the breeze blew out squarely behind  as the little boat sidled up to the steamer and the old man shipped his oars he remarked once more pointing above that ships all the world over flew that flag the day they sailed in the minds of both the passengers the blue flag appeared a sinister token and this the moment for presentiments but nevertheless they rose gathered their things together and climbed on deck  down in the saloon of her fathers ship miss rachel vinrace aged twentyfour stood waiting her uncle and aunt nervously to begin with though nearly related she scarcely remembered them to go on with they were elderly people and finally as her fathers daughter she must be in some sort prepared to entertain them she looked forward to seeing them as civilised people generally look forward to the first sight of civilised people as though they were of the nature of an approaching physical discomforta tight shoe or a draughty window she was already unnaturally braced to receive them as she occupied herself in laying forks severely straight by the side of knives she heard a mans voice saying gloomily  on a dark night one would fall down these stairs head foremost to which a womans voice added and be killed  as she spoke the last words the woman stood in the doorway tall largeeyed draped in purple shawls mrs ambrose was romantic and beautiful not perhaps sympathetic for her eyes looked straight and considered what they saw her face was much warmer than a greek face on the other hand it was much bolder than the face of the usual pretty englishwoman  oh rachel how dyou do she said shaking hands  how are you dear said mr ambrose inclining his forehead to be kissed his niece instinctively liked his thin angular body and the big head with its sweeping features and the acute innocent eyes  tell mr pepper rachel bade the servant husband and wife then sat down on one side of the table with their niece opposite to them  my father told me to begin she explained he is very busy with the men    you know mr pepper  a little man who was bent as some trees are by a gale on one side of them had slipped in nodding to mr ambrose he shook hands with helen  draughts he said erecting the collar of his coat  you are still rheumatic asked helen her voice was low and seductive though she spoke absently enough the sight of town and river being still present to her mind  once rheumatic always rheumatic i fear he replied to some extent it depends on the weather though not so much as people are apt to think  one does not die of it at any rate said helen  as a general ruleno said mr pepper  soup uncle ridley asked rachel  thank you dear he said and as he held his plate out sighed audibly ah shes not like her mother helen was just too late in thumping her tumbler on the table to prevent rachel from hearing and from blushing scarlet with embarrassment  the way servants treat flowers she said hastily she drew a green vase with a crinkled lip towards her and began pulling out the tight little chrysanthemums which she laid on the tablecloth arranging them fastidiously side by side  there was a pause  you knew jenkinson didnt you ambrose asked mr pepper across the table  jenkinson of peterhouse  hes dead said mr pepper  ah deari knew himages ago said ridley he was the hero of the punt accident you remember a queer card married a young woman out of a tobacconists and lived in the fensnever heard what became of him  drinkdrugs said mr pepper with sinister conciseness he left a commentary hopeless muddle im told  the man had really great abilities said ridley  his introduction to jellaby holds its own still went on mr pepper which is surprising seeing how textbooks change  there was a theory about the planets wasnt there asked ridley  a screw loose somewhere no doubt of it said mr pepper shaking his head  now a tremor ran through the table and a light outside swerved at the same time an electric bell rang sharply again and again  were off said ridley  a slight but perceptible wave seemed to roll beneath the floor then it sank then another came more perceptible lights slid right across the uncurtained window the ship gave a loud melancholy moan  were off said mr pepper other ships as sad as she answered her outside on the river the chuckling and hissing of water could be plainly heard and the ship heaved so that the steward bringing plates had to balance himself as he drew the curtain there was a pause  jenkinson of catsdyou still keep up with him asked ambrose  as much as one ever does said mr pepper we meet annually this year he has had the misfortune to lose his wife which made it painful of course  very painful ridley agreed  theres an unmarried daughter who keeps house for him i believe but its never the same not at his age  both gentlemen nodded sagely as they carved their apples  there was a book wasnt there ridley enquired  there was a book but there never will be a book said mr pepper with such fierceness that both ladies looked up at him  there never will be a book because some one else has written it for him said mr pepper with considerable acidity thats what comes of putting things off and collecting fossils and sticking norman arches on ones pigsties  i confess i sympathise said ridley with a melancholy sigh i have a weakness for people who cant begin     the accumulations of a lifetime wasted continued mr pepper he had accumulations enough to fill a barn  its a vice that some of us escape said ridley our friend miles has another work out today  mr pepper gave an acid little laugh according to my calculations he said he has produced two volumes and a half annually which allowing for time spent in the cradle and so forth shows a commendable industry  yes the old masters saying of him has been pretty well realised said ridley  a way they had said mr pepper you know the bruce collectionnot for publication of course  i should suppose not said ridley significantly for a divine he wasremarkably free  the pump in nevilles row for example enquired mr pepper  precisely said ambrose  each of the ladies being after the fashion of their sex highly trained in promoting mens talk without listening to it could thinkabout the education of children about the use of fog sirens in an operawithout betraying herself only it struck helen that rachel was perhaps too still for a hostess and that she might have done something with her hands  perhaps she said at length upon which they rose and left vaguely to the surprise of the gentlemen who had either thought them attentive or had forgotten their presence  ah one could tell strange stories of the old days they heard ridley say as he sank into his chair again glancing back at the doorway they saw mr pepper as though he had suddenly loosened his clothes and had become a vivacious and malicious old ape  winding veils round their heads the women walked on deck they were now moving steadily down the river passing the dark shapes of ships at anchor and london was a swarm of lights with a pale yellow canopy drooping above it there were the lights of the great theatres the lights of the long streets lights that indicated huge squares of domestic comfort lights that hung high in air no darkness would ever settle upon those lamps as no darkness had settled upon them for hundreds of years it seemed dreadful that the town should blaze for ever in the same spot dreadful at least to people going away to adventure upon the sea and beholding it as a circumscribed mound eternally burnt eternally scarred from the deck of the ship the great city appeared a crouched and cowardly figure a sedentary miser  leaning over the rail side by side helen said wont you be cold rachel replied no    how beautiful she added a moment later very little was visiblea few masts a shadow of land here a line of brilliant windows there they tried to make head against the wind  it blowsit blows gasped rachel the words rammed down her throat struggling by her side helen was suddenly overcome by the spirit of movement and pushed along with her skirts wrapping themselves round her knees and both arms to her hair but slowly the intoxication of movement died down and the wind became rough and chilly they looked through a chink in the blind and saw that long cigars were being smoked in the diningroom they saw mr ambrose throw himself violently against the back of his chair while mr pepper crinkled his cheeks as though they had been cut in wood the ghost of a roar of laughter came out to them and was drowned at once in the wind in the dry yellowlighted room mr pepper and mr ambrose were oblivious of all tumult they were in cambridge and it was probably about the year 1875  theyre old friends said helen smiling at the sight now is there a room for us to sit in  rachel opened a door  its more like a landing than a room she said indeed it had nothing of the shut stationary character of a room on shore a table was rooted in the middle and seats were stuck to the sides happily the tropical suns had bleached the tapestries to a faded bluegreen colour and the mirror with its frame of shells the work of the stewards love when the time hung heavy in the southern seas was quaint rather than ugly twisted shells with red lips like unicorns horns ornamented the mantelpiece which was draped by a pall of purple plush from which depended a certain number of balls two windows opened on to the deck and the light beating through them when the ship was roasted on the amazons had turned the prints on the opposite wall to a faint yellow colour so that the coliseum was scarcely to be distinguished from queen alexandra playing with her spaniels a pair of wicker armchairs by the fireside invited one to warm ones hands at a grate full of gilt shavings a great lamp swung above the tablethe kind of lamp which makes the light of civilisation across dark fields to one walking in the country  its odd that every one should be an old friend of mr peppers rachel started nervously for the situation was difficult the room cold and helen curiously silent  i suppose you take him for granted said her aunt  hes like this said rachel lighting on a fossilised fish in a basin and displaying it  i expect youre too severe helen remarked  rachel immediately tried to qualify what she had said against her belief  i dont really know him she said and took refuge in facts believing that elderly people really like them better than feelings she produced what she knew of william pepper she told helen that he always called on sundays when they were at home he knew about a great many thingsabout mathematics history greek zoology economics and the icelandic sagas he had turned persian poetry into english prose and english prose into greek iambics he was an authority upon coins andone other thingoh yes she thought it was vehicular traffic  he was here either to get things out of the sea or to write upon the probable course of odysseus for greek after all was his hobby  ive got all his pamphlets she said little pamphlets little yellow books it did not appear that she had read them  has he ever been in love asked helen who had chosen a seat  this was unexpectedly to the point  his hearts a piece of old shoe leather rachel declared dropping the fish but when questioned she had to own that she had never asked him  i shall ask him said helen  the last time i saw you you were buying a piano she continued do you rememberthe piano the room in the attic and the great plants with the prickles  yes and my aunts said the piano would come through the floor but at their age one wouldnt mind being killed in the night she enquired  i heard from aunt bessie not long ago helen stated she is afraid that you will spoil your arms if you insist upon so much practising  the muscles of the forearmand then one wont marry  she didnt put it quite like that replied mrs ambrose  oh noof course she wouldnt said rachel with a sigh  helen looked at her her face was weak rather than decided saved from insipidity by the large enquiring eyes denied beauty now that she was sheltered indoors by the lack of colour and definite outline moreover a hesitation in speaking or rather a tendency to use the wrong words made her seem more than normally incompetent for her years mrs ambrose who had been speaking much at random now reflected that she certainly did not look forward to the intimacy of three or four weeks on board ship which was threatened women of her own age usually boring her she supposed that girls would be worse she glanced at rachel again yes how clear it was that she would be vacillating emotional and when you said something to her it would make no more lasting impression than the stroke of a stick upon water there was nothing to take hold of in girlsnothing hard permanent satisfactory did willoughby say three weeks or did he say four she tried to remember  at this point however the door opened and a tall burly man entered the room came forward and shook helens hand with an emotional kind of heartiness willoughby himself rachels father helens brotherinlaw as a great deal of flesh would have been needed to make a fat man of him his frame being so large he was not fat his face was a large framework too looking by the smallness of the features and the glow in the hollow of the cheek more fitted to withstand assaults of the weather than to express sentiments and emotions or to respond to them in others  it is a great pleasure that you have come he said for both of us  rachel murmured in obedience to her fathers glance  well do our best to make you comfortable and ridley we think it an honour to have charge of him pepperll have some one to contradict himwhich i darent do you find this child grown dont you a young woman eh  still holding helens hand he drew his arm round rachels shoulder thus making them come uncomfortably close but helen forbore to look  you think she does us credit he asked  oh yes said helen  because we expect great things of her he continued squeezing his daughters arm and releasing her but about you now they sat down side by side on the little sofa did you leave the children well theyll be ready for school i suppose do they take after you or ambrose theyve got good heads on their shoulders ill be bound  at this helen immediately brightened more than she had yet done and explained that her son was six and her daughter ten everybody said that her boy was like her and her girl like ridley as for brains they were quick brats she thought and modestly she ventured on a little story about her sonhow left alone for a minute he had taken the pat of butter in his fingers run across the room with it and put it on the firemerely for the fun of the thing a feeling which she could understand  and you had to show the young rascal that these tricks wouldnt do eh  a child of six i dont think they matter  im an oldfashioned father  nonsense willoughby rachel knows better  much as willoughby would doubtless have liked his daughter to praise him she did not her eyes were unreflecting as water her fingers still toying with the fossilised fish her mind absent the elder people went on to speak of arrangements that could be made for ridleys comforta table placed where he couldnt help looking at the sea far from boilers at the same time sheltered from the view of people passing unless he made this a holiday when his books were all packed he would have no holiday whatever for out at santa marina helen knew by experience that he would work all day his boxes she said were packed with books  leave it to meleave it to me said willoughby obviously intending to do much more than she asked of him but ridley and mr pepper were heard fumbling at the door  how are you vinrace said ridley extending a limp hand as he came in as though the meeting were melancholy to both but on the whole more so to him  willoughby preserved his heartiness tempered by respect for the moment nothing was said  we looked in and saw you laughing helen remarked mr pepper had just told a very good story  pish none of the stories were good said her husband peevishly  still a severe judge ridley enquired mr vinrace  we bored you so that you left said ridley speaking directly to his wife  as this was quite true helen did not attempt to deny it and her next remark but didnt they improve after wed gone was unfortunate for her husband answered with a droop of his shoulders if possible they got worse  the situation was now one of considerable discomfort for every one concerned as was proved by a long interval of constraint and silence mr pepper indeed created a diversion of a kind by leaping on to his seat both feet tucked under him with the action of a spinster who detects a mouse as the draught struck at his ankles drawn up there sucking at his cigar with his arms encircling his knees he looked like the image of buddha and from this elevation began a discourse addressed to nobody for nobody had called for it upon the unplumbed depths of ocean he professed himself surprised to learn that although mr vinrace possessed ten ships regularly plying between london and buenos aires not one of them was bidden to investigate the great white monsters of the lower waters  no no laughed willoughby the monsters of the earth are too many for me  rachel was heard to sigh poor little goats  if it werent for the goats thered be no music my dear music depends upon goats said her father rather sharply and mr pepper went on to describe the white hairless blind monsters lying curled on the ridges of sand at the bottom of the sea which would explode if you brought them to the surface their sides bursting asunder and scattering entrails to the winds when released from pressure with considerable detail and with such show of knowledge that ridley was disgusted and begged him to stop  from all this helen drew her own conclusions which were gloomy enough pepper was a bore rachel was an unlicked girl no doubt prolific of confidences the very first of which would be you see i dont get on with my father willoughby as usual loved his business and built his empire and between them all she would be considerably bored being a woman of action however she rose and said that for her part she was going to bed at the door she glanced back instinctively at rachel expecting that as two of the same sex they would leave the room together rachel rose looked vaguely into helens face and remarked with her slight stammer im going out to tttriumph in the wind  mrs ambroses worst suspicions were confirmed she went down the passage lurching from side to side and fending off the wall now with her right arm now with her left at each lurch she exclaimed emphatically damn      chapter ii   uncomfortable as the night with its rocking movement and salt smells may have been and in one case undoubtedly was for mr pepper had insufficient clothes upon his bed the breakfast next morning wore a kind of beauty the voyage had begun and had begun happily with a soft blue sky and a calm sea the sense of untapped resources things to say as yet unsaid made the hour significant so that in future years the entire journey perhaps would be represented by this one scene with the sound of sirens hooting in the river the night before somehow mixing in  the table was cheerful with apples and bread and eggs helen handed willoughby the butter and as she did so cast her eye on him and reflected and she married you and she was happy i suppose  she went off on a familiar train of thought leading on to all kinds of wellknown reflections from the old wonder why theresa had married willoughby  of course one sees all that she thought meaning that one sees that he is big and burly and has a great booming voice and a fist and a will of his own but here she slipped into a fine analysis of him which is best represented by one word sentimental by which she meant that he was never simple and honest about his feelings for example he seldom spoke of the dead but kept anniversaries with singular pomp she suspected him of nameless atrocities with regard to his daughter as indeed she had always suspected him of bullying his wife naturally she fell to comparing her own fortunes with the fortunes of her friend for willoughbys wife had been perhaps the one woman helen called friend and this comparison often made the staple of their talk ridley was a scholar and willoughby was a man of business ridley was bringing out the third volume of pindar when willoughby was launching his first ship they built a new factory the very year the commentary on aristotlewas itappeared at the university press and rachel she looked at her meaning no doubt to decide the argument which was otherwise too evenly balanced by declaring that rachel was not comparable to her own children she really might be six years old was all she said however this judgment referring to the smooth unmarked outline of the girls face and not condemning her otherwise for if rachel were ever to think feel laugh or express herself instead of dropping milk from a height as though to see what kind of drops it made she might be interesting though never exactly pretty she was like her mother as the image in a pool on a still summers day is like the vivid flushed face that hangs over it  meanwhile helen herself was under examination though not from either of her victims mr pepper considered her and his meditations carried on while he cut his toast into bars and neatly buttered them took him through a considerable stretch of autobiography one of his penetrating glances assured him that he was right last night in judging that helen was beautiful blandly he passed her the jam she was talking nonsense but not worse nonsense than people usually do talk at breakfast the cerebral circulation as he knew to his cost being apt to give trouble at that hour he went on saying no to her on principle for he never yielded to a woman on account of her sex and here dropping his eyes to his plate he became autobiographical he had not married himself for the sufficient reason that he had never met a woman who commanded his respect condemned to pass the susceptible years of youth in a railway station in bombay he had seen only coloured women military women official women and his ideal was a woman who could read greek if not persian was irreproachably fair in the face and able to understand the small things he let fall while undressing as it was he had contracted habits of which he was not in the least ashamed certain odd minutes every day went to learning things by heart he never took a ticket without noting the number he devoted january to petronius february to catullus march to the etruscan vases perhaps anyhow he had done good work in india and there was nothing to regret in his life except the fundamental defects which no wise man regrets when the present is still his so concluding he looked up suddenly and smiled rachel caught his eye  and now youve chewed something thirtyseven times i suppose she thought but said politely aloud are your legs troubling you today mr pepper  my shoulder blades he asked shifting them painfully beauty has no effect upon uric acid that im aware of he sighed contemplating the round pane opposite through which the sky and sea showed blue at the same time he took a little parchment volume from his pocket and laid it on the table as it was clear that he invited comment helen asked him the name of it she got the name but she got also a disquisition upon the proper method of making roads beginning with the greeks who had he said many difficulties to contend with he continued with the romans passed to england and the right method which speedily became the wrong method and wound up with such a fury of denunciation directed against the roadmakers of the present day in general and the roadmakers of richmond park in particular where mr pepper had the habit of cycling every morning before breakfast that the spoons fairly jingled against the coffee cups and the insides of at least four rolls mounted in a heap beside mr peppers plate  pebbles he concluded viciously dropping another bread pellet upon the heap the roads of england are mended with pebbles with the first heavy rainfall ive told em your road will be a swamp again and again my words have proved true but dyou suppose they listen to me when i tell em so when i point out the consequences the consequences to the public purse when i recommend em to read coryphaeus no mrs ambrose you will form no just opinion of the stupidity of mankind until you have sat upon a borough council the little man fixed her with a glance of ferocious energy  i have had servants said mrs ambrose concentrating her gaze at this moment i have a nurse shes a good woman as they go but shes determined to make my children pray so far owing to great care on my part they think of god as a kind of walrus but now that my backs turnedridley she demanded swinging round upon her husband what shall we do if we find them saying the lords prayer when we get home again  ridley made the sound which is represented by tush but willoughby whose discomfort as he listened was manifested by a slight movement rocking of his body said awkwardly oh surely helen a little religion hurts nobody  i would rather my children told lies she replied and while willoughby was reflecting that his sisterinlaw was even more eccentric than he remembered pushed her chair back and swept upstairs in a second they heard her calling back oh look were out at sea  they followed her on to the deck all the smoke and the houses had disappeared and the ship was out in a wide space of sea very fresh and clear though pale in the early light they had left london sitting on its mud a very thin line of shadow tapered on the horizon scarcely thick enough to stand the burden of paris which nevertheless rested upon it they were free of roads free of mankind and the same exhilaration at their freedom ran through them all the ship was making her way steadily through small waves which slapped her and then fizzled like effervescing water leaving a little border of bubbles and foam on either side the colourless october sky above was thinly clouded as if by the trail of woodfire smoke and the air was wonderfully salt and brisk indeed it was too cold to stand still mrs ambrose drew her arm within her husbands and as they moved off it could be seen from the way in which her sloping cheek turned up to his that she had something private to communicate they went a few paces and rachel saw them kiss  down she looked into the depth of the sea while it was slightly disturbed on the surface by the passage of the euphrosyne beneath it was green and dim and it grew dimmer and dimmer until the sand at the bottom was only a pale blur one could scarcely see the black ribs of wrecked ships or the spiral towers made by the burrowings of great eels or the smooth greensided monsters who came by flickering this way and that  and rachel if any one wants me im busy till one said her father enforcing his words as he often did when he spoke to his daughter by a smart blow upon the shoulder  until one he repeated and youll find yourself some employment eh scales french a little german eh theres mr pepper who knows more about separable verbs than any man in europe eh and he went off laughing rachel laughed too as indeed she had laughed ever since she could remember without thinking it funny but because she admired her father  but just as she was turning with a view perhaps to finding some employment she was intercepted by a woman who was so broad and so thick that to be intercepted by her was inevitable the discreet tentative way in which she moved together with her sober black dress showed that she belonged to the lower orders nevertheless she took up a rocklike position looking about her to see that no gentry were near before she delivered her message which had reference to the state of the sheets and was of the utmost gravity  how ever were to get through this voyage miss rachel i really cant tell she began with a shake of her head theres only just sheets enough to go round and the masters has a rotten place you could put your fingers through and the counterpanes did you notice the counterpanes i thought to myself a poor person would have been ashamed of them the one i gave mr pepper was hardly fit to cover a dog    no miss rachel they could not be mended theyre only fit for dust sheets why if one sewed ones finger to the bone one would have ones work undone the next time they went to the laundry  her voice in its indignation wavered as if tears were near  there was nothing for it but to descend and inspect a large pile of linen heaped upon a table mrs chailey handled the sheets as if she knew each by name character and constitution some had yellow stains others had places where the threads made long ladders but to the ordinary eye they looked much as sheets usually do look very chill white cold and irreproachably clean  suddenly mrs chailey turning from the subject of sheets dismissing them entirely clenched her fists on the top of them and proclaimed and you couldnt ask a living creature to sit where i sit  mrs chailey was expected to sit in a cabin which was large enough but too near the boilers so that after five minutes she could hear her heart go she complained putting her hand above it which was a state of things that mrs vinrace rachels mother would never have dreamt of inflictingmrs vinrace who knew every sheet in her house and expected of every one the best they could do but no more  it was the easiest thing in the world to grant another room and the problem of sheets simultaneously and miraculously solved itself the spots and ladders not being past cure after all but  lies lies lies exclaimed the mistress indignantly as she ran up on to the deck whats the use of telling me lies  in her anger that a woman of fifty should behave like a child and come cringing to a girl because she wanted to sit where she had not leave to sit she did not think of the particular case and unpacking her music soon forgot all about the old woman and her sheets  mrs chailey folded her sheets but her expression testified to flatness within the world no longer cared about her and a ship was not a home when the lamps were lit yesterday and the sailors went tumbling above her head she had cried she would cry this evening she would cry tomorrow it was not home meanwhile she arranged her ornaments in the room which she had won too easily they were strange ornaments to bring on a sea voyagechina pugs teasets in miniature cups stamped floridly with the arms of the city of bristol hairpin boxes crusted with shamrock antelopes heads in coloured plaster together with a multitude of tiny photographs representing downright workmen in their sunday best and women holding white babies but there was one portrait in a gilt frame for which a nail was needed and before she sought it mrs chailey put on her spectacles and read what was written on a slip of paper at the back  this picture of her mistress is given to emma chailey by willoughby vinrace in gratitude for thirty years of devoted service  tears obliterated the words and the head of the nail  so long as i can do something for your family she was saying as she hammered at it when a voice called melodiously in the passage  mrs chailey mrs chailey  chailey instantly tidied her dress composed her face and opened the door  im in a fix said mrs ambrose who was flushed and out of breath you know what gentlemen are the chairs too highthe tables too lowtheres six inches between the floor and the door what i wants a hammer an old quilt and have you such a thing as a kitchen table anyhow between usshe now flung open the door of her husbands sitting room and revealed ridley pacing up and down his forehead all wrinkled and the collar of his coat turned up  its as though theyd taken pains to torment me he cried stopping dead did i come on this voyage in order to catch rheumatism and pneumonia really one might have credited vinrace with more sense my dear helen was on her knees under a table you are only making yourself untidy and we had much better recognise the fact that we are condemned to six weeks of unspeakable misery to come at all was the height of folly but now that we are here i suppose that i can face it like a man my diseases of course will be increasedi feel already worse than i did yesterday but weve only ourselves to thank and the children happily  move move move cried helen chasing him from corner to corner with a chair as though he were an errant hen out of the way ridley and in half an hour youll find it ready  she turned him out of the room and they could hear him groaning and swearing as he went along the passage  i daresay he isnt very strong said mrs chailey looking at mrs ambrose compassionately as she helped to shift and carry  its books sighed helen lifting an armful of sad volumes from the floor to the shelf greek from morning to night if ever miss rachel marries chailey pray that she may marry a man who doesnt know his abc  the preliminary discomforts and harshnesses which generally make the first days of a sea voyage so cheerless and trying to the temper being somehow lived through the succeeding days passed pleasantly enough october was well advanced but steadily burning with a warmth that made the early months of the summer appear very young and capricious great tracts of the earth lay now beneath the autumn sun and the whole of england from the bald moors to the cornish rocks was lit up from dawn to sunset and showed in stretches of yellow green and purple under that illumination even the roofs of the great towns glittered in thousands of small gardens millions of darkred flowers were blooming until the old ladies who had tended them so carefully came down the paths with their scissors snipped through their juicy stalks and laid them upon cold stone ledges in the village church innumerable parties of picnickers coming home at sunset cried was there ever such a day as this its you the young men whispered oh its you the young women replied all old people and many sick people were drawn were it only for a foot or two into the open air and prognosticated pleasant things about the course of the world as for the confidences and expressions of love that were heard not only in cornfields but in lamplit rooms where the windows opened on the garden and men with cigars kissed women with grey hairs they were not to be counted some said that the sky was an emblem of the life to come longtailed birds clattered and screamed and crossed from wood to wood with golden eyes in their plumage  but while all this went on by land very few people thought about the sea they took it for granted that the sea was calm and there was no need as there is in many houses when the creeper taps on the bedroom windows for the couples to murmur before they kiss think of the ships tonight or thank heaven im not the man in the lighthouse for all they imagined the ships when they vanished on the skyline dissolved like snow in water the grownup view indeed was not much clearer than the view of the little creatures in bathing drawers who were trotting in to the foam all along the coasts of england and scooping up buckets full of water they saw white sails or tufts of smoke pass across the horizon and if you had said that these were waterspouts or the petals of white sea flowers they would have agreed  the people in ships however took an equally singular view of england not only did it appear to them to be an island and a very small island but it was a shrinking island in which people were imprisoned one figured them first swarming about like aimless ants and almost pressing each other over the edge and then as the ship withdrew one figured them making a vain clamour which being unheard either ceased or rose into a brawl finally when the ship was out of sight of land it became plain that the people of england were completely mute the disease attacked other parts of the earth europe shrank asia shrank africa and america shrank until it seemed doubtful whether the ship would ever run against any of those wrinkled little rocks again but on the other hand an immense dignity had descended upon her she was an inhabitant of the great world which has so few inhabitants travelling all day across an empty universe with veils drawn before her and behind she was more lonely than the caravan crossing the desert she was infinitely more mysterious moving by her own power and sustained by her own resources the sea might give her death or some unexampled joy and none would know of it she was a bride going forth to her husband a virgin unknown of men in her vigor and purity she might be likened to all beautiful things for as a ship she had a life of her own  indeed if they had not been blessed in their weather one blue day being bowled up after another smooth round and flawless mrs ambrose would have found it very dull as it was she had her embroidery frame set up on deck with a little table by her side on which lay open a black volume of philosophy she chose a thread from the varicoloured tangle that lay in her lap and sewed red into the bark of a tree or yellow into the river torrent she was working at a great design of a tropical river running through a tropical forest where spotted deer would eventually browse upon masses of fruit bananas oranges and giant pomegranates while a troop of naked natives whirled darts into the air between the stitches she looked to one side and read a sentence about the reality of matter or the nature of good round her men in blue jerseys knelt and scrubbed the boards or leant over the rails and whistled and not far off mr pepper sat cutting up roots with a penknife the rest were occupied in other parts of the ship ridley at his greekhe had never found quarters more to his liking willoughby at his documents for he used a voyage to work of arrears of business and rachelhelen between her sentences of philosophy wondered sometimes what rachel did do with herself she meant vaguely to go and see they had scarcely spoken two words to each other since that first evening they were polite when they met but there had been no confidence of any kind rachel seemed to get on very well with her fathermuch better helen thought than she ought toand was as ready to let helen alone as helen was to let her alone  at that moment rachel was sitting in her room doing absolutely nothing when the ship was full this apartment bore some magnificent title and was the resort of elderly seasick ladies who left the deck to their youngsters by virtue of the piano and a mess of books on the floor rachel considered it her room and there she would sit for hours playing very difficult music reading a little german or a little english when the mood took her and doingas at this momentabsolutely nothing  the way she had been educated joined to a fine natural indolence was of course partly the reason of it for she had been educated as the majority of welltodo girls in the last part of the nineteenth century were educated kindly doctors and gentle old professors had taught her the rudiments of about ten different branches of knowledge but they would as soon have forced her to go through one piece of drudgery thoroughly as they would have told her that her hands were dirty the one hour or the two hours weekly passed very pleasantly partly owing to the other pupils partly to the fact that the window looked upon the back of a shop where figures appeared against the red windows in winter partly to the accidents that are bound to happen when more than two people are in the same room together but there was no subject in the world which she knew accurately her mind was in the state of an intelligent mans in the beginning of the reign of queen elizabeth she would believe practically anything she was told invent reasons for anything she said the shape of the earth the history of the world how trains worked or money was invested what laws were in force which people wanted what and why they wanted it the most elementary idea of a system in modern lifenone of this had been imparted to her by any of her professors or mistresses but this system of education had one great advantage it did not teach anything but it put no obstacle in the way of any real talent that the pupil might chance to have rachel being musical was allowed to learn nothing but music she became a fanatic about music all the energies that might have gone into languages science or literature that might have made her friends or shown her the world poured straight into music finding her teachers inadequate she had practically taught herself at the age of twentyfour she knew as much about music as most people do when they are thirty and could play as well as nature allowed her to which as became daily more obvious was a really generous allowance if this one definite gift was surrounded by dreams and ideas of the most extravagant and foolish description no one was any the wiser  her education being thus ordinary her circumstances were no more out of the common she was an only child and had never been bullied and laughed at by brothers and sisters her mother having died when she was eleven two aunts the sisters of her father brought her up and they lived for the sake of the air in a comfortable house in richmond she was of course brought up with excessive care which as a child was for her health as a girl and a young woman was for what it seems almost crude to call her morals until quite lately she had been completely ignorant that for women such things existed she groped for knowledge in old books and found it in repulsive chunks but she did not naturally care for books and thus never troubled her head about the censorship which was exercised first by her aunts later by her father friends might have told her things but she had few of her own agerichmond being an awkward place to reachand as it happened the only girl she knew well was a religious zealot who in the fervour of intimacy talked about god and the best ways of taking up ones cross a topic only fitfully interesting to one whose mind reached other stages at other times  but lying in her chair with one hand behind her head the other grasping the knob on the arm she was clearly following her thoughts intently her education left her abundant time for thinking her eyes were fixed so steadily upon a ball on the rail of the ship that she would have been startled and annoyed if anything had chanced to obscure it for a second she had begun her meditations with a shout of laughter caused by the following translation from tristan       in shrinking trepidation        his shame he seems to hide      while to the king his relation        he brings the corpselike bride      seems it so senseless what i say  she cried that it did and threw down the book next she had picked up cowpers letters the classic prescribed by her father which had bored her so that one sentence chancing to say something about the smell of broom in his garden she had thereupon seen the little hall at richmond laden with flowers on the day of her mothers funeral smelling so strong that now any flowerscent brought back the sickly horrible sensation and so from one scene she passed halfhearing halfseeing to another she saw her aunt lucy arranging flowers in the drawingroom  aunt lucy she volunteered i dont like the smell of broom it reminds me of funerals  nonsense rachel aunt lucy replied dont say such foolish things dear i always think it a particularly cheerful plant  lying in the hot sun her mind was fixed upon the characters of her aunts their views and the way they lived indeed this was a subject that lasted her hundreds of morning walks round richmond park and blotted out the trees and the people and the deer why did they do the things they did and what did they feel and what was it all about again she heard aunt lucy talking to aunt eleanor she had been that morning to take up the character of a servant and of course at halfpast ten in the morning one expects to find the housemaid brushing the stairs how odd how unspeakably odd but she could not explain to herself why suddenly as her aunt spoke the whole system in which they lived had appeared before her eyes as something quite unfamiliar and inexplicable and themselves as chairs or umbrellas dropped about here and there without any reason she could only say with her slight stammer are you fffond of aunt eleanor aunt lucy to which her aunt replied with her nervous henlike twitter of a laugh my dear child what questions you do ask  how fond very fond rachel pursued  i cant say ive ever thought how said miss vinrace if one cares one doesnt think how rachel which was aimed at the niece who had never yet come to her aunts as cordially as they wished  but you know i care for you dont you dear because youre your mothers daughter if for no other reason and there are plenty of other reasonsand she leant over and kissed her with some emotion and the argument was spilt irretrievably about the place like a bucket of milk  by these means rachel reached that stage in thinking if thinking it can be called when the eyes are intent upon a ball or a knob and the lips cease to move her efforts to come to an understanding had only hurt her aunts feelings and the conclusion must be that it is better not to try to feel anything strongly was to create an abyss between oneself and others who feel strongly perhaps but differently it was far better to play the piano and forget all the rest the conclusion was very welcome let these odd men and womenher aunts the hunts ridley helen mr pepper and the restbe symbolsfeatureless but dignified symbols of age of youth of motherhood of learning and beautiful often as people upon the stage are beautiful it appeared that nobody ever said a thing they meant or ever talked of a feeling they felt but that was what music was for reality dwelling in what one saw and felt but did not talk about one could accept a system in which things went round and round quite satisfactorily to other people without often troubling to think about it except as something superficially strange absorbed by her music she accepted her lot very complacently blazing into indignation perhaps once a fortnight and subsiding as she subsided now inextricably mixed in dreamy confusion her mind seemed to enter into communion to be delightfully expanded and combined with the spirit of the whitish boards on deck with the spirit of the sea with the spirit of beethoven op 112 even with the spirit of poor william cowper there at olney like a ball of thistledown it kissed the sea rose kissed it again and thus rising and kissing passed finally out of sight the rising and falling of the ball of thistledown was represented by the sudden droop forward of her own head and when it passed out of sight she was asleep  ten minutes later mrs ambrose opened the door and looked at her it did not surprise her to find that this was the way in which rachel passed her mornings she glanced round the room at the piano at the books at the general mess in the first place she considered rachel aesthetically lying unprotected she looked somehow like a victim dropped from the claws of a bird of prey but considered as a woman a young woman of twentyfour the sight gave rise to reflections mrs ambrose stood thinking for at least two minutes she then smiled turned noiselessly away and went lest the sleeper should waken and there should be the awkwardness of speech between them      chapter iii   early next morning there was a sound as of chains being drawn roughly overhead the steady heart of the euphrosyne slowly ceased to beat and helen poking her nose above deck saw a stationary castle upon a stationary hill they had dropped anchor in the mouth of the tagus and instead of cleaving new waves perpetually the same waves kept returning and washing against the sides of the ship  as soon as breakfast was done willoughby disappeared over the vessels side carrying a brown leather case shouting over his shoulder that every one was to mind and behave themselves for he would be kept in lisbon doing business until five oclock that afternoon  at about that hour he reappeared carrying his case professing himself tired bothered hungry thirsty cold and in immediate need of his tea rubbing his hands he told them the adventures of the day how he had come upon poor old jackson combing his moustache before the glass in the office little expecting his descent had put him through such a mornings work as seldom came his way then treated him to a lunch of champagne and ortolans paid a call upon mrs jackson who was fatter than ever poor woman but asked kindly after racheland o lord little jackson had confessed to a confounded piece of weaknesswell well no harm was done he supposed but what was the use of his giving orders if they were promptly disobeyed he had said distinctly that he would take no passengers on this trip here he began searching in his pockets and eventually discovered a card which he planked down on the table before rachel on it she read mr and mrs richard dalloway 23 browne street mayfair  mr richard dalloway continued vinrace seems to be a gentleman who thinks that because he was once a member of parliament and his wifes the daughter of a peer they can have what they like for the asking they got round poor little jackson anyhow said they must have passagesproduced a letter from lord glenaway asking me as a personal favouroverruled any objections jackson made i dont believe they came to much and so theres nothing for it but to submit i suppose  but it was evident that for some reason or other willoughby was quite pleased to submit although he made a show of growling  the truth was that mr and mrs dalloway had found themselves stranded in lisbon they had been travelling on the continent for some weeks chiefly with a view to broadening mr dalloways mind unable for a season by one of the accidents of political life to serve his country in parliament mr dalloway was doing the best he could to serve it out of parliament for that purpose the latin countries did very well although the east of course would have done better  expect to hear of me next in petersburg or teheran he had said turning to wave farewell from the steps of the travellers but a disease had broken out in the east there was cholera in russia and he was heard of not so romantically in lisbon they had been through france he had stopped at manufacturing centres where producing letters of introduction he had been shown over works and noted facts in a pocketbook in spain he and mrs dalloway had mounted mules for they wished to understand how the peasants live are they ripe for rebellion for example mrs dalloway had then insisted upon a day or two at madrid with the pictures finally they arrived in lisbon and spent six days which in a journal privately issued afterwards they described as of unique interest richard had audiences with ministers and foretold a crisis at no distant date the foundations of government being incurably corrupt yet how blame etc while clarissa inspected the royal stables and took several snapshots showing men now exiled and windows now broken among other things she photographed fieldings grave and let loose a small bird which some ruffian had trapped because one hates to think of anything in a cage where english people lie buried the diary stated their tour was thoroughly unconventional and followed no meditated plan the foreign correspondents of the times decided their route as much as anything else mr dalloway wished to look at certain guns and was of opinion that the african coast is far more unsettled than people at home were inclined to believe for these reasons they wanted a slow inquisitive kind of ship comfortable for they were bad sailors but not extravagant which would stop for a day or two at this port and at that taking in coal while the dalloways saw things for themselves meanwhile they found themselves stranded in lisbon unable for the moment to lay hands upon the precise vessel they wanted they heard of the euphrosyne but heard also that she was primarily a cargo boat and only took passengers by special arrangement her business being to carry dry goods to the amazons and rubber home again by special arrangement however were words of high encouragement to them for they came of a class where almost everything was specially arranged or could be if necessary on this occasion all that richard did was to write a note to lord glenaway the head of the line which bears his title to call on poor old jackson to represent to him how mrs dalloway was soandso and he had been something or other else and what they wanted was such and such a thing it was done they parted with compliments and pleasure on both sides and here a week later came the boat rowing up to the ship in the dusk with the dalloways on board of it in three minutes they were standing together on the deck of the euphrosyne their arrival of course created some stir and it was seen by several pairs of eyes that mrs dalloway was a tall slight woman her body wrapped in furs her head in veils while mr dalloway appeared to be a middlesized man of sturdy build dressed like a sportsman on an autumnal moor many solid leather bags of a rich brown hue soon surrounded them in addition to which mr dalloway carried a despatch box and his wife a dressingcase suggestive of a diamond necklace and bottles with silver tops  its so like whistler she exclaimed with a wave towards the shore as she shook rachel by the hand and rachel had only time to look at the grey hills on one side of her before willoughby introduced mrs chailey who took the lady to her cabin  momentary though it seemed nevertheless the interruption was upsetting every one was more or less put out by it from mr grice the steward to ridley himself a few minutes later rachel passed the smokingroom and found helen moving armchairs she was absorbed in her arrangements and on seeing rachel remarked confidentially  if one can give men a room to themselves where they will sit its all to the good armchairs are the important things she began wheeling them about now does it still look like a bar at a railway station  she whipped a plush cover off a table the appearance of the place was marvellously improved  again the arrival of the strangers made it obvious to rachel as the hour of dinner approached that she must change her dress and the ringing of the great bell found her sitting on the edge of her berth in such a position that the little glass above the washstand reflected her head and shoulders in the glass she wore an expression of tense melancholy for she had come to the depressing conclusion since the arrival of the dalloways that her face was not the face she wanted and in all probability never would be  however punctuality had been impressed on her and whatever face she had she must go in to dinner  these few minutes had been used by willoughby in sketching to the dalloways the people they were to meet and checking them upon his fingers  theres my brotherinlaw ambrose the scholar i daresay youve heard his name his wife my old friend pepper a very quiet fellow but knows everything im told and thats all were a very small party im dropping them on the coast  mrs dalloway with her head a little on one side did her best to recollect ambrosewas it a surnamebut failed she was made slightly uneasy by what she had heard she knew that scholars married any onegirls they met in farms on reading parties or little suburban women who said disagreeably of course i know its my husband you want not me  but helen came in at that point and mrs dalloway saw with relief that though slightly eccentric in appearance she was not untidy held herself well and her voice had restraint in it which she held to be the sign of a lady mr pepper had not troubled to change his neat ugly suit  but after all clarissa thought to herself as she followed vinrace in to dinner every ones interesting really  when seated at the table she had some need of that assurance chiefly because of ridley who came in late looked decidedly unkempt and took to his soup in profound gloom  an imperceptible signal passed between husband and wife meaning that they grasped the situation and would stand by each other loyally with scarcely a pause mrs dalloway turned to willoughby and began  what i find so tiresome about the sea is that there are no flowers in it imagine fields of hollyhocks and violets in midocean how divine  but somewhat dangerous to navigation boomed richard in the bass like the bassoon to the flourish of his wifes violin why weeds can be bad enough cant they vinrace i remember crossing in the mauretania once and saying to the captainrichardsdid you know himnow tell me what perils you really dread most for your ship captain richards expecting him to say icebergs or derelicts or fog or something of that sort not a bit of it ive always remembered his answer sedgius aquatici he said which i take to be a kind of duckweed  mr pepper looked up sharply and was about to put a question when willoughby continued  theyve an awful time of itthose captains three thousand souls on board  yes indeed said clarissa she turned to helen with an air of profundity im convinced people are wrong when they say its work that wears one its responsibility thats why one pays ones cook more than ones housemaid i suppose  according to that one ought to pay ones nurse double but one doesnt said helen  no but think what a joy to have to do with babies instead of saucepans said mrs dalloway looking with more interest at helen a probable mother  id much rather be a cook than a nurse said helen nothing would induce me to take charge of children  mothers always exaggerate said ridley a wellbred child is no responsibility ive travelled all over europe with mine you just wrap em up warm and put em in the rack  helen laughed at that mrs dalloway exclaimed looking at ridley  how like a father my husbands just the same and then one talks of the equality of the sexes  does one said mr pepper  oh some do cried clarissa my husband had to pass an irate lady every afternoon last session who said nothing else i imagine  she sat outside the house it was very awkward said dalloway at last i plucked up courage and said to her my good creature youre only in the way where you are youre hindering me and youre doing no good to yourself  and then she caught him by the coat and would have scratched his eyes out mrs dalloway put in  poohthats been exaggerated said richard no i pity them i confess the discomfort of sitting on those steps must be awful  serve them right said willoughby curtly  oh im entirely with you there said dalloway nobody can condemn the utter folly and futility of such behaviour more than i do and as for the whole agitation well may i be in my grave before a woman has the right to vote in england thats all i say  the solemnity of her husbands assertion made clarissa grave  its unthinkable she said dont tell me youre a suffragist she turned to ridley  i dont care a fig one way or tother said ambrose if any creature is so deluded as to think that a vote does him or her any good let him have it hell soon learn better  youre not a politician i see she smiled  goodness no said ridley  im afraid your husband wont approve of me said dalloway aside to mrs ambrose she suddenly recollected that he had been in parliament  dont you ever find it rather dull she asked not knowing exactly what to say  richard spread his hands before him as if inscriptions were to be read in the palms of them  if you ask me whether i ever find it rather dull he said i am bound to say yes on the other hand if you ask me what career do you consider on the whole taking the good with the bad the most enjoyable and enviable not to speak of its more serious side of all careers for a man i am bound to say the politicians  the bar or politics i agree said willoughby you get more run for your money  all ones faculties have their play said richard i may be treading on dangerous ground but what i feel about poets and artists in general is this on your own lines you cant be beatengranted but off your own linespuffone has to make allowances now i shouldnt like to think that any one had to make allowances for me  i dont quite agree richard said mrs dalloway think of shelley i feel that theres almost everything one wants in adonais  read adonais by all means richard conceded but whenever i hear of shelley i repeat to myself the words of matthew arnold what a set what a set  this roused ridleys attention matthew arnold a detestable prig he snapped  a priggranted said richard but i think a man of the world thats where my point comes in we politicians doubtless seem to you he grasped somehow that helen was the representative of the arts a gross commonplace set of people but we see both sides we may be clumsy but we do our best to get a grasp of things now your artists find things in a mess shrug their shoulders turn aside to their visionswhich i grant may be very beautifuland leave things in a mess now that seems to me evading ones responsibilities besides we arent all born with the artistic faculty  its dreadful said mrs dalloway who while her husband spoke had been thinking when im with artists i feel so intensely the delights of shutting oneself up in a little world of ones own with pictures and music and everything beautiful and then i go out into the streets and the first child i meet with its poor hungry dirty little face makes me turn round and say no i cant shut myself upi wont live in a world of my own i should like to stop all the painting and writing and music until this kind of thing exists no longer dont you feel she wound up addressing helen that lifes a perpetual conflict helen considered for a moment no she said i dont think i do  there was a pause which was decidedly uncomfortable mrs dalloway then gave a little shiver and asked whether she might have her fur cloak brought to her as she adjusted the soft brown fur about her neck a fresh topic struck her  i own she said that i shall never forget the antigone i saw it at cambridge years ago and its haunted me ever since dont you think its quite the most modern thing you ever saw she asked ridley it seemed to me id known twenty clytemnestras old lady ditchling for one i dont know a word of greek but i could listen to it for ever  here mr pepper struck up      πολλἀ τἀ δεινά κοὐδἑν ἀν     θρώπου δεινότερον πέλει     τοῦτο καί πολιοῦ πέραν     πόντου χειμερίῳ νότῳ     χωρεῖ περιβρυχίοισι     περῶν ὑπ´ οῐδμασι  mrs dalloway looked at him with compressed lips  id give ten years of my life to know greek she said when he had done  i could teach you the alphabet in half an hour said ridley and youd read homer in a month i should think it an honour to instruct you  helen engaged with mr dalloway and the habit now fallen into decline of quoting greek in the house of commons noted in the great commonplace book that lies open beside us as we talk the fact that all men even men like ridley really prefer women to be fashionable  clarissa exclaimed that she could think of nothing more delightful for an instant she saw herself in her drawingroom in browne street with a plato open on her kneesplato in the original greek she could not help believing that a real scholar if specially interested could slip greek into her head with scarcely any trouble  ridley engaged her to come tomorrow  if only your ship is going to treat us kindly she exclaimed drawing willoughby into play for the sake of guests and these were distinguished willoughby was ready with a bow of his head to vouch for the good behaviour even of the waves  im dreadfully bad and my husbands not very good sighed clarissa  i am never sick richard explained at least i have only been actually sick once he corrected himself that was crossing the channel but a choppy sea i confess or still worse a swell makes me distinctly uncomfortable the great thing is never to miss a meal you look at the food and you say i cant you take a mouthful and lord knows how youre going to swallow it but persevere and you often settle the attack for good my wifes a coward  they were pushing back their chairs the ladies were hesitating at the doorway  id better show the way said helen advancing  rachel followed she had taken no part in the talk no one had spoken to her but she had listened to every word that was said she had looked from mrs dalloway to mr dalloway and from mr dalloway back again clarissa indeed was a fascinating spectacle she wore a white dress and a long glittering necklace what with her clothes and her arch delicate face which showed exquisitely pink beneath hair turning grey she was astonishingly like an eighteenthcentury masterpiecea reynolds or a romney she made helen and the others look coarse and slovenly beside her sitting lightly upright she seemed to be dealing with the world as she chose the enormous solid globe spun round this way and that beneath her fingers and her husband mr dalloway rolling that rich deliberate voice was even more impressive he seemed to come from the humming oily centre of the machine where the polished rods are sliding and the pistons thumping he grasped things so firmly but so loosely he made the others appear like old maids cheapening remnants rachel followed in the wake of the matrons as if in a trance a curious scent of violets came back from mrs dalloway mingling with the soft rustling of her skirts and the tinkling of her chains as she followed rachel thought with supreme selfabasement taking in the whole course of her life and the lives of all her friends she said we lived in a world of our own its true were perfectly absurd  we sit in here said helen opening the door of the saloon  you play said mrs dalloway to mrs ambrose taking up the score of tristan which lay on the table  my niece does said helen laying her hand on rachels shoulder  oh how i envy you clarissa addressed rachel for the first time dyou remember this isnt it divine she played a bar or two with ringed fingers upon the page  and then tristan goes like this and isoldeohits all too thrilling have you been to bayreuth  no i havent said rachel then thats still to come i shall never forget my first parsifala grilling august day and those fat old german women come in their stuffy high frocks and then the dark theatre and the music beginning and one couldnt help sobbing a kind man went and fetched me water i remember and i could only cry on his shoulder it caught me here she touched her throat its like nothing else in the world but wheres your piano its in another room rachel explained  but you will play to us clarissa entreated i cant imagine anything nicer than to sit out in the moonlight and listen to musiconly that sounds too like a schoolgirl you know she said turning to helen i dont think musics altogether good for peopleim afraid not  too great a strain asked helen  too emotional somehow said clarissa one notices it at once when a boy or girl takes up music as a profession sir william broadley told me just the same thing dont you hate the kind of attitudes people go into over wagnerlike this she cast her eyes to the ceiling clasped her hands and assumed a look of intensity it really doesnt mean that they appreciate him in fact i always think its the other way round the people who really care about an art are always the least affected dyou know henry philips the painter she asked  i have seen him said helen  to look at one might think he was a successful stockbroker and not one of the greatest painters of the age thats what i like  there are a great many successful stockbrokers if you like looking at them said helen  rachel wished vehemently that her aunt would not be so perverse  when you see a musician with long hair dont you know instinctively that hes bad clarissa asked turning to rachel watts and joachimthey looked just like you and me  and how much nicer theyd have looked with curls said helen the question is are you going to aim at beauty or are you not  cleanliness said clarissa i do want a man to look clean  by cleanliness you really mean wellcut clothes said helen  theres something one knows a gentleman by said clarissa but one cant say what it is  take my husband now does he look like a gentleman  the question seemed to clarissa in extraordinarily bad taste one of the things that cant be said she would have put it she could find no answer but a laugh  well anyhow she said turning to rachel i shall insist upon your playing to me tomorrow  there was that in her manner that made rachel love her  mrs dalloway hid a tiny yawn a mere dilation of the nostrils  dyou know she said im extraordinarily sleepy its the sea air i think i shall escape  a mans voice which she took to be that of mr pepper strident in discussion and advancing upon the saloon gave her the alarm  goodnightgoodnight she said oh i know my waydo pray for calm goodnight  her yawn must have been the image of a yawn instead of letting her mouth droop dropping all her clothes in a bunch as though they depended on one string and stretching her limbs to the utmost end of her berth she merely changed her dress for a dressinggown with innumerable frills and wrapping her feet in a rug sat down with a writingpad on her knee already this cramped little cabin was the dressing room of a lady of quality there were bottles containing liquids there were trays boxes brushes pins evidently not an inch of her person lacked its proper instrument the scent which had intoxicated rachel pervaded the air thus established mrs dalloway began to write a pen in her hands became a thing one caressed paper with and she might have been stroking and tickling a kitten as she wrote   picture us my dear afloat in the very oddest ship you can imagine its not the ship so much as the people one does come across queer sorts as one travels i must say i find it hugely amusing theres the manager of the linecalled vinracea nice big englishman doesnt say muchyou know the sort as for the restthey might have come trailing out of an old number of punch theyre like people playing croquet in the sixties how long theyve all been shut up in this ship i dont knowyears and years i should saybut one feels as though one had boarded a little separate world and theyd never been on shore or done ordinary things in their lives its what ive always said about literary peopletheyre far the hardest of any to get on with the worst of it is these peoplea man and his wife and a niecemight have been one feels just like everybody else if they hadnt got swallowed up by oxford or cambridge or some such place and been made cranks of the mans really delightful if hed cut his nails and the woman has quite a fine face only she dresses of course in a potato sack and wears her hair like a liberty shopgirls they talk about art and think us such poops for dressing in the evening however i cant help that id rather die than come in to dinner without changingwouldnt you it matters ever so much more than the soup its odd how things like that do matter so much more than whats generally supposed to matter id rather have my head cut off than wear flannel next the skin then theres a nice shy girlpoor thingi wish one could rake her out before its too late she has quite nice eyes and hair only of course shell get funny too we ought to start a society for broadening the minds of the youngmuch more useful than missionaries hester oh id forgotten theres a dreadful little thing called pepper hes just like his name hes indescribably insignificant and rather queer in his temper poor dear its like sitting down to dinner with an illconditioned foxterrier only one cant comb him out and sprinkle him with powder as one would ones dog its a pity sometimes one cant treat people like dogs the great comfort is that were away from newspapers so that richard will have a real holiday this time spain wasnt a holiday      you coward said richard almost filling the room with his sturdy figure  i did my duty at dinner cried clarissa  youve let yourself in for the greek alphabet anyhow  oh my dear who is ambrose  i gather that he was a cambridge don lives in london now and edits classics  did you ever see such a set of cranks the woman asked me if i thought her husband looked like a gentleman  it was hard to keep the ball rolling at dinner certainly said richard why is it that the women in that class are so much queerer than the men  theyre not half badlooking reallyonlytheyre so odd  they both laughed thinking of the same things so that there was no need to compare their impressions  i see i shall have quite a lot to say to vinrace said richard he knows sutton and all that set he can tell me a good deal about the conditions of shipbuilding in the north  oh im glad the men always are so much better than the women  one always has something to say to a man certainly said richard but ive no doubt youll chatter away fast enough about the babies clarice  has she got children she doesnt look like it somehow  two a boy and girl  a pang of envy shot through mrs dalloways heart  we must have a son dick she said  good lord what opportunities there are now for young men said dalloway for his talk had set him thinking i dont suppose theres been so good an opening since the days of pitt  and its yours said clarissa  to be a leader of men richard soliloquised its a fine career my godwhat a career  the chest slowly curved beneath his waistcoat  dyou know dick i cant help thinking of england said his wife meditatively leaning her head against his chest being on this ship seems to make it so much more vividwhat it really means to be english one thinks of all weve done and our navies and the people in india and africa and how weve gone on century after century sending out boys from little country villagesand of men like you dick and it makes one feel as if one couldnt bear not to be english think of the light burning over the house dick when i stood on deck just now i seemed to see it its what one means by london  its the continuity said richard sententiously a vision of english history king following king prime minister prime minister and law law had come over him while his wife spoke he ran his mind along the line of conservative policy which went steadily from lord salisbury to alfred and gradually enclosed as though it were a lasso that opened and caught things enormous chunks of the habitable globe  its taken a long time but weve pretty nearly done it he said it remains to consolidate  and these people dont see it clarissa exclaimed  it takes all sorts to make a world said her husband there would never be a government if there werent an opposition  dick youre better than i am said clarissa you see round where i only see there she pressed a point on the back of his hand  thats my business as i tried to explain at dinner  what i like about you dick she continued is that youre always the same and im a creature of moods  youre a pretty creature anyhow he said gazing at her with deeper eyes  you think so do you then kiss me  he kissed her passionately so that her halfwritten letter slid to the ground picking it up he read it without asking leave  wheres your pen he said and added in his little masculine hand  rd loquitur clarice has omitted to tell you that she looked exceedingly pretty at dinner and made a conquest by which she has bound herself to learn the greek alphabet i will take this occasion of adding that we are both enjoying ourselves in these outlandish parts and only wish for the presence of our friends yourself and john to wit to make the trip perfectly enjoyable as it promises to be instructive     voices were heard at the end of the corridor mrs ambrose was speaking low william pepper was remarking in his definite and rather acid voice that is the type of lady with whom i find myself distinctly out of sympathy she  but neither richard nor clarissa profited by the verdict for directly it seemed likely that they would overhear richard crackled a sheet of paper  i often wonder clarissa mused in bed over the little white volume of pascal which went with her everywhere whether it is really good for a woman to live with a man who is morally her superior as richard is mine it makes one so dependent i suppose i feel for him what my mother and women of her generation felt for christ it just shows that one cant do without something she then fell into a sleep which was as usual extremely sound and refreshing but visited by fantastic dreams of great greek letters stalking round the room when she woke up and laughed to herself remembering where she was and that the greek letters were real people lying asleep not many yards away then thinking of the black sea outside tossing beneath the moon she shuddered and thought of her husband and the others as companions on the voyage the dreams were not confined to her indeed but went from one brain to another they all dreamt of each other that night as was natural considering how thin the partitions were between them and how strangely they had been lifted off the earth to sit next each other in midocean and see every detail of each others faces and hear whatever they chanced to say      chapter iv   next morning clarissa was up before anyone else she dressed and was out on deck breathing the fresh air of a calm morning and making the circuit of the ship for the second time she ran straight into the lean person of mr grice the steward she apologised and at the same time asked him to enlighten her what were those shiny brass stands for half glass on the top she had been wondering and could not guess when he had done explaining she cried enthusiastically  i do think that to be a sailor must be the finest thing in the world  and what dyou know about it said mr grice kindling in a strange manner pardon me what does any man or woman brought up in england know about the sea they profess to know but they dont  the bitterness with which he spoke was ominous of what was to come he led her off to his own quarters and sitting on the edge of a brassbound table looking uncommonly like a seagull with her white tapering body and thin alert face mrs dalloway had to listen to the tirade of a fanatical man did she realise to begin with what a very small part of the world the land was how peaceful how beautiful how benignant in comparison the sea the deep waters could sustain europe unaided if every earthly animal died of the plague tomorrow mr grice recalled dreadful sights which he had seen in the richest city of the worldmen and women standing in line hour after hour to receive a mug of greasy soup and i thought of the good flesh down here waiting and asking to be caught im not exactly a protestant and im not a catholic but i could almost pray for the days of popery to come againbecause of the fasts  as he talked he kept opening drawers and moving little glass jars here were the treasures which the great ocean had bestowed upon himpale fish in greenish liquids blobs of jelly with streaming tresses fish with lights in their heads they lived so deep  they have swum about among bones clarissa sighed  youre thinking of shakespeare said mr grice and taking down a copy from a shelf well lined with books recited in an emphatic nasal voice  full fathom five thy father lies  a grand fellow shakespeare he said replacing the volume  clarissa was so glad to hear him say so  which is your favourite play i wonder if its the same as mine  henry the fifth said mr grice  joy cried clarissa it is  hamlet was what you might call too introspective for mr grice the sonnets too passionate henry the fifth was to him the model of an english gentleman but his favourite reading was huxley herbert spencer and henry george while emerson and thomas hardy he read for relaxation he was giving mrs dalloway his views upon the present state of england when the breakfast bell rung so imperiously that she had to tear herself away promising to come back and be shown his seaweeds  the party which had seemed so odd to her the night before was already gathered round the table still under the influence of sleep and therefore uncommunicative but her entrance sent a little flutter like a breath of air through them all  ive had the most interesting talk of my life she exclaimed taking her seat beside willoughby dyou realise that one of your men is a philosopher and a poet  a very interesting fellowthats what i always say said willoughby distinguishing mr grice though rachel finds him a bore  hes a bore when he talks about currents said rachel her eyes were full of sleep but mrs dalloway still seemed to her wonderful  ive never met a bore yet said clarissa  and i should say the world was full of them exclaimed helen but her beauty which was radiant in the morning light took the contrariness from her words  i agree that its the worst one can possibly say of any one said clarissa how much rather one would be a murderer than a bore she added with her usual air of saying something profound one can fancy liking a murderer its the same with dogs some dogs are awful bores poor dears  it happened that richard was sitting next to rachel she was curiously conscious of his presence and appearancehis wellcut clothes his crackling shirtfront his cuffs with blue rings round them and the squaretipped very clean fingers with the red stone on the little finger of the left hand  we had a dog who was a bore and knew it he said addressing her in cool easy tones he was a skye terrier one of those long chaps with little feet poking out from their hair likelike caterpillarsno like sofas i should say well we had another dog at the same time a black brisk animala schipperke i think you call them you cant imagine a greater contrast the skye so slow and deliberate looking up at you like some old gentleman in the club as much as to say you dont really mean it do you and the schipperke as quick as a knife i liked the skye best i must confess there was something pathetic about him  the story seemed to have no climax  what happened to him rachel asked  thats a very sad story said richard lowering his voice and peeling an apple he followed my wife in the car one day and got run over by a brute of a cyclist  was he killed asked rachel  but clarissa at her end of the table had overheard  dont talk of it she cried its a thing i cant bear to think of to this day  surely the tears stood in her eyes  thats the painful thing about pets said mr dalloway they die the first sorrow i can remember was for the death of a dormouse i regret to say that i sat upon it still that didnt make one any the less sorry here lies the duck that samuel johnson sat on eh i was big for my age  then we had canaries he continued a pair of ringdoves a lemur and at one time a martin  did you live in the country rachel asked him  we lived in the country for six months of the year when i say we i mean four sisters a brother and myself theres nothing like coming of a large family sisters particularly are delightful  dick you were horribly spoilt cried clarissa across the table  no no appreciated said richard  rachel had other questions on the tip of her tongue or rather one enormous question which she did not in the least know how to put into words the talk appeared too airy to admit of it  please tell meeverything that was what she wanted to say he had drawn apart one little chink and showed astonishing treasures it seemed to her incredible that a man like that should be willing to talk to her he had sisters and pets and once lived in the country she stirred her tea round and round the bubbles which swam and clustered in the cup seemed to her like the union of their minds  the talk meanwhile raced past her and when richard suddenly stated in a jocular tone of voice im sure miss vinrace now has secret leanings towards catholicism she had no idea what to answer and helen could not help laughing at the start she gave  however breakfast was over and mrs dalloway was rising i always think religions like collecting beetles she said summing up the discussion as she went up the stairs with helen one person has a passion for black beetles another hasnt its no good arguing about it whats your black beetle now  i suppose its my children said helen  ahthats different clarissa breathed do tell me you have a boy havent you isnt it detestable leaving them  it was as though a blue shadow had fallen across a pool their eyes became deeper and their voices more cordial instead of joining them as they began to pace the deck rachel was indignant with the prosperous matrons who made her feel outside their world and motherless and turning back she left them abruptly she slammed the door of her room and pulled out her music it was all old musicbach and beethoven mozart and purcellthe pages yellow the engraving rough to the finger in three minutes she was deep in a very difficult very classical fugue in a and over her face came a queer remote impersonal expression of complete absorption and anxious satisfaction now she stumbled now she faltered and had to play the same bar twice over but an invisible line seemed to string the notes together from which rose a shape a building she was so far absorbed in this work for it was really difficult to find how all these sounds should stand together and drew upon the whole of her faculties that she never heard a knock at the door it was burst impulsively open and mrs dalloway stood in the room leaving the door open so that a strip of the white deck and of the blue sea appeared through the opening the shape of the bach fugue crashed to the ground  dont let me interrupt clarissa implored i heard you playing and i couldnt resist i adore bach  rachel flushed and fumbled her fingers in her lap she stood up awkwardly  its too difficult she said  but you were playing quite splendidly i ought to have stayed outside  no said rachel  she slid cowpers letters and wuthering heights out of the armchair so that clarissa was invited to sit there  what a dear little room she said looking round oh cowpers letters ive never read them are they nice  rather dull said rachel  he wrote awfully well didnt he said clarissa if one likes that kind of thingfinished his sentences and all that wuthering heights ahthats more in my line i really couldnt exist without the brontes dont you love them still on the whole id rather live without them than without jane austen  lightly and at random though she spoke her manner conveyed an extraordinary degree of sympathy and desire to befriend  jane austen i dont like jane austen said rachel  you monster clarissa exclaimed i can only just forgive you tell me why  shes sosowell so like a tight plait rachel floundered ahi see what you mean but i dont agree and you wont when youre older at your age i only liked shelley i can remember sobbing over him in the garden       he has outsoared the shadow of our night      envy and calumny and hate and pain you remember       can touch him not and torture not again      from the contagion of the worlds slow stain  how divineand yet what nonsense she looked lightly round the room i always think its living not dying that counts i really respect some snuffy old stockbroker whos gone on adding up column after column all his days and trotting back to his villa at brixton with some old pug dog he worships and a dreary little wife sitting at the end of the table and going off to margate for a fortnighti assure you i know heaps like thatwell they seem to me really nobler than poets whom every one worships just because theyre geniuses and die young but i dont expect you to agree with me  she pressed rachels shoulder  ummm she went on quoting  unrest which men miscall delight  when youre my age youll see that the world is crammed with delightful things i think young people make such a mistake about thatnot letting themselves be happy i sometimes think that happiness is the only thing that counts i dont know you well enough to say but i should guess you might be a little inclined towhen ones young and attractiveim going to say iteverythings at ones feet she glanced round as much as to say not only a few stuffy books and bach  i long to ask questions she continued you interest me so much if im impertinent you must just box my ears  and ii want to ask questions said rachel with such earnestness that mrs dalloway had to check her smile  dyou mind if we walk she said the airs so delicious  she snuffed it like a racehorse as they shut the door and stood on deck  isnt it good to be alive she exclaimed and drew rachels arm within hers  look look how exquisite  the shores of portugal were beginning to lose their substance but the land was still the land though at a great distance they could distinguish the little towns that were sprinkled in the folds of the hills and the smoke rising faintly the towns appeared to be very small in comparison with the great purple mountains behind them  honestly though said clarissa having looked i dont like views theyre too inhuman they walked on  how odd it is she continued impulsively this time yesterday wed never met i was packing in a stuffy little room in the hotel we know absolutely nothing about each otherand yeti feel as if i did know you  you have childrenyour husband was in parliament  youve never been to school and you live  with my aunts at richmond  richmond  you see my aunts like the park they like the quiet  and you dont i understand clarissa laughed  i like walking in the park alone but notwith the dogs she finished  no and some people are dogs arent they said clarissa as if she had guessed a secret but not every oneoh no not every one  not every one said rachel and stopped  i can quite imagine you walking alone said clarissa and thinkingin a little world of your own but how you will enjoy itsome day  i shall enjoy walking with a manis that what you mean said rachel regarding mrs dalloway with her large enquiring eyes  i wasnt thinking of a man particularly said clarissa but you will  no i shall never marry rachel determined  i shouldnt be so sure of that said clarissa her sidelong glance told rachel that she found her attractive although she was inexplicably amused  why do people marry rachel asked  thats what youre going to find out clarissa laughed  rachel followed her eyes and found that they rested for a second on the robust figure of richard dalloway who was engaged in striking a match on the sole of his boot while willoughby expounded something which seemed to be of great interest to them both  theres nothing like it she concluded do tell me about the ambroses or am i asking too many questions  i find you easy to talk to said rachel  the short sketch of the ambroses was however somewhat perfunctory and contained little but the fact that mr ambrose was her uncle  your mothers brother  when a name has dropped out of use the lightest touch upon it tells mrs dalloway went on  are you like your mother  no she was different said rachel  she was overcome by an intense desire to tell mrs dalloway things she had never told any onethings she had not realised herself until this moment  i am lonely she began i want she did not know what she wanted so that she could not finish the sentence but her lip quivered  but it seemed that mrs dalloway was able to understand without words  i know she said actually putting one arm round rachels shoulder when i was your age i wanted too no one understood until i met richard he gave me all i wanted hes man and woman as well her eyes rested upon mr dalloway leaning upon the rail still talking dont think i say that because im his wifei see his faults more clearly than i see any one elses what one wants in the person one lives with is that they should keep one at ones best i often wonder what ive done to be so happy she exclaimed and a tear slid down her cheek she wiped it away squeezed rachels hand and exclaimed  how good life is at that moment standing out in the fresh breeze with the sun upon the waves and mrs dalloways hand upon her arm it seemed indeed as if life which had been unnamed before was infinitely wonderful and too good to be true  here helen passed them and seeing rachel arminarm with a comparative stranger looking excited was amused but at the same time slightly irritated but they were immediately joined by richard who had enjoyed a very interesting talk with willoughby and was in a sociable mood  observe my panama he said touching the brim of his hat are you aware miss vinrace how much can be done to induce fine weather by appropriate headdress i have determined that it is a hot summer day i warn you that nothing you can say will shake me therefore i am going to sit down i advise you to follow my example three chairs in a row invited them to be seated  leaning back richard surveyed the waves  thats a very pretty blue he said but theres a little too much of it variety is essential to a view thus if you have hills you ought to have a river if a river hills the best view in the world in my opinion is that from boars hill on a fine dayit must be a fine day mark youa rugoh thank you my dear    in that case you have also the advantage of associationsthe past  dyou want to talk dick or shall i read aloud  clarissa had fetched a book with the rugs  persuasion announced richard examining the volume  thats for miss vinrace said clarissa she cant bear our beloved jane  thatif i may say sois because you have not read her said richard she is incomparably the greatest female writer we possess  she is the greatest he continued and for this reason she does not attempt to write like a man every other woman does on that account i dont read em  produce your instances miss vinrace he went on joining his fingertips im ready to be converted  he waited while rachel vainly tried to vindicate her sex from the slight he put upon it  im afraid hes right said clarissa he generally isthe wretch  i brought persuasion she went on because i thought it was a little less threadbare than the othersthough dick its no good your pretending to know jane by heart considering that she always sends you to sleep  after the labours of legislation i deserve sleep said richard  youre not to think about those guns said clarissa seeing that his eye passing over the waves still sought the land meditatively or about navies or empires or anything so saying she opened the book and began to read  sir walter elliott of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetagedont you know sir walterthere he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one she does write well doesnt she there she read on in a light humorous voice she was determined that sir walter should take her husbands mind off the guns of britain and divert him in an exquisite quaint sprightly and slightly ridiculous world after a time it appeared that the sun was sinking in that world and the points becoming softer rachel looked up to see what caused the change richards eyelids were closing and opening opening and closing a loud nasal breath announced that he no longer considered appearances that he was sound asleep  triumph clarissa whispered at the end of a sentence suddenly she raised her hand in protest a sailor hesitated she gave the book to rachel and stepped lightly to take the messagemr grice wished to know if it was convenient etc she followed him ridley who had prowled unheeded started forward stopped and with a gesture of disgust strode off to his study the sleeping politician was left in rachels charge she read a sentence and took a look at him in sleep he looked like a coat hanging at the end of a bed there were all the wrinkles and the sleeves and trousers kept their shape though no longer filled out by legs and arms you can then best judge the age and state of the coat she looked him all over until it seemed to her that he must protest  he was a man of forty perhaps and here there were lines round his eyes and there curious clefts in his cheeks slightly battered he appeared but dogged and in the prime of life  sisters and a dormouse and some canaries rachel murmured never taking her eyes off him i wonder i wonder she ceased her chin upon her hand still looking at him a bell chimed behind them and richard raised his head then he opened his eyes which wore for a second the queer look of a shortsighted persons whose spectacles are lost it took him a moment to recover from the impropriety of having snored and possibly grunted before a young lady to wake and find oneself left alone with one was also slightly disconcerting  i suppose ive been dozing he said whats happened to everyone clarissa  mrs dalloway has gone to look at mr grices fish rachel replied  i might have guessed said richard its a common occurrence and how have you improved the shining hour have you become a convert  i dont think ive read a line said rachel  thats what i always find there are too many things to look at i find nature very stimulating myself my best ideas have come to me out of doors  when you were walking  walkingridingyachtingi suppose the most momentous conversations of my life took place while perambulating the great court at trinity i was at both universities it was a fad of my fathers he thought it broadening to the mind i think i agree with him i can rememberwhat an age ago it seemssettling the basis of a future state with the present secretary for india we thought ourselves very wise im not sure we werent we were happy miss vinrace and we were younggifts which make for wisdom  have you done what you said youd do she asked  a searching question i answeryes and no if on the one hand i have not accomplished what i set out to accomplishwhich of us doeson the other i can fairly say this i have not lowered my ideal  he looked resolutely at a seagull as though his ideal flew on the wings of the bird  but said rachel what is your ideal  there you ask too much miss vinrace said richard playfully  she could only say that she wanted to know and richard was sufficiently amused to answer  well how shall i reply in one wordunity unity of aim of dominion of progress the dispersion of the best ideas over the greatest area  the english  i grant that the english seem on the whole whiter than most men their records cleaner but good lord dont run away with the idea that i dont see the drawbackshorrorsunmentionable things done in our very midst im under no illusions few people i suppose have fewer illusions than i have have you ever been in a factory miss vinraceno i suppose noti may say i hope not  as for rachel she had scarcely walked through a poor street and always under the escort of father maid or aunts  i was going to say that if youd ever seen the kind of thing thats going on round you youd understand what it is that makes me and men like me politicians you asked me a moment ago whether id done what i set out to do well when i consider my life there is one fact i admit that im proud of owing to me some thousands of girls in lancashireand many thousands to come after themcan spend an hour every day in the open air which their mothers had to spend over their looms im prouder of that i own than i should be of writing keats and shelley into the bargain  it became painful to rachel to be one of those who write keats and shelley she liked richard dalloway and warmed as he warmed he seemed to mean what he said  i know nothing she exclaimed  its far better that you should know nothing he said paternally and you wrong yourself im sure you play very nicely im told and ive no doubt youve read heaps of learned books  elderly banter would no longer check her  you talk of unity she said you ought to make me understand  i never allow my wife to talk politics he said seriously for this reason it is impossible for human beings constituted as they are both to fight and to have ideals if i have preserved mine as i am thankful to say that in great measure i have it is due to the fact that i have been able to come home to my wife in the evening and to find that she has spent her day in calling music play with the children domestic dutieswhat you will her illusions have not been destroyed she gives me courage to go on the strain of public life is very great he added  this made him appear a battered martyr parting every day with some of the finest gold in the service of mankind  i cant think rachel exclaimed how any one does it  explain miss vinrace said richard this is a matter i want to clear up  his kindness was genuine and she determined to take the chance he gave her although to talk to a man of such worth and authority made her heart beat  it seems to me like this she began doing her best first to recollect and then to expose her shivering private visions  theres an old widow in her room somewhere let us suppose in the suburbs of leeds  richard bent his head to show that he accepted the widow  in london youre spending your life talking writing things getting bills through missing what seems natural the result of it all is that she goes to her cupboard and finds a little more tea a few lumps of sugar or a little less tea and a newspaper widows all over the country i admit do this still theres the mind of the widowthe affections those you leave untouched but you waste you own  if the widow goes to her cupboard and finds it bare richard answered her spiritual outlook we may admit will be affected if i may pick holes in your philosophy miss vinrace which has its merits i would point out that a human being is not a set of compartments but an organism imagination miss vinrace use your imagination thats where you young liberals fail conceive the world as a whole now for your second point when you assert that in trying to set the house in order for the benefit of the young generation i am wasting my higher capabilities i totally disagree with you i can conceive no more exalted aimto be the citizen of the empire look at it in this way miss vinrace conceive the state as a complicated machine we citizens are parts of that machine some fulfil more important duties others perhaps i am one of them serve only to connect some obscure parts of the mechanism concealed from the public eye yet if the meanest screw fails in its task the proper working of the whole is imperilled  it was impossible to combine the image of a lean black widow gazing out of her window and longing for some one to talk to with the image of a vast machine such as one sees at south kensington thumping thumping thumping the attempt at communication had been a failure  we dont seem to understand each other she said  shall i say something that will make you very angry he replied  it wont said rachel  well then no woman has what i may call the political instinct you have very great virtues i am the first i hope to admit that but i have never met a woman who even saw what is meant by statesmanship i am going to make you still more angry i hope that i never shall meet such a woman now miss vinrace are we enemies for life  vanity irritation and a thrusting desire to be understood urged her to make another attempt  under the streets in the sewers in the wires in the telephones there is something alive is that what you mean in things like dustcarts and men mending roads you feel that all the time when you walk about london and when you turn on a tap and the water comes  certainly said richard i understand you to mean that the whole of modern society is based upon cooperative effort if only more people would realise that miss vinrace there would be fewer of your old widows in solitary lodgings  rachel considered  are you a liberal or are you a conservative she asked  i call myself a conservative for convenience sake said richard smiling but there is more in common between the two parties than people generally allow  there was a pause which did not come on rachels side from any lack of things to say as usual she could not say them and was further confused by the fact that the time for talking probably ran short she was haunted by absurd jumbled ideashow if one went back far enough everything perhaps was intelligible everything was in common for the mammoths who pastured in the fields of richmond high street had turned into paving stones and boxes full of ribbon and her aunts  did you say you lived in the country when you were a child she asked  crude as her manners seemed to him richard was flattered there could be no doubt that her interest was genuine  i did he smiled  and what happened she asked or do i ask too many questions  im flattered i assure you butlet me seewhat happened well riding lessons sisters there was an enchanted rubbish heap i remember where all kinds of queer things happened odd what things impress children i can remember the look of the place to this day its a fallacy to think that children are happy theyre not theyre unhappy ive never suffered so much as i did when i was a child  why she asked  i didnt get on well with my father said richard shortly he was a very able man but hard wellit makes one determined not to sin in that way oneself children never forget injustice they forgive heaps of things grownup people mind but that sin is the unpardonable sin mind youi daresay i was a difficult child to manage but when i think what i was ready to give no i was more sinned against than sinning and then i went to school where i did very fairly well and and then as i say my father sent me to both universities    dyou know miss vinrace youve made me think how little after all one can tell anybody about ones life here i sit there you sit both i doubt not chockfull of the most interesting experiences ideas emotions yet how communicate ive told you what every second person you meet might tell you  i dont think so she said its the way of saying things isnt it not the things  true said richard perfectly true he paused when i look back over my lifeim fortytwowhat are the great facts that stand out what were the revelations if i may call them so the misery of the poor and he hesitated and pitched over love  upon that word he lowered his voice it was a word that seemed to unveil the skies for rachel  its an odd thing to say to a young lady he continued but have you any idea whatwhat i mean by that no of course not i dont use the word in a conventional sense i use it as young men use it girls are kept very ignorant arent they perhaps its wiseperhapsyou dont know  he spoke as if he had lost consciousness of what he was saying  no i dont she said scarcely speaking above her breath  warships dick over there look clarissa released from mr grice appreciative of all his seaweeds skimmed towards them gesticulating  she had sighted two sinister grey vessels low in the water and bald as bone one closely following the other with the look of eyeless beasts seeking their prey consciousness returned to richard instantly  by george he exclaimed and stood shielding his eyes  ours dick said clarissa  the mediterranean fleet he answered  the euphrosyne was slowly dipping her flag richard raised his hat convulsively clarissa squeezed rachels hand  arent you glad to be english she said  the warships drew past casting a curious effect of discipline and sadness upon the waters and it was not until they were again invisible that people spoke to each other naturally at lunch the talk was all of valour and death and the magnificent qualities of british admirals clarissa quoted one poet willoughby quoted another life on board a manofwar was splendid so they agreed and sailors whenever one met them were quite especially nice and simple  this being so no one liked it when helen remarked that it seemed to her as wrong to keep sailors as to keep a zoo and that as for dying on a battlefield surely it was time we ceased to praise courageor to write bad poetry about it snarled pepper  but helen was really wondering why rachel sitting silent looked so queer and flushed      chapter v   she was not able to follow up her observations however or to come to any conclusion for by one of those accidents which are liable to happen at sea the whole course of their lives was now put out of order  even at tea the floor rose beneath their feet and pitched too low again and at dinner the ship seemed to groan and strain as though a lash were descending she who had been a broadbacked drayhorse upon whose hindquarters pierrots might waltz became a colt in a field the plates slanted away from the knives and mrs dalloways face blanched for a second as she helped herself and saw the potatoes roll this way and that willoughby of course extolled the virtues of his ship and quoted what had been said of her by experts and distinguished passengers for he loved his own possessions still dinner was uneasy and directly the ladies were alone clarissa owned that she would be better off in bed and went smiling bravely  next morning the storm was on them and no politeness could ignore it mrs dalloway stayed in her room richard faced three meals eating valiantly at each but at the third certain glazed asparagus swimming in oil finally conquered him  that beats me he said and withdrew  now we are alone once more remarked william pepper looking round the table but no one was ready to engage him in talk and the meal ended in silence  on the following day they metbut as flying leaves meet in the air sick they were not but the wind propelled them hastily into rooms violently downstairs they passed each other gasping on deck they shouted across tables they wore fur coats and helen was never seen without a bandanna on her head for comfort they retreated to their cabins where with tightly wedged feet they let the ship bounce and tumble their sensations were the sensations of potatoes in a sack on a galloping horse the world outside was merely a violent grey tumult for two days they had a perfect rest from their old emotions rachel had just enough consciousness to suppose herself a donkey on the summit of a moor in a hailstorm with its coat blown into furrows then she became a wizened tree perpetually driven back by the salt atlantic gale  helen on the other hand staggered to mrs dalloways door knocked could not be heard for the slamming of doors and the battering of wind and entered  there were basins of course mrs dalloway lay halfraised on a pillow and did not open her eyes then she murmured oh dick is that you  helen shoutedfor she was thrown against the washstandhow are you  clarissa opened one eye it gave her an incredibly dissipated appearance awful she gasped her lips were white inside  planting her feet wide helen contrived to pour champagne into a tumbler with a toothbrush in it  champagne she said  theres a toothbrush in it murmured clarissa and smiled it might have been the contortion of one weeping she drank  disgusting she whispered indicating the basins relics of humour still played over her face like moonshine  want more helen shouted speech was again beyond clarissas reach the wind laid the ship shivering on her side pale agonies crossed mrs dalloway in waves when the curtains flapped grey lights puffed across her between the spasms of the storm helen made the curtain fast shook the pillows stretched the bedclothes and smoothed the hot nostrils and forehead with cold scent  you are good clarissa gasped horrid mess  she was trying to apologise for white underclothes fallen and scattered on the floor for one second she opened a single eye and saw that the room was tidy  thats nice she gasped  helen left her far far away she knew that she felt a kind of liking for mrs dalloway she could not help respecting her spirit and her desire even in the throes of sickness for a tidy bedroom her petticoats however rose above her knees  quite suddenly the storm relaxed its grasp it happened at tea the expected paroxysm of the blast gave out just as it reached its climax and dwindled away and the ship instead of taking the usual plunge went steadily the monotonous order of plunging and rising roaring and relaxing was interfered with and every one at table looked up and felt something loosen within them the strain was slackened and human feelings began to peep again as they do when daylight shows at the end of a tunnel  try a turn with me ridley called across to rachel  foolish cried helen but they went stumbling up the ladder choked by the wind their spirits rose with a rush for on the skirts of all the grey tumult was a misty spot of gold instantly the world dropped into shape they were no longer atoms flying in the void but people riding a triumphant ship on the back of the sea wind and space were banished the world floated like an apple in a tub and the mind of man which had been unmoored also once more attached itself to the old beliefs  having scrambled twice round the ship and received many sound cuffs from the wind they saw a sailors face positively shine golden they looked and beheld a complete yellow circle of sun next minute it was traversed by sailing stands of cloud and then completely hidden by breakfast the next morning however the sky was swept clean the waves although steep were blue and after their view of the strange underworld inhabited by phantoms people began to live among teapots and loaves of bread with greater zest than ever  richard and clarissa however still remained on the borderland she did not attempt to sit up her husband stood on his feet contemplated his waistcoat and trousers shook his head and then lay down again the inside of his brain was still rising and falling like the sea on the stage at four oclock he woke from sleep and saw the sunlight make a vivid angle across the red plush curtains and the grey tweed trousers the ordinary world outside slid into his mind and by the time he was dressed he was an english gentleman again  he stood beside his wife she pulled him down to her by the lapel of his coat kissed him and held him fast for a minute  go and get a breath of air dick she said you look quite washed out    how nice you smell    and be polite to that woman she was so kind to me  thereupon mrs dalloway turned to the cool side of her pillow terribly flattened but still invincible  richard found helen talking to her brotherinlaw over two dishes of yellow cake and smooth bread and butter  you look very ill she exclaimed on seeing him come and have some tea  he remarked that the hands that moved about the cups were beautiful  i hear youve been very good to my wife he said shes had an awful time of it you came in and fed her with champagne were you among the saved yourself  i oh i havent been sick for twenty yearsseasick i mean  there are three stages of convalescence i always say broke in the hearty voice of willoughby the milk stage the breadandbutter stage and the roastbeef stage i should say you were at the breadandbutter stage he handed him the plate  now i should advise a hearty tea then a brisk walk on deck and by dinnertime youll be clamouring for beef eh he went off laughing excusing himself on the score of business  what a splendid fellow he is said richard always keen on something  yes said helen hes always been like that  this is a great undertaking of his richard continued its a business that wont stop with ships i should say we shall see him in parliament or im much mistaken hes the kind of man we want in parliamentthe man who has done things  but helen was not much interested in her brotherinlaw  i expect your heads aching isnt it she asked pouring a fresh cup  well it is said richard its humiliating to find what a slave one is to ones body in this world dyou know i can never work without a kettle on the hob as often as not i dont drink tea but i must feel that i can if i want to  thats very bad for you said helen  it shortens ones life but im afraid mrs ambrose we politicians must make up our minds to that at the outset weve got to burn the candle at both ends or  youve cooked your goose said helen brightly  we cant make you take us seriously mrs ambrose he protested may i ask how youve spent your time readingphilosophy he saw the black book metaphysics and fishing he exclaimed if i had to live again i believe i should devote myself to one or the other he began turning the pages  good then is indefinable he read out how jolly to think thats going on still so far as i know there is only one ethical writer professor henry sidgwick who has clearly recognised and stated this fact thats just the kind of thing we used to talk about when we were boys i can remember arguing until five in the morning with duffynow secretary for indiapacing round and round those cloisters until we decided it was too late to go to bed and we went for a ride instead whether we ever came to any conclusionthats another matter still its the arguing that counts its things like that that stand out in life nothings been quite so vivid since its the philosophers its the scholars he continued theyre the people who pass the torch who keep the light burning by which we live being a politician doesnt necessarily blind one to that mrs ambrose  no why should it said helen but can you remember if your wife takes sugar  she lifted the tray and went off with it to mrs dalloway  richard twisted a muffler twice round his throat and struggled up on deck his body which had grown white and tender in a dark room tingled all over in the fresh air he felt himself a man undoubtedly in the prime of life pride glowed in his eye as he let the wind buffet him and stood firm with his head slightly lowered he sheered round corners strode uphill and met the blast there was a collision for a second he could not see what the body was he had run into sorry sorry it was rachel who apologised they both laughed too much blown about to speak she drove open the door of her room and stepped into its calm in order to speak to her it was necessary that richard should follow they stood in a whirlpool of wind papers began flying round in circles the door crashed to and they tumbled laughing into chairs richard sat upon bach  my word what a tempest he exclaimed  fine isnt it said rachel certainly the struggle and wind had given her a decision she lacked red was in her cheeks and her hair was down  oh what fun he cried what am i sitting on is this your room how jolly theresit there she commanded cowper slid once more  how jolly to meet again said richard it seems an age cowpers letters    bach    wuthering heights    is this where you meditate on the world and then come out and pose poor politicians with questions in the intervals of seasickness ive thought a lot of our talk i assure you you made me think  i made you think but why  what solitary icebergs we are miss vinrace how little we can communicate there are lots of things i should like to tell you aboutto hear your opinion of have you ever read burke  burke she repeated who was burke  no well then i shall make a point of sending you a copy the speech on the french revolutionthe american rebellion which shall it be i wonder he noted something in his pocketbook and then you must write and tell me what you think of it this reticencethis isolationthats whats the matter with modern life now tell me about yourself what are your interests and occupations i should imagine that you were a person with very strong interests of course you are good god when i think of the age we live in with its opportunities and possibilities the mass of things to be done and enjoyedwhy havent we ten lives instead of one but about yourself  you see im a woman said rachel  i knowi know said richard throwing his head back and drawing his fingers across his eyes  how strange to be a woman a young and beautiful woman he continued sententiously has the whole world at her feet thats true miss vinrace you have an inestimable powerfor good or for evil what couldnt you do he broke off  what asked rachel  you have beauty he said the ship lurched rachel fell slightly forward richard took her in his arms and kissed her holding her tight he kissed her passionately so that she felt the hardness of his body and the roughness of his cheek printed upon hers she fell back in her chair with tremendous beats of the heart each of which sent black waves across her eyes he clasped his forehead in his hands  you tempt me he said the tone of his voice was terrifying he seemed choked in fright they were both trembling rachel stood up and went her head was cold her knees shaking and the physical pain of the emotion was so great that she could only keep herself moving above the great leaps of her heart she leant upon the rail of the ship and gradually ceased to feel for a chill of body and mind crept over her far out between the waves little black and white seabirds were riding rising and falling with smooth and graceful movements in the hollows of the waves they seemed singularly detached and unconcerned  youre peaceful she said she became peaceful too at the same time possessed with a strange exultation life seemed to hold infinite possibilities she had never guessed at she leant upon the rail and looked over the troubled grey waters where the sunlight was fitfully scattered upon the crests of the waves until she was cold and absolutely calm again nevertheless something wonderful had happened  at dinner however she did not feel exalted but merely uncomfortable as if she and richard had seen something together which is hidden in ordinary life so that they did not like to look at each other richard slid his eyes over her uneasily once and never looked at her again formal platitudes were manufactured with effort but willoughby was kindled  beef for mr dalloway he shouted come nowafter that walk youre at the beef stage dalloway  wonderful masculine stories followed about bright and disraeli and coalition governments wonderful stories which made the people at the dinnertable seem featureless and small after dinner sitting alone with rachel under the great swinging lamp helen was struck by her pallor it once more occurred to her that there was something strange in the girls behaviour  you look tired are you tired she asked  not tired said rachel oh yes i suppose i am tired  helen advised bed and she went not seeing richard again she must have been very tired for she fell asleep at once but after an hour or two of dreamless sleep she dreamt she dreamt that she was walking down a long tunnel which grew so narrow by degrees that she could touch the damp bricks on either side at length the tunnel opened and became a vault she found herself trapped in it bricks meeting her wherever she turned alone with a little deformed man who squatted on the floor gibbering with long nails his face was pitted and like the face of an animal the wall behind him oozed with damp which collected into drops and slid down still and cold as death she lay not daring to move until she broke the agony by tossing herself across the bed and woke crying oh  light showed her the familiar things her clothes fallen off the chair the water jug gleaming white but the horror did not go at once she felt herself pursued so that she got up and actually locked her door a voice moaned for her eyes desired her all night long barbarian men harassed the ship they came scuffling down the passages and stopped to snuffle at her door she could not sleep again      chapter vi   thats the tragedy of lifeas i always say said mrs dalloway beginning things and having to end them still im not going to let this end if youre willing it was the morning the sea was calm and the ship once again was anchored not far from another shore  she was dressed in her long fur cloak with the veils wound around her head and once more the rich boxes stood on top of each other so that the scene of a few days back seemed to be repeated  dyou suppose we shall ever meet in london said ridley ironically youll have forgotten all about me by the time you step out there  he pointed to the shore of the little bay where they could now see the separate trees with moving branches  how horrid you are she laughed rachels coming to see me anyhowthe instant you get back she said pressing rachels arm nowyouve no excuse  with a silver pencil she wrote her name and address on the flyleaf of persuasion and gave the book to rachel sailors were shouldering the luggage and people were beginning to congregate there were captain cobbold mr grice willoughby helen and an obscure grateful man in a blue jersey  oh its time said clarissa well goodbye i do like you she murmured as she kissed rachel people in the way made it unnecessary for richard to shake rachel by the hand he managed to look at her very stiffly for a second before he followed his wife down the ships side  the boat separating from the vessel made off towards the land and for some minutes helen ridley and rachel leant over the rail watching once mrs dalloway turned and waved but the boat steadily grew smaller and smaller until it ceased to rise and fall and nothing could be seen save two resolute backs  well thats over said ridley after a long silence we shall never see them again he added turning to go to his books a feeling of emptiness and melancholy came over them they knew in their hearts that it was over and that they had parted for ever and the knowledge filled them with far greater depression than the length of their acquaintance seemed to justify even as the boat pulled away they could feel other sights and sounds beginning to take the place of the dalloways and the feeling was so unpleasant that they tried to resist it for so too would they be forgotten  in much the same way as mrs chailey downstairs was sweeping the withered roseleaves off the dressingtable so helen was anxious to make things straight again after the visitors had gone rachels obvious languor and listlessness made her an easy prey and indeed helen had devised a kind of trap that something had happened she now felt pretty certain moreover she had come to think that they had been strangers long enough she wished to know what the girl was like partly of course because rachel showed no disposition to be known so as they turned from the rail she said  come and talk to me instead of practising and led the way to the sheltered side where the deckchairs were stretched in the sun rachel followed her indifferently her mind was absorbed by richard by the extreme strangeness of what had happened and by a thousand feelings of which she had not been conscious before she made scarcely any attempt to listen to what helen was saying as helen indulged in commonplaces to begin with while mrs ambrose arranged her embroidery sucked her silk and threaded her needle she lay back gazing at the horizon  did you like those people helen asked her casually  yes she replied blankly  you talked to him didnt you  she said nothing for a minute  he kissed me she said without any change of tone  helen started looked at her but could not make out what she felt  mmmyes she said after a pause i thought he was that kind of man  what kind of man said rachel  pompous and sentimental  i like him said rachel  so you really didnt mind  for the first time since helen had known her rachels eyes lit up brightly  i did mind she said vehemently i dreamt i couldnt sleep  tell me what happened said helen she had to keep her lips from twitching as she listened to rachels story it was poured out abruptly with great seriousness and no sense of humour  we talked about politics he told me what he had done for the poor somewhere i asked him all sorts of questions he told me about his own life the day before yesterday after the storm he came in to see me it happened then quite suddenly he kissed me i dont know why as she spoke she grew flushed i was a good deal excited she continued but i didnt mind till afterwards when she paused and saw the figure of the bloated little man againi became terrified  from the look in her eyes it was evident she was again terrified helen was really at a loss what to say from the little she knew of rachels upbringing she supposed that she had been kept entirely ignorant as to the relations of men with women with a shyness which she felt with women and not with men she did not like to explain simply what these are therefore she took the other course and belittled the whole affair  oh well she said he was a silly creature and if i were you id think no more about it  no said rachel sitting bolt upright i shant do that i shall think about it all day and all night until i find out exactly what it does mean  dont you ever read helen asked tentatively  cowpers lettersthat kind of thing father gets them for me or my aunts  helen could hardly restrain herself from saying out loud what she thought of a man who brought up his daughter so that at the age of twentyfour she scarcely knew that men desired women and was terrified by a kiss she had good reason to fear that rachel had made herself incredibly ridiculous  you dont know many men she asked  mr pepper said rachel ironically  so no ones ever wanted to marry you  no she answered ingenuously  helen reflected that as from what she had said rachel certainly would think these things out it might be as well to help her  you oughtnt to be frightened she said its the most natural thing in the world men will want to kiss you just as theyll want to marry you the pity is to get things out of proportion its like noticing the noises people make when they eat or men spitting or in short any small thing that gets on ones nerves  rachel seemed to be inattentive to these remarks  tell me she said suddenly what are those women in piccadilly  in picadilly they are prostituted said helen  it is terrifyingit is disgusting rachel asserted as if she included helen in the hatred  it is said helen but  i did like him rachel mused as if speaking to herself i wanted to talk to him i wanted to know what hed done the women in lancashire  it seemed to her as she recalled their talk that there was something lovable about richard good in their attempted friendship and strangely piteous in the way they had parted  the softening of her mood was apparent to helen  you see she said you must take things as they are and if you want friendship with men you must run risks personally she continued breaking into a smile i think its worth it i dont mind being kissed im rather jealous i believe that mr dalloway kissed you and didnt kiss me though she added he bored me considerably  but rachel did not return the smile or dismiss the whole affair as helen meant her to her mind was working very quickly inconsistently and painfully helens words hewed down great blocks which had stood there always and the light which came in was cold after sitting for a time with fixed eyes she burst out  so thats why i cant walk alone  by this new light she saw her life for the first time a creeping hedgedin thing driven cautiously between high walls here turned aside there plunged in darkness made dull and crippled for everher life that was the only chance she hada thousand words and actions became plain to her  because men are brutes i hate men she exclaimed  i thought you said you liked him said helen  i liked him and i liked being kissed she answered as if that only added more difficulties to her problem  helen was surprised to see how genuine both shock and problem were but she could think of no way of easing the difficulty except by going on talking she wanted to make her niece talk and so to understand why this rather dull kindly plausible politician had made so deep an impression on her for surely at the age of twentyfour this was not natural  and did you like mrs dalloway too she asked  as she spoke she saw rachel redden for she remembered silly things she had said and also it occurred to her that she treated this exquisite woman rather badly for mrs dalloway had said that she loved her husband  she was quite nice but a thimblepated creature helen continued i never heard such nonsense chitterchatterchitterchatterfish and the greek alphabetnever listened to a word any one saidchockfull of idiotic theories about the way to bring up childrenid far rather talk to him any day he was pompous but he did at least understand what was said to him  the glamour insensibly faded a little both from richard and clarissa they had not been so wonderful after all then in the eyes of a mature person  its very difficult to know what people are like rachel remarked and helen saw with pleasure that she spoke more naturally i suppose i was taken in  there was little doubt about that according to helen but she restrained herself and said aloud  one has to make experiments  and they were nice said rachel they were extraordinarily interesting she tried to recall the image of the world as a live thing that richard had given her with drains like nerves and bad houses like patches of diseased skin she recalled his watchwordsunityimagination and saw again the bubbles meeting in her teacup as he spoke of sisters and canaries boyhood and his father her small world becoming wonderfully enlarged  but all people dont seem to you equally interesting do they asked mrs ambrose  rachel explained that most people had hitherto been symbols but that when they talked to one they ceased to be symbols and becamei could listen to them for ever she exclaimed she then jumped up disappeared downstairs for a minute and came back with a fat red book  whos who she said laying it upon helens knee and turning the pages it gives short lives of peoplefor instance sir roland beal born 1852 parents from moffatt educated at rugby passed first into re married 1878 the daughter of t fishwick served in the bechuanaland expedition 188485 honourably mentioned clubs united service naval and military recreations an enthusiastic curler  sitting on the deck at helens feet she went on turning the pages and reading biographies of bankers writers clergymen sailors surgeons judges professors statesmen editors philanthropists merchants and actresses what clubs they belonged to where they lived what games they played and how many acres they owned  she became absorbed in the book  helen meanwhile stitched at her embroidery and thought over the things they had said her conclusion was that she would very much like to show her niece if it were possible how to live or as she put it how to be a reasonable person she thought that there must be something wrong in this confusion between politics and kissing politicians and that an elder person ought to be able to help  i quite agree she said that people are very interesting only rachel putting her finger between the pages looked up enquiringly  only i think you ought to discriminate she ended its a pity to be intimate with people who arewell rather secondrate like the dalloways and to find it out later  but how does one know rachel asked  i really cant tell you replied helen candidly after a moments thought youll have to find out for yourself but try andwhy dont you call me helen she added aunts a horrid name i never liked my aunts  i should like to call you helen rachel answered  dyou think me very unsympathetic  rachel reviewed the points which helen had certainly failed to understand they arose chiefly from the difference of nearly twenty years in age between them which made mrs ambrose appear too humorous and cool in a matter of such moment  no she said some things you dont understand of course  of course helen agreed so now you can go ahead and be a person on your own account she added  the vision of her own personality of herself as a real everlasting thing different from anything else unmergeable like the sea or the wind flashed into rachels mind and she became profoundly excited at the thought of living  i can by mmmyself she stammered in spite of you in spite of the dalloways and mr pepper and father and my aunts in spite of these she swept her hand across a whole page of statesmen and soldiers  in spite of them all said helen gravely she then put down her needle and explained a plan which had come into her head as they talked instead of wandering on down the amazons until she reached some sulphurous tropical port where one had to lie within doors all day beating off insects with a fan the sensible thing to do surely was to spend the season with them in their villa by the seaside where among other advantages mrs ambrose herself would be at hand toafter all rachel she broke off its silly to pretend that because theres twenty years difference between us we therefore cant talk to each other like human beings  no because we like each other said rachel  yes mrs ambrose agreed  that fact together with other facts had been made clear by their twenty minutes talk although how they had come to these conclusions they could not have said  however they were come by they were sufficiently serious to send mrs ambrose a day or two later in search of her brotherinlaw she found him sitting in his room working applying a stout blue pencil authoritatively to bundles of filmy paper papers lay to left and to right of him there were great envelopes so gorged with papers that they spilt papers on to the table above him hung a photograph of a womans head the need of sitting absolutely still before a cockney photographer had given her lips a queer little pucker and her eyes for the same reason looked as though she thought the whole situation ridiculous nevertheless it was the head of an individual and interesting woman who would no doubt have turned and laughed at willoughby if she could have caught his eye but when he looked up at her he sighed profoundly in his mind this work of his the great factories at hull which showed like mountains at night the ships that crossed the ocean punctually the schemes for combining this and that and building up a solid mass of industry was all an offering to her he laid his success at her feet and was always thinking how to educate his daughter so that theresa might be glad he was a very ambitious man and although he had not been particularly kind to her while she lived as helen thought he now believed that she watched him from heaven and inspired what was good in him  mrs ambrose apologised for the interruption and asked whether she might speak to him about a plan of hers would he consent to leave his daughter with them when they landed instead of taking her on up the amazons  we would take great care of her she added and we should really like it  willoughby looked very grave and carefully laid aside his papers  shes a good girl he said at length there is a likenesshe nodded his head at the photograph of theresa and sighed helen looked at theresa pursing up her lips before the cockney photographer it suggested her in an absurd human way and she felt an intense desire to share some joke  shes the only thing thats left to me sighed willoughby we go on year after year without talking about these things he broke off but its better so only lifes very hard  helen was sorry for him and patted him on the shoulder but she felt uncomfortable when her brotherinlaw expressed his feelings and took refuge in praising rachel and explaining why she thought her plan might be a good one  true said willoughby when she had done the social conditions are bound to be primitive i should be out a good deal i agreed because she wished it and of course i have complete confidence in you    you see helen he continued becoming confidential i want to bring her up as her mother would have wished i dont hold with these modern viewsany more than you do eh shes a nice quiet girl devoted to her musica little less of that would do no harm still its kept her happy and we lead a very quiet life at richmond i should like her to begin to see more people i want to take her about with me when i get home ive half a mind to rent a house in london leaving my sisters at richmond and take her to see one or two people whod be kind to her for my sake im beginning to realise he continued stretching himself out that all this is tending to parliament helen its the only way to get things done as one wants them done i talked to dalloway about it in that case of course i should want rachel to be able to take more part in things a certain amount of entertaining would be necessarydinners an occasional evening party ones constituents like to be fed i believe in all these ways rachel could be of great help to me so he wound up i should be very glad if we arrange this visit which must be upon a business footing mind if you could see your way to helping my girl bringing her outshes a little shy nowmaking a woman of her the kind of woman her mother would have liked her to be he ended jerking his head at the photograph  willoughbys selfishness though consistent as helen saw with real affection for his daughter made her determined to have the girl to stay with her even if she had to promise a complete course of instruction in the feminine graces she could not help laughing at the notion of itrachel a tory hostessand marvelling as she left him at the astonishing ignorance of a father  rachel when consulted showed less enthusiasm than helen could have wished one moment she was eager the next doubtful visions of a great river now blue now yellow in the tropical sun and crossed by bright birds now white in the moon now deep in shade with moving trees and canoes sliding out from the tangled banks beset her helen promised a river then she did not want to leave her father that feeling seemed genuine too but in the end helen prevailed although when she had won her case she was beset by doubts and more than once regretted the impulse which had entangled her with the fortunes of another human being      chapter vii   from a distance the euphrosyne looked very small glasses were turned upon her from the decks of great liners and she was pronounced a tramp a cargoboat or one of those wretched little passenger steamers where people rolled about among the cattle on deck the insectlike figures of dalloways ambroses and vinraces were also derided both from the extreme smallness of their persons and the doubt which only strong glasses could dispel as to whether they were really live creatures or only lumps on the rigging mr pepper with all his learning had been mistaken for a cormorant and then as unjustly transformed into a cow at night indeed when the waltzes were swinging in the saloon and gifted passengers reciting the little shipshrunk to a few beads of light out among the dark waves and one high in air upon the mastheadseemed something mysterious and impressive to heated partners resting from the dance she became a ship passing in the nightan emblem of the loneliness of human life an occasion for queer confidences and sudden appeals for sympathy  on and on she went by day and by night following her path until one morning broke and showed the land losing its shadowlike appearance it became first cleft and mountainous next coloured grey and purple next scattered with white blocks which gradually separated themselves and then as the progress of the ship acted upon the view like a fieldglass of increasing power became streets of houses by nine oclock the euphrosyne had taken up her position in the middle of a great bay she dropped her anchor immediately as if she were a recumbent giant requiring examination small boats came swarming about her she rang with cries men jumped on to her her deck was thumped by feet the lonely little island was invaded from all quarters at once and after four weeks of silence it was bewildering to hear human speech mrs ambrose alone heeded none of this stir she was pale with suspense while the boat with mail bags was making towards them absorbed in her letters she did not notice that she had left the euphrosyne and felt no sadness when the ship lifted up her voice and bellowed thrice like a cow separated from its calf  the children are well she exclaimed mr pepper who sat opposite with a great mound of bag and rug upon his knees said gratifying rachel to whom the end of the voyage meant a complete change of perspective was too much bewildered by the approach of the shore to realise what children were well or why it was gratifying helen went on reading  moving very slowly and rearing absurdly high over each wave the little boat was now approaching a white crescent of sand behind this was a deep green valley with distinct hills on either side on the slope of the righthand hill white houses with brown roofs were settled like nesting seabirds and at intervals cypresses striped the hill with black bars mountains whose sides were flushed with red but whose crowns were bald rose as a pinnacle halfconcealing another pinnacle behind it the hour being still early the whole view was exquisitely light and airy the blues and greens of sky and tree were intense but not sultry as they drew nearer and could distinguish details the effect of the earth with its minute objects and colours and different forms of life was overwhelming after four weeks of the sea and kept them silent  three hundred years odd said mr pepper meditatively at length  as nobody said what he merely extracted a bottle and swallowed a pill the piece of information that died within him was to the effect that three hundred years ago five elizabethan barques had anchored where the euphrosyne now floated halfdrawn up upon the beach lay an equal number of spanish galleons unmanned for the country was still a virgin land behind a veil slipping across the water the english sailors bore away bars of silver bales of linen timbers of cedar wood golden crucifixes knobbed with emeralds when the spaniards came down from their drinking a fight ensued the two parties churning up the sand and driving each other into the surf the spaniards bloated with fine living upon the fruits of the miraculous land fell in heaps but the hardy englishmen tawny with seavoyaging hairy for lack of razors with muscles like wire fangs greedy for flesh and fingers itching for gold despatched the wounded drove the dying into the sea and soon reduced the natives to a state of superstitious wonderment here a settlement was made women were imported children grew all seemed to favour the expansion of the british empire and had there been men like richard dalloway in the time of charles the first the map would undoubtedly be red where it is now an odious green but it must be supposed that the political mind of that age lacked imagination and merely for want of a few thousand pounds and a few thousand men the spark died that should have been a conflagration from the interior came indians with subtle poisons naked bodies and painted idols from the sea came vengeful spaniards and rapacious portuguese exposed to all these enemies though the climate proved wonderfully kind and the earth abundant the english dwindled away and all but disappeared somewhere about the middle of the seventeenth century a single sloop watched its season and slipped out by night bearing within it all that was left of the great british colony a few men a few women and perhaps a dozen dusky children english history then denies all knowledge of the place owing to one cause and another civilisation shifted its centre to a spot some four or five hundred miles to the south and today santa marina is not much larger than it was three hundred years ago in population it is a happy compromise for portuguese fathers wed indian mothers and their children intermarry with the spanish although they get their ploughs from manchester they make their coats from their own sheep their silk from their own worms and their furniture from their own cedar trees so that in arts and industries the place is still much where it was in elizabethan days  the reasons which had drawn the english across the sea to found a small colony within the last ten years are not so easily described and will never perhaps be recorded in history books granted facility of travel peace good trade and so on there was besides a kind of dissatisfaction among the english with the older countries and the enormous accumulations of carved stone stained glass and rich brown painting which they offered to the tourist the movement in search of something new was of course infinitely small affecting only a handful of welltodo people it began by a few schoolmasters serving their passage out to south america as the pursers of tramp steamers they returned in time for the summer term when their stories of the splendours and hardships of life at sea the humours of seacaptains the wonders of night and dawn and the marvels of the place delighted outsiders and sometimes found their way into print the country itself taxed all their powers of description for they said it was much bigger than italy and really nobler than greece again they declared that the natives were strangely beautiful very big in stature dark passionate and quick to seize the knife the place seemed new and full of new forms of beauty in proof of which they showed handkerchiefs which the women had worn round their heads and primitive carvings coloured bright greens and blues somehow or other as fashions do the fashion spread an old monastery was quickly turned into a hotel while a famous line of steamships altered its route for the convenience of passengers  oddly enough it happened that the least satisfactory of helen ambroses brothers had been sent out years before to make his fortune at any rate to keep clear of racehorses in the very spot which had now become so popular often leaning upon the column in the verandah he had watched the english ships with english schoolmasters for pursers steaming into the bay having at length earned enough to take a holiday and being sick of the place he proposed to put his villa on the slope of the mountain at his sisters disposal she too had been a little stirred by the talk of a new world where there was always sun and never a fog which went on around her and the chance when they were planning where to spend the winter out of england seemed too good to be missed for these reasons she determined to accept willoughbys offer of free passages on his ship to place the children with their grandparents and to do the thing thoroughly while she was about it  taking seats in a carriage drawn by longtailed horses with pheasants feathers erect between their ears the ambroses mr pepper and rachel rattled out of the harbour the day increased in heat as they drove up the hill the road passed through the town where men seemed to be beating brass and crying water where the passage was blocked by mules and cleared by whips and curses where the women walked barefoot their heads balancing baskets and cripples hastily displayed mutilated members it issued among steep green fields not so green but that the earth showed through great trees now shaded all but the centre of the road and a mountain stream so shallow and so swift that it plaited itself into strands as it ran raced along the edge higher they went until ridley and rachel walked behind next they turned along a lane scattered with stones where mr pepper raised his stick and silently indicated a shrub bearing among sparse leaves a voluminous purple blossom and at a rickety canter the last stage of the way was accomplished  the villa was a roomy white house which as is the case with most continental houses looked to an english eye frail ramshackle and absurdly frivolous more like a pagoda in a teagarden than a place where one slept the garden called urgently for the services of gardener bushes waved their branches across the paths and the blades of grass with spaces of earth between them could be counted in the circular piece of ground in front of the verandah were two cracked vases from which red flowers drooped with a stone fountain between them now parched in the sun the circular garden led to a long garden where the gardeners shears had scarcely been unless now and then when he cut a bough of blossom for his beloved a few tall trees shaded it and round bushes with waxlike flowers mobbed their heads together in a row a garden smoothly laid with turf divided by thick hedges with raised beds of bright flowers such as we keep within walls in england would have been out of place upon the side of this bare hill there was no ugliness to shut out and the villa looked straight across the shoulder of a slope ribbed with olive trees to the sea  the indecency of the whole place struck mrs chailey forcibly there were no blinds to shut out the sun nor was there any furniture to speak of for the sun to spoil standing in the bare stone hall and surveying a staircase of superb breadth but cracked and carpetless she further ventured the opinion that there were rats as large as terriers at home and that if one put ones foot down with any force one would come through the floor as for hot waterat this point her investigations left her speechless  poor creature she murmured to the sallow spanish servantgirl who came out with the pigs and hens to receive them no wonder you hardly look like a human being maria accepted the compliment with an exquisite spanish grace in chaileys opinion they would have done better to stay on board an english ship but none knew better than she that her duty commanded her to stay  when they were settled in and in train to find daily occupation there was some speculation as to the reasons which induced mr pepper to stay taking up his lodging in the ambroses house efforts had been made for some days before landing to impress upon him the advantages of the amazons  that great stream helen would begin gazing as if she saw a visionary cascade ive a good mind to go with you myself willoughbyonly i cant think of the sunsets and the moonrisesi believe the colours are unimaginable  there are wild peacocks rachel hazarded  and marvellous creatures in the water helen asserted  one might discover a new reptile rachel continued  theres certain to be a revolution im told helen urged  the effect of these subterfuges was a little dashed by ridley who after regarding pepper for some moments sighed aloud poor fellow and inwardly speculated upon the unkindness of women  he stayed however in apparent contentment for six days playing with a microscope and a notebook in one of the many sparsely furnished sittingrooms but on the evening of the seventh day as they sat at dinner he appeared more restless than usual the dinnertable was set between two long windows which were left uncurtained by helens orders darkness fell as sharply as a knife in this climate and the town then sprang out in circles and lines of bright dots beneath them buildings which never showed by day showed by night and the sea flowed right over the land judging by the moving lights of the steamers the sight fulfilled the same purpose as an orchestra in a london restaurant and silence had its setting william pepper observed it for some time he put on his spectacles to contemplate the scene  ive identified the big block to the left he observed and pointed with his fork at a square formed by several rows of lights  one should infer that they can cook vegetables he added  an hotel said helen  once a monastery said mr pepper  nothing more was said then but the day after mr pepper returned from a midday walk and stood silently before helen who was reading in the verandah  ive taken a room over there he said  youre not going she exclaimed  on the wholeyes he remarked no private cook can cook vegetables  knowing his dislike of questions which she to some extent shared helen asked no more still an uneasy suspicion lurked in her mind that william was hiding a wound she flushed to think that her words or her husbands or rachels had penetrated and stung she was halfmoved to cry stop william explain and would have returned to the subject at luncheon if william had not shown himself inscrutable and chill lifting fragments of salad on the point of his fork with the gesture of a man pronging seaweed detecting gravel suspecting germs  if you all die of typhoid i wont be responsible he snapped  if you die of dulness neither will i helen echoed in her heart  she reflected that she had never yet asked him whether he had been in love they had got further and further from that subject instead of drawing nearer to it and she could not help feeling it a relief when william pepper with all his knowledge his microscope his notebooks his genuine kindliness and good sense but a certain dryness of soul took his departure also she could not help feeling it sad that friendships should end thus although in this case to have the room empty was something of a comfort and she tried to console herself with the reflection that one never knows how far other people feel the things they might be supposed to feel      chapter viii   the next few months passed away as many years can pass away without definite events and yet if suddenly disturbed it would be seen that such months or years had a character unlike others the three months which had passed had brought them to the beginning of march the climate had kept its promise and the change of season from winter to spring had made very little difference so that helen who was sitting in the drawingroom with a pen in her hand could keep the windows open though a great fire of logs burnt on one side of her below the sea was still blue and the roofs still brown and white though the day was fading rapidly it was dusk in the room which large and empty at all times now appeared larger and emptier than usual her own figure as she sat writing with a pad on her knee shared the general effect of size and lack of detail for the flames which ran along the branches suddenly devouring little green tufts burnt intermittently and sent irregular illuminations across her face and the plaster walls there were no pictures on the walls but here and there boughs laden with heavypetalled flowers spread widely against them of the books fallen on the bare floor and heaped upon the large table it was only possible in this light to trace the outline  mrs ambrose was writing a very long letter beginning dear bernard it went on to describe what had been happening in the villa san gervasio during the past three months as for instance that they had had the british consul to dinner and had been taken over a spanish manofwar and had seen a great many processions and religious festivals which were so beautiful that mrs ambrose couldnt conceive why if people must have a religion they didnt all become roman catholics they had made several expeditions though none of any length it was worth coming if only for the sake of the flowering trees which grew wild quite near the house and the amazing colours of sea and earth the earth instead of being brown was red purple green you wont believe me she added there is no colour like it in england she adopted indeed a condescending tone towards that poor island which was now advancing chilly crocuses and nipped violets in nooks in copses in cosy corners tended by rosy old gardeners in mufflers who were always touching their hats and bobbing obsequiously she went on to deride the islanders themselves rumours of london all in a ferment over a general election had reached them even out here it seems incredible she went on that people should care whether asquith is in or austen chamberlin out and while you scream yourselves hoarse about politics you let the only people who are trying for something good starve or simply laugh at them when have you ever encouraged a living artist or bought his best work why are you all so ugly and so servile here the servants are human beings they talk to one as if they were equals as far as i can tell there are no aristocrats  perhaps it was the mention of aristocrats that reminded her of richard dalloway and rachel for she ran on with the same penful to describe her niece  its an odd fate that has put me in charge of a girl she wrote considering that i have never got on well with women or had much to do with them however i must retract some of the things that i have said against them if they were properly educated i dont see why they shouldnt be much the same as menas satisfactory i mean though of course very different the question is how should one educate them the present method seems to me abominable this girl though twentyfour had never heard that men desired women and until i explained it did not know how children were born her ignorance upon other matters as important here mrs ambroses letter may not be quoted    was complete it seems to me not merely foolish but criminal to bring people up like that let alone the suffering to them it explains why women are what they arethe wonder is theyre no worse i have taken it upon myself to enlighten her and now though still a good deal prejudiced and liable to exaggerate she is more or less a reasonable human being keeping them ignorant of course defeats its own object and when they begin to understand they take it all much too seriously my brotherinlaw really deserved a catastrophewhich he wont get i now pray for a young man to come to my help some one i mean who would talk to her openly and prove how absurd most of her ideas about life are unluckily such men seem almost as rare as the women the english colony certainly doesnt provide one artists merchants cultivated peoplethey are stupid conventional and flirtatious    she ceased and with her pen in her hand sat looking into the fire making the logs into caves and mountains for it had grown too dark to go on writing moreover the house began to stir as the hour of dinner approached she could hear the plates being chinked in the diningroom next door and chailey instructing the spanish girl where to put things down in vigorous english the bell rang she rose met ridley and rachel outside and they all went in to dinner  three months had made but little difference in the appearance either of ridley or rachel yet a keen observer might have thought that the girl was more definite and selfconfident in her manner than before her skin was brown her eyes certainly brighter and she attended to what was said as though she might be going to contradict it the meal began with the comfortable silence of people who are quite at their ease together then ridley leaning on his elbow and looking out of the window observed that it was a lovely night  yes said helen she added the seasons begun looking at the lights beneath them she asked maria in spanish whether the hotel was not filling up with visitors maria informed her with pride that there would come a time when it was positively difficult to buy eggsthe shopkeepers would not mind what prices they asked they would get them at any rate from the english  thats an english steamer in the bay said rachel looking at a triangle of lights below she came in early this morning  then we may hope for some letters and send ours back said helen  for some reason the mention of letters always made ridley groan and the rest of the meal passed in a brisk argument between husband and wife as to whether he was or was not wholly ignored by the entire civilised world  considering the last batch said helen you deserve beating you were asked to lecture you were offered a degree and some silly woman praised not only your books but your beautyshe said he was what shelley would have been if shelley had lived to fiftyfive and grown a beard really ridley i think youre the vainest man i know she ended rising from the table which i may tell you is saying a good deal  finding her letter lying before the fire she added a few lines to it and then announced that she was going to take the letters nowridley must bring hisand rachel  i hope youve written to your aunts its high time  the women put on cloaks and hats and after inviting ridley to come with them which he emphatically refused to do exclaiming that rachel he expected to be a fool but helen surely knew better they turned to go he stood over the fire gazing into the depths of the lookingglass and compressing his face into the likeness of a commander surveying a field of battle or a martyr watching the flames lick his toes rather than that of a secluded professor  helen laid hold of his beard  am i a fool she said  let me go helen  am i a fool she repeated  vile woman he exclaimed and kissed her  well leave you to your vanities she called back as they went out of the door  it was a beautiful evening still light enough to see a long way down the road though the stars were coming out the pillarbox was let into a high yellow wall where the lane met the road and having dropped the letters into it helen was for turning back  no no said rachel taking her by the wrist were going to see life you promised  seeing life was the phrase they used for their habit of strolling through the town after dark the social life of santa marina was carried on almost entirely by lamplight which the warmth of the nights and the scents culled from flowers made pleasant enough the young women with their hair magnificently swept in coils a red flower behind the ear sat on the doorsteps or issued out on to balconies while the young men ranged up and down beneath shouting up a greeting from time to time and stopping here and there to enter into amorous talk at the open windows merchants could be seen making up the days account and older women lifting jars from shelf to shelf the streets were full of people men for the most part who interchanged their views of the world as they walked or gathered round the winetables at the street corner where an old cripple was twanging his guitar strings while a poor girl cried her passionate song in the gutter the two englishwomen excited some friendly curiosity but no one molested them  helen sauntered on observing the different people in their shabby clothes who seemed so careless and so natural with satisfaction  just think of the mall tonight she exclaimed at length its the fifteenth of march perhaps theres a court she thought of the crowd waiting in the cold spring air to see the grand carriages go by its very cold if its not raining she said first there are men selling picture postcards then there are wretched little shopgirls with round bandboxes then there are bank clerks in tail coats and thenany number of dressmakers people from south kensington drive up in a hired fly officials have a pair of bays earls on the other hand are allowed one footman to stand up behind dukes have two royal dukesso i was toldhave three the king i suppose can have as many as he likes and the people believe in it  out here it seemed as though the people of england must be shaped in the body like the kings and queens knights and pawns of the chessboard so strange were their differences so marked and so implicitly believed in  they had to part in order to circumvent a crowd  they believe in god said rachel as they regained each other she meant that the people in the crowd believed in him for she remembered the crosses with bleeding plaster figures that stood where footpaths joined and the inexplicable mystery of a service in a roman catholic church  we shall never understand she sighed  they had walked some way and it was now night but they could see a large iron gate a little way farther down the road on their left  do you mean to go right up to the hotel helen asked  rachel gave the gate a push it swung open and seeing no one about and judging that nothing was private in this country they walked straight on an avenue of trees ran along the road which was completely straight the trees suddenly came to an end the road turned a corner and they found themselves confronted by a large square building they had come out upon the broad terrace which ran round the hotel and were only a few feet distant from the windows a row of long windows opened almost to the ground they were all of them uncurtained and all brilliantly lighted so that they could see everything inside each window revealed a different section of the life of the hotel they drew into one of the broad columns of shadow which separated the windows and gazed in they found themselves just outside the diningroom it was being swept a waiter was eating a bunch of grapes with his leg across the corner of a table next door was the kitchen where they were washing up white cooks were dipping their arms into cauldrons while the waiters made their meal voraciously off broken meats sopping up the gravy with bits of crumb moving on they became lost in a plantation of bushes and then suddenly found themselves outside the drawingroom where the ladies and gentlemen having dined well lay back in deep armchairs occasionally speaking or turning over the pages of magazines a thin woman was flourishing up and down the piano  what is a dahabeeyah charles the distinct voice of a widow seated in an armchair by the window asked her son  it was the end of the piece and his answer was lost in the general clearing of throats and tapping of knees  theyre all old in this room rachel whispered  creeping on they found that the next window revealed two men in shirtsleeves playing billiards with two young ladies  he pinched my arm the plump young woman cried as she missed her stroke  now you twono ragging the young man with the red face reproved them who was marking  take care or we shall be seen whispered helen plucking rachel by the arm incautiously her head had risen to the middle of the window  turning the corner they came to the largest room in the hotel which was supplied with four windows and was called the lounge although it was really a hall hung with armour and native embroideries furnished with divans and screens which shut off convenient corners the room was less formal than the others and was evidently the haunt of youth signor rodriguez whom they knew to be the manager of the hotel stood quite near them in the doorway surveying the scenethe gentlemen lounging in chairs the couples leaning over coffeecups the game of cards in the centre under profuse clusters of electric light he was congratulating himself upon the enterprise which had turned the refectory a cold stone room with pots on trestles into the most comfortable room in the house the hotel was very full and proved his wisdom in decreeing that no hotel can flourish without a lounge  the people were scattered about in couples or parties of four and either they were actually better acquainted or the informal room made their manners easier through the open window came an uneven humming sound like that which rises from a flock of sheep pent within hurdles at dusk the cardparty occupied the centre of the foreground  helen and rachel watched them play for some minutes without being able to distinguish a word helen was observing one of the men intently he was a lean somewhat cadaverous man of about her own age whose profile was turned to them and he was the partner of a highlycoloured girl obviously english by birth  suddenly in the strange way in which some words detach themselves from the rest they heard him say quite distinctly  all you want is practice miss warrington courage and practiceones no good without the other  hughling elliot of course helen exclaimed she ducked her head immediately for at the sound of his name he looked up the game went on for a few minutes and was then broken up by the approach of a wheeled chair containing a voluminous old lady who paused by the table and said  better luck tonight susan  all the lucks on our side said a young man who until now had kept his back turned to the window he appeared to be rather stout and had a thick crop of hair  luck mr hewet said his partner a middleaged lady with spectacles i assure you mrs paley our success is due solely to our brilliant play  unless i go to bed early i get practically no sleep at all mrs paley was heard to explain as if to justify her seizure of susan who got up and proceeded to wheel the chair to the door  theyll get some one else to take my place she said cheerfully but she was wrong no attempt was made to find another player and after the young man had built three stories of a cardhouse which fell down the players strolled off in different directions  mr hewet turned his full face towards the window they could see that he had large eyes obscured by glasses his complexion was rosy his lips cleanshaven and seen among ordinary people it appeared to be an interesting face he came straight towards them but his eyes were fixed not upon the eavesdroppers but upon a spot where the curtain hung in folds  asleep he said  helen and rachel started to think that some one had been sitting near to them unobserved all the time there were legs in the shadow a melancholy voice issued from above them  two women it said  a scuffling was heard on the gravel the women had fled they did not stop running until they felt certain that no eye could penetrate the darkness and the hotel was only a square shadow in the distance with red holes regularly cut in it      chapter ix   an hour passed and the downstairs rooms at the hotel grew dim and were almost deserted while the little boxlike squares above them were brilliantly irradiated some forty or fifty people were going to bed the thump of jugs set down on the floor above could be heard and the clink of china for there was not as thick a partition between the rooms as one might wish so miss allan the elderly lady who had been playing bridge determined giving the wall a smart rap with her knuckles it was only matchboard she decided run up to make many little rooms of one large one her grey petticoats slipped to the ground and stooping she folded her clothes with neat if not loving fingers screwed her hair into a plait wound her fathers great gold watch and opened the complete works of wordsworth she was reading the prelude partly because she always read the prelude abroad and partly because she was engaged in writing a short primer of english literaturebeowulf to swinburnewhich would have a paragraph on wordsworth she was deep in the fifth book stopping indeed to pencil a note when a pair of boots dropped one after another on the floor above her she looked up and speculated whose boots were they she wondered she then became aware of a swishing sound next doora woman clearly putting away her dress it was succeeded by a gentle tapping sound such as that which accompanies hairdressing it was very difficult to keep her attention fixed upon the prelude was it susan warrington tapping she forced herself however to read to the end of the book when she placed a mark between the pages sighed contentedly and then turned out the light  very different was the room through the wall though as like in shape as one eggbox is like another as miss allan read her book susan warrington was brushing her hair ages have consecrated this hour and the most majestic of all domestic actions to talk of love between women but miss warrington being alone could not talk she could only look with extreme solicitude at her own face in the glass she turned her head from side to side tossing heavy locks now this way now that and then withdrew a pace or two and considered herself seriously  im nicelooking she determined not prettypossibly she drew herself up a little yesmost people would say i was handsome  she was really wondering what arthur venning would say she was her feeling about him was decidedly queer she would not admit to herself that she was in love with him or that she wanted to marry him yet she spent every minute when she was alone in wondering what he thought of her and in comparing what they had done today with what they had done the day before  he didnt ask me to play but he certainly followed me into the hall she meditated summing up the evening she was thirty years of age and owing to the number of her sisters and the seclusion of life in a country parsonage had as yet had no proposal of marriage the hour of confidences was often a sad one and she had been known to jump into bed treating her hair unkindly feeling herself overlooked by life in comparison with others she was a big wellmade woman the red lying upon her cheeks in patches that were too well defined but her serious anxiety gave her a kind of beauty  she was just about to pull back the bedclothes when she exclaimed oh but im forgetting and went to her writingtable a brown volume lay there stamped with the figure of the year she proceeded to write in the square ugly hand of a mature child as she wrote daily year after year keeping the diaries though she seldom looked at them  amtalked to mrs h elliot about country neighbours she knows the manns also the selbycarroways how small the world is like her read a chapter of miss applebys adventure to aunt e pmplayed lawntennis with mr perrott and evelyn m dont like mr p have a feeling that he is not quite though clever certainly beat them day splendid view wonderful one gets used to no trees though much too bare at first cards after dinner aunt e cheerful though twingy she says mem ask about damp sheets  she knelt in prayer and then lay down in bed tucking the blankets comfortably about her and in a few minutes her breathing showed that she was asleep with its profoundly peaceful sighs and hesitations it resembled that of a cow standing up to its knees all night through in the long grass  a glance into the next room revealed little more than a nose prominent above the sheets growing accustomed to the darkness for the windows were open and showed grey squares with splinters of starlight one could distinguish a lean form terribly like the body of a dead person the body indeed of william pepper asleep too thirtysix thirtyseven thirtyeighthere were three portuguese men of business asleep presumably since a snore came with the regularity of a great ticking clock thirtynine was a corner room at the end of the passage but late though it wasone struck gently downstairsa line of light under the door showed that some one was still awake  how late you are hugh a woman lying in bed said in a peevish but solicitous voice her husband was brushing his teeth and for some moments did not answer  you should have gone to sleep he replied i was talking to thornbury  but you know that i never can sleep when im waiting for you she said  to that he made no answer but only remarked well then well turn out the light they were silent  the faint but penetrating pulse of an electric bell could now be heard in the corridor old mrs paley having woken hungry but without her spectacles was summoning her maid to find the biscuitbox the maid having answered the bell drearily respectful even at this hour though muffled in a mackintosh the passage was left in silence downstairs all was empty and dark but on the upper floor a light still burnt in the room where the boots had dropped so heavily above miss allans head here was the gentleman who a few hours previously in the shade of the curtain had seemed to consist entirely of legs deep in an armchair he was reading the third volume of gibbons history of the decline and fall of rome by candlelight as he read he knocked the ash automatically now and again from his cigarette and turned the page while a whole procession of splendid sentences entered his capacious brow and went marching through his brain in order it seemed likely that this process might continue for an hour or more until the entire regiment had shifted its quarters had not the door opened and the young man who was inclined to be stout come in with large naked feet  oh hirst what i forgot to say was  two minutes said hirst raising his finger  he safely stowed away the last words of the paragraph  what was it you forgot to say he asked  dyou think you do make enough allowance for feelings asked mr hewet he had again forgotten what he had meant to say  after intense contemplation of the immaculate gibbon mr hirst smiled at the question of his friend he laid aside his book and considered  i should call yours a singularly untidy mind he observed feelings arent they just what we do allow for we put love up there and all the rest somewhere down below with his left hand he indicated the top of a pyramid and with his right the base  but you didnt get out of bed to tell me that he added severely  i got out of bed said hewet vaguely merely to talk i suppose  meanwhile i shall undress said hirst when naked of all but his shirt and bent over the basin mr hirst no longer impressed one with the majesty of his intellect but with the pathos of his young yet ugly body for he stooped and he was so thin that there were dark lines between the different bones of his neck and shoulders  women interest me said hewet who sitting on the bed with his chin resting on his knees paid no attention to the undressing of mr hirst  theyre so stupid said hirst youre sitting on my pyjamas  i suppose they are stupid hewet wondered  there cant be two opinions about that i imagine said hirst hopping briskly across the room unless youre in lovethat fat woman warrington he enquired  not one fat womanall fat women hewet sighed  the women i saw tonight were not fat said hirst who was taking advantage of hewets company to cut his toenails  describe them said hewet  you know i cant describe things said hirst they were much like other women i should think they always are  no thats where we differ said hewet i say everythings different no two people are in the least the same take you and me now  so i used to think once said hirst but now theyre all types dont take ustake this hotel you could draw circles round the whole lot of them and theyd never stray outside  you can kill a hen by doing that hewet murmured  mr hughling elliot mrs hughling elliot miss allan mr and mrs thornburyone circle hirst continued miss warrington mr arthur venning mr perrott evelyn m another circle then there are a whole lot of natives finally ourselves  are we all alone in our circle asked hewet  quite alone said hirst you try to get out but you cant you only make a mess of things by trying  im not a hen in a circle said hewet im a dove on a treetop  i wonder if this is what they call an ingrowing toenail said hirst examining the big toe on his left foot  i flit from branch to branch continued hewet the world is profoundly pleasant he lay back on the bed upon his arms  i wonder if its really nice to be as vague as you are asked hirst looking at him its the lack of continuitythats whats so odd bout you he went on at the age of twentyseven which is nearly thirty you seem to have drawn no conclusions a party of old women excites you still as though you were three  hewet contemplated the angular young man who was neatly brushing the rims of his toenails into the fireplace in silence for a moment  i respect you hirst he remarked  i envy yousome things said hirst one your capacity for not thinking two people like you better than they like me women like you i suppose  i wonder whether that isnt really what matters most said hewet lying now flat on the bed he waved his hand in vague circles above him  of course it is said hirst but thats not the difficulty the difficulty is isnt it to find an appropriate object  there are no female hens in your circle asked hewet  not the ghost of one said hirst  although they had known each other for three years hirst had never yet heard the true story of hewets loves in general conversation it was taken for granted that they were many but in private the subject was allowed to lapse the fact that he had money enough to do no work and that he had left cambridge after two terms owing to a difference with the authorities and had then travelled and drifted made his life strange at many points where his friends lives were much of a piece  i dont see your circlesi dont see them hewet continued i see a thing like a teetotum spinning in and outknocking into thingsdashing from side to sidecollecting numbersmore and more and more till the whole place is thick with them round and round they goout there over the rimout of sight  his fingers showed that the waltzing teetotums had spun over the edge of the counterpane and fallen off the bed into infinity  could you contemplate three weeks alone in this hotel asked hirst after a moments pause  hewet proceeded to think  the truth of it is that one never is alone and one never is in company he concluded  meaning said hirst  meaning oh something about bubblesauraswhat dyou call em you cant see my bubble i cant see yours all we see of each other is a speck like the wick in the middle of that flame the flame goes about with us everywhere its not ourselves exactly but what we feel the world is short or people mainly all kinds of people  a nice streaky bubble yours must be said hirst  and supposing my bubble could run into some one elses bubble  and they both burst put in hirst  thenthenthen pondered hewet as if to himself it would be an enormous world he said stretching his arms to their full width as though even so they could hardly clasp the billowy universe for when he was with hirst he always felt unusually sanguine and vague  i dont think you altogether as foolish as i used to hewet said hirst you dont know what you mean but you try to say it  but arent you enjoying yourself here asked hewet  on the wholeyes said hirst i like observing people i like looking at things this country is amazingly beautiful did you notice how the top of the mountain turned yellow tonight really we must take our lunch and spend the day out youre getting disgustingly fat he pointed at the calf of hewets bare leg  well get up an expedition said hewet energetically well ask the entire hotel well hire donkeys and  oh lord said hirst do shut it i can see miss warrington and miss allan and mrs elliot and the rest squatting on the stones and quacking how jolly  well ask venning and perrott and miss murgatroydevery one we can lay hands on went on hewet whats the name of the little old grasshopper with the eyeglasses pepperpepper shall lead us  thank god youll never get the donkeys said hirst  i must make a note of that said hewet slowly dropping his feet to the floor hirst escorts miss warrington pepper advances alone on a white ass provisions equally distributedor shall we hire a mule the matronstheres mrs paley by joveshare a carriage  thats where youll go wrong said hirst putting virgins among matrons  how long should you think that an expedition like that would take hirst asked hewet  from twelve to sixteen hours i would say said hirst the time usually occupied by a first confinement  it will need considerable organisation said hewet he was now padding softly round the room and stopped to stir the books on the table they lay heaped one upon another  we shall want some poets too he remarked not gibbon no dyou happen to have modern love or john donne you see i contemplate pauses when people get tired of looking at the view and then it would be nice to read something rather difficult aloud  mrs paley will enjoy herself said hirst  mrs paley will enjoy it certainly said hewet its one of the saddest things i knowthe way elderly ladies cease to read poetry and yet how appropriate this is       i speak as one who plumbs        lifes dim profound      one who at length can sound        clear views and certain       butafter love what comes      a scene that lours        a few sad vacant hours        and then the curtain  i daresay mrs paley is the only one of us who can really understand that  well ask her said hirst please hewet if you must go to bed draw my curtain few things distress me more than the moonlight  hewet retreated pressing the poems of thomas hardy beneath his arm and in their beds next door to each other both the young men were soon asleep  between the extinction of hewets candle and the rising of a dusky spanish boy who was the first to survey the desolation of the hotel in the early morning a few hours of silence intervened one could almost hear a hundred people breathing deeply and however wakeful and restless it would have been hard to escape sleep in the middle of so much sleep looking out of the windows there was only darkness to be seen all over the shadowed half of the world people lay prone and a few flickering lights in empty streets marked the places where their cities were built red and yellow omnibuses were crowding each other in piccadilly sumptuous women were rocking at a standstill but here in the darkness an owl flitted from tree to tree and when the breeze lifted the branches the moon flashed as if it were a torch until all people should awake again the houseless animals were abroad the tigers and the stags and the elephants coming down in the darkness to drink at pools the wind at night blowing over the hills and woods was purer and fresher than the wind by day and the earth robbed of detail more mysterious than the earth coloured and divided by roads and fields for six hours this profound beauty existed and then as the east grew whiter and whiter the ground swam to the surface the roads were revealed the smoke rose and the people stirred and the sun shone upon the windows of the hotel at santa marina until they were uncurtained and the gong blaring all through the house gave notice of breakfast  directly breakfast was over the ladies as usual circled vaguely picking up papers and putting them down again about the hall  and what are you going to do today asked mrs elliot drifting up against miss warrington  mrs elliot the wife of hughling the oxford don was a short woman whose expression was habitually plaintive her eyes moved from thing to thing as though they never found anything sufficiently pleasant to rest upon for any length of time  im going to try to get aunt emma out into the town said susan shes not seen a thing yet  i call it so spirited of her at her age said mrs elliot coming all this way from her own fireside  yes we always tell her shell die on board ship susan replied she was born on one she added  in the old days said mrs elliot a great many people were i always pity the poor women so weve got a lot to complain of she shook her head her eyes wandered about the table and she remarked irrelevantly the poor little queen of holland newspaper reporters practically one may say at her bedroom door  were you talking of the queen of holland said the pleasant voice of miss allan who was searching for the thick pages of the times among a litter of thin foreign sheets  i always envy any one who lives in such an excessively flat country she remarked  how very strange said mrs elliot i find a flat country so depressing  im afraid you cant be very happy here then miss allan said susan  on the contrary said miss allan i am exceedingly fond of mountains perceiving the times at some distance she moved off to secure it  well i must find my husband said mrs elliot fidgeting away  and i must go to my aunt said miss warrington and taking up the duties of the day they moved away  whether the flimsiness of foreign sheets and the coarseness of their type is any proof of frivolity and ignorance there is no doubt that english people scarce consider news read there as news any more than a programme bought from a man in the street inspires confidence in what it says a very respectable elderly pair having inspected the long tables of newspapers did not think it worth their while to read more than the headlines  the debate on the fifteenth should have reached us by now mrs thornbury murmured mr thornbury who was beautifully clean and had red rubbed into his handsome worn face like traces of paint on a weatherbeaten wooden figure looked over his glasses and saw that miss allan had the times  the couple therefore sat themselves down in armchairs and waited  ah theres mr hewet said mrs thornbury mr hewet she continued do come and sit by us i was telling my husband how much you reminded me of a dear old friend of minemary umpleby she was a most delightful woman i assure you she grew roses we used to stay with her in the old days  no young man likes to have it said that he resembles an elderly spinster said mr thornbury  on the contrary said mr hewet i always think it a compliment to remind people of some one else but miss umplebywhy did she grow roses  ah poor thing said mrs thornbury thats a long story she had gone through dreadful sorrows at one time i think she would have lost her senses if it hadnt been for her garden the soil was very much against hera blessing in disguise she had to be up at dawnout in all weathers and then there are creatures that eat roses but she triumphed she always did she was a brave soul she sighed deeply but at the same time with resignation  i did not realise that i was monopolising the paper said miss allan coming up to them  we were so anxious to read about the debate said mrs thornbury accepting it on behalf of her husband  one doesnt realise how interesting a debate can be until one has sons in the navy my interests are equally balanced though i have sons in the army too and one son who makes speeches at the unionmy baby  hirst would know him i expect said hewet  mr hirst has such an interesting face said mrs thornbury but i feel one ought to be very clever to talk to him well william she enquired for mr thornbury grunted  theyre making a mess of it said mr thornbury he had reached the second column of the report a spasmodic column for the irish members had been brawling three weeks ago at westminster over a question of naval efficiency after a disturbed paragraph or two the column of print once more ran smoothly  you have read it mrs thornbury asked miss allan  no i am ashamed to say i have only read about the discoveries in crete said miss allan  oh but i would give so much to realise the ancient world cried mrs thornbury now that we old people are alonewere on our second honeymooni am really going to put myself to school again after all we are founded on the past arent we mr hewet my soldier son says that there is still a great deal to be learnt from hannibal one ought to know so much more than one does somehow when i read the paper i begin with the debates first and before ive done the door always openswere a very large party at homeand so one never does think enough about the ancients and all theyve done for us but you begin at the beginning miss allan  when i think of the greeks i think of them as naked black men said miss allan which is quite incorrect im sure  and you mr hirst said mrs thornbury perceiving that the gaunt young man was near im sure you read everything  i confine myself to cricket and crime said hirst the worst of coming from the upper classes he continued is that ones friends are never killed in railway accidents  mr thornbury threw down the paper and emphatically dropped his eyeglasses the sheets fell in the middle of the group and were eyed by them all  its not gone well asked his wife solicitously  hewet picked up one sheet and read a lady was walking yesterday in the streets of westminster when she perceived a cat in the window of a deserted house the famished animal  i shall be out of it anyway mr thornbury interrupted peevishly  cats are often forgotten miss allan remarked  remember william the prime minister has reserved his answer said mrs thornbury  at the age of eighty mr joshua harris of eeles park brondesbury has had a son said hirst     the famished animal which had been noticed by workmen for some days was rescued butby jove it bit the mans hand to pieces  wild with hunger i suppose commented miss allan  youre all neglecting the chief advantage of being abroad said mr hughling elliot who had joined the group you might read your news in french which is equivalent to reading no news at all  mr elliot had a profound knowledge of coptic which he concealed as far as possible and quoted french phrases so exquisitely that it was hard to believe that he could also speak the ordinary tongue he had an immense respect for the french  coming he asked the two young men we ought to start before its really hot  i beg of you not to walk in the heat hugh his wife pleaded giving him an angular parcel enclosing half a chicken and some raisins  hewet will be our barometer said mr elliot he will melt before i shall indeed if so much as a drop had melted off his spare ribs the bones would have lain bare the ladies were left alone now surrounding the times which lay upon the floor miss allan looked at her fathers watch  ten minutes to eleven she observed  work asked mrs thornbury  work replied miss allan  what a fine creature she is murmured mrs thornbury as the square figure in its manly coat withdrew  and im sure she has a hard life sighed mrs elliot  oh it is a hard life said mrs thornbury unmarried womenearning their livingsits the hardest life of all  yet she seems pretty cheerful said mrs elliot  it must be very interesting said mrs thornbury i envy her her knowledge  but that isnt what women want said mrs elliot  im afraid its all a great many can hope to have sighed mrs thornbury i believe that there are more of us than ever now sir harley lethbridge was telling me only the other day how difficult it is to find boys for the navypartly because of their teeth it is true and i have heard young women talk quite openly of  dreadful dreadful exclaimed mrs elliot the crown as one may call it of a womans life i who know what it is to be childless she sighed and ceased  but we must not be hard said mrs thornbury the conditions are so much changed since i was a young woman  surely maternity does not change said mrs elliot  in some ways we can learn a great deal from the young said mrs thornbury i learn so much from my own daughters  i believe that hughling really doesnt mind said mrs elliot but then he has his work  women without children can do so much for the children of others observed mrs thornbury gently  i sketch a great deal said mrs elliot but that isnt really an occupation its so disconcerting to find girls just beginning doing better than one does oneself and natures difficultvery difficult  are there not institutionsclubsthat you could help asked mrs thornbury  they are so exhausting said mrs elliot i look strong because of my colour but im not the youngest of eleven never is  if the mother is careful before said mrs thornbury judicially there is no reason why the size of the family should make any difference and there is no training like the training that brothers and sisters give each other i am sure of that i have seen it with my own children my eldest boy ralph for instance  but mrs elliot was inattentive to the elder ladys experience and her eyes wandered about the hall  my mother had two miscarriages i know she said suddenly the first because she met one of those great dancing bearsthey shouldnt be allowed the otherit was a horrid storyour cook had a child and there was a dinner party so i put my dyspepsia down to that  and a miscarriage is so much worse than a confinement mrs thornbury murmured absentmindedly adjusting her spectacles and picking up the times mrs elliot rose and fluttered away  when she had heard what one of the million voices speaking in the paper had to say and noticed that a cousin of hers had married a clergyman at mineheadignoring the drunken women the golden animals of crete the movements of battalions the dinners the reforms the fires the indignant the learned and benevolent mrs thornbury went upstairs to write a letter for the mail  the paper lay directly beneath the clock the two together seeming to represent stability in a changing world mr perrott passed through mr venning poised for a second on the edge of a table mrs paley was wheeled past susan followed mr venning strolled after her portuguese military families their clothes suggesting late rising in untidy bedrooms trailed across attended by confidential nurses carrying noisy children as midday drew on and the sun beat straight upon the roof an eddy of great flies droned in a circle iced drinks were served under the palms the long blinds were pulled down with a shriek turning all the light yellow the clock now had a silent hall to tick in and an audience of four or five somnolent merchants by degrees white figures with shady hats came in at the door admitting a wedge of the hot summer day and shutting it out again after resting in the dimness for a minute they went upstairs simultaneously the clock wheezed one and the gong sounded beginning softly working itself into a frenzy and ceasing there was a pause then all those who had gone upstairs came down cripples came planting both feet on the same step lest they should slip prim little girls came holding the nurses finger fat old men came still buttoning waistcoats the gong had been sounded in the garden and by degrees recumbent figures rose and strolled in to eat since the time had come for them to feed again there were pools and bars of shade in the garden even at midday where two or three visitors could lie working or talking at their ease  owing to the heat of the day luncheon was generally a silent meal when people observed their neighbors and took stock of any new faces there might be hazarding guesses as to who they were and what they did mrs paley although well over seventy and crippled in the legs enjoyed her food and the peculiarities of her fellowbeings she was seated at a small table with susan  i shouldnt like to say what she is she chuckled surveying a tall woman dressed conspicuously in white with paint in the hollows of her cheeks who was always late and always attended by a shabby female follower at which remark susan blushed and wondered why her aunt said such things  lunch went on methodically until each of the seven courses was left in fragments and the fruit was merely a toy to be peeled and sliced as a child destroys a daisy petal by petal the food served as an extinguisher upon any faint flame of the human spirit that might survive the midday heat but susan sat in her room afterwards turning over and over the delightful fact that mr venning had come to her in the garden and had sat there quite half an hour while she read aloud to her aunt men and women sought different corners where they could lie unobserved and from two to four it might be said without exaggeration that the hotel was inhabited by bodies without souls disastrous would have been the result if a fire or a death had suddenly demanded something heroic of human nature but tragedies come in the hungry hours towards four oclock the human spirit again began to lick the body as a flame licks a black promontory of coal mrs paley felt it unseemly to open her toothless jaw so widely though there was no one near and mrs elliot surveyed her found flushed face anxiously in the lookingglass  half an hour later having removed the traces of sleep they met each other in the hall and mrs paley observed that she was going to have her tea  you like your tea too dont you she said and invited mrs elliot whose husband was still out to join her at a special table which she had placed for her under a tree  a little silver goes a long way in this country she chuckled  she sent susan back to fetch another cup  they have such excellent biscuits here she said contemplating a plateful not sweet biscuits which i dont likedry biscuits    have you been sketching  oh ive done two or three little daubs said mrs elliot speaking rather louder than usual but its so difficult after oxfordshire where there are so many trees the lights so strong here some people admire it i know but i find it very fatiguing  i really dont need cooking susan said mrs paley when her niece returned i must trouble you to move me everything had to be moved finally the old lady was placed so that the light wavered over her as though she were a fish in a net susan poured out tea and was just remarking that they were having hot weather in wiltshire too when mr venning asked whether he might join them  its so nice to find a young man who doesnt despise tea said mrs paley regaining her good humour one of my nephews the other day asked for a glass of sherryat five oclock i told him he could get it at the public house round the corner but not in my drawing room  id rather go without lunch than tea said mr venning thats not strictly true i want both  mr venning was a dark young man about thirtytwo years of age very slapdash and confident in his manner although at this moment obviously a little excited his friend mr perrott was a barrister and as mr perrott refused to go anywhere without mr venning it was necessary when mr perrott came to santa marina about a company for mr venning to come too he was a barrister also but he loathed a profession which kept him indoors over books and directly his widowed mother died he was going so he confided to susan to take up flying seriously and become partner in a large business for making aeroplanes the talk rambled on it dealt of course with the beauties and singularities of the place the streets the people and the quantities of unowned yellow dogs  dont you think it dreadfully cruel the way they treat dogs in this country asked mrs paley  id have em all shot said mr venning  oh but the darling puppies said susan  jolly little chaps said mr venning look here youve got nothing to eat a great wedge of cake was handed susan on the point of a trembling knife her hand trembled too as she took it  i have such a dear dog at home said mrs elliot  my parrot cant stand dogs said mrs paley with the air of one making a confidence i always suspect that he or she was teased by a dog when i was abroad  you didnt get far this morning miss warrington said mr venning  it was hot she answered their conversation became private owing to mrs paleys deafness and the long sad history which mrs elliot had embarked upon of a wirehaired terrier white with just one black spot belonging to an uncle of hers which had committed suicide animals do commit suicide she sighed as if she asserted a painful fact  couldnt we explore the town this evening mr venning suggested  my aunt susan began  you deserve a holiday he said youre always doing things for other people  but thats my life she said under cover of refilling the teapot  thats no ones life he returned no young persons youll come  i should like to come she murmured  at this moment mrs elliot looked up and exclaimed oh hugh hes bringing some one she added  he would like some tea said mrs paley susan run and get some cupsthere are the two young men  were thirsting for tea said mr elliot you know mr ambrose hilda we met on the hill  he dragged me in said ridley or i should have been ashamed im dusty and dirty and disagreeable he pointed to his boots which were white with dust while a dejected flower drooping in his buttonhole like an exhausted animal over a gate added to the effect of length and untidiness he was introduced to the others mr hewet and mr hirst brought chairs and tea began again susan pouring cascades of water from pot to pot always cheerfully and with the competence of long use  my wifes brother ridley explained to hilda whom he failed to remember has a house here which he has lent us i was sitting on a rock thinking of nothing at all when elliot started up like a fairy in a pantomime  our chicken got into the salt hewet said dolefully to susan nor is it true that bananas include moisture as well as sustenance  hirst was already drinking  weve been cursing you said ridley in answer to mrs elliots kind enquiries about his wife you tourists eat up all the eggs helen tells me thats an eyesore toohe nodded his head at the hotel disgusting luxury i call it we live with pigs in the drawingroom  the food is not at all what it ought to be considering the price said mrs paley seriously but unless one goes to a hotel where is one to go to  stay at home said ridley i often wish i had everyone ought to stay at home but of course they wont  mrs paley conceived a certain grudge against ridley who seemed to be criticising her habits after an acquaintance of five minutes  i believe in foreign travel myself she stated if one knows ones native land which i think i can honestly say i do i should not allow any one to travel until they had visited kent and dorsetshirekent for the hops and dorsetshire for its old stone cottages there is nothing to compare with them here  yesi always think that some people like the flat and other people like the downs said mrs elliot rather vaguely  hirst who had been eating and drinking without interruption now lit a cigarette and observed oh but were all agreed by this time that natures a mistake shes either very ugly appallingly uncomfortable or absolutely terrifying i dont know which alarms me mosta cow or a tree i once met a cow in a field by night the creature looked at me i assure you it turned my hair grey its a disgrace that the animals should be allowed to go at large  and what did the cow think of him venning mumbled to susan who immediately decided in her own mind that mr hirst was a dreadful young man and that although he had such an air of being clever he probably wasnt as clever as arthur in the ways that really matter  wasnt it wilde who discovered the fact that nature makes no allowance for hipbones enquired hughling elliot he knew by this time exactly what scholarships and distinction hirst enjoyed and had formed a very high opinion of his capacities  but hirst merely drew his lips together very tightly and made no reply  ridley conjectured that it was now permissible for him to take his leave politeness required him to thank mrs elliot for his tea and to add with a wave of his hand you must come up and see us  the wave included both hirst and hewet and hewet answered i should like it immensely  the party broke up and susan who had never felt so happy in her life was just about to start for her walk in the town with arthur when mrs paley beckoned her back she could not understand from the book how double demon patience is played and suggested that if they sat down and worked it out together it would fill up the time nicely before dinner      chapter x   among the promises which mrs ambrose had made her niece should she stay was a room cut off from the rest of the house large privatea room in which she could play read think defy the world a fortress as well as a sanctuary rooms she knew became more like worlds than rooms at the age of twentyfour her judgment was correct and when she shut the door rachel entered an enchanted place where the poets sang and things fell into their right proportions some days after the vision of the hotel by night she was sitting alone sunk in an armchair reading a brightlycovered red volume lettered on the back works of henrik ibsen music was open on the piano and books of music rose in two jagged pillars on the floor but for the moment music was deserted  far from looking bored or absentminded her eyes were concentrated almost sternly upon the page and from her breathing which was slow but repressed it could be seen that her whole body was constrained by the working of her mind at last she shut the book sharply lay back and drew a deep breath expressive of the wonder which always marks the transition from the imaginary world to the real world  what i want to know she said aloud is this what is the truth whats the truth of it all she was speaking partly as herself and partly as the heroine of the play she had just read the landscape outside because she had seen nothing but print for the space of two hours now appeared amazingly solid and clear but although there were men on the hill washing the trunks of olive trees with a white liquid for the moment she herself was the most vivid thing in itan heroic statue in the middle of the foreground dominating the view ibsens plays always left her in that condition she acted them for days at a time greatly to helens amusement and then it would be merediths turn and she became diana of the crossways but helen was aware that it was not all acting and that some sort of change was taking place in the human being when rachel became tired of the rigidity of her pose on the back of the chair she turned round slid comfortably down into it and gazed out over the furniture through the window opposite which opened on the garden her mind wandered away from nora but she went on thinking of things that the book suggested to her of women and life  during the three months she had been here she had made up considerably as helen meant she should for time spent in interminable walks round sheltered gardens and the household gossip of her aunts but mrs ambrose would have been the first to disclaim any influence or indeed any belief that to influence was within her power she saw her less shy and less serious which was all to the good and the violent leaps and the interminable mazes which had led to that result were usually not even guessed at by her talk was the medicine she trusted to talk about everything talk that was free unguarded and as candid as a habit of talking with men made natural in her own case nor did she encourage those habits of unselfishness and amiability founded upon insincerity which are put at so high a value in mixed households of men and women she desired that rachel should think and for this reason offered books and discouraged too entire a dependence upon bach and beethoven and wagner but when mrs ambrose would have suggested defoe maupassant or some spacious chronicle of family life rachel chose modern books books in shiny yellow covers books with a great deal of gilding on the back which were tokens in her aunts eyes of harsh wrangling and disputes about facts which had no such importance as the moderns claimed for them but she did not interfere rachel read what she chose reading with the curious literalness of one to whom written sentences are unfamiliar and handling words as though they were made of wood separately of great importance and possessed of shapes like tables or chairs in this way she came to conclusions which had to be remodelled according to the adventures of the day and were indeed recast as liberally as any one could desire leaving always a small grain of belief behind them  ibsen was succeeded by a novel such as mrs ambrose detested whose purpose was to distribute the guilt of a womans downfall upon the right shoulders a purpose which was achieved if the readers discomfort were any proof of it she threw the book down looked out of the window turned away from the window and relapsed into an armchair  the morning was hot and the exercise of reading left her mind contracting and expanding like the mainspring of a clock and the small noises of midday which one can ascribe to no definite cause in a regular rhythm it was all very real very big very impersonal and after a moment or two she began to raise her first finger and to let it fall on the arm of her chair so as to bring back to herself some consciousness of her own existence she was next overcome by the unspeakable queerness of the fact that she should be sitting in an armchair in the morning in the middle of the world who were the people moving in the housemoving things from one place to another and life what was that it was only a light passing over the surface and vanishing as in time she would vanish though the furniture in the room would remain her dissolution became so complete that she could not raise her finger any more and sat perfectly still listening and looking always at the same spot it became stranger and stranger she was overcome with awe that things should exist at all    she forgot that she had any fingers to raise    the things that existed were so immense and so desolate    she continued to be conscious of these vast masses of substance for a long stretch of time the clock still ticking in the midst of the universal silence  come in she said mechanically for a string in her brain seemed to be pulled by a persistent knocking at the door with great slowness the door opened and a tall human being came towards her holding out her arm and saying  what am i to say to this  the utter absurdity of a woman coming into a room with a piece of paper in her hand amazed rachel  i dont know what to answer or who terence hewet is helen continued in the toneless voice of a ghost she put a paper before rachel on which were written the incredible words   dear mrs ambrosei am getting up a picnic for next friday when we propose to start at eleventhirty if the weather is fine and to make the ascent of monte rosa it will take some time but the view should be magnificent it would give me great pleasure if you and miss vinrace would consent to be of the party  yours sincerely terence hewet   rachel read the words aloud to make herself believe in them for the same reason she put her hand on helens shoulder  booksbooksbooks said helen in her absentminded way more new booksi wonder what you find in them     for the second time rachel read the letter but to herself this time instead of seeming vague as ghosts each word was astonishingly prominent they came out as the tops of mountains come through a mist fridayeleventhirtymiss vinrace the blood began to run in her veins she felt her eyes brighten  we must go she said rather surprising helen by her decision we must certainly gosuch was the relief of finding that things still happened and indeed they appeared the brighter for the mist surrounding them  monte rosathats the mountain over there isnt it said helen but hewetwhos he one of the young men ridley met i suppose shall i say yes then it may be dreadfully dull  she took the letter back and went for the messenger was waiting for her answer  the party which had been suggested a few nights ago in mr hirsts bedroom had taken shape and was the source of great satisfaction to mr hewet who had seldom used his practical abilities and was pleased to find them equal to the strain his invitations had been universally accepted which was the more encouraging as they had been issued against hirsts advice to people who were very dull not at all suited to each other and sure not to come  undoubtedly he said as he twirled and untwirled a note signed helen ambrose the gifts needed to make a great commander have been absurdly overrated about half the intellectual effort which is needed to review a book of modern poetry has enabled me to get together seven or eight people of opposite sexes at the same spot at the same hour on the same day what else is generalship hirst what more did wellington do on the field of waterloo its like counting the number of pebbles of a path tedious but not difficult  he was sitting in his bedroom one leg over the arm of the chair and hirst was writing a letter opposite hirst was quick to point out that all the difficulties remained  for instance here are two women youve never seen suppose one of them suffers from mountainsickness as my sister does and the other  oh the women are for you hewet interrupted i asked them solely for your benefit what you want hirst you know is the society of young women of your own age you dont know how to get on with women which is a great defect considering that half the world consists of women  hirst groaned that he was quite aware of that  but hewets complacency was a little chilled as he walked with hirst to the place where a general meeting had been appointed he wondered why on earth he had asked these people and what one really expected to get from bunching human beings up together  cows he reflected draw together in a field ships in a calm and were just the same when weve nothing else to do but why do we do itis it to prevent ourselves from seeing to the bottom of things he stopped by a stream and began stirring it with his walkingstick and clouding the water with mud making cities and mountains and whole universes out of nothing or do we really love each other or do we on the other hand live in a state of perpetual uncertainty knowing nothing leaping from moment to moment as from world to worldwhich is on the whole the view i incline to  he jumped over the stream hirst went round and joined him remarking that he had long ceased to look for the reason of any human action  half a mile further they came to a group of plane trees and the salmonpink farmhouse standing by the stream which had been chosen as meetingplace it was a shady spot lying conveniently just where the hill sprung out from the flat between the thin stems of the plane trees the young men could see little knots of donkeys pasturing and a tall woman rubbing the nose of one of them while another woman was kneeling by the stream lapping water out of her palms  as they entered the shady place helen looked up and then held out her hand  i must introduce myself she said i am mrs ambrose  having shaken hands she said thats my niece  rachel approached awkwardly she held out her hand but withdrew it its all wet she said  scarcely had they spoken when the first carriage drew up  the donkeys were quickly jerked into attention and the second carriage arrived by degrees the grove filled with peoplethe elliots the thornburys mr venning and susan miss allan evelyn murgatroyd and mr perrott mr hirst acted the part of hoarse energetic sheepdog by means of a few words of caustic latin he had the animals marshalled and by inclining a sharp shoulder he lifted the ladies what hewet fails to understand he remarked is that we must break the back of the ascent before midday he was assisting a young lady by name evelyn murgatroyd as he spoke she rose light as a bubble to her seat with a feather drooping from a broadbrimmed hat in white from top to toe she looked like a gallant lady of the time of charles the first leading royalist troops into action  ride with me she commanded and as soon as hirst had swung himself across a mule the two started leading the cavalcade  youre not to call me miss murgatroyd i hate it she said my names evelyn whats yours  st john he said  i like that said evelyn and whats your friends name  his initials being r s t we call him monk said hirst  oh youre all too clever she said which way pick me a branch lets canter  she gave her donkey a sharp cut with a switch and started forward the full and romantic career of evelyn murgatroyd is best hit off by her own words call me evelyn and ill call you st john she said that on very slight provocationher surname was enoughbut although a great many young men had answered her already with considerable spirit she went on saying it and making choice of none but her donkey stumbled to a jogtrot and she had to ride in advance alone for the path when it began to ascend one of the spines of the hill became narrow and scattered with stones the cavalcade wound on like a jointed caterpillar tufted with the white parasols of the ladies and the panama hats of the gentlemen at one point where the ground rose sharply evelyn m jumped off threw her reins to the native boy and adjured st john hirst to dismount too their example was followed by those who felt the need of stretching  i dont see any need to get off said miss allan to mrs elliot just behind her considering the difficulty i had getting on  these little donkeys stand anything nestce pas mrs elliot addressed the guide who obligingly bowed his head  flowers said helen stooping to pick the lovely little bright flowers which grew separately here and there you pinch their leaves and then they smell she said laying one on miss allans knee  havent we met before asked miss allan looking at her  i was taking it for granted helen laughed for in the confusion of meeting they had not been introduced  how sensible chirped mrs elliot thats just what one would always likeonly unfortunately its not possible not possible said helen everythings possible who knows what maynt happen before nightfall she continued mocking the poor ladys timidity who depended implicitly upon one thing following another that the mere glimpse of a world where dinner could be disregarded or the table moved one inch from its accustomed place filled her with fears for her own stability  higher and higher they went becoming separated from the world the world when they turned to look back flattened itself out and was marked with squares of thin green and grey  towns are very small rachel remarked obscuring the whole of santa marina and its suburbs with one hand the sea filled in all the angles of the coast smoothly breaking in a white frill and here and there ships were set firmly in the blue the sea was stained with purple and green blots and there was a glittering line upon the rim where it met the sky the air was very clear and silent save for the sharp noise of grasshoppers and the hum of bees which sounded loud in the ear as they shot past and vanished the party halted and sat for a time in a quarry on the hillside  amazingly clear exclaimed st john identifying one cleft in the land after another  evelyn m sat beside him propping her chin on her hand she surveyed the view with a certain look of triumph  dyou think garibaldi was ever up here she asked mr hirst oh if she had been his bride if instead of a picnic party this was a party of patriots and she redshirted like the rest had lain among grim men flat on the turf aiming her gun at the white turrets beneath them screening her eyes to pierce through the smoke so thinking her foot stirred restlessly and she exclaimed  i dont call this life do you  what do you call life said st john  fightingrevolution she said still gazing at the doomed city you only care for books i know  youre quite wrong said st john  explain she urged for there were no guns to be aimed at bodies and she turned to another kind of warfare  what do i care for people he said  well i am surprised she exclaimed you look so awfully serious do lets be friends and tell each other what were like i hate being cautious dont you  but st john was decidedly cautious as she could see by the sudden constriction of his lips and had no intention of revealing his soul to a young lady the ass is eating my hat he remarked and stretched out for it instead of answering her evelyn blushed very slightly and then turned with some impetuosity upon mr perrott and when they mounted again it was mr perrott who lifted her to her seat  when one has laid the eggs one eats the omelette said hughling elliot exquisitely in french a hint to the rest of them that it was time to ride on again  the midday sun which hirst had foretold was beginning to beat down hotly the higher they got the more of the sky appeared until the mountain was only a small tent of earth against an enormous blue background the english fell silent the natives who walked beside the donkeys broke into queer wavering songs and tossed jokes from one to the other the way grew very steep and each rider kept his eyes fixed on the hobbling curved form of the rider and donkey directly in front of him rather more strain was being put upon their bodies than is quite legitimate in a party of pleasure and hewet overheard one or two slightly grumbling remarks  expeditions in such heat are perhaps a little unwise mrs elliot murmured to miss allan  but miss allan returned i always like to get to the top and it was true although she was a big woman stiff in the joints and unused to donkeyriding but as her holidays were few she made the most of them  the vivacious white figure rode well in front she had somehow possessed herself of a leafy branch and wore it round her hat like a garland they went on for a few minutes in silence  the view will be wonderful hewet assured them turning round in his saddle and smiling encouragement rachel caught his eye and smiled too they struggled on for some time longer nothing being heard but the clatter of hooves striving on the loose stones then they saw that evelyn was off her ass and that mr perrott was standing in the attitude of a statesman in parliament square stretching an arm of stone towards the view a little to the left of them was a low ruined wall the stump of an elizabethan watchtower  i couldnt have stood it much longer mrs elliot confided to mrs thornbury but the excitement of being at the top in another moment and seeing the view prevented any one from answering her one after another they came out on the flat space at the top and stood overcome with wonder before them they beheld an immense spacegrey sands running into forest and forest merging in mountains and mountains washed by air the infinite distances of south america a river ran across the plain as flat as the land and appearing quite as stationary the effect of so much space was at first rather chilling they felt themselves very small and for some time no one said anything then evelyn exclaimed splendid she took hold of the hand that was next her it chanced to be miss allans hand  northsoutheastwest said miss allan jerking her head slightly towards the points of the compass  hewet who had gone a little in front looked up at his guests as if to justify himself for having brought them he observed how strangely the people standing in a row with their figures bent slightly forward and their clothes plastered by the wind to the shape of their bodies resembled naked statues on their pedestal of earth they looked unfamiliar and noble but in another moment they had broken their rank and he had to see to the laying out of food hirst came to his help and they handed packets of chicken and bread from one to another  as st john gave helen her packet she looked him full in the face and said  do you remembertwo women  he looked at her sharply  i do he answered  so youre the two women hewet exclaimed looking from helen to rachel  your lights tempted us said helen we watched you playing cards but we never knew that we were being watched  it was like a thing in a play rachel added  and hirst couldnt describe you said hewet  it was certainly odd to have seen helen and to find nothing to say about her  hughling elliot put up his eyeglass and grasped the situation  i dont know of anything more dreadful he said pulling at the joint of a chickens leg than being seen when one isnt conscious of it one feels sure one has been caught doing something ridiculouslooking at ones tongue in a hansom for instance  now the others ceased to look at the view and drawing together sat down in a circle round the baskets  and yet those little lookingglasses in hansoms have a fascination of their own said mrs thornbury ones features look so different when one can only see a bit of them  there will soon be very few hansom cabs left said mrs elliot and fourwheeled cabsi assure you even at oxford its almost impossible to get a fourwheeled cab  i wonder what happens to the horses said susan  veal pie said arthur  its high time that horses should become extinct anyhow said hirst theyre distressingly ugly besides being vicious  but susan who had been brought up to understand that the horse is the noblest of gods creatures could not agree and venning thought hirst an unspeakable ass but was too polite not to continue the conversation  when they see us falling out of aeroplanes they get some of their own back i expect he remarked  you fly said old mr thornbury putting on his spectacles to look at him  i hope to some day said arthur  here flying was discussed at length and mrs thornbury delivered an opinion which was almost a speech to the effect that it would be quite necessary in time of war and in england we were terribly behindhand if i were a young fellow she concluded i should certainly qualify it was odd to look at the little elderly lady in her grey coat and skirt with a sandwich in her hand her eyes lighting up with zeal as she imagined herself a young man in an aeroplane for some reason however the talk did not run easily after this and all they said was about drink and salt and the view suddenly miss allan who was seated with her back to the ruined wall put down her sandwich picked something off her neck and remarked im covered with little creatures it was true and the discovery was very welcome the ants were pouring down a glacier of loose earth heaped between the stones of the ruinlarge brown ants with polished bodies she held out one on the back of her hand for helen to look at  suppose they sting said helen  they will not sting but they may infest the victuals said miss allan and measures were taken at once to divert the ants from their course at hewets suggestion it was decided to adopt the methods of modern warfare against an invading army the tablecloth represented the invaded country and round it they built barricades of baskets set up the wine bottles in a rampart made fortifications of bread and dug fosses of salt when an ant got through it was exposed to a fire of breadcrumbs until susan pronounced that that was cruel and rewarded those brave spirits with spoil in the shape of tongue playing this game they lost their stiffness and even became unusually daring for mr perrott who was very shy said permit me and removed an ant from evelyns neck  it would be no laughing matter really said mrs elliot confidentially to mrs thornbury if an ant did get between the vest and the skin  the noise grew suddenly more clamorous for it was discovered that a long line of ants had found their way on to the tablecloth by a back entrance and if success could be gauged by noise hewet had every reason to think his party a success nevertheless he became for no reason at all profoundly depressed  they are not satisfactory they are ignoble he thought surveying his guests from a little distance where he was gathering together the plates he glanced at them all stooping and swaying and gesticulating round the tablecloth amiable and modest respectable in many ways lovable even in their contentment and desire to be kind how mediocre they all were and capable of what insipid cruelty to one another there was mrs thornbury sweet but trivial in her maternal egoism mrs elliot perpetually complaining of her lot her husband a mere pea in a pod and susanshe had no self and counted neither one way nor the other venning was as honest and as brutal as a schoolboy poor old thornbury merely trod his round like a horse in a mill and the less one examined into evelyns character the better he suspected yet these were the people with money and to them rather than to others was given the management of the world put among them some one more vital who cared for life or for beauty and what an agony what a waste would they inflict on him if he tried to share with them and not to scourge  theres hirst he concluded coming to the figure of his friend with his usual little frown of concentration upon his forehead he was peeling the skin off a banana and hes as ugly as sin for the ugliness of st john hirst and the limitations that went with it he made the rest in some way responsible it was their fault that he had to live alone then he came to helen attracted to her by the sound of her laugh she was laughing at miss allan you wear combinations in this heat she said in a voice which was meant to be private he liked the look of her immensely not so much her beauty but her largeness and simplicity which made her stand out from the rest like a great stone woman and he passed on in a gentler mood his eye fell upon rachel she was lying back rather behind the others resting on one elbow she might have been thinking precisely the same thoughts as hewet himself her eyes were fixed rather sadly but not intently upon the row of people opposite her hewet crawled up to her on his knees with a piece of bread in his hand  what are you looking at he asked  she was a little startled but answered directly human beings      chapter xi   one after another they rose and stretched themselves and in a few minutes divided more or less into two separate parties one of these parties was dominated by hughling elliot and mrs thornbury who having both read the same books and considered the same questions were now anxious to name the places beneath them and to hang upon them stores of information about navies and armies political parties natives and mineral productsall of which combined they said to prove that south america was the country of the future  evelyn m listened with her bright blue eyes fixed upon the oracles  how it makes one long to be a man she exclaimed  mr perrott answered surveying the plain that a country with a future was a very fine thing  if i were you said evelyn turning to him and drawing her glove vehemently through her fingers id raise a troop and conquer some great territory and make it splendid youd want women for that id love to start life from the very beginning as it ought to benothing squalidbut great halls and gardens and splendid men and women but youyou only like law courts  and would you really be content without pretty frocks and sweets and all the things young ladies like asked mr perrott concealing a certain amount of pain beneath his ironical manner  im not a young lady evelyn flashed she bit her underlip just because i like splendid things you laugh at me why are there no men like garibaldi now she demanded  look here said mr perrott you dont give me a chance you think we ought to begin things fresh good but i dont see preciselyconquer a territory theyre all conquered already arent they  its not any territory in particular evelyn explained its the idea dont you see we lead such tame lives and i feel sure youve got splendid things in you  hewet saw the scars and hollows in mr perrotts sagacious face relax pathetically he could imagine the calculations which even then went on within his mind as to whether he would be justified in asking a woman to marry him considering that he made no more than five hundred a year at the bar owned no private means and had an invalid sister to support mr perrott again knew that he was not quite as susan stated in her diary not quite a gentleman she meant for he was the son of a grocer in leeds had started life with a basket on his back and now though practically indistinguishable from a born gentleman showed his origin to keen eyes in an impeccable neatness of dress lack of freedom in manner extreme cleanliness of person and a certain indescribable timidity and precision with his knife and fork which might be the relic of days when meat was rare and the way of handling it by no means gingerly  the two parties who were strolling about and losing their unity now came together and joined each other in a long stare over the yellow and green patches of the heated landscape below the hot air danced across it making it impossible to see the roofs of a village on the plain distinctly even on the top of the mountain where a breeze played lightly it was very hot and the heat the food the immense space and perhaps some less welldefined cause produced a comfortable drowsiness and a sense of happy relaxation in them they did not say much but felt no constraint in being silent  suppose we go and see whats to be seen over there said arthur to susan and the pair walked off together their departure certainly sending some thrill of emotion through the rest  an odd lot arent they said arthur i thought we should never get em all to the top but im glad we came by jove i wouldnt have missed this for something  i dont like mr hirst said susan inconsequently i suppose hes very clever but why should clever people be soi expect hes awfully nice really she added instinctively qualifying what might have seemed an unkind remark  hirst oh hes one of these learned chaps said arthur indifferently he dont look as if he enjoyed it you should hear him talking to elliot its as much as i can do to follow em at all    i was never good at my books  with these sentences and the pauses that came between them they reached a little hillock on the top of which grew several slim trees  dyou mind if we sit down here said arthur looking about him its jolly in the shadeand the view they sat down and looked straight ahead of them in silence for some time  but i do envy those clever chaps sometimes arthur remarked i dont suppose they ever    he did not finish his sentence  i cant see why you should envy them said susan with great sincerity  odd things happen to one said arthur one goes along smoothly enough one thing following another and its all very jolly and plain sailing and you think you know all about it and suddenly one doesnt know where one is a bit and everything seems different from what it used to seem now today coming up that path riding behind you i seemed to see everything as if he paused and plucked a piece of grass up by the roots he scattered the little lumps of earth which were sticking to the rootsas if it had a kind of meaning youve made the difference to me he jerked out i dont see why i shouldnt tell you ive felt it ever since i knew you    its because i love you  even while they had been saying commonplace things susan had been conscious of the excitement of intimacy which seemed not only to lay bare something in her but in the trees and the sky and the progress of his speech which seemed inevitable was positively painful to her for no human being had ever come so close to her before  she was struck motionless as his speech went on and her heart gave great separate leaps at the last words she sat with her fingers curled round a stone looking straight in front of her down the mountain over the plain so then it had actually happened to her a proposal of marriage  arthur looked round at her his face was oddly twisted she was drawing her breath with such difficulty that she could hardly answer  you might have known he seized her in his arms again and again and again they clasped each other murmuring inarticulately  well sighed arthur sinking back on the ground thats the most wonderful thing thats ever happened to me he looked as if he were trying to put things seen in a dream beside real things  there was a long silence  its the most perfect thing in the world susan stated very gently and with great conviction it was no longer merely a proposal of marriage but of marriage with arthur with whom she was in love  in the silence that followed holding his hand tightly in hers she prayed to god that she might make him a good wife  and what will mr perrott say she asked at the end of it  dear old fellow said arthur who now that the first shock was over was relaxing into an enormous sense of pleasure and contentment we must be very nice to him susan  he told her how hard perrotts life had been and how absurdly devoted he was to arthur himself he went on to tell her about his mother a widow lady of strong character in return susan sketched the portraits of her own familyedith in particular her youngest sister whom she loved better than any one else except you arthur    arthur she continued what was it that you first liked me for  it was a buckle you wore one night at sea said arthur after due consideration i remember noticingits an absurd thing to noticethat you didnt take peas because i dont either  from this they went on to compare their more serious tastes or rather susan ascertained what arthur cared about and professed herself very fond of the same thing they would live in london perhaps have a cottage in the country near susans family for they would find it strange without her at first her mind stunned to begin with now flew to the various changes that her engagement would makehow delightful it would be to join the ranks of the married womenno longer to hang on to groups of girls much younger than herselfto escape the long solitude of an old maids life now and then her amazing good fortune overcame her and she turned to arthur with an exclamation of love  they lay in each others arms and had no notion that they were observed yet two figures suddenly appeared among the trees above them heres shade began hewet when rachel suddenly stopped dead they saw a man and woman lying on the ground beneath them rolling slightly this way and that as the embrace tightened and slackened the man then sat upright and the woman who now appeared to be susan warrington lay back upon the ground with her eyes shut and an absorbed look upon her face as though she were not altogether conscious nor could you tell from her expression whether she was happy or had suffered something when arthur again turned to her butting her as a lamb butts a ewe hewet and rachel retreated without a word hewet felt uncomfortably shy  i dont like that said rachel after a moment  i can remember not liking it either said hewet i can remember but he changed his mind and continued in an ordinary tone of voice well we may take it for granted that theyre engaged dyou think hell ever fly or will she put a stop to that  but rachel was still agitated she could not get away from the sight they had just seen instead of answering hewet she persisted  loves an odd thing isnt it making ones heart beat  its so enormously important you see hewet replied their lives are now changed for ever  and it makes one sorry for them too rachel continued as though she were tracing the course of her feelings i dont know either of them but i could almost burst into tears thats silly isnt it  just because theyre in love said hewet yes he added after a moments consideration theres something horribly pathetic about it i agree  and now as they had walked some way from the grove of trees and had come to a rounded hollow very tempting to the back they proceeded to sit down and the impression of the lovers lost some of its force though a certain intensity of vision which was probably the result of the sight remained with them as a day upon which any emotion has been repressed is different from other days so this day was now different merely because they had seen other people at a crisis of their lives  a great encampment of tents they might be said hewet looking in front of him at the mountains isnt it like a watercolour tooyou know the way watercolours dry in ridges all across the paperive been wondering what they looked like  his eyes became dreamy as though he were matching things and reminded rachel in their colour of the green flesh of a snail she sat beside him looking at the mountains too when it became painful to look any longer the great size of the view seeming to enlarge her eyes beyond their natural limit she looked at the ground it pleased her to scrutinise this inch of the soil of south america so minutely that she noticed every grain of earth and made it into a world where she was endowed with the supreme power she bent a blade of grass and set an insect on the utmost tassel of it and wondered if the insect realised his strange adventure and thought how strange it was that she should have bent that tassel rather than any other of the million tassels  youve never told me you name said hewet suddenly miss somebody vinrace    i like to know peoples christian names  rachel she replied  rachel he repeated i have an aunt called rachel who put the life of father damien into verse she is a religious fanaticthe result of the way she was brought up down in northamptonshire never seeing a soul have you any aunts  i live with them said rachel  and i wonder what theyre doing now hewet enquired  they are probably buying wool rachel determined she tried to describe them they are small rather pale women she began very clean we live in richmond they have an old dog too who will only eat the marrow out of bones    they are always going to church they tidy their drawers a good deal but here she was overcome by the difficulty of describing people  its impossible to believe that its all going on still she exclaimed  the sun was behind them and two long shadows suddenly lay upon the ground in front of them one waving because it was made by a skirt and the other stationary because thrown by a pair of legs in trousers  you look very comfortable said helens voice above them  hirst said hewet pointing at the scissorlike shadow he then rolled round to look up at them  theres room for us all here he said  when hirst had seated himself comfortably he said  did you congratulate the young couple  it appeared that coming to the same spot a few minutes after hewet and rachel helen and hirst had seen precisely the same thing  no we didnt congratulate them said hewet they seemed very happy  well said hirst pursing up his lips so long as i neednt marry either of them  we were very much moved said hewet  i thought you would be said hirst which was it monk the thought of the immortal passions or the thought of newborn males to keep the roman catholics out i assure you he said to helen hes capable of being moved by either  rachel was a good deal stung by his banter which she felt to be directed equally against them both but she could think of no repartee  nothing moves hirst hewet laughed he did not seem to be stung at all unless it were a transfinite number falling in love with a finite onei suppose such things do happen even in mathematics  on the contrary said hirst with a touch of annoyance i consider myself a person of very strong passions it was clear from the way he spoke that he meant it seriously he spoke of course for the benefit of the ladies  by the way hirst said hewet after a pause i have a terrible confession to make your bookthe poems of wordsworth which if you remember i took off your table just as we were starting and certainly put in my pocket here  is lost hirst finished for him  i consider that there is still a chance hewet urged slapping himself to right and left that i never did take it after all  no said hirst it is here he pointed to his breast  thank god hewet exclaimed i need no longer feel as though id murdered a child  i should think you were always losing things helen remarked looking at him meditatively  i dont lose things said hewet i mislay them that was the reason why hirst refused to share a cabin with me on the voyage out  you came out together helen enquired  i propose that each member of this party now gives a short biographical sketch of himself or herself said hirst sitting upright miss vinrace you come first begin  rachel stated that she was twentyfour years of age the daughter of a shipowner that she had never been properly educated played the piano had no brothers or sisters and lived at richmond with aunts her mother being dead  next said hirst having taken in these facts he pointed at hewet i am the son of an english gentleman i am twentyseven hewet began my father was a foxhunting squire he died when i was ten in the hunting field i can remember his body coming home on a shutter i suppose just as i was going down to tea and noticing that there was jam for tea and wondering whether i should be allowed  yes but keep to the facts hirst put in  i was educated at winchester and cambridge which i had to leave after a time i have done a good many things since  profession  noneat least  tastes  literary im writing a novel  brothers and sisters  three sisters no brother and a mother  is that all were to hear about you said helen she stated that she was very oldforty last october and her father had been a solicitor in the city who had gone bankrupt for which reason she had never had much educationthey lived in one place after anotherbut an elder brother used to lend her books  if i were to tell you everything she stopped and smiled it would take too long she concluded i married when i was thirty and i have two children my husband is a scholar and nowits your turn she nodded at hirst  youve left out a great deal he reproved her my name is st john alaric hirst he began in a jaunty tone of voice im twentyfour years old im the son of the reverend sidney hirst vicar of great wappyng in norfolk oh i got scholarships everywherewestminsterkings im now a fellow of kings dont it sound dreary parents both alive alas two brothers and one sister im a very distinguished young man he added  one of the three or is it five most distinguished men in england hewet remarked  quite correct said hirst  thats all very interesting said helen after a pause but of course weve left out the only questions that matter for instance are we christians  i am not i am not both the young men replied  i am rachel stated  you believe in a personal god hirst demanded turning round and fixing her with his eyeglasses  i believei believe rachel stammered i believe there are things we dont know about and the world might change in a minute and anything appear  at this helen laughed outright nonsense she said youre not a christian youve never thought what you areand there are lots of other questions she continued though perhaps we cant ask them yet although they had talked so freely they were all uncomfortably conscious that they really knew nothing about each other  the important questions hewet pondered the really interesting ones i doubt that one ever does ask them  rachel who was slow to accept the fact that only a very few things can be said even by people who know each other well insisted on knowing what he meant  whether weve ever been in love she enquired is that the kind of question you mean  again helen laughed at her benignantly strewing her with handfuls of the long tasselled grass for she was so brave and so foolish  oh rachel she cried its like having a puppy in the house having you with onea puppy that brings ones underclothes down into the hall  but again the sunny earth in front of them was crossed by fantastic wavering figures the shadows of men and women  there they are exclaimed mrs elliot there was a touch of peevishness in her voice and weve had such a hunt to find you do you know what the time is  mrs elliot and mr and mrs thornbury now confronted them mrs elliot was holding out her watch and playfully tapping it upon the face hewet was recalled to the fact that this was a party for which he was responsible and he immediately led them back to the watchtower where they were to have tea before starting home again a bright crimson scarf fluttered from the top of the wall which mr perrott and evelyn were tying to a stone as the others came up the heat had changed just so far that instead of sitting in the shadow they sat in the sun which was still hot enough to paint their faces red and yellow and to colour great sections of the earth beneath them  theres nothing half so nice as tea said mrs thornbury taking her cup  nothing said helen cant you remember as a child chopping up hay she spoke much more quickly than usual and kept her eye fixed upon mrs thornbury and pretending it was tea and getting scolded by the nurseswhy i cant imagine except that nurses are such brutes wont allow pepper instead of salt though theres no earthly harm in it werent your nurses just the same  during this speech susan came into the group and sat down by helens side a few minutes later mr venning strolled up from the opposite direction he was a little flushed and in the mood to answer hilariously whatever was said to him  what have you been doing to that old chaps grave he asked pointing to the red flag which floated from the top of the stones  we have tried to make him forget his misfortune in having died three hundred years ago said mr perrott  it would be awfulto be dead ejaculated evelyn m  to be dead said hewet i dont think it would be awful its quite easy to imagine when you go to bed tonight fold your hands sobreathe slower and slower he lay back with his hands clasped upon his breast and his eyes shut now he murmured in an even monotonous voice i shall never never never move again his body lying flat among them did for a moment suggest death  this is a horrible exhibition mr hewet cried mrs thornbury  more cake for us said arthur  i assure you theres nothing horrible about it said hewet sitting up and laying hands upon the cake  its so natural he repeated people with children should make them do that exercise every night    not that i look forward to being dead  and when you allude to a grave said mr thornbury who spoke almost for the first time have you any authority for calling that ruin a grave i am quite with you in refusing to accept the common interpretation which declares it to be the remains of an elizabethan watchtowerany more than i believe that the circular mounds or barrows which we find on the top of our english downs were camps the antiquaries call everything a camp i am always asking them well then where do you think our ancestors kept their cattle half the camps in england are merely the ancient pound or barton as we call it in my part of the world the argument that no one would keep his cattle in such exposed and inaccessible spots has no weight at all if you reflect that in those days a mans cattle were his capital his stockintrade his daughters dowries without cattle he was a serf another mans man    his eyes slowly lost their intensity and he muttered a few concluding words under his breath looking curiously old and forlorn  hughling elliot who might have been expected to engage the old gentleman in argument was absent at the moment he now came up holding out a large square of cotton upon which a fine design was printed in pleasant bright colours that made his hand look pale  a bargain he announced laying it down on the cloth ive just bought it from the big man with the earrings fine isnt it it wouldnt suit every one of course but its just the thingisnt it hildafor mrs raymond parry  mrs raymond parry cried helen and mrs thornbury at the same moment  they looked at each other as though a mist hitherto obscuring their faces had been blown away  ahyou have been to those wonderful parties too mrs elliot asked with interest  mrs parrys drawingroom though thousands of miles away behind a vast curve of water on a tiny piece of earth came before their eyes they who had had no solidity or anchorage before seemed to be attached to it somehow and at once grown more substantial perhaps they had been in the drawingroom at the same moment perhaps they had passed each other on the stairs at any rate they knew some of the same people they looked one another up and down with new interest but they could do no more than look at each other for there was no time to enjoy the fruits of the discovery the donkeys were advancing and it was advisable to begin the descent immediately for the night fell so quickly that it would be dark before they were home again  accordingly remounting in order they filed off down the hillside scraps of talk came floating back from one to another there were jokes to begin with and laughter some walked part of the way and picked flowers and sent stones bounding before them  who writes the best latin verse in your college hirst mr elliot called back incongruously and mr hirst returned that he had no idea  the dusk fell as suddenly as the natives had warned them the hollows of the mountain on either side filling up with darkness and the path becoming so dim that it was surprising to hear the donkeys hooves still striking on hard rock silence fell upon one and then upon another until they were all silent their minds spilling out into the deep blue air the way seemed shorter in the dark than in the day and soon the lights of the town were seen on the flat far beneath them  suddenly some one cried ah  in a moment the slow yellow drop rose again from the plain below it rose paused opened like a flower and fell in a shower of drops  fireworks they cried  another went up more quickly and then another they could almost hear it twist and roar  some saints day i suppose said a voice the rush and embrace of the rockets as they soared up into the air seemed like the fiery way in which lovers suddenly rose and united leaving the crowd gazing up at them with strained white faces but susan and arthur riding down the hill never said a word to each other and kept accurately apart  then the fireworks became erratic and soon they ceased altogether and the rest of the journey was made almost in darkness the mountain being a great shadow behind them and bushes and trees little shadows which threw darkness across the road among the planetrees they separated bundling into carriages and driving off without saying goodnight or saying it only in a halfmuffled way  it was so late that there was no time for normal conversation between their arrival at the hotel and their retirement to bed but hirst wandered into hewets room with a collar in his hand  well hewet he remarked on the crest of a gigantic yawn that was a great success i consider he yawned but take care youre not landed with that young woman    i dont really like young women     hewet was too much drugged by hours in the open air to make any reply in fact every one of the party was sound asleep within ten minutes or so of each other with the exception of susan warrington she lay for a considerable time looking blankly at the wall opposite her hands clasped above her heart and her light burning by her side all articulate thought had long ago deserted her her heart seemed to have grown to the size of a sun and to illuminate her entire body shedding like the sun a steady tide of warmth  im happy im happy im happy she repeated i love every one im happy      chapter xii   when susans engagement had been approved at home and made public to any one who took an interest in it at the hoteland by this time the society at the hotel was divided so as to point to invisible chalkmarks such as mr hirst had described the news was felt to justify some celebrationan expedition that had been done already a dance then the advantage of a dance was that it abolished one of those long evenings which were apt to become tedious and lead to absurdly early hours in spite of bridge  two or three people standing under the erect body of the stuffed leopard in the hall very soon had the matter decided evelyn slid a pace or two this way and that and pronounced that the floor was excellent signor rodriguez informed them of an old spaniard who fiddled at weddingsfiddled so as to make a tortoise waltz and his daughter although endowed with eyes as black as coalscuttles had the same power over the piano if there were any so sick or so surly as to prefer sedentary occupations on the night in question to spinning and watching others spin the drawingroom and billiardroom were theirs hewet made it his business to conciliate the outsiders as much as possible to hirsts theory of the invisible chalkmarks he would pay no attention whatever he was treated to a snub or two but in reward found obscure lonely gentlemen delighted to have this opportunity of talking to their kind and the lady of doubtful character showed every symptom of confiding her case to him in the near future indeed it was made quite obvious to him that the two or three hours between dinner and bed contained an amount of unhappiness which was really pitiable so many people had not succeeded in making friends  it was settled that the dance was to be on friday one week after the engagement and at dinner hewet declared himself satisfied  theyre all coming he told hirst pepper he called seeing william pepper slip past in the wake of the soup with a pamphlet beneath his arm were counting on you to open the ball  you will certainly put sleep out of the question pepper returned  you are to take the floor with miss allan hewet continued consulting a sheet of pencilled notes  pepper stopped and began a discourse upon round dances country dances morris dances and quadrilles all of which are entirely superior to the bastard waltz and spurious polka which have ousted them most unjustly in contemporary popularitywhen the waiters gently pushed him on to his table in the corner  the diningroom at this moment had a certain fantastic resemblance to a farmyard scattered with grain on which bright pigeons kept descending almost all the ladies wore dresses which they had not yet displayed and their hair rose in waves and scrolls so as to appear like carved wood in gothic churches rather than hair the dinner was shorter and less formal than usual even the waiters seeming to be affected with the general excitement ten minutes before the clock struck nine the committee made a tour through the ballroom the hall when emptied of its furniture brilliantly lit adorned with flowers whose scent tinged the air presented a wonderful appearance of ethereal gaiety  its like a starlit sky on an absolutely cloudless night hewet murmured looking about him at the airy empty room  a heavenly floor anyhow evelyn added taking a run and sliding two or three feet along  what about those curtains asked hirst the crimson curtains were drawn across the long windows its a perfect night outside  yes but curtains inspire confidence miss allan decided when the ball is in full swing it will be time to draw them we might even open the windows a little    if we do it now elderly people will imagine there are draughts  her wisdom had come to be recognised and held in respect meanwhile as they stood talking the musicians were unwrapping their instruments and the violin was repeating again and again a note struck upon the piano everything was ready to begin  after a few minutes pause the father the daughter and the soninlaw who played the horn flourished with one accord like the rats who followed the piper heads instantly appeared in the doorway there was another flourish and then the trio dashed spontaneously into the triumphant swing of the waltz it was as though the room were instantly flooded with water after a moments hesitation first one couple then another leapt into midstream and went round and round in the eddies the rhythmic swish of the dancers sounded like a swirling pool by degrees the room grew perceptibly hotter the smell of kid gloves mingled with the strong scent of flowers the eddies seemed to circle faster and faster until the music wrought itself into a crash ceased and the circles were smashed into little separate bits the couples struck off in different directions leaving a thin row of elderly people stuck fast to the walls and here and there a piece of trimming or a handkerchief or a flower lay upon the floor there was a pause and then the music started again the eddies whirled the couples circled round in them until there was a crash and the circles were broken up into separate pieces  when this had happened about five times hirst who leant against a windowframe like some singular gargoyle perceived that helen ambrose and rachel stood in the doorway the crowd was such that they could not move but he recognised them by a piece of helens shoulder and a glimpse of rachels head turning round he made his way to them they greeted him with relief  we are suffering the tortures of the damned said helen  this is my idea of hell said rachel  her eyes were bright and she looked bewildered  hewet and miss allan who had been waltzing somewhat laboriously paused and greeted the newcomers  this is nice said hewet but where is mr ambrose  pindar said helen may a married woman who was forty in october dance i cant stand still she seemed to fade into hewet and they both dissolved in the crowd  we must follow suit said hirst to rachel and he took her resolutely by the elbow rachel without being expert danced well because of a good ear for rhythm but hirst had no taste for music and a few dancing lessons at cambridge had only put him into possession of the anatomy of a waltz without imparting any of its spirit a single turn proved to them that their methods were incompatible instead of fitting into each other their bones seemed to jut out in angles making smooth turning an impossibility and cutting moreover into the circular progress of the other dancers  shall we stop said hirst rachel gathered from his expression that he was annoyed  they staggered to seats in the corner from which they had a view of the room it was still surging in waves of blue and yellow striped by the black eveningclothes of the gentlemen  an amazing spectacle hirst remarked do you dance much in london they were both breathing fast and both a little excited though each was determined not to show any excitement at all  scarcely ever do you  my people give a dance every christmas  this isnt half a bad floor rachel said hirst did not attempt to answer her platitude he sat quite silent staring at the dancers after three minutes the silence became so intolerable to rachel that she was goaded to advance another commonplace about the beauty of the night hirst interrupted her ruthlessly  was that all nonsense what you said the other day about being a christian and having no education he asked  it was practically true she replied but i also play the piano very well she said better i expect than any one in this room you are the most distinguished man in england arent you she asked shyly  one of the three he corrected  helen whirling past here tossed a fan into rachels lap  she is very beautiful hirst remarked  they were again silent rachel was wondering whether he thought her also nicelooking st john was considering the immense difficulty of talking to girls who had no experience of life rachel had obviously never thought or felt or seen anything and she might be intelligent or she might be just like all the rest but hewets taunt rankled in his mindyou dont know how to get on with women and he was determined to profit by this opportunity her eveningclothes bestowed on her just that degree of unreality and distinction which made it romantic to speak to her and stirred a desire to talk which irritated him because he did not know how to begin he glanced at her and she seemed to him very remote and inexplicable very young and chaste he drew a sigh and began  about books now what have you read just shakespeare and the bible  i havent read many classics rachel stated she was slightly annoyed by his jaunty and rather unnatural manner while his masculine acquirements induced her to take a very modest view of her own power  dyou mean to tell me youve reached the age of twentyfour without reading gibbon he demanded  yes i have she answered  mon dieu he exclaimed throwing out his hands you must begin tomorrow i shall send you my copy what i want to know is he looked at her critically you see the problem is can one really talk to you have you got a mind or are you like the rest of your sex you seem to me absurdly young compared with men of your age  rachel looked at him but said nothing  about gibbon he continued dyou think youll be able to appreciate him hes the test of course its awfully difficult to tell about women he continued how much i mean is due to lack of training and how much is native incapacity i dont see myself why you shouldnt understandonly i suppose youve led an absurd life until nowyouve just walked in a crocodile i suppose with your hair down your back  the music was again beginning hirsts eye wandered about the room in search of mrs ambrose with the best will in the world he was conscious that they were not getting on well together  id like awfully to lend you books he said buttoning his gloves and rising from his seat we shall meet again im going to leave you now  he got up and left her  rachel looked round she felt herself surrounded like a child at a party by the faces of strangers all hostile to her with hooked noses and sneering indifferent eyes she was by a window she pushed it open with a jerk she stepped out into the garden her eyes swam with tears of rage  damn that man she exclaimed having acquired some of helens words damn his insolence  she stood in the middle of the pale square of light which the window she had opened threw upon the grass the forms of great black trees rose massively in front of her she stood still looking at them shivering slightly with anger and excitement she heard the trampling and swinging of the dancers behind her and the rhythmic sway of the waltz music  there are trees she said aloud would the trees make up for st john hirst she would be a persian princess far from civilisation riding her horse upon the mountains alone and making her women sing to her in the evening far from all this from the strife and men and womena form came out of the shadow a little red light burnt high up in its blackness  miss vinrace is it said hewet peering at her you were dancing with hirst  hes made me furious she cried vehemently no ones any right to be insolent  insolent hewet repeated taking his cigar from his mouth in surprise hirstinsolent  its insolent to said rachel and stopped she did not know exactly why she had been made so angry with a great effort she pulled herself together  oh well she added the vision of helen and her mockery before her i dare say im a fool she made as though she were going back into the ballroom but hewet stopped her  please explain to me he said i feel sure hirst didnt mean to hurt you  when rachel tried to explain she found it very difficult she could not say that she found the vision of herself walking in a crocodile with her hair down her back peculiarly unjust and horrible nor could she explain why hirsts assumption of the superiority of his nature and experience had seemed to her not only galling but terribleas if a gate had clanged in her face pacing up and down the terrace beside hewet she said bitterly  its no good we should live separate we cannot understand each other we only bring out whats worst  hewet brushed aside her generalisation as to the natures of the two sexes for such generalisations bored him and seemed to him generally untrue but knowing hirst he guessed fairly accurately what had happened and though secretly much amused was determined that rachel should not store the incident away in her mind to take its place in the view she had of life  now youll hate him he said which is wrong poor old hirsthe cant help his method and really miss vinrace he was doing his best he was paying you a complimenthe was tryinghe was trying he could not finish for the laughter that overcame him  rachel veered round suddenly and laughed out too she saw that there was something ridiculous about hirst and perhaps about herself  its his way of making friends i suppose she laughed welli shall do my part i shall beginugly in body repulsive in mind as you are mr hirst  hear hear cried hewet thats the way to treat him you see miss vinrace you must make allowances for hirst hes lived all his life in front of a lookingglass so to speak in a beautiful panelled room hung with japanese prints and lovely old chairs and tables just one splash of colour you know in the right placebetween the windows i think it isand there he sits hour after hour with his toes on the fender talking about philosophy and god and his liver and his heart and the hearts of his friends theyre all broken you cant expect him to be at his best in a ballroom he wants a cosy smoky masculine place where he can stretch his legs out and only speak when hes got something to say for myself i find it rather dreary but i do respect it theyre all so much in earnest they do take the serious things very seriously  the description of hirsts way of life interested rachel so much that she almost forgot her private grudge against him and her respect revived  they are really very clever then she asked  of course they are so far as brains go i think its true what he said the other day theyre the cleverest people in england butyou ought to take him in hand he added theres a great deal more in him thans ever been got at he wants some one to laugh at him    the idea of hirst telling you that youve had no experiences poor old hirst  they had been pacing up and down the terrace while they talked and now one by one the dark windows were uncurtained by an invisible hand and panes of light fell regularly at equal intervals upon the grass they stopped to look in at the drawingroom and perceived mr pepper writing alone at a table  theres pepper writing to his aunt said hewet she must be a very remarkable old lady eightyfive he tells me and he takes her for walking tours in the new forest    pepper he cried rapping on the window go and do your duty miss allan expects you  when they came to the windows of the ballroom the swing of the dancers and the lilt of the music was irresistible  shall we said hewet and they clasped hands and swept off magnificently into the great swirling pool although this was only the second time they had met the first time they had seen a man and woman kissing each other and the second time mr hewet had found that a young woman angry is very like a child so that when they joined hands in the dance they felt more at their ease than is usual  it was midnight and the dance was now at its height servants were peeping in at the windows the garden was sprinkled with the white shapes of couples sitting out mrs thornbury and mrs elliot sat side by side under a palm tree holding fans handkerchiefs and brooches deposited in their laps by flushed maidens occasionally they exchanged comments  miss warrington does look happy said mrs elliot they both smiled they both sighed  he has a great deal of character said mrs thornbury alluding to arthur  and character is what one wants said mrs elliot now that young man is clever enough she added nodding at hirst who came past with miss allan on his arm  he does not look strong said mrs thornbury his complexion is not goodshall i tear it off she asked for rachel had stopped conscious of a long strip trailing behind her  i hope you are enjoying yourselves hewet asked the ladies  this is a very familiar position for me smiled mrs thornbury i have brought out five daughtersand they all loved dancing you love it too miss vinrace she asked looking at rachel with maternal eyes i know i did when i was your age how i used to beg my mother to let me stayand now i sympathise with the poor mothersbut i sympathise with the daughters too  she smiled sympathetically and at the same time rather keenly at rachel  they seem to find a great deal to say to each other said mrs elliot looking significantly at the backs of the couple as they turned away did you notice at the picnic he was the only person who could make her utter  her father is a very interesting man said mrs thornbury he has one of the largest shipping businesses in hull he made a very able reply you remember to mr asquith at the last election it is so interesting to find that a man of his experience is a strong protectionist  she would have liked to discuss politics which interested her more than personalities but mrs elliot would only talk about the empire in a less abstract form  i hear there are dreadful accounts from england about the rats she said a sisterinlaw who lives at norwich tells me it has been quite unsafe to order poultry the plagueyou see it attacks the rats and through them other creatures  and the local authorities are not taking proper steps asked mrs thornbury  that she does not say but she describes the attitude of the educated peoplewho should know betteras callous in the extreme of course my sisterinlaw is one of those active modern women who always takes things up you knowthe kind of woman one admires though one does not feel at least i do not feelbut then she has a constitution of iron  mrs elliot brought back to the consideration of her own delicacy here sighed  a very animated face said mrs thornbury looking at evelyn m who had stopped near them to pin tight a scarlet flower at her breast it would not stay and with a spirited gesture of impatience she thrust it into her partners buttonhole he was a tall melancholy youth who received the gift as a knight might receive his ladys token  very trying to the eyes was mrs eliots next remark after watching the yellow whirl in which so few of the whirlers had either name or character for her for a few minutes bursting out of the crowd helen approached them and took a vacant chair  may i sit by you she said smiling and breathing fast i suppose i ought to be ashamed of myself she went on sitting down at my age  her beauty now that she was flushed and animated was more expansive than usual and both the ladies felt the same desire to touch her  i am enjoying myself she panted movementisnt it amazing  i have always heard that nothing comes up to dancing if one is a good dancer said mrs thornbury looking at her with a smile  helen swayed slightly as if she sat on wires  i could dance for ever she said they ought to let themselves go more she exclaimed they ought to leap and swing look how they mince  have you seen those wonderful russian dancers began mrs elliot but helen saw her partner coming and rose as the moon rises she was half round the room before they took their eyes off her for they could not help admiring her although they thought it a little odd that a woman of her age should enjoy dancing  directly helen was left alone for a minute she was joined by st john hirst who had been watching for an opportunity  should you mind sitting out with me he asked im quite incapable of dancing he piloted helen to a corner which was supplied with two armchairs and thus enjoyed the advantage of semiprivacy they sat down and for a few minutes helen was too much under the influence of dancing to speak  astonishing she exclaimed at last what sort of shape can she think her body is this remark was called forth by a lady who came past them waddling rather than walking and leaning on the arm of a stout man with globular green eyes set in a fat white face some support was necessary for she was very stout and so compressed that the upper part of her body hung considerably in advance of her feet which could only trip in tiny steps owing to the tightness of the skirt round her ankles the dress itself consisted of a small piece of shiny yellow satin adorned here and there indiscriminately with round shields of blue and green beads made to imitate hues of a peacocks breast on the summit of a frothy castle of hair a purple plume stood erect while her short neck was encircled by a black velvet ribbon knobbed with gems and golden bracelets were tightly wedged into the flesh of her fat gloved arms she had the face of an impertinent but jolly little pig mottled red under a dusting of powder  st john could not join in helens laughter  it makes me sick he declared the whole thing makes me sick    consider the minds of those peopletheir feelings dont you agree  i always make a vow never to go to another party of any description helen replied and i always break it  she leant back in her chair and looked laughingly at the young man she could see that he was genuinely cross if at the same time slightly excited  however he said resuming his jaunty tone i suppose one must just make up ones mind to it  to what  there never will be more than five people in the world worth talking to  slowly the flush and sparkle in helens face died away and she looked as quiet and as observant as usual  five people she remarked i should say there were more than five  youve been very fortunate then said hirst or perhaps ive been very unfortunate he became silent  should you say i was a difficult kind of person to get on with he asked sharply  most clever people are when theyre young helen replied  and of course i amimmensely clever said hirst im infinitely cleverer than hewet its quite possible he continued in his curiously impersonal manner that im going to be one of the people who really matter thats utterly different from being clever though one cant expect ones family to see it he added bitterly  helen thought herself justified in asking do you find your family difficult to get on with  intolerable    they want me to be a peer and a privy councillor ive come out here partly in order to settle the matter its got to be settled either i must go to the bar or i must stay on in cambridge of course there are obvious drawbacks to each but the arguments certainly do seem to me in favour of cambridge this kind of thing he waved his hand at the crowded ballroom repulsive im conscious of great powers of affection too im not susceptible of course in the way hewet is im very fond of a few people i think for example that theres something to be said for my mother though she is in many ways so deplorable    at cambridge of course i should inevitably become the most important man in the place but there are other reasons why i dread cambridge he ceased  are you finding me a dreadful bore he asked he changed curiously from a friend confiding in a friend to a conventional young man at a party  not in the least said helen i like it very much  you cant think he exclaimed speaking almost with emotion what a difference it makes finding someone to talk to directly i saw you i felt you might possibly understand me im very fond of hewet but he hasnt the remotest idea what im like youre the only woman ive ever met who seems to have the faintest conception of what i mean when i say a thing  the next dance was beginning it was the barcarolle out of hoffman which made helen beat her toe in time to it but she felt that after such a compliment it was impossible to get up and go and besides being amused she was really flattered and the honesty of his conceit attracted her she suspected that he was not happy and was sufficiently feminine to wish to receive confidences  im very old she sighed  the odd thing is that i dont find you old at all he replied i feel as though we were exactly the same age moreover here he hesitated but took courage from a glance at her face i feel as if i could talk quite plainly to you as one does to a manabout the relations between the sexes about    and     in spite of his certainty a slight redness came into his face as he spoke the last two words  she reassured him at once by the laugh with which she exclaimed i should hope so  he looked at her with real cordiality and the lines which were drawn about his nose and lips slackened for the first time  thank god he exclaimed now we can behave like civilised human beings  certainly a barrier which usually stands fast had fallen and it was possible to speak of matters which are generally only alluded to between men and women when doctors are present or the shadow of death in five minutes he was telling her the history of his life it was long for it was full of extremely elaborate incidents which led on to a discussion of the principles on which morality is founded and thus to several very interesting matters which even in this ballroom had to be discussed in a whisper lest one of the pouter pigeon ladies or resplendent merchants should overhear them and proceed to demand that they should leave the place when they had come to an end or to speak more accurately when helen intimated by a slight slackening of her attention that they had sat there long enough hirst rose exclaiming so theres no reason whatever for all this mystery  none except that we are english people she answered she took his arm and they crossed the ballroom making their way with difficulty between the spinning couples who were now perceptibly dishevelled and certainly to a critical eye by no means lovely in their shapes the excitement of undertaking a friendship and the length of their talk made them hungry and they went in search of food to the diningroom which was now full of people eating at little separate tables in the doorway they met rachel going up to dance again with arthur venning she was flushed and looked very happy and helen was struck by the fact that in this mood she was certainly more attractive than the generality of young women she had never noticed it so clearly before  enjoying yourself she asked as they stopped for a second  miss vinrace arthur answered for her has just made a confession shed no idea that dances could be so delightful  yes rachel exclaimed ive changed my view of life completely  you dont say so helen mocked they passed on  thats typical of rachel she said she changes her view of life about every other day dyou know i believe youre just the person i want she said as they sat down to help me complete her education shes been brought up practically in a nunnery her fathers too absurd ive been doing what i canbut im too old and im a woman why shouldnt you talk to herexplain things to hertalk to her i mean as you talk to me  i have made one attempt already this evening said st john i rather doubt that it was successful she seems to me so very young and inexperienced i have promised to lend her gibbon  its not gibbon exactly helen pondered its the facts of life i thinkdyou see what i mean what really goes on what people feel although they generally try to hide it theres nothing to be frightened of its so much more beautiful than the pretencesalways more interestingalways better i should say than that kind of thing  she nodded her head at a table near them where two girls and two young men were chaffing each other very loudly and carrying on an arch insinuating dialogue sprinkled with endearments about it seemed a pair of stockings or a pair of legs one of the girls was flirting a fan and pretending to be shocked and the sight was very unpleasant partly because it was obvious that the girls were secretly hostile to each other  in my old age however helen sighed im coming to think that it doesnt much matter in the long run what one does people always go their own waynothing will ever influence them she nodded her head at the supper party  but st john did not agree he said that he thought one could really make a great deal of difference by ones point of view books and so on and added that few things at the present time mattered more than the enlightenment of women he sometimes thought that almost everything was due to education  in the ballroom meanwhile the dancers were being formed into squares for the lancers arthur and rachel susan and hewet miss allan and hughling elliot found themselves together  miss allan looked at her watch  halfpast one she stated and i have to despatch alexander pope tomorrow  pope snorted mr elliot who reads pope i should like to know and as for reading about himno no miss allan be persuaded you will benefit the world much more by dancing than by writing it was one of mr elliots affectations that nothing in the world could compare with the delights of dancingnothing in the world was so tedious as literature thus he sought pathetically enough to ingratiate himself with the young and to prove to them beyond a doubt that though married to a ninny of a wife and rather pale and bent and careworn by his weight of learning he was as much alive as the youngest of them all  its a question of bread and butter said miss allan calmly however they seem to expect me she took up her position and pointed a square black toe  mr hewet you bow to me it was evident at once that miss allan was the only one of them who had a thoroughly sound knowledge of the figures of the dance  after the lancers there was a waltz after the waltz a polka and then a terrible thing happened the music which had been sounding regularly with fiveminute pauses stopped suddenly the lady with the great dark eyes began to swathe her violin in silk and the gentleman placed his horn carefully in its case they were surrounded by couples imploring them in english in french in spanish of one more dance one only it was still early but the old man at the piano merely exhibited his watch and shook his head he turned up the collar of his coat and produced a red silk muffler which completely dashed his festive appearance strange as it seemed the musicians were pale and heavyeyed they looked bored and prosaic as if the summit of their desire was cold meat and beer succeeded immediately by bed  rachel was one of those who had begged them to continue when they refused she began turning over the sheets of dance music which lay upon the piano the pieces were generally bound in coloured covers with pictures on them of romantic scenesgondoliers astride on the crescent of the moon nuns peering through the bars of a convent window or young women with their hair down pointing a gun at the stars she remembered that the general effect of the music to which they had danced so gaily was one of passionate regret for dead love and the innocent years of youth dreadful sorrows had always separated the dancers from their past happiness  no wonder they get sick of playing stuff like this she remarked reading a bar or two theyre really hymn tunes played very fast with bits out of wagner and beethoven  do you play would you play anything so long as we can dance to it from all sides her gift for playing the piano was insisted upon and she had to consent as very soon she had played the only pieces of dance music she could remember she went on to play an air from a sonata by mozart  but thats not a dance said some one pausing by the piano  it is she replied emphatically nodding her head invent the steps sure of her melody she marked the rhythm boldly so as to simplify the way helen caught the idea seized miss allan by the arm and whirled round the room now curtseying now spinning round now tripping this way and that like a child skipping through a meadow  this is the dance for people who dont know how to dance she cried the tune changed to a minuet st john hopped with incredible swiftness first on his left leg then on his right the tune flowed melodiously hewet swaying his arms and holding out the tails of his coat swam down the room in imitation of the voluptuous dreamy dance of an indian maiden dancing before her rajah the tune marched and miss allen advanced with skirts extended and bowed profoundly to the engaged pair once their feet fell in with the rhythm they showed a complete lack of selfconsciousness from mozart rachel passed without stopping to old english hunting songs carols and hymn tunes for as she had observed any good tune with a little management became a tune one could dance to by degrees every person in the room was tripping and turning in pairs or alone mr pepper executed an ingenious pointed step derived from figureskating for which he once held some local championship while mrs thornbury tried to recall an old country dance which she had seen danced by her fathers tenants in dorsetshire in the old days as for mr and mrs elliot they gallopaded round and round the room with such impetuosity that the other dancers shivered at their approach some people were heard to criticise the performance as a romp to others it was the most enjoyable part of the evening  now for the great round dance hewet shouted instantly a gigantic circle was formed the dancers holding hands and shouting out dyou ken john peel as they swung faster and faster and faster until the strain was too great and one link of the chainmrs thornburygave way and the rest went flying across the room in all directions to land upon the floor or the chairs or in each others arms as seemed most convenient  rising from these positions breathless and unkempt it struck them for the first time that the electric lights pricked the air very vainly and instinctively a great many eyes turned to the windows yesthere was the dawn while they had been dancing the night had passed and it had come outside the mountains showed very pure and remote the dew was sparkling on the grass and the sky was flushed with blue save for the pale yellows and pinks in the east the dancers came crowding to the windows pushed them open and here and there ventured a foot upon the grass  how silly the poor old lights look said evelyn m in a curiously subdued tone of voice and ourselves it isnt becoming it was true the untidy hair and the green and yellow gems which had seemed so festive half an hour ago now looked cheap and slovenly the complexions of the elder ladies suffered terribly and as if conscious that a cold eye had been turned upon them they began to say goodnight and to make their way up to bed  rachel though robbed of her audience had gone on playing to herself from john peel she passed to bach who was at this time the subject of her intense enthusiasm and one by one some of the younger dancers came in from the garden and sat upon the deserted gilt chairs round the piano the room being now so clear that they turned out the lights as they sat and listened their nerves were quieted the heat and soreness of their lips the result of incessant talking and laughing was smoothed away they sat very still as if they saw a building with spaces and columns succeeding each other rising in the empty space then they began to see themselves and their lives and the whole of human life advancing very nobly under the direction of the music they felt themselves ennobled and when rachel stopped playing they desired nothing but sleep  susan rose i think this has been the happiest night of my life she exclaimed i do adore music she said as she thanked rachel it just seems to say all the things one cant say oneself she gave a nervous little laugh and looked from one to another with great benignity as though she would like to say something but could not find the words in which to express it every ones been so kindso very kind she said then she too went to bed  the party having ended in the very abrupt way in which parties do end helen and rachel stood by the door with their cloaks on looking for a carriage  i suppose you realise that there are no carriages left said st john who had been out to look you must sleep here  oh no said helen we shall walk  may we come too hewet asked we cant go to bed imagine lying among bolsters and looking at ones washstand on a morning like thisis that where you live they had begun to walk down the avenue and he turned and pointed at the white and green villa on the hillside which seemed to have its eyes shut  thats not a light burning is it helen asked anxiously  its the sun said st john the upper windows had each a spot of gold on them  i was afraid it was my husband still reading greek she said all this time hes been editing pindar  they passed through the town and turned up the steep road which was perfectly clear though still unbordered by shadows partly because they were tired and partly because the early light subdued them they scarcely spoke but breathed in the delicious fresh air which seemed to belong to a different state of life from the air at midday when they came to the high yellow wall where the lane turned off from the road helen was for dismissing the two young men  youve come far enough she said go back to bed  but they seemed unwilling to move  lets sit down a moment said hewet he spread his coat on the ground lets sit down and consider they sat down and looked out over the bay it was very still the sea was rippling faintly and lines of green and blue were beginning to stripe it there were no sailing boats as yet but a steamer was anchored in the bay looking very ghostly in the mist it gave one unearthly cry and then all was silent  rachel occupied herself in collecting one grey stone after another and building them into a little cairn she did it very quietly and carefully  and so youve changed your view of life rachel said helen  rachel added another stone and yawned i dont remember she said i feel like a fish at the bottom of the sea she yawned again none of these people possessed any power to frighten her out here in the dawn and she felt perfectly familiar even with mr hirst  my brain on the contrary said hirst is in a condition of abnormal activity he sat in his favourite position with his arms binding his legs together and his chin resting on the top of his knees i see through everythingabsolutely everything life has no more mysteries for me he spoke with conviction but did not appear to wish for an answer near though they sat and familiar though they felt they seemed mere shadows to each other  and all those people down there going to sleep hewet began dreamily thinking such different thingsmiss warrington i suppose is now on her knees the elliots are a little startled its not often they get out of breath and they want to get to sleep as quickly as possible then theres the poor lean young man who danced all night with evelyn hes putting his flower in water and asking himself is this loveand poor old perrott i daresay cant get to sleep at all and is reading his favourite greek book to console himselfand the othersno hirst he wound up i dont find it simple at all  i have a key said hirst cryptically his chin was still upon his knees and his eyes fixed in front of him  a silence followed then helen rose and bade them goodnight but she said remember that youve got to come and see us  they waved goodnight and parted but the two young men did not go back to the hotel they went for a walk during which they scarcely spoke and never mentioned the names of the two women who were to a considerable extent the subject of their thoughts they did not wish to share their impressions they returned to the hotel in time for breakfast      chapter xiii   there were many rooms in the villa but one room which possessed a character of its own because the door was always shut and no sound of music or laughter issued from it every one in the house was vaguely conscious that something went on behind that door and without in the least knowing what it was were influenced in their own thoughts by the knowledge that if the passed it the door would be shut and if they made a noise mr ambrose inside would be disturbed certain acts therefore possessed merit and others were bad so that life became more harmonious and less disconnected than it would have been had mr ambrose given up editing pindar and taken to a nomad existence in and out of every room in the house as it was every one was conscious that by observing certain rules such as punctuality and quiet by cooking well and performing other small duties one ode after another was satisfactorily restored to the world and they shared the continuity of the scholars life unfortunately as age puts one barrier between human beings and learning another and sex a third mr ambrose in his study was some thousand miles distant from the nearest human being who in this household was inevitably a woman he sat hour after hour among whiteleaved books alone like an idol in an empty church still except for the passage of his hand from one side of the sheet to another silent save for an occasional choke which drove him to extend his pipe a moment in the air as he worked his way further and further into the heart of the poet his chair became more and more deeply encircled by books which lay open on the floor and could only be crossed by a careful process of stepping so delicate that his visitors generally stopped and addressed him from the outskirts  on the morning after the dance however rachel came into her uncles room and hailed him twice uncle ridley before he paid her any attention  at length he looked over his spectacles  well he asked  i want a book she replied gibbons history of the roman empire may i have it  she watched the lines on her uncles face gradually rearrange themselves at her question it had been smooth as a mask before she spoke  please say that again said her uncle either because he had not heard or because he had not understood  she repeated the same words and reddened slightly as she did so  gibbon what on earth dyou want him for he enquired  somebody advised me to read it rachel stammered  but i dont travel about with a miscellaneous collection of eighteenthcentury historians her uncle exclaimed gibbon ten big volumes at least  rachel said that she was sorry to interrupt and was turning to go  stop cried her uncle he put down his pipe placed his book on one side and rose and led her slowly round the room holding her by the arm plato he said laying one finger on the first of a row of small dark books and jorrocks next door which is wrong sophocles swift you dont care for german commentators i presume french then you read french you should read balzac then we come to wordsworth and coleridge pope johnson addison wordsworth shelley keats one thing leads to another why is marlowe here mrs chailey i presume but whats the use of reading if you dont read greek after all if you read greek you need never read anything else pure waste of timepure waste of time thus speaking half to himself with quick movements of his hands they had come round again to the circle of books on the floor and their progress was stopped  well he demanded which shall it be  balzac said rachel or have you the speech on the american revolution uncle ridley  the speech on the american revolution he asked he looked at her very keenly again another young man at the dance  no that was mr dalloway she confessed  good lord he flung back his head in recollection of mr dalloway  she chose for herself a volume at random submitted it to her uncle who seeing that it was la cousine bette bade her throw it away if she found it too horrible and was about to leave him when he demanded whether she had enjoyed her dance  he then wanted to know what people did at dances seeing that he had only been to one thirtyfive years ago when nothing had seemed to him more meaningless and idiotic did they enjoy turning round and round to the screech of a fiddle did they talk and say pretty things and if so why didnt they do it under reasonable conditions as for himselfhe sighed and pointed at the signs of industry lying all about him which in spite of his sigh filled his face with such satisfaction that his niece thought good to leave on bestowing a kiss she was allowed to go but not until she had bound herself to learn at any rate the greek alphabet and to return her french novel when done with upon which something more suitable would be found for her  as the rooms in which people live are apt to give off something of the same shock as their faces when seen for the first time rachel walked very slowly downstairs lost in wonder at her uncle and his books and his neglect of dances and his queer utterly inexplicable but apparently satisfactory view of life when her eye was caught by a note with her name on it lying in the hall the address was written in a small strong hand unknown to her and the note which had no beginning ran   i send the first volume of gibbon as i promised personally i find little to be said for the moderns but im going to send you wedekind when ive done him donne have you read webster and all that set i envy you reading them for the first time completely exhausted after last night and you   the flourish of initials which she took to be st j a h wound up the letter she was very much flattered that mr hirst should have remembered her and fulfilled his promise so quickly  there was still an hour to luncheon and with gibbon in one hand and balzac in the other she strolled out of the gate and down the little path of beaten mud between the olive trees on the slope of the hill it was too hot for climbing hills but along the valley there were trees and a grass path running by the river bed in this land where the population was centred in the towns it was possible to lose sight of civilisation in a very short time passing only an occasional farmhouse where the women were handling red roots in the courtyard or a little boy lying on his elbows on the hillside surrounded by a flock of black strongsmelling goats save for a thread of water at the bottom the river was merely a deep channel of dry yellow stones on the bank grew those trees which helen had said it was worth the voyage out merely to see april had burst their buds and they bore large blossoms among their glossy green leaves with petals of a thick waxlike substance coloured an exquisite cream or pink or deep crimson but filled with one of those unreasonable exultations which start generally from an unknown cause and sweep whole countries and skies into their embrace she walked without seeing the night was encroaching upon the day her ears hummed with the tunes she had played the night before she sang and the singing made her walk faster and faster she did not see distinctly where she was going the trees and the landscape appearing only as masses of green and blue with an occasional space of differently coloured sky faces of people she had seen last night came before her she heard their voices she stopped singing and began saying things over again or saying things differently or inventing things that might have been said the constraint of being among strangers in a long silk dress made it unusually exciting to stride thus alone hewet hirst mr venning miss allan the music the light the dark trees in the garden the dawnas she walked they went surging round in her head a tumultuous background from which the present moment with its opportunity of doing exactly as she liked sprung more wonderfully vivid even than the night before  so she might have walked until she had lost all knowledge of her way had it not been for the interruption of a tree which although it did not grow across her path stopped her as effectively as if the branches had struck her in the face it was an ordinary tree but to her it appeared so strange that it might have been the only tree in the world dark was the trunk in the middle and the branches sprang here and there leaving jagged intervals of light between them as distinctly as if it had but that second risen from the ground having seen a sight that would last her for a lifetime and for a lifetime would preserve that second the tree once more sank into the ordinary ranks of trees and she was able to seat herself in its shade and to pick the red flowers with the thin green leaves which were growing beneath it she laid them side by side flower to flower and stalk to stalk caressing them for walking alone flowers and even pebbles in the earth had their own life and disposition and brought back the feelings of a child to whom they were companions looking up her eye was caught by the line of the mountains flying out energetically across the sky like the lash of a curling whip she looked at the pale distant sky and the high bare places on the mountaintops lying exposed to the sun when she sat down she had dropped her books on to the earth at her feet and now she looked down on them lying there so square in the grass a tall stem bending over and tickling the smooth brown cover of gibbon while the mottled blue balzac lay naked in the sun with a feeling that to open and read would certainly be a surprising experience she turned the historians page and read that   his generals in the early part of his reign attempted the reduction of aethiopia and arabia felix they marched near a thousand miles to the south of the tropic but the heat of the climate soon repelled the invaders and protected the unwarlike natives of those sequestered regions    the northern countries of europe scarcely deserved the expense and labour of conquest the forests and morasses of germany were filled with a hardy race of barbarians who despised life when it was separated from freedom   never had any words been so vivid and so beautifularabia felixaethiopia but those were not more noble than the others hardy barbarians forests and morasses they seemed to drive roads back to the very beginning of the world on either side of which the populations of all times and countries stood in avenues and by passing down them all knowledge would be hers and the book of the world turned back to the very first page such was her excitement at the possibilities of knowledge now opening before her that she ceased to read and a breeze turning the page the covers of gibbon gently ruffled and closed together she then rose again and walked on slowly her mind became less confused and sought the origins of her exaltation which were twofold and could be limited by an effort to the persons of mr hirst and mr hewet any clear analysis of them was impossible owing to the haze of wonder in which they were enveloped she could not reason about them as about people whose feelings went by the same rule as her own did and her mind dwelt on them with a kind of physical pleasure such as is caused by the contemplation of bright things hanging in the sun from them all life seemed to radiate the very words of books were steeped in radiance she then became haunted by a suspicion which she was so reluctant to face that she welcomed a trip and stumble over the grass because thus her attention was dispersed but in a second it had collected itself again unconsciously she had been walking faster and faster her body trying to outrun her mind but she was now on the summit of a little hillock of earth which rose above the river and displayed the valley she was no longer able to juggle with several ideas but must deal with the most persistent and a kind of melancholy replaced her excitement she sank down on to the earth clasping her knees together and looking blankly in front of her for some time she observed a great yellow butterfly which was opening and closing its wings very slowly on a little flat stone  what is it to be in love she demanded after a long silence each word as it came into being seemed to shove itself out into an unknown sea hypnotised by the wings of the butterfly and awed by the discovery of a terrible possibility in life she sat for some time longer when the butterfly flew away she rose and with her two books beneath her arm returned home again much as a soldier prepared for battle      chapter xiv   the sun of that same day going down dusk was saluted as usual at the hotel by an instantaneous sparkle of electric lights the hours between dinner and bedtime were always difficult enough to kill and the night after the dance they were further tarnished by the peevishness of dissipation certainly in the opinion of hirst and hewet who lay back in long armchairs in the middle of the hall with their coffeecups beside them and their cigarettes in their hands the evening was unusually dull the women unusually badly dressed the men unusually fatuous moreover when the mail had been distributed half an hour ago there were no letters for either of the two young men as every other person practically had received two or three plump letters from england which they were now engaged in reading this seemed hard and prompted hirst to make the caustic remark that the animals had been fed their silence he said reminded him of the silence in the lionhouse when each beast holds a lump of raw meat in its paws he went on stimulated by this comparison to liken some to hippopotamuses some to canary birds some to swine some to parrots and some to loathsome reptiles curled round the halfdecayed bodies of sheep the intermittent soundsnow a cough now a horrible wheezing or throatclearing now a little patter of conversationwere just he declared what you hear if you stand in the lionhouse when the bones are being mauled but these comparisons did not rouse hewet who after a careless glance round the room fixed his eyes upon a thicket of native spears which were so ingeniously arranged as to run their points at you whichever way you approached them he was clearly oblivious of his surroundings whereupon hirst perceiving that hewets mind was a complete blank fixed his attention more closely upon his fellowcreatures he was too far from them however to hear what they were saying but it pleased him to construct little theories about them from their gestures and appearance  mrs thornbury had received a great many letters she was completely engrossed in them when she had finished a page she handed it to her husband or gave him the sense of what she was reading in a series of short quotations linked together by a sound at the back of her throat evie writes that george has gone to glasgow he finds mr chadbourne so nice to work with and we hope to spend christmas together but i should not like to move betty and alfred any great distance no quite right though it is difficult to imagine cold weather in this heat    eleanor and roger drove over in the new trap    eleanor certainly looked more like herself than ive seen her since the winter she has put baby on three bottles now which im sure is wise im sure it is too and so gets better nights    my hair still falls out i find it on the pillow but i am cheered by hearing from tottie hall green    muriel is in torquay enjoying herself greatly at dances she is going to show her black put after all    a line from herbertso busy poor fellow ah margaret says poor old mrs fairbank died on the eighth quite suddenly in the conservatory only a maid in the house who hadnt the presence of mind to lift her up which they think might have saved her but the doctor says it might have come at any moment and one can only feel thankful that it was in the house and not in the street i should think so the pigeons have increased terribly just as the rabbits did five years ago    while she read her husband kept nodding his head very slightly but very steadily in sign of approval  near by miss allan was reading her letters too they were not altogether pleasant as could be seen from the slight rigidity which came over her large fine face as she finished reading them and replaced them neatly in their envelopes the lines of care and responsibility on her face made her resemble an elderly man rather than a woman the letters brought her news of the failure of last years fruit crop in new zealand which was a serious matter for hubert her only brother made his living on a fruit farm and if it failed again of course he would throw up his place come back to england and what were they to do with him this time the journey out here which meant the loss of a terms work became an extravagance and not the just and wonderful holiday due to her after fifteen years of punctual lecturing and correcting essays upon english literature emily her sister who was a teacher also wrote we ought to be prepared though i have no doubt hubert will be more reasonable this time and then went on in her sensible way to say that she was enjoying a very jolly time in the lakes they are looking exceedingly pretty just now i have seldom seen the trees so forward at this time of year we have taken our lunch out several days old alice is as young as ever and asks after every one affectionately the days pass very quickly and term will soon be here political prospects not good i think privately but do not like to damp ellens enthusiasm lloyd george has taken the bill up but so have many before now and we are where we are but trust to find myself mistaken anyhow we have our work cut out for us    surely meredith lacks the human note one likes in w w she concluded and went on to discuss some questions of english literature which miss allan had raised in her last letter  at a little distance from miss allan on a seat shaded and made semiprivate by a thick clump of palm trees arthur and susan were reading each others letters the big slashing manuscripts of hockeyplaying young women in wiltshire lay on arthurs knee while susan deciphered tight little legal hands which rarely filled more than a page and always conveyed the same impression of jocular and breezy goodwill  i do hope mr hutchinson will like me arthur she said looking up  whos your loving flo asked arthur  flo gravesthe girl i told you about who was engaged to that dreadful mr vincent said susan is mr hutchinson married she asked  already her mind was busy with benevolent plans for her friends or rather with one magnificent planwhich was simple toothey were all to get marriedat oncedirectly she got back marriage marriage that was the right thing the only thing the solution required by every one she knew and a great part of her meditations was spent in tracing every instance of discomfort loneliness illhealth unsatisfied ambition restlessness eccentricity taking things up and dropping them again public speaking and philanthropic activity on the part of men and particularly on the part of women to the fact that they wanted to marry were trying to marry and had not succeeded in getting married if as she was bound to own these symptoms sometimes persisted after marriage she could only ascribe them to the unhappy law of nature which decreed that there was only one arthur venning and only one susan who could marry him her theory of course had the merit of being fully supported by her own case she had been vaguely uncomfortable at home for two or three years now and a voyage like this with her selfish old aunt who paid her fare but treated her as servant and companion in one was typical of the kind of thing people expected of her directly she became engaged mrs paley behaved with instinctive respect positively protested when susan as usual knelt down to lace her shoes and appeared really grateful for an hour of susans company where she had been used to exact two or three as her right she therefore foresaw a life of far greater comfort than she had been used to and the change had already produced a great increase of warmth in her feelings towards other people  it was close on twenty years now since mrs paley had been able to lace her own shoes or even to see them the disappearance of her feet having coincided more or less accurately with the death of her husband a man of business soon after which event mrs paley began to grow stout she was a selfish independent old woman possessed of a considerable income which she spent upon the upkeep of a house that needed seven servants and a charwoman in lancaster gate and another with a garden and carriagehorses in surrey susans engagement relieved her of the one great anxiety of her lifethat her son christopher should entangle himself with his cousin now that this familiar source of interest was removed she felt a little low and inclined to see more in susan than she used to she had decided to give her a very handsome wedding present a cheque for two hundred two hundred and fifty or possibly conceivablyit depended upon the undergardener and huths bill for doing up the drawingroomthree hundred pounds sterling  she was thinking of this very question revolving the figures as she sat in her wheeled chair with a table spread with cards by her side the patience had somehow got into a muddle and she did not like to call for susan to help her as susan seemed to be busy with arthur  shes every right to expect a handsome present from me of course she thought looking vaguely at the leopard on its hind legs and ive no doubt she does money goes a long way with every one the young are very selfish if i were to die nobody would miss me but dakyns and shell be consoled by the will however ive got no reason to complain    i can still enjoy myself im not a burden to anyone    i like a great many things a good deal in spite of my legs  being slightly depressed however she went on to think of the only people she had known who had not seemed to her at all selfish or fond of money who had seemed to her somehow rather finer than the general run people she willingly acknowledged who were finer than she was there were only two of them one was her brother who had been drowned before her eyes the other was a girl her greatest friend who had died in giving birth to her first child these things had happened some fifty years ago  they ought not to have died she thought however they didand we selfish old creatures go on the tears came to her eyes she felt a genuine regret for them a kind of respect for their youth and beauty and a kind of shame for herself but the tears did not fall and she opened one of those innumerable novels which she used to pronounce good or bad or pretty middling or really wonderful i cant think how people come to imagine such things she would say taking off her spectacles and looking up with the old faded eyes that were becoming ringed with white  just behind the stuffed leopard mr elliot was playing chess with mr pepper he was being defeated naturally for mr pepper scarcely took his eyes off the board and mr elliot kept leaning back in his chair and throwing out remarks to a gentleman who had only arrived the night before a tall handsome man with a head resembling the head of an intellectual ram after a few remarks of a general nature had passed they were discovering that they knew some of the same people as indeed had been obvious from their appearance directly they saw each other  ah yes old truefit said mr elliot he has a son at oxford ive often stayed with them its a lovely old jacobean house some exquisite greuzesone or two dutch pictures which the old boy kept in the cellars then there were stacks upon stacks of prints oh the dirt in that house he was a miser you know the boy married a daughter of lord pinwells i know them too the collecting mania tends to run in families this chap collects bucklesmens shoebuckles they must be in use between the years 1580 and 1660 the dates maynt be right but facts as i say your true collector always has some unaccountable fad of that kind on other points hes as levelheaded as a breeder of shorthorns which is what he happens to be then the pinwells as you probably know have their share of eccentricity too lady maud for instance he was interrupted here by the necessity of considering his movelady maud has a horror of cats and clergymen and people with big front teeth ive heard her shout across a table keep your mouth shut miss smith theyre as yellow as carrots across a table mind you to me shes always been civility itself she dabbles in literature likes to collect a few of us in her drawingroom but mention a clergyman a bishop even nay the archbishop himself and she gobbles like a turkeycock ive been told its a family feudsomething to do with an ancestor in the reign of charles the first yes he continued suffering check after check i always like to know something of the grandmothers of our fashionable young men in my opinion they preserve all that we admire in the eighteenth century with the advantage in the majority of cases that they are personally clean not that one would insult old lady barborough by calling her clean how often dyou think hilda he called out to his wife her ladyship takes a bath  i should hardly like to say hugh mrs elliot tittered but wearing puce velvet as she does even on the hottest august day it somehow doesnt show  pepper you have me said mr elliot my chess is even worse than i remembered he accepted his defeat with great equanimity because he really wished to talk  he drew his chair beside mr wilfrid flushing the newcomer  are these at all in your line he asked pointing at a case in front of them where highly polished crosses jewels and bits of embroidery the work of the natives were displayed to tempt visitors  shams all of them said mr flushing briefly this rug now isnt at all bad he stopped and picked up a piece of the rug at their feet not old of course but the design is quite in the right tradition alice lend me your brooch see the difference between the old work and the new  a lady who was reading with great concentration unfastened her brooch and gave it to her husband without looking at him or acknowledging the tentative bow which mr elliot was desirous of giving her if she had listened she might have been amused by the reference to old lady barborough her greataunt but oblivious of her surroundings she went on reading  the clock which had been wheezing for some minutes like an old man preparing to cough now struck nine the sound slightly disturbed certain somnolent merchants government officials and men of independent means who were lying back in their chairs chatting smoking ruminating about their affairs with their eyes half shut they raised their lids for an instant at the sound and then closed them again they had the appearance of crocodiles so fully gorged by their last meal that the future of the world gives them no anxiety whatever the only disturbance in the placid bright room was caused by a large moth which shot from light to light whizzing over elaborate heads of hair and causing several young women to raise their hands nervously and exclaim some one ought to kill it  absorbed in their own thoughts hewet and hirst had not spoken for a long time  when the clock struck hirst said  ah the creatures begin to stir    he watched them raise themselves look about them and settle down again what i abhor most of all he concluded is the female breast imagine being venning and having to get into bed with susan but the really repulsive thing is that they feel nothing at allabout what i do when i have a hot bath theyre gross theyre absurd theyre utterly intolerable  so saying and drawing no reply from hewet he proceeded to think about himself about science about cambridge about the bar about helen and what she thought of him until being very tired he was nodding off to sleep  suddenly hewet woke him up  how dyou know what you feel hirst  are you in love asked hirst he put in his eyeglass  dont be a fool said hewet  well ill sit down and think about it said hirst one really ought to if these people would only think about things the world would be a far better place for us all to live in are you trying to think  that was exactly what hewet had been doing for the last halfhour but he did not find hirst sympathetic at the moment  i shall go for a walk he said  remember we werent in bed last night said hirst with a prodigious yawn  hewet rose and stretched himself  i want to go and get a breath of air he said  an unusual feeling had been bothering him all the evening and forbidding him to settle into any one train of thought it was precisely as if he had been in the middle of a talk which interested him profoundly when some one came up and interrupted him he could not finish the talk and the longer he sat there the more he wanted to finish it as the talk that had been interrupted was a talk with rachel he had to ask himself why he felt this and why he wanted to go on talking to her hirst would merely say that he was in love with her but he was not in love with her did love begin in that way with the wish to go on talking no it always began in his case with definite physical sensations and these were now absent he did not even find her physically attractive there was something of course unusual about hershe was young inexperienced and inquisitive they had been more open with each other than was usually possible he always found girls interesting to talk to and surely these were good reasons why he should wish to go on talking to her and last night what with the crowd and the confusion he had only been able to begin to talk to her what was she doing now lying on a sofa and looking at the ceiling perhaps he could imagine her doing that and helen in an armchair with her hands on the arm of it solooking ahead of her with her great big eyesoh no theyd be talking of course about the dance but suppose rachel was going away in a day or two suppose this was the end of her visit and her father had arrived in one of the steamers anchored in the bayit was intolerable to know so little therefore he exclaimed how dyou know what you feel hirst to stop himself from thinking  but hirst did not help him and the other people with their aimless movements and their unknown lives were disturbing so that he longed for the empty darkness the first thing he looked for when he stepped out of the hall door was the light of the ambroses villa when he had definitely decided that a certain light apart from the others higher up the hill was their light he was considerably reassured there seemed to be at once a little stability in all this incoherence without any definite plan in his head he took the turning to the right and walked through the town and came to the wall by the meeting of the roads where he stopped the booming of the sea was audible the darkblue mass of the mountains rose against the paler blue of the sky there was no moon but myriads of stars and lights were anchored up and down in the dark waves of earth all round him he had meant to go back but the single light of the ambroses villa had now become three separate lights and he was tempted to go on he might as well make sure that rachel was still there walking fast he soon stood by the iron gate of their garden and pushed it open the outline of the house suddenly appeared sharply before his eyes and the thin column of the verandah cutting across the palely lit gravel of the terrace he hesitated at the back of the house some one was rattling cans he approached the front the light on the terrace showed him that the sittingrooms were on that side he stood as near the light as he could by the corner of the house the leaves of a creeper brushing his face after a moment he could hear a voice the voice went on steadily it was not talking but from the continuity of the sound it was a voice reading aloud he crept a little closer he crumpled the leaves together so as to stop their rustling about his ears it might be rachels voice he left the shadow and stepped into the radius of the light and then heard a sentence spoken quite distinctly  and there we lived from the year 1860 to 1895 the happiest years of my parents lives and there in 1862 my brother maurice was born to the delight of his parents as he was destined to be the delight of all who knew him  the voice quickened and the tone became conclusive rising slightly in pitch as if these words were at the end of the chapter hewet drew back again into the shadow there was a long silence he could just hear chairs being moved inside he had almost decided to go back when suddenly two figures appeared at the window not six feet from him  it was maurice fielding of course that your mother was engaged to said helens voice she spoke reflectively looking out into the dark garden and thinking evidently as much of the look of the night as of what she was saying  mother said rachel hewets heart leapt and he noticed the fact her voice though low was full of surprise  you didnt know that said helen  i never knew thered been any one else said rachel she was clearly surprised but all they said was said low and inexpressively because they were speaking out into the cool dark night  more people were in love with her than with any one ive ever known helen stated she had that powershe enjoyed things she wasnt beautiful buti was thinking of her last night at the dance she got on with every kind of person and then she made it all so amazinglyfunny  it appeared that helen was going back into the past choosing her words deliberately comparing theresa with the people she had known since theresa died  i dont know how she did it she continued and ceased and there was a long pause in which a little owl called first here then there as it moved from tree to tree in the garden  thats so like aunt lucy and aunt katie said rachel at last they always make out that she was very sad and very good  then why for goodness sake did they do nothing but criticize her when she was alive said helen very gentle their voices sounded as if they fell through the waves of the sea  if i were to die tomorrow    she began  the broken sentences had an extraordinary beauty and detachment in hewets ears and a kind of mystery too as though they were spoken by people in their sleep  no rachel helens voice continued im not going to walk in the garden its dampits sure to be damp besides i see at least a dozen toads  toads those are stones helen come out its nicer out the flowers smell rachel replied  hewet drew still farther back his heart was beating very quickly apparently rachel tried to pull helen out on to the terrace and helen resisted there was a certain amount of scuffling entreating resisting and laughter from both of them then a mans form appeared hewet could not hear what they were all saying in a minute they had gone in he could hear bolts grating then there was dead silence and all the lights went out  he turned away still crumpling and uncrumpling a handful of leaves which he had torn from the wall an exquisite sense of pleasure and relief possessed him it was all so solid and peaceful after the ball at the hotel whether he was in love with them or not and he was not in love with them no but it was good that they should be alive  after standing still for a minute or two he turned and began to walk towards the gate with the movement of his body the excitement the romance and the richness of life crowded into his brain he shouted out a line of poetry but the words escaped him and he stumbled among lines and fragments of lines which had no meaning at all except for the beauty of the words he shut the gate and ran swinging from side to side down the hill shouting any nonsense that came into his head here am i he cried rhythmically as his feet pounded to the left and to the right plunging along like an elephant in the jungle stripping the branches as i go he snatched at the twigs of a bush at the roadside roaring innumerable words lovely words about innumerable things running downhill and talking nonsense aloud to myself about roads and leaves and lights and women coming out into the darknessabout womenabout rachel about rachel he stopped and drew a deep breath the night seemed immense and hospitable and although so dark there seemed to be things moving down there in the harbour and movement out at sea he gazed until the darkness numbed him and then he walked on quickly still murmuring to himself and i ought to be in bed snoring and dreaming dreaming dreaming dreams and realities dreams and realities dreams and realities he repeated all the way up the avenue scarcely knowing what he said until he reached the front door here he paused for a second and collected himself before he opened the door  his eyes were dazed his hands very cold and his brain excited and yet half asleep inside the door everything was as he had left it except that the hall was now empty there were the chairs turning in towards each other where people had sat talking and the empty glasses on little tables and the newspapers scattered on the floor as he shut the door he felt as if he were enclosed in a square box and instantly shrivelled up it was all very bright and very small he stopped for a minute by the long table to find a paper which he had meant to read but he was still too much under the influence of the dark and the fresh air to consider carefully which paper it was or where he had seen it  as he fumbled vaguely among the papers he saw a figure cross the tail of his eye coming downstairs he heard the swishing sound of skirts and to his great surprise evelyn m came up to him laid her hand on the table as if to prevent him from taking up a paper and said  youre just the person i wanted to talk to her voice was a little unpleasant and metallic her eyes were very bright and she kept them fixed upon him  to talk to me he repeated but im half asleep  but i think you understand better than most people she answered and sat down on a little chair placed beside a big leather chair so that hewet had to sit down beside her  well he said he yawned openly and lit a cigarette he could not believe that this was really happening to him what is it  are you really sympathetic or is it just a pose she demanded  its for you to say he replied im interested i think he still felt numb all over and as if she was much too close to him  any one can be interested she cried impatiently your friend mr hirsts interested i daresay however i do believe in you you look as if youd got a nice sister somehow she paused picking at some sequins on her knees and then as if she had made up her mind she started off anyhow im going to ask your advice dyou ever get into a state where you dont know your own mind thats the state im in now you see last night at the dance raymond oliverhes the tall dark boy who looks as if he had indian blood in him but he says hes not reallywell we were sitting out together and he told me all about himself how unhappy he is at home and how he hates being out here theyve put him into some beastly mining business he says its beastlyi should like it i know but thats neither here nor there and i felt awfully sorry for him one couldnt help being sorry for him and when he asked me to let him kiss me i did i dont see any harm in that do you and then this morning he said hed thought i meant something more and i wasnt the sort to let any one kiss me and we talked and talked i daresay i was very silly but one cant help liking people when ones sorry for them i do like him most awfully she paused so i gave him half a promise and then you see theres alfred perrott  oh perrott said hewet  we got to know each other on that picnic the other day she continued he seemed so lonely especially as arthur had gone off with susan and one couldnt help guessing what was in his mind so we had quite a long talk when you were looking at the ruins and he told me all about his life and his struggles and how fearfully hard it had been dyou know he was a boy in a grocers shop and took parcels to peoples houses in a basket that interested me awfully because i always say it doesnt matter how youre born if youve got the right stuff in you and he told me about his sister whos paralysed poor girl and one can see shes a great trial though hes evidently very devoted to her i must say i do admire people like that i dont expect you do because youre so clever well last night we sat out in the garden together and i couldnt help seeing what he wanted to say and comforting him a little and telling him i did carei really doonly then theres raymond oliver what i want you to tell me is can one be in love with two people at once or cant one  she became silent and sat with her chin on her hands looking very intent as if she were facing a real problem which had to be discussed between them  i think it depends what sort of person you are said hewet he looked at her she was small and pretty aged perhaps twentyeight or twentynine but though dashing and sharply cut her features expressed nothing very clearly except a great deal of spirit and good health  who are you what are you you see i know nothing about you he continued  well i was coming to that said evelyn m she continued to rest her chin on her hands and to look intently ahead of her im the daughter of a mother and no father if that interests you she said its not a very nice thing to be its what often happens in the country she was a farmers daughter and he was rather a swellthe young man up at the great house he never made things straightnever married herthough he allowed us quite a lot of money his people wouldnt let him poor father i cant help liking him mother wasnt the sort of woman who could keep him straight anyhow he was killed in the war i believe his men worshipped him they say great big troopers broke down and cried over his body on the battlefield i wish id known him mother had all the life crushed out of her the world she clenched her fist oh people can be horrid to a woman like that she turned upon hewet  well she said dyou want to know any more about me  but you he asked who looked after you  ive looked after myself mostly she laughed ive had splendid friends i do like people thats the trouble what would you do if you liked two people both of them tremendously and you couldnt tell which most  i should go on liking themi should wait and see why not  but one has to make up ones mind said evelyn or are you one of the people who doesnt believe in marriages and all that look herethis isnt fair i do all the telling and you tell nothing perhaps youre the same as your friendshe looked at him suspiciously perhaps you dont like me  i dont know you said hewet  i know when i like a person directly i see them i knew i liked you the very first night at dinner oh dear she continued impatiently what a lot of bother would be saved if only people would say the things they think straight out im made like that i cant help it  but dont you find it leads to difficulties hewet asked  thats mens fault she answered they always drag it inlove i mean  and so youve gone on having one proposal after another said hewet  i dont suppose ive had more proposals than most women said evelyn but she spoke without conviction  five six ten hewet ventured  evelyn seemed to intimate that perhaps ten was the right figure but that it really was not a high one  i believe youre thinking me a heartless flirt she protested but i dont care if you are i dont care what any one thinks of me just because ones interested and likes to be friends with men and talk to them as one talks to women ones called a flirt  but miss murgatroyd  i wish youd call me evelyn she interrupted  after ten proposals do you honestly think that men are the same as women  honestly honestlyhow i hate that word its always used by prigs cried evelyn honestly i think they ought to be thats whats so disappointing every time one thinks its not going to happen and every time it does  the pursuit of friendship said hewet the title of a comedy  youre horrid she cried you dont care a bit really you might be mr hirst  well said hewet lets consider let us consider he paused because for the moment he could not remember what it was that they had to consider he was far more interested in her than in her story for as she went on speaking his numbness had disappeared and he was conscious of a mixture of liking pity and distrust youve promised to marry both oliver and perrott he concluded  not exactly promised said evelyn i cant make up my mind which i really like best oh how i detest modern life she flung off it must have been so much easier for the elizabethans i thought the other day on that mountain how id have liked to be one of those colonists to cut down trees and make laws and all that instead of fooling about with all these people who think ones just a pretty young lady though im not i really might do something she reflected in silence for a minute then she said  im afraid right down in my heart that alfred perrot wont do hes not strong is he  perhaps he couldnt cut down a tree said hewet have you never cared for anybody he asked  ive cared for heaps of people but not to marry them she said i suppose im too fastidious all my life ive wanted somebody i could look up to somebody great and big and splendid most men are so small  what dyou mean by splendid hewet asked people arenothing more  evelyn was puzzled  we dont care for people because of their qualities he tried to explain its just them that we care forhe struck a matchjust that he said pointing to the flames  i see what you mean she said but i dont agree i do know why i care for people and i think im hardly ever wrong i see at once what theyve got in them now i think you must be rather splendid but not mr hirst  hewlet shook his head  hes not nearly so unselfish or so sympathetic or so big or so understanding evelyn continued  hewet sat silent smoking his cigarette  i should hate cutting down trees he remarked  im not trying to flirt with you though i suppose you think i am evelyn shot out id never have come to you if id thought youd merely think odious things of me the tears came into her eyes  do you never flirt he asked  of course i dont she protested havent i told you i want friendship i want to care for some one greater and nobler than i am and if they fall in love with me it isnt my fault i dont want it i positively hate it  hewet could see that there was very little use in going on with the conversation for it was obvious that evelyn did not wish to say anything in particular but to impress upon him an image of herself being for some reason which she would not reveal unhappy or insecure he was very tired and a pale waiter kept walking ostentatiously into the middle of the room and looking at them meaningly  they want to shut up he said my advice is that you should tell oliver and perrott tomorrow that youve made up your mind that you dont mean to marry either of them im certain you dont if you change your mind you can always tell them so theyre both sensible men theyll understand and then all this bother will be over he got up  but evelyn did not move she sat looking up at him with her bright eager eyes in the depths of which he thought he detected some disappointment or dissatisfaction  goodnight he said  there are heaps of things i want to say to you still she said and im going to some time i suppose you must go to bed now  yes said hewet im half asleep he left her still sitting by herself in the empty hall  why is it that they wont be honest he muttered to himself as he went upstairs why was it that relations between different people were so unsatisfactory so fragmentary so hazardous and words so dangerous that the instinct to sympathise with another human being was an instinct to be examined carefully and probably crushed what had evelyn really wished to say to him what was she feeling left alone in the empty hall the mystery of life and the unreality even of ones own sensations overcame him as he walked down the corridor which led to his room it was dimly lighted but sufficiently for him to see a figure in a bright dressinggown pass swiftly in front of him the figure of a woman crossing from one room to another      chapter xv   whether too slight or too vague the ties that bind people casually meeting in a hotel at midnight they possess one advantage at least over the bonds which unite the elderly who have lived together once and so must live for ever slight they may be but vivid and genuine merely because the power to break them is within the grasp of each and there is no reason for continuance except a true desire that continue they shall when two people have been married for years they seem to become unconscious of each others bodily presence so that they move as if alone speak aloud things which they do not expect to be answered and in general seem to experience all the comfort of solitude without its loneliness the joint lives of ridley and helen had arrived at this stage of community and it was often necessary for one or the other to recall with an effort whether a thing had been said or only thought shared or dreamt in private at four oclock in the afternoon two or three days later mrs ambrose was standing brushing her hair while her husband was in the dressingroom which opened out of her room and occasionally through the cascade of waterhe was washing his faceshe caught exclamations so it goes on year after year i wish i wish i wish i could make an end of it to which she paid no attention  its white or only brown thus she herself murmured examining a hair which gleamed suspiciously among the brown she pulled it out and laid it on the dressingtable she was criticising her own appearance or rather approving of it standing a little way back from the glass and looking at her own face with superb pride and melancholy when her husband appeared in the doorway in his shirt sleeves his face half obscured by a towel  you often tell me i dont notice things he remarked  tell me if this is a white hair then she replied she laid the hair on his hand  theres not a white hair on your head he exclaimed  ah ridley i begin to doubt she sighed and bowed her head under his eyes so that he might judge but the inspection produced only a kiss where the line of parting ran and husband and wife then proceeded to move about the room casually murmuring  what was that you were saying helen remarked after an interval of conversation which no third person could have understood  rachelyou ought to keep an eye upon rachel he observed significantly and helen though she went on brushing her hair looked at him his observations were apt to be true  young gentlemen dont interest themselves in young womens education without a motive he remarked  oh hirst said helen  hirst and hewet theyre all the same to meall covered with spots he replied he advises her to read gibbon did you know that  helen did not know that but she would not allow herself inferior to her husband in powers of observation she merely said  nothing would surprise me even that dreadful flying man we met at the danceeven mr dallowayeven  i advise you to be circumspect said ridley theres willoughby rememberwilloughby he pointed at a letter  helen looked with a sigh at an envelope which lay upon her dressingtable yes there lay willoughby curt inexpressive perpetually jocular robbing a whole continent of mystery enquiring after his daughters manners and moralshoping she wasnt a bore and bidding them pack her off to him on board the very next ship if she wereand then grateful and affectionate with suppressed emotion and then half a page about his own triumphs over wretched little natives who went on strike and refused to load his ships until he roared english oaths at them popping my head out of the window just as i was in my shirt sleeves the beggars had the sense to scatter  if theresa married willoughby she remarked turning the page with a hairpin one doesnt see whats to prevent rachel  but ridley was now off on grievances of his own connected with the washing of his shirts which somehow led to the frequent visits of hughling elliot who was a bore a pedant a dry stick of a man and yet ridley couldnt simply point at the door and tell him to go the truth of it was they saw too many people and so on and so on more conjugal talk pattering softly and unintelligibly until they were both ready to go down to tea  the first thing that caught helens eye as she came downstairs was a carriage at the door filled with skirts and feathers nodding on the tops of hats she had only time to gain the drawingroom before two names were oddly mispronounced by the spanish maid and mrs thornbury came in slightly in advance of mrs wilfrid flushing  mrs wilfrid flushing said mrs thornbury with a wave of her hand a friend of our common friend mrs raymond parry  mrs flushing shook hands energetically she was a woman of forty perhaps very well set up and erect splendidly robust though not as tall as the upright carriage of her body made her appear  she looked helen straight in the face and said you have a charmin house  she had a strongly marked face her eyes looked straight at you and though naturally she was imperious in her manner she was nervous at the same time mrs thornbury acted as interpreter making things smooth all round by a series of charming commonplace remarks  ive taken it upon myself mr ambrose she said to promise that you will be so kind as to give mrs flushing the benefit of your experience im sure no one here knows the country as well as you do no one takes such wonderful long walks no one im sure has your encyclopaedic knowledge upon every subject mr wilfrid flushing is a collector he has discovered really beautiful things already i had no notion that the peasants were so artisticthough of course in the past  not old thingsnew things interrupted mrs flushing curtly that is if he takes my advice  the ambroses had not lived for many years in london without knowing something of a good many people by name at least and helen remembered hearing of the flushings mr flushing was a man who kept an old furniture shop he had always said he would not marry because most women have red cheeks and would not take a house because most houses have narrow staircases and would not eat meat because most animals bleed when they are killed and then he had married an eccentric aristocratic lady who certainly was not pale who looked as if she ate meat who had forced him to do all the things he most dislikedand this then was the lady helen looked at her with interest they had moved out into the garden where the tea was laid under a tree and mrs flushing was helping herself to cherry jam she had a peculiar jerking movement of the body when she spoke which caused the canarycoloured plume on her hat to jerk too her small but finelycut and vigorous features together with the deep red of lips and cheeks pointed to many generations of welltrained and wellnourished ancestors behind her  nothin thats more than twenty years old interests me she continued mouldy old pictures dirty old books they stick em in museums when theyre only fit for burnin  i quite agree helen laughed but my husband spends his life in digging up manuscripts which nobody wants she was amused by ridleys expression of startled disapproval  theres a clever man in london called john who paints ever so much better than the old masters mrs flushing continued his pictures excite menothin thats old excites me  but even his pictures will become old mrs thornbury intervened  then ill have em burnt or ill put it in my will said mrs flushing  and mrs flushing lived in one of the most beautiful old houses in englandchillingley mrs thornbury explained to the rest of them  if id my way id burn that tomorrow mrs flushing laughed she had a laugh like the cry of a jay at once startling and joyless  what does any sane person want with those great big houses she demanded if you go downstairs after dark youre covered with black beetles and the electric lights always goin out what would you do if spiders came out of the tap when you turned on the hot water she demanded fixing her eye on helen  mrs ambrose shrugged her shoulders with a smile  this is what i like said mrs flushing she jerked her head at the villa a little house in a garden i had one once in ireland one could lie in bed in the mornin and pick roses outside the window with ones toes  and the gardeners werent they surprised mrs thornbury enquired  there were no gardeners mrs flushing chuckled nobody but me and an old woman without any teeth you know the poor in ireland lose their teeth after theyre twenty but you wouldnt expect a politician to understand thatarthur balfour wouldnt understand that  ridley sighed that he never expected any one to understand anything least of all politicians  however he concluded theres one advantage i find in extreme old agenothing matters a hang except ones food and ones digestion all i ask is to be left alone to moulder away in solitude its obvious that the worlds going as fast as it can tothe nethermost pit and all i can do is to sit still and consume as much of my own smoke as possible he groaned and with a melancholy glance laid the jam on his bread for he felt the atmosphere of this abrupt lady distinctly unsympathetic  i always contradict my husband when he says that said mrs thornbury sweetly you men where would you be if it werent for the women  read the symposium said ridley grimly  symposium cried mrs flushing thats latin or greek tell me is there a good translation  no said ridley you will have to learn greek  mrs flushing cried ah ah ah id rather break stones in the road i always envy the men who break stones and sit on those nice little heaps all day wearin spectacles id infinitely rather break stones than clean out poultry runs or feed the cows or  here rachel came up from the lower garden with a book in her hand  whats that book said ridley when she had shaken hands  its gibbon said rachel as she sat down  the decline and fall of the roman empire said mrs thornbury a very wonderful book i know my dear father was always quoting it at us with the result that we resolved never to read a line  gibbon the historian enquired mrs flushing i connect him with some of the happiest hours of my life we used to lie in bed and read gibbonabout the massacres of the christians i rememberwhen we were supposed to be asleep its no joke i can tell you readin a great big book in double columns by a nightlight and the light that comes through a chink in the door then there were the mothstiger moths yellow moths and horrid cockchafers louisa my sister would have the window open i wanted it shut we fought every night of our lives over that window have you ever seen a moth dyin in a nightlight she enquired  again there was an interruption hewet and hirst appeared at the drawingroom window and came up to the teatable  rachels heart beat hard she was conscious of an extraordinary intensity in everything as though their presence stripped some cover off the surface of things but the greetings were remarkably commonplace  excuse me said hirst rising from his chair directly he had sat down he went into the drawingroom and returned with a cushion which he placed carefully upon his seat  rheumatism he remarked as he sat down for the second time  the result of the dance helen enquired  whenever i get at all run down i tend to be rheumatic hirst stated he bent his wrist back sharply i hear little pieces of chalk grinding together  rachel looked at him she was amused and yet she was respectful if such a thing could be the upper part of her face seemed to laugh and the lower part to check its laughter  hewet picked up the book that lay on the ground  you like this he asked in an undertone  no i dont like it she replied she had indeed been trying all the afternoon to read it and for some reason the glory which she had perceived at first had faded and read as she would she could not grasp the meaning with her mind  it goes round round round like a roll of oilcloth she hazarded evidently she meant hewet alone to hear her words but hirst demanded what dyou mean  she was instantly ashamed of her figure of speech for she could not explain it in words of sober criticism  surely its the most perfect style so far as style goes thats ever been invented he continued every sentence is practically perfect and the wit  ugly in body repulsive in mind she thought instead of thinking about gibbons style yes but strong searching unyielding in mind she looked at his big head a disproportionate part of which was occupied by the forehead and at the direct severe eyes  i give you up in despair he said he meant it lightly but she took it seriously and believed that her value as a human being was lessened because she did not happen to admire the style of gibbon the others were talking now in a group about the native villages which mrs flushing ought to visit  i despair too she said impetuously how are you going to judge people merely by their minds  you agree with my spinster aunt i expect said st john in his jaunty manner which was always irritating because it made the person he talked to appear unduly clumsy and in earnest be good sweet maidi thought mr kingsley and my aunt were now obsolete  one can be very nice without having read a book she asserted very silly and simple her words sounded and laid her open to derision  did i ever deny it hirst enquired raising his eyebrows  most unexpectedly mrs thornbury here intervened either because it was her mission to keep things smooth or because she had long wished to speak to mr hirst feeling as she did that young men were her sons  i have lived all my life with people like your aunt mr hirst she said leaning forward in her chair her brown squirrellike eyes became even brighter than usual they have never heard of gibbon they only care for their pheasants and their peasants they are great big men who look so fine on horseback as people must have done i think in the days of the great wars say what you like against themthey are animal they are unintellectual they dont read themselves and they dont want others to read but they are some of the finest and the kindest human beings on the face of the earth you would be surprised at some of the stories i could tell you have never guessed perhaps at all the romances that go on in the heart of the country there are the people i feel among whom shakespeare will be born if he is ever born again in those old houses up among the downs  my aunt hirst interrupted spends her life in east lambeth among the degraded poor i only quoted my aunt because she is inclined to persecute people she calls intellectual which is what i suspect miss vinrace of doing its all the fashion now if youre clever its always taken for granted that youre completely without sympathy understanding affectionall the things that really matter oh you christians youre the most conceited patronising hypocritical set of old humbugs in the kingdom of course he continued im the first to allow your country gentlemen great merits for one thing theyre probably quite frank about their passions which we are not my father who is a clergyman in norfolk says that there is hardly a squire in the country who does not  but about gibbon hewet interrupted the look of nervous tension which had come over every face was relaxed by the interruption  you find him monotonous i suppose but you know he opened the book and began searching for passages to read aloud and in a little time he found a good one which he considered suitable but there was nothing in the world that bored ridley more than being read aloud to and he was besides scrupulously fastidious as to the dress and behaviour of ladies in the space of fifteen minutes he had decided against mrs flushing on the ground that her orange plume did not suit her complexion that she spoke too loud that she crossed her legs and finally when he saw her accept a cigarette that hewet offered her he jumped up exclaiming something about bar parlours and left them mrs flushing was evidently relieved by his departure she puffed her cigarette stuck her legs out and examined helen closely as to the character and reputation of their common friend mrs raymond parry by a series of little strategems she drove her to define mrs parry as somewhat elderly by no means beautiful very much made upan insolent old harridan in short whose parties were amusing because one met odd people but helen herself always pitied poor mr parry who was understood to be shut up downstairs with cases full of gems while his wife enjoyed herself in the drawingroom not that i believe what people say against heralthough she hints of course upon which mrs flushing cried out with delight  shes my first cousin go ongo on  when mrs flushing rose to go she was obviously delighted with her new acquaintances she made three or four different plans for meeting or going on an expedition or showing helen the things they had bought on her way to the carriage she included them all in a vague but magnificent invitation  as helen returned to the garden again ridleys words of warning came into her head and she hesitated a moment and looked at rachel sitting between hirst and hewet but she could draw no conclusions for hewet was still reading gibbon aloud and rachel for all the expression she had might have been a shell and his words water rubbing against her ears as water rubs a shell on the edge of a rock  hewets voice was very pleasant when he reached the end of the period hewet stopped and no one volunteered any criticism  i do adore the aristocracy hirst exclaimed after a moments pause theyre so amazingly unscrupulous none of us would dare to behave as that woman behaves  what i like about them said helen as she sat down is that theyre so well put together naked mrs flushing would be superb dressed as she dresses its absurd of course  yes said hirst a shade of depression crossed his face ive never weighed more than ten stone in my life he said which is ridiculous considering my height and ive actually gone down in weight since we came here i daresay that accounts for the rheumatism again he jerked his wrist back sharply so that helen might hear the grinding of the chalk stones she could not help smiling  its no laughing matter for me i assure you he protested my mothers a chronic invalid and im always expecting to be told that ive got heart disease myself rheumatism always goes to the heart in the end  for goodness sake hirst hewet protested one might think you were an old cripple of eighty if it comes to that i had an aunt who died of cancer myself but i put a bold face on it he rose and began tilting his chair backwards and forwards on its hind legs is any one here inclined for a walk he said theres a magnificent walk up behind the house you come out on to a cliff and look right down into the sea the rocks are all red you can see them through the water the other day i saw a sight that fairly took my breath awayabout twenty jellyfish semitransparent pink with long streamers floating on the top of the waves  sure they werent mermaids said hirst its much too hot to climb uphill he looked at helen who showed no signs of moving  yes its too hot helen decided  there was a short silence  id like to come said rachel  but she might have said that anyhow helen thought to herself as hewet and rachel went away together and helen was left alone with st john to st johns obvious satisfaction  he may have been satisfied but his usual difficulty in deciding that one subject was more deserving of notice than another prevented him from speaking for some time he sat staring intently at the head of a dead match while helen consideredso it seemed from the expression of her eyessomething not closely connected with the present moment  at last st john exclaimed damn damn everything damn everybody he added at cambridge there are people to talk to  at cambridge there are people to talk to helen echoed him rhythmically and absentmindedly then she woke up by the way have you settled what youre going to dois it to be cambridge or the bar  he pursed his lips but made no immediate answer for helen was still slightly inattentive she had been thinking about rachel and which of the two young men she was likely to fall in love with and now sitting opposite to hirst she thought hes ugly its a pity theyre so ugly  she did not include hewet in this criticism she was thinking of the clever honest interesting young men she knew of whom hirst was a good example and wondering whether it was necessary that thought and scholarship should thus maltreat their bodies and should thus elevate their minds to a very high tower from which the human race appeared to them like rats and mice squirming on the flat  and the future she reflected vaguely envisaging a race of men becoming more and more like hirst and a race of women becoming more and more like rachel oh no she concluded glancing at him one wouldnt marry you well then the future of the race is in the hands of susan and arthur nothats dreadful of farm labourers nonot of the english at all but of russians and chinese this train of thought did not satisfy her and was interrupted by st john who began again  i wish you knew bennett hes the greatest man in the world  bennett she enquired becoming more at ease st john dropped the concentrated abruptness of his manner and explained that bennett was a man who lived in an old windmill six miles out of cambridge he lived the perfect life according to st john very lonely very simple caring only for the truth of things always ready to talk and extraordinarily modest though his mind was of the greatest  dont you think said st john when he had done describing him that kind of thing makes this kind of thing rather flimsy did you notice at tea how poor old hewet had to change the conversation how they were all ready to pounce upon me because they thought i was going to say something improper it wasnt anything really if bennett had been there hed have said exactly what he meant to say or hed have got up and gone but theres something rather bad for the character in thati mean if one hasnt got bennetts character its inclined to make one bitter should you say that i was bitter  helen did not answer and he continued  of course i am disgustingly bitter and its a beastly thing to be but the worst of me is that im so envious i envy every one i cant endure people who do things better than i doperfectly absurd things toowaiters balancing piles of plateseven arthur because susans in love with him i want people to like me and they dont its partly my appearance i expect he continued though its an absolute lie to say ive jewish blood in meas a matter of fact weve been in norfolk hirst of hirstbourne hall for three centuries at least it must be awfully soothing to be like youevery one liking one at once  i assure you they dont helen laughed  they do said hirst with conviction in the first place youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen in the second you have an exceptionally nice nature  if hirst had looked at her instead of looking intently at his teacup he would have seen helen blush partly with pleasure partly with an impulse of affection towards the young man who had seemed and would seem again so ugly and so limited she pitied him for she suspected that he suffered and she was interested in him for many of the things he said seemed to her true she admired the morality of youth and yet she felt imprisoned as if her instinct were to escape to something brightly coloured and impersonal which she could hold in her hands she went into the house and returned with her embroidery but he was not interested in her embroidery he did not even look at it  about miss vinrace he beganoh look here do lets be st john and helen and rachel and terencewhats she like does she reason does she feel or is she merely a kind of footstool  oh no said helen with great decision from her observations at tea she was inclined to doubt whether hirst was the person to educate rachel she had gradually come to be interested in her niece and fond of her she disliked some things about her very much she was amused by others but she felt her on the whole a live if unformed human being experimental and not always fortunate in her experiments but with powers of some kind and a capacity for feeling somewhere in the depths of her too she was bound to rachel by the indestructible if inexplicable ties of sex she seems vague but shes a will of her own she said as if in the interval she had run through her qualities  the embroidery which was a matter for thought the design being difficult and the colours wanting consideration brought lapses into the dialogue when she seemed to be engrossed in her skeins of silk or with head a little drawn back and eyes narrowed considered the effect of the whole thus she merely said ummm to st johns next remark i shall ask her to go for a walk with me  perhaps he resented this division of attention he sat silent watching helen closely  youre absolutely happy he proclaimed at last  yes helen enquired sticking in her needle  marriage i suppose said st john  yes said helen gently drawing her needle out  children st john enquired  yes said helen sticking her needle in again i dont know why im happy she suddenly laughed looking him full in the face there was a considerable pause  theres an abyss between us said st john his voice sounded as if it issued from the depths of a cavern in the rocks youre infinitely simpler than i am women always are of course thats the difficulty one never knows how a woman gets there supposing all the time youre thinking oh what a morbid young man  helen sat and looked at him with her needle in her hand from her position she saw his head in front of the dark pyramid of a magnoliatree with one foot raised on the rung of a chair and her elbow out in the attitude for sewing her own figure possessed the sublimity of a womans of the early world spinning the thread of fatethe sublimity possessed by many women of the present day who fall into the attitude required by scrubbing or sewing st john looked at her  i suppose youve never paid any a compliment in the course of your life he said irrelevantly  i spoil ridley rather helen considered  im going to ask you point blankdo you like me  after a certain pause she replied yes certainly  thank god he exclaimed thats one mercy you see he continued with emotion id rather you liked me than any one ive ever met  what about the five philosophers said helen with a laugh stitching firmly and swiftly at her canvas i wish youd describe them  hirst had no particular wish to describe them but when he began to consider them he found himself soothed and strengthened far away to the other side of the world as they were in smoky rooms and grey medieval courts they appeared remarkable figures freespoken men with whom one could be at ease incomparably more subtle in emotion than the people here they gave him certainly what no woman could give him not helen even warming at the thought of them he went on to lay his case before mrs ambrose should he stay on at cambridge or should he go to the bar one day he thought one thing another day another helen listened attentively at last without any preface she pronounced her decision  leave cambridge and go to the bar she said he pressed her for her reasons  i think youd enjoy london more she said it did not seem a very subtle reason but she appeared to think it sufficient she looked at him against the background of flowering magnolia there was something curious in the sight perhaps it was that the heavy waxlike flowers were so smooth and inarticulate and his facehe had thrown his hat away his hair was rumpled he held his eyeglasses in his hand so that a red mark appeared on either side of his nosewas so worried and garrulous it was a beautiful bush spreading very widely and all the time she had sat there talking she had been noticing the patches of shade and the shape of the leaves and the way the great white flowers sat in the midst of the green she had noticed it halfconsciously nevertheless the pattern had become part of their talk she laid down her sewing and began to walk up and down the garden and hirst rose too and paced by her side he was rather disturbed uncomfortable and full of thought neither of them spoke  the sun was beginning to go down and a change had come over the mountains as if they were robbed of their earthly substance and composed merely of intense blue mist long thin clouds of flamingo red with edges like the edges of curled ostrich feathers lay up and down the sky at different altitudes the roofs of the town seemed to have sunk lower than usual the cypresses appeared very black between the roofs and the roofs themselves were brown and white as usual in the evening single cries and single bells became audible rising from beneath  st john stopped suddenly  well you must take the responsibility he said ive made up my mind i shall go to the bar  his words were very serious almost emotional they recalled helen after a seconds hesitation  im sure youre right she said warmly and shook the hand he held out youll be a great man im certain  then as if to make him look at the scene she swept her hand round the immense circumference of the view from the sea over the roofs of the town across the crests of the mountains over the river and the plain and again across the crests of the mountains it swept until it reached the villa the garden the magnoliatree and the figures of hirst and herself standing together when it dropped to her side      chapter xvi   hewet and rachel had long ago reached the particular place on the edge of the cliff where looking down into the sea you might chance on jellyfish and dolphins looking the other way the vast expanse of land gave them a sensation which is given by no view however extended in england the villages and the hills there having names and the farthest horizon of hills as often as not dipping and showing a line of mist which is the sea here the view was one of infinite sundried earth earth pointed in pinnacles heaped in vast barriers earth widening and spreading away and away like the immense floor of the sea earth chequered by day and by night and partitioned into different lands where famous cities were founded and the races of men changed from dark savages to white civilised men and back to dark savages again perhaps their english blood made this prospect uncomfortably impersonal and hostile to them for having once turned their faces that way they next turned them to the sea and for the rest of the time sat looking at the sea the sea though it was a thin and sparkling water here which seemed incapable of surge or anger eventually narrowed itself clouded its pure tint with grey and swirled through narrow channels and dashed in a shiver of broken waters against massive granite rocks it was this sea that flowed up to the mouth of the thames and the thames washed the roots of the city of london  hewets thoughts had followed some such course as this for the first thing he said as they stood on the edge of the cliff was  id like to be in england  rachel lay down on her elbow and parted the tall grasses which grew on the edge so that she might have a clear view the water was very calm rocking up and down at the base of the cliff and so clear that one could see the red of the stones at the bottom of it so it had been at the birth of the world and so it had remained ever since probably no human being had ever broken that water with boat or with body obeying some impulse she determined to mar that eternity of peace and threw the largest pebble she could find it struck the water and the ripples spread out and out hewet looked down too  its wonderful he said as they widened and ceased the freshness and the newness seemed to him wonderful he threw a pebble next there was scarcely any sound  but england rachel murmured in the absorbed tone of one whose eyes are concentrated upon some sight what dyou want with england  my friends chiefly he said and all the things one does  he could look at rachel without her noticing it she was still absorbed in the water and the exquisitely pleasant sensations which a little depth of the sea washing over rocks suggests he noticed that she was wearing a dress of deep blue colour made of a soft thin cotton stuff which clung to the shape of her body it was a body with the angles and hollows of a young womans body not yet developed but in no way distorted and thus interesting and even lovable raising his eyes hewet observed her head she had taken her hat off and the face rested on her hand as she looked down into the sea her lips were slightly parted the expression was one of childlike intentness as if she were watching for a fish to swim past over the clear red rocks nevertheless her twentyfour years of life had given her a look of reserve her hand which lay on the ground the fingers curling slightly in was well shaped and competent the squaretipped and nervous fingers were the fingers of a musician with something like anguish hewet realised that far from being unattractive her body was very attractive to him she looked up suddenly her eyes were full of eagerness and interest  you write novels she asked  for the moment he could not think what he was saying he was overcome with the desire to hold her in his arms  oh yes he said that is i want to write them  she would not take her large grey eyes off his face  novels she repeated why do you write novels you ought to write music music you seeshe shifted her eyes and became less desirable as her brain began to work inflicting a certain change upon her facemusic goes straight for things it says all there is to say at once with writing it seems to me theres so muchshe paused for an expression and rubbed her fingers in the earthscratching on the matchbox most of the time when i was reading gibbon this afternoon i was horribly oh infernally damnably bored she gave a shake of laughter looking at hewet who laughed too  i shant lend you books he remarked  why is it rachel continued that i can laugh at mr hirst to you but not to his face at tea i was completely overwhelmed not by his uglinessby his mind she enclosed a circle in the air with her hands she realised with a great sense of comfort who easily she could talk to hewet those thorns or ragged corners which tear the surface of some relationships being smoothed away  so i observed said hewet thats a thing that never ceases to amaze me he had recovered his composure to such an extent that he could light and smoke a cigarette and feeling her ease became happy and easy himself  the respect that women even welleducated very able women have for men he went on i believe we must have the sort of power over you that were said to have over horses they see us three times as big as we are or theyd never obey us for that very reason im inclined to doubt that youll ever do anything even when you have the vote he looked at her reflectively she appeared very smooth and sensitive and young itll take at least six generations before youre sufficiently thickskinned to go into law courts and business offices consider what a bully the ordinary man is he continued the ordinary hardworking rather ambitious solicitor or man of business with a family to bring up and a certain position to maintain and then of course the daughters have to give way to the sons the sons have to be educated they have to bully and shove for their wives and families and so it all comes over again and meanwhile there are the women in the background    do you really think that the vote will do you any good  the vote rachel repeated she had to visualise it as a little bit of paper which she dropped into a box before she understood his question and looking at each other they smiled at something absurd in the question  not to me she said but i play the piano    are men really like that she asked returning to the question that interested her im not afraid of you she looked at him easily  oh im different hewet replied ive got between six and seven hundred a year of my own and then no one takes a novelist seriously thank heavens theres no doubt it helps to make up for the drudgery of a profession if a mans taken very very seriously by every oneif he gets appointments and has offices and a title and lots of letters after his name and bits of ribbon and degrees i dont grudge it em though sometimes it comes over mewhat an amazing concoction what a miracle the masculine conception of life isjudges civil servants army navy houses of parliament lord mayorswhat a world weve made of it look at hirst now i assure you he said not a days passed since we came here without a discussion as to whether hes to stay on at cambridge or to go to the bar its his careerhis sacred career and if ive heard it twenty times im sure his mother and sister have heard it five hundred times cant you imagine the family conclaves and the sister told to run out and feed the rabbits because st john must have the schoolroom to himselfst johns working st john wants his tea brought to him dont you know the kind of thing no wonder that st john thinks it a matter of considerable importance it is too he has to earn his living but st johns sister hewet puffed in silence no one takes her seriously poor dear she feeds the rabbits  yes said rachel ive fed rabbits for twentyfour years it seems odd now she looked meditative and hewet who had been talking much at random and instinctively adopting the feminine point of view saw that she would now talk about herself which was what he wanted for so they might come to know each other  she looked back meditatively upon her past life  how do you spend your day he asked  she meditated still when she thought of their day it seemed to her it was cut into four pieces by their meals these divisions were absolutely rigid the contents of the day having to accommodate themselves within the four rigid bars looking back at her life that was what she saw  breakfast nine luncheon one tea five dinner eight she said  well said hewet what dyou do in the morning  i need to play the piano for hours and hours  and after luncheon  then i went shopping with one of my aunts or we went to see some one or we took a message or we did something that had to be donethe taps might be leaking they visit the poor a good dealold charwomen with bad legs women who want tickets for hospitals or i used to walk in the park by myself and after tea people sometimes called or in summer we sat in the garden or played croquet in winter i read aloud while they worked after dinner i played the piano and they wrote letters if father was at home we had friends of his to dinner and about once a month we went up to the play every now and then we dined out sometimes i went to a dance in london but that was difficult because of getting back the people we saw were old family friends and relations but we didnt see many people there was the clergyman mr pepper and the hunts father generally wanted to be quiet when he came home because he works very hard at hull also my aunts arent very strong a house takes up a lot of time if you do it properly our servants were always bad and so aunt lucy used to do a good deal in the kitchen and aunt clara i think spent most of the morning dusting the drawingroom and going through the linen and silver then there were the dogs they had to be exercised besides being washed and brushed now sandys dead but aunt clara has a very old cockatoo that came from india everything in our house she exclaimed comes from somewhere its full of old furniture not really old victorian things mothers family had or fathers family had which they didnt like to get rid of i suppose though weve really no room for them its rather a nice house she continued except that its a little dingydull i should say she called up before her eyes a vision of the drawingroom at home it was a large oblong room with a square window opening on the garden green plush chairs stood against the wall there was a heavy carved bookcase with glass doors and a general impression of faded sofa covers large spaces of pale green and baskets with pieces of woolwork dropping out of them photographs from old italian masterpieces hung on the walls and views of venetian bridges and swedish waterfalls which members of the family had seen years ago there were also one or two portraits of fathers and grandmothers and an engraving of john stuart mill after the picture by watts it was a room without definite character being neither typically and openly hideous nor strenuously artistic nor really comfortable rachel roused herself from the contemplation of this familiar picture  but this isnt very interesting for you she said looking up  good lord hewet exclaimed ive never been so much interested in my life she then realised that while she had been thinking of richmond his eyes had never left her face the knowledge of this excited her  go on please go on he urged lets imagine its a wednesday youre all at luncheon you sit there and aunt lucy there and aunt clara here he arranged three pebbles on the grass between them  aunt clara carves the neck of lamb rachel continued she fixed her gaze upon the pebbles theres a very ugly yellow china stand in front of me called a dumb waiter on which are three dishes one for biscuits one for butter and one for cheese theres a pot of ferns then theres blanche the maid who snuffles because of her nose we talkoh yes its aunt lucys afternoon at walworth so were rather quick over luncheon she goes off she has a purple bag and a black notebook aunt clara has what they call a gfs meeting in the drawingroom on wednesday so i take the dogs out i go up richmond hill along the terrace into the park its the 18th of aprilthe same day as it is here its spring in england the ground is rather damp however i cross the road and get on to the grass and we walk along and i sing as i always do when im alone until we come to the open place where you can see the whole of london beneath you on a clear day hampstead church spire there westminster cathedral over there and factory chimneys about here theres generally a haze over the low parts of london but its often blue over the park when londons in a mist its the open place that the balloons cross going over to hurlingham theyre pale yellow well then it smells very good particularly if they happen to be burning wood in the keepers lodge which is there i could tell you now how to get from place to place and exactly what trees youd pass and where youd cross the roads you see i played there when i was small spring is good but its best in the autumn when the deer are barking then it gets dusky and i go back through the streets and you cant see people properly they come past very quick you just see their faces and then theyre gonethats what i likeand no one knows in the least what youre doing  but you have to be back for tea i suppose hewet checked her  tea oh yes five oclock then i say what ive done and my aunts say what theyve done and perhaps some one comes in mrs hunt lets suppose shes an old lady with a lame leg she has or she once had eight children so we ask after them theyre all over the world so we ask where they are and sometimes theyre ill or theyre stationed in a cholera district or in some place where it only rains once in five months mrs hunt she said with a smile had a son who was hugged to death by a bear  here she stopped and looked at hewet to see whether he was amused by the same things that amused her she was reassured but she thought it necessary to apologise again she had been talking too much  you cant conceive how it interests me he said indeed his cigarette had gone out and he had to light another  why does it interest you she asked  partly because youre a woman he replied when he said this rachel who had become oblivious of anything and had reverted to a childlike state of interest and pleasure lost her freedom and became selfconscious she felt herself at once singular and under observation as she felt with st john hirst she was about to launch into an argument which would have made them both feel bitterly against each other and to define sensations which had no such importance as words were bound to give them when hewet led her thoughts in a different direction  ive often walked along the streets where people live all in a row and one house is exactly like another house and wondered what on earth the women were doing inside he said just consider its the beginning of the twentieth century and until a few years ago no woman had ever come out by herself and said things at all there it was going on in the background for all those thousands of years this curious silent unrepresented life of course were always writing about womenabusing them or jeering at them or worshipping them but its never come from women themselves i believe we still dont know in the least how they live or what they feel or what they do precisely if ones a man the only confidences one gets are from young women about their love affairs but the lives of women of forty of unmarried women of working women of women who keep shops and bring up children of women like your aunts or mrs thornbury or miss allanone knows nothing whatever about them they wont tell you either theyre afraid or theyve got a way of treating men its the mans view thats represented you see think of a railway train fifteen carriages for men who want to smoke doesnt it make your blood boil if i were a woman id blow some ones brains out dont you laugh at us a great deal dont you think it all a great humbug you i meanhow does it all strike you  his determination to know while it gave meaning to their talk hampered her he seemed to press further and further and made it appear so important she took some time to answer and during that time she went over and over the course of her twentyfour years lighting now on one point now on anotheron her aunts her mother her father and at last her mind fixed upon her aunts and her father and she tried to describe them as at this distance they appeared to her  they were very much afraid of her father he was a great dim force in the house by means of which they held on to the great world which is represented every morning in the times but the real life of the house was something quite different from this it went on independently of mr vinrace and tended to hide itself from him he was goodhumoured towards them but contemptuous she had always taken it for granted that his point of view was just and founded upon an ideal scale of things where the life of one person was absolutely more important than the life of another and that in that scale they were much less importance than he was but did she really believe that hewets words made her think she always submitted to her father just as they did but it was her aunts who influenced her really her aunts who built up the fine closely woven substance of their life at home they were less splendid but more natural than her father was all her rages had been against them it was their world with its four meals its punctuality and servants on the stairs at halfpast ten that she examined so closely and wanted so vehemently to smash to atoms following these thoughts she looked up and said  and theres a sort of beauty in itthere they are at richmond at this very moment building things up theyre all wrong perhaps but theres a sort of beauty in it she repeated its so unconscious so modest and yet they feel things they do mind if people die old spinsters are always doing things i dont quite know what they do only that was what i felt when i lived with them it was very real  she reviewed their little journeys to and fro to walworth to charwomen with bad legs to meetings for this and that their minute acts of charity and unselfishness which flowered punctually from a definite view of what they ought to do their friendships their tastes and habits she saw all these things like grains of sand falling falling through innumerable days making an atmosphere and building up a solid mass a background hewet observed her as she considered this  were you happy he demanded  again she had become absorbed in something else and he called her back to an unusually vivid consciousness of herself  i was both she replied i was happy and i was miserable youve no conception what its liketo be a young woman she looked straight at him there are terrors and agonies she said keeping her eye on him as if to detect the slightest hint of laughter  i can believe it he said he returned her look with perfect sincerity  women one sees in the streets she said  prostitutes  men kissing one  he nodded his head  you were never told  she shook her head  and then she began and stopped here came in the great space of life into which no one had ever penetrated all that she had been saying about her father and her aunts and walks in richmond park and what they did from hour to hour was merely on the surface hewet was watching her did he demand that she should describe that also why did he sit so near and keep his eye on her why did they not have done with this searching and agony why did they not kiss each other simply she wished to kiss him but all the time she went on spinning out words  a girl is more lonely than a boy no one cares in the least what she does nothings expected of her unless ones very pretty people dont listen to what you say    and that is what i like she added energetically as if the memory were very happy i like walking in richmond park and singing to myself and knowing it doesnt matter a damn to anybody i like seeing things go onas we saw you that night when you didnt see usi love the freedom of itits like being the wind or the sea she turned with a curious fling of her hands and looked at the sea it was still very blue dancing away as far as the eye could reach but the light on it was yellower and the clouds were turning flamingo red  a feeling of intense depression crossed hewets mind as she spoke it seemed plain that she would never care for one person rather than another she was evidently quite indifferent to him they seemed to come very near and then they were as far apart as ever again and her gesture as she turned away had been oddly beautiful  nonsense he said abruptly you like people you like admiration your real grudge against hirst is that he doesnt admire you  she made no answer for some time then she said  thats probably true of course i like peoplei like almost every one ive ever met  she turned her back on the sea and regarded hewet with friendly if critical eyes he was goodlooking in the sense that he had always had a sufficiency of beef to eat and fresh air to breathe his head was big the eyes were also large though generally vague they could be forcible and the lips were sensitive one might account him a man of considerable passion and fitful energy likely to be at the mercy of moods which had little relation to facts at once tolerant and fastidious the breadth of his forehead showed capacity for thought the interest with which rachel looked at him was heard in her voice  what novels do you write she asked  i want to write a novel about silence he said the things people dont say but the difficulty is immense he sighed however you dont care he continued he looked at her almost severely nobody cares all you read a novel for is to see what sort of person the writer is and if you know him which of his friends hes put in as for the novel itself the whole conception the way ones seen the thing felt about it make it stand in relation to other things not one in a million cares for that and yet i sometimes wonder whether theres anything else in the whole world worth doing these other people he indicated the hotel are always wanting something they cant get but theres an extraordinary satisfaction in writing even in the attempt to write what you said just now is true one doesnt want to be things one wants merely to be allowed to see them  some of the satisfaction of which he spoke came into his face as he gazed out to sea  it was rachels turn now to feel depressed as he talked of writing he had become suddenly impersonal he might never care for any one all that desire to know her and get at her which she had felt pressing on her almost painfully had completely vanished  are you a good writer she asked  yes he said im not firstrate of course im good secondrate about as good as thackeray i should say  rachel was amazed for one thing it amazed her to hear thackeray called secondrate and then she could not widen her point of view to believe that there could be great writers in existence at the present day or if there were that any one she knew could be a great writer and his selfconfidence astounded her and he became more and more remote  my other novel hewet continued is about a young man who is obsessed by an ideathe idea of being a gentleman he manages to exist at cambridge on a hundred pounds a year he has a coat it was once a very good coat but the trouserstheyre not so good well he goes up to london gets into good society owing to an earlymorning adventure on the banks of the serpentine he is led into telling liesmy idea you see is to show the gradual corruption of the soulcalls himself the son of some great landed proprietor in devonshire meanwhile the coat becomes older and older and he hardly dares to wear the trousers cant you imagine the wretched man after some splendid evening of debauchery contemplating these garmentshanging them over the end of the bed arranging them now in full light now in shade and wondering whether they will survive him or he will survive them thoughts of suicide cross his mind he has a friend too a man who somehow subsists upon selling small birds for which he sets traps in the fields near uxbridge theyre scholars both of them i know one or two wretched starving creatures like that who quote aristotle at you over a fried herring and a pint of porter fashionable life too i have to represent at some length in order to show my hero under all circumstances lady theo bingham bingley whose bay mare he had the good fortune to stop is the daughter of a very fine old tory peer im going to describe the kind of parties i once went tothe fashionable intellectuals you know who like to have the latest book on their tables they give parties river parties parties where you play games theres no difficulty in conceiving incidents the difficulty is to put them into shapenot to get run away with as lady theo was it ended disastrously for her poor woman for the book as i planned it was going to end in profound and sordid respectability disowned by her father she marries my hero and they live in a snug little villa outside croydon in which town he is set up as a house agent he never succeeds in becoming a real gentleman after all thats the interesting part of it does it seem to you the kind of book youd like to read he enquired or perhaps youd like my stuart tragedy better he continued without waiting for her to answer him my idea is that theres a certain quality of beauty in the past which the ordinary historical novelist completely ruins by his absurd conventions the moon becomes the regent of the skies people clap spurs to their horses and so on im going to treat people as though they were exactly the same as we are the advantage is that detached from modern conditions one can make them more intense and more abstract then people who live as we do  rachel had listened to all this with attention but with a certain amount of bewilderment they both sat thinking their own thoughts  im not like hirst said hewet after a pause he spoke meditatively i dont see circles of chalk between peoples feet i sometimes wish i did it seems to me so tremendously complicated and confused one cant come to any decision at all ones less and less capable of making judgments dyou find that and then one never knows what any one feels were all in the dark we try to find out but can you imagine anything more ludicrous than one persons opinion of another person one goes along thinking one knows but one really doesnt know  as he said this he was leaning on his elbow arranging and rearranging in the grass the stones which had represented rachel and her aunts at luncheon he was speaking as much to himself as to rachel he was reasoning against the desire which had returned with intensity to take her in his arms to have done with indirectness to explain exactly what he felt what he said was against his belief all the things that were important about her he knew he felt them in the air around them but he said nothing he went on arranging the stones  i like you dyou like me rachel suddenly observed  i like you immensely hewet replied speaking with the relief of a person who is unexpectedly given an opportunity of saying what he wants to say he stopped moving the pebbles  mightnt we call each other rachel and terence he asked  terence rachel repeated terencethats like the cry of an owl  she looked up with a sudden rush of delight and in looking at terence with eyes widened by pleasure she was struck by the change that had come over the sky behind them the substantial blue day had faded to a paler and more ethereal blue the clouds were pink far away and closely packed together and the peace of evening had replaced the heat of the southern afternoon in which they had started on their walk  it must be late she exclaimed  it was nearly eight oclock  but eight oclock doesnt count here does it terence asked as they got up and turned inland again they began to walk rather quickly down the hill on a little path between the olive trees  they felt more intimate because they shared the knowledge of what eight oclock in richmond meant terence walked in front for there was not room for them side by side  what i want to do in writing novels is very much what you want to do when you play the piano i expect he began turning and speaking over his shoulder we want to find out whats behind things dont welook at the lights down there he continued scattered about anyhow things i feel come to me like lights    i want to combine them    have you ever seen fireworks that make figures    i want to make figures    is that what you want to do  now they were out on the road and could walk side by side  when i play the piano music is different    but i see what you mean they tried to invent theories and to make their theories agree as hewet had no knowledge of music rachel took his stick and drew figures in the thin white dust to explain how bach wrote his fugues  my musical gift was ruined he explained as they walked on after one of these demonstrations by the village organist at home who had invented a system of notation which he tried to teach me with the result that i never got to the tuneplaying at all my mother thought music wasnt manly for boys she wanted me to kill rats and birdsthats the worst of living in the country we live in devonshire its the loveliest place in the world onlyits always difficult at home when ones grown up id like you to know one of my sisters    oh heres your gate he pushed it open they paused for a moment she could not ask him to come in she could not say that she hoped they would meet again there was nothing to be said and so without a word she went through the gate and was soon invisible directly hewet lost sight of her he felt the old discomfort return even more strongly than before their talk had been interrupted in the middle just as he was beginning to say the things he wanted to say after all what had they been able to say he ran his mind over the things they had said the random unnecessary things which had eddied round and round and used up all the time and drawn them so close together and flung them so far apart and left him in the end unsatisfied ignorant still of what she felt and of what she was like what was the use of talking talking merely talking      chapter xvii   it was now the height of the season and every ship that came from england left a few people on the shores of santa marina who drove up to the hotel the fact that the ambroses had a house where one could escape momentarily from the slightly inhuman atmosphere of an hotel was a source of genuine pleasure not only to hirst and hewet but to the elliots the thornburys the flushings miss allan evelyn m together with other people whose identity was so little developed that the ambroses did not discover that they possessed names by degrees there was established a kind of correspondence between the two houses the big and the small so that at most hours of the day one house could guess what was going on in the other and the words the villa and the hotel called up the idea of two separate systems of life acquaintances showed signs of developing into friends for that one tie to mrs parrys drawingroom had inevitably split into many other ties attached to different parts of england and sometimes these alliances seemed cynically fragile and sometimes painfully acute lacking as they did the supporting background of organised english life one night when the moon was round between the trees evelyn m told helen the story of her life and claimed her everlasting friendship or another occasion merely because of a sigh or a pause or a word thoughtlessly dropped poor mrs elliot left the villa half in tears vowing never again to meet the cold and scornful woman who had insulted her and in truth meet again they never did it did not seem worth while to piece together so slight a friendship  hewet indeed might have found excellent material at this time up at the villa for some chapters in the novel which was to be called silence or the things people dont say helen and rachel had become very silent having detected as she thought a secret and judging that rachel meant to keep it from her mrs ambrose respected it carefully but from that cause though unintentionally a curious atmosphere of reserve grew up between them instead of sharing their views upon all subjects and plunging after an idea wherever it might lead they spoke chiefly in comment upon the people they saw and the secret between them made itself felt in what they said even of thornburys and elliots always calm and unemotional in her judgments mrs ambrose was now inclined to be definitely pessimistic she was not severe upon individuals so much as incredulous of the kindness of destiny fate what happens in the long run and apt to insist that this was generally adverse to people in proportion as they deserved well even this theory she was ready to discard in favour of one which made chaos triumphant things happening for no reason at all and every one groping about in illusion and ignorance with a certain pleasure she developed these views to her niece taking a letter from home as her test which gave good news but might just as well have given bad how did she know that at this very moment both her children were not lying dead crushed by motor omnibuses its happening to somebody why shouldnt it happen to me she would argue her face taking on the stoical expression of anticipated sorrow however sincere these views may have been they were undoubtedly called forth by the irrational state of her nieces mind it was so fluctuating and went so quickly from joy to despair that it seemed necessary to confront it with some stable opinion which naturally became dark as well as stable perhaps mrs ambrose had some idea that in leading the talk into these quarters she might discover what was in rachels mind but it was difficult to judge for sometimes she would agree with the gloomiest thing that was said at other times she refused to listen and rammed helens theories down her throat with laughter chatter ridicule of the wildest and fierce bursts of anger even at what she called the croaking of a raven in the mud  its hard enough without that she asserted  whats hard helen demanded  life she replied and then they both became silent  helen might draw her own conclusions as to why life was hard as to why an hour later perhaps life was something so wonderful and vivid that the eyes of rachel beholding it were positively exhilarating to a spectator true to her creed she did not attempt to interfere although there were enough of those weak moments of depression to make it perfectly easy for a less scrupulous person to press through and know all and perhaps rachel was sorry that she did not choose all these moods ran themselves into one general effect which helen compared to the sliding of a river quick quicker quicker still as it races to a waterfall her instinct was to cry out stop but even had there been any use in crying stop she would have refrained thinking it best that things should take their way the water racing because the earth was shaped to make it race  it seemed that rachel herself had no suspicion that she was watched or that there was anything in her manner likely to draw attention to her what had happened to her she did not know her mind was very much in the condition of the racing water to which helen compared it she wanted to see terence she was perpetually wishing to see him when he was not there it was an agony to miss seeing him agonies were strewn all about her day on account of him but she never asked herself what this force driving through her life arose from she thought of no result any more than a tree perpetually pressed downwards by the wind considers the result of being pressed downwards by the wind  during the two or three weeks which had passed since their walk half a dozen notes from him had accumulated in her drawer she would read them and spend the whole morning in a daze of happiness the sunny land outside the window being no less capable of analysing its own colour and heat than she was of analysing hers in these moods she found it impossible to read or play the piano even to move being beyond her inclination the time passed without her noticing it when it was dark she was drawn to the window by the lights of the hotel a light that went in and out was the light in terences window there he sat reading perhaps or now he was walking up and down pulling out one book after another and now he was seated in his chair again and she tried to imagine what he was thinking about the steady lights marked the rooms where terence sat with people moving round him every one who stayed in the hotel had a peculiar romance and interest about them they were not ordinary people she would attribute wisdom to mrs elliot beauty to susan warrington a splendid vitality to evelyn m because terence spoke to them as unreflecting and pervasive were the moods of depression her mind was as the landscape outside when dark beneath clouds and straitly lashed by wind and hail again she would sit passive in her chair exposed to pain and helens fantastical or gloomy words were like so many darts goading her to cry out against the hardness of life best of all were the moods when for no reason again this stress of feeling slackened and life went on as usual only with a joy and colour in its events that was unknown before they had a significance like that which she had seen in the tree the nights were black bars separating her from the days she would have liked to run all the days into one long continuity of sensation although these moods were directly or indirectly caused by the presence of terence or the thought of him she never said to herself that she was in love with him or considered what was to happen if she continued to feel such things so that helens image of the river sliding on to the waterfall had a great likeness to the facts and the alarm which helen sometimes felt was justified  in her curious condition of unanalysed sensations she was incapable of making a plan which should have any effect upon her state of mind she abandoned herself to the mercy of accidents missing terence one day meeting him the next receiving his letters always with a start of surprise any woman experienced in the progress of courtship would have come by certain opinions from all this which would have given her at least a theory to go upon but no one had ever been in love with rachel and she had never been in love with any one moreover none of the books she read from wuthering heights to man and superman and the plays of ibsen suggested from their analysis of love that what their heroines felt was what she was feeling now it seemed to her that her sensations had no name  she met terence frequently when they did not meet he was apt to send a note with a book or about a book for he had not been able after all to neglect that approach to intimacy but sometimes he did not come or did not write for several days at a time again when they met their meeting might be one of inspiriting joy or of harassing despair over all their partings hung the sense of interruption leaving them both unsatisfied though ignorant that the other shared the feeling  if rachel was ignorant of her own feelings she was even more completely ignorant of his at first he moved as a god as she came to know him better he was still the centre of light but combined with this beauty a wonderful power of making her daring and confident of herself she was conscious of emotions and powers which she had never suspected in herself and of a depth in the world hitherto unknown when she thought of their relationship she saw rather than reasoned representing her view of what terence felt by a picture of him drawn across the room to stand by her side this passage across the room amounted to a physical sensation but what it meant she did not know  thus the time went on wearing a calm bright look upon its surface letters came from england letters came from willoughby and the days accumulated their small events which shaped the year superficially three odes of pindar were mended helen covered about five inches of her embroidery and st john completed the first two acts of a play he and rachel being now very good friends he read them aloud to her and she was so genuinely impressed by the skill of his rhythms and the variety of his adjectives as well as by the fact that he was terences friend that he began to wonder whether he was not intended for literature rather than for law it was a time of profound thought and sudden revelations for more than one couple and several single people  a sunday came which no one in the villa with the exception of rachel and the spanish maid proposed to recognise rachel still went to church because she had never according to helen taken the trouble to think about it since they had celebrated the service at the hotel she went there expecting to get some pleasure from her passage across the garden and through the hall of the hotel although it was very doubtful whether she would see terence or at any rate have the chance of speaking to him  as the greater number of visitors at the hotel were english there was almost as much difference between sunday and wednesday as there is in england and sunday appeared here as there the mute black ghost or penitent spirit of the busy weekday the english could not pale the sunshine but they could in some miraculous way slow down the hours dull the incidents lengthen the meals and make even the servants and pageboys wear a look of boredom and propriety the best clothes which every one put on helped the general effect it seemed that no lady could sit down without bending a clean starched petticoat and no gentleman could breathe without a sudden crackle from a stiff shirtfront as the hands of the clock neared eleven on this particular sunday various people tended to draw together in the hall clasping little redleaved books in their hands the clock marked a few minutes to the hour when a stout black figure passed through the hall with a preoccupied expression as though he would rather not recognise salutations although aware of them and disappeared down the corridor which led from it  mr bax mrs thornbury whispered  the little group of people then began to move off in the same direction as the stout black figure looked at in an odd way by people who made no effort to join them they moved with one exception slowly and consciously towards the stairs mrs flushing was the exception she came running downstairs strode across the hall joined the procession much out of breath demanding of mrs thornbury in an agitated whisper where where  we are all going said mrs thornbury gently and soon they were descending the stairs two by two rachel was among the first to descend she did not see that terence and hirst came in at the rear possessed of no black volume but of one thin book bound in lightblue cloth which st john carried under his arm  the chapel was the old chapel of the monks it was a profound cool place where they had said mass for hundreds of years and done penance in the cold moonlight and worshipped old brown pictures and carved saints which stood with upraised hands of blessing in the hollows in the walls the transition from catholic to protestant worship had been bridged by a time of disuse when there were no services and the place was used for storing jars of oil liqueur and deckchairs the hotel flourishing some religious body had taken the place in hand and it was now fitted out with a number of glazed yellow benches claretcoloured footstools it had a small pulpit and a brass eagle carrying the bible on its back while the piety of different women had supplied ugly squares of carpet and long strips of embroidery heavily wrought with monograms in gold  as the congregation entered they were met by mild sweet chords issuing from a harmonium where miss willett concealed from view by a baize curtain struck emphatic chords with uncertain fingers the sound spread through the chapel as the rings of water spread from a fallen stone the twenty or twentyfive people who composed the congregation first bowed their heads and then sat up and looked about them it was very quiet and the light down here seemed paler than the light above the usual bows and smiles were dispensed with but they recognised each other the lords prayer was read over them as the childlike battle of voices rose the congregation many of whom had only met on the staircase felt themselves pathetically united and welldisposed towards each other as if the prayer were a torch applied to fuel a smoke seemed to rise automatically and fill the place with the ghosts of innumerable services on innumerable sunday mornings at home susan warrington in particular was conscious of the sweetest sense of sisterhood as she covered her face with her hands and saw slips of bent backs through the chinks between her fingers her emotions rose calmly and evenly approving of herself and of life at the same time it was all so quiet and so good but having created this peaceful atmosphere mr bax suddenly turned the page and read a psalm though he read it with no change of voice the mood was broken  be merciful unto me o god he read for man goeth about to devour me he is daily fighting and troubling me    they daily mistake my words all that they imagine is to do me evil they hold all together and keep themselves close    break their teeth o god in their mouths smite the jawbones of the lions o lord let them fall away like water that runneth apace and when they shoot their arrows let them be rooted out  nothing in susans experience at all corresponded with this and as she had no love of language she had long ceased to attend to such remarks although she followed them with the same kind of mechanical respect with which she heard many of lears speeches read aloud her mind was still serene and really occupied with praise of her own nature and praise of god that is of the solemn and satisfactory order of the world  but it could be seen from a glance at their faces that most of the others the men in particular felt the inconvenience of the sudden intrusion of this old savage they looked more secular and critical as then listened to the ravings of the old black man with a cloth round his loins cursing with vehement gesture by a campfire in the desert after that there was a general sound of pages being turned as if they were in class and then they read a little bit of the old testament about making a well very much as school boys translate an easy passage from the anabasis when they have shut up their french grammar then they returned to the new testament and the sad and beautiful figure of christ while christ spoke they made another effort to fit his interpretation of life upon the lives they lived but as they were all very different some practical some ambitious some stupid some wild and experimental some in love and others long past any feeling except a feeling of comfort they did very different things with the words of christ  from their faces it seemed that for the most part they made no effort at all and recumbent as it were accepted the ideas the words gave as representing goodness in the same way no doubt as one of those industrious needlewomen had accepted the bright ugly pattern on her mat as beauty  whatever the reason might be for the first time in her life instead of slipping at once into some curious pleasant cloud of emotion too familiar to be considered rachel listened critically to what was being said by the time they had swung in an irregular way from prayer to psalm from psalm to history from history to poetry and mr bax was giving out his text she was in a state of acute discomfort such was the discomfort she felt when forced to sit through an unsatisfactory piece of music badly played tantalised enraged by the clumsy insensitiveness of the conductor who put the stress on the wrong places and annoyed by the vast flock of the audience tamely praising and acquiescing without knowing or caring so she was not tantalized and enraged only here with eyes halfshut and lips pursed together the atmosphere of forced solemnity increased her anger all round her were people pretending to feel what they did not feel while somewhere above her floated the idea which they could none of them grasp which they pretended to grasp always escaping out of reach a beautiful idea an idea like a butterfly one after another vast and hard and cold appeared to her the churches all over the world where this blundering effort and misunderstanding were perpetually going on great buildings filled with innumerable men and women not seeing clearly who finally gave up the effort to see and relapsed tamely into praise and acquiescence halfshutting their eyes and pursing up their lips the thought had the same sort of physical discomfort as is caused by a film of mist always coming between the eyes and the printed page she did her best to brush away the film and to conceive something to be worshipped as the service went on but failed always misled by the voice of mr bax saying things which misrepresented the idea and by the patter of baaing inexpressive human voices falling round her like damp leaves the effort was tiring and dispiriting she ceased to listen and fixed her eyes on the face of a woman near her a hospital nurse whose expression of devout attention seemed to prove that she was at any rate receiving satisfaction but looking at her carefully she came to the conclusion that the hospital nurse was only slavishly acquiescent and that the look of satisfaction was produced by no splendid conception of god within her how indeed could she conceive anything far outside her own experience a woman with a commonplace face like hers a little round red face upon which trivial duties and trivial spites had drawn lines whose weak blue eyes saw without intensity or individuality whose features were blurred insensitive and callous she was adoring something shallow and smug clinging to it so the obstinate mouth witnessed with the assiduity of a limpet nothing would tear her from her demure belief in her own virtue and the virtues of her religion she was a limpet with the sensitive side of her stuck to a rock for ever dead to the rush of fresh and beautiful things past her the face of this single worshipper became printed on rachels mind with an impression of keen horror and she had it suddenly revealed to her what helen meant and st john meant when they proclaimed their hatred of christianity with the violence that now marked her feelings she rejected all that she had implicitly believed  meanwhile mr bax was halfway through the second lesson she looked at him he was a man of the world with supple lips and an agreeable manner he was indeed a man of much kindliness and simplicity though by no means clever but she was not in the mood to give any one credit for such qualities and examined him as though he were an epitome of all the vices of his service  right at the back of the chapel mrs flushing hirst and hewet sat in a row in a very different frame of mind hewet was staring at the roof with his legs stuck out in front of him for as he had never tried to make the service fit any feeling or idea of his he was able to enjoy the beauty of the language without hindrance his mind was occupied first with accidental things such as the womens hair in front of him the light on the faces then with the words which seemed to him magnificent and then more vaguely with the characters of the other worshippers but when he suddenly perceived rachel all these thoughts were driven out of his head and he thought only of her the psalms the prayers the litany and the sermon were all reduced to one chanting sound which paused and then renewed itself a little higher or a little lower he stared alternately at rachel and at the ceiling but his expression was now produced not by what he saw but by something in his mind he was almost as painfully disturbed by his thoughts as she was by hers  early in the service mrs flushing had discovered that she had taken up a bible instead of a prayerbook and as she was sitting next to hirst she stole a glance over his shoulder he was reading steadily in the thin paleblue volume unable to understand she peered closer upon which hirst politely laid the book before her pointing to the first line of a greek poem and then to the translation opposite  whats that she whispered inquisitively  sappho he replied the one swinburne didthe best thing thats ever been written  mrs flushing could not resist such an opportunity she gulped down the ode to aphrodite during the litany keeping herself with difficulty from asking when sappho lived and what else she wrote worth reading and contriving to come in punctually at the end with the forgiveness of sins the resurrection of the body and the life everlastin amen  meanwhile hirst took out an envelope and began scribbling on the back of it when mr bax mounted the pulpit he shut up sappho with his envelope between the pages settled his spectacles and fixed his gaze intently upon the clergyman standing in the pulpit he looked very large and fat the light coming through the greenish unstained windowglass made his face appear smooth and white like a very large egg  he looked round at all the faces looking mildly up at him although some of them were the faces of men and women old enough to be his grandparents and gave out his text with weighty significance the argument of the sermon was that visitors to this beautiful land although they were on a holiday owed a duty to the natives it did not in truth differ very much from a leading article upon topics of general interest in the weekly newspapers it rambled with a kind of amiable verbosity from one heading to another suggesting that all human beings are very much the same under their skins illustrating this by the resemblance of the games which little spanish boys play to the games little boys in london streets play observing that very small things do influence people particularly natives in fact a very dear friend of mr baxs had told him that the success of our rule in india that vast country largely depended upon the strict code of politeness which the english adopted towards the natives which led to the remark that small things were not necessarily small and that somehow to the virtue of sympathy which was a virtue never more needed than today when we lived in a time of experiment and upheavalwitness the aeroplane and wireless telegraph and there were other problems which hardly presented themselves to our fathers but which no man who called himself a man could leave unsettled here mr bax became more definitely clerical if it were possible he seemed to speak with a certain innocent craftiness as he pointed out that all this laid a special duty upon earnest christians what men were inclined to say now was oh that fellowhes a parson what we want them to say is hes a good fellowin other words he is my brother he exhorted them to keep in touch with men of the modern type they must sympathise with their multifarious interests in order to keep before their eyes that whatever discoveries were made there was one discovery which could not be superseded which was indeed as much of a necessity to the most successful and most brilliant of them all as it had been to their fathers the humblest could help the least important things had an influence here his manner became definitely priestly and his remarks seemed to be directed to women for indeed mr baxs congregations were mainly composed of women and he was used to assigning them their duties in his innocent clerical campaigns leaving more definite instruction he passed on and his theme broadened into a peroration for which he drew a long breath and stood very uprightas a drop of water detached alone separate from others falling from the cloud and entering the great ocean alters so scientists tell us not only the immediate spot in the ocean where it falls but all the myriad drops which together compose the great universe of waters and by this means alters the configuration of the globe and the lives of millions of sea creatures and finally the lives of the men and women who seek their living upon the shoresas all this is within the compass of a single drop of water such as any rain shower sends in millions to lose themselves in the earth to lose themselves we say but we know very well that the fruits of the earth could not flourish without themso is a marvel comparable to this within the reach of each one of us who dropping a little word or a little deed into the great universe alters it yea it is a solemn thought alters it for good or for evil not for one instant or in one vicinity but throughout the entire race and for all eternity whipping round as though to avoid applause he continued with the same breath but in a different tone of voiceand now to god the father     he gave his blessing and then while the solemn chords again issued from the harmonium behind the curtain the different people began scraping and fumbling and moving very awkwardly and consciously towards the door halfway upstairs at a point where the light and sounds of the upper world conflicted with the dimness and the dying hymntune of the under rachel felt a hand drop upon her shoulder  miss vinrace mrs flushing whispered peremptorily stay to luncheon its such a dismal day they dont even give one beef for luncheon please stay  here they came out into the hall where once more the little band was greeted with curious respectful glances by the people who had not gone to church although their clothing made it clear that they approved of sunday to the very verge of going to church rachel felt unable to stand any more of this particular atmosphere and was about to say she must go back when terence passed them drawn along in talk with evelyn m rachel thereupon contented herself with saying that the people looked very respectable which negative remark mrs flushing interpreted to mean that she would stay  english people abroad she returned with a vivid flash of malice aint they awful but we wont stay here she continued plucking at rachels arm come up to my room  she bore her past hewet and evelyn and the thornburys and the elliots hewet stepped forward  luncheon he began  miss vinrace has promised to lunch with me said mrs flushing and began to pound energetically up the staircase as though the middle classes of england were in pursuit she did not stop until she had slammed her bedroom door behind them  well what did you think of it she demanded panting slightly  all the disgust and horror which rachel had been accumulating burst forth beyond her control  i thought it the most loathsome exhibition id ever seen she broke out how can theyhow dare theywhat do you mean by itmr bax hospital nurses old men prostitutes disgusting  she hit off the points she remembered as fast as she could but she was too indignant to stop to analyse her feelings mrs flushing watched her with keen gusto as she stood ejaculating with emphatic movements of her head and hands in the middle of the room  go on go on do go on she laughed clapping her hands its delightful to hear you  but why do you go rachel demanded  ive been every sunday of my life ever since i can remember mrs flushing chuckled as though that were a reason by itself  rachel turned abruptly to the window she did not know what it was that had put her into such a passion the sight of terence in the hall had confused her thoughts leaving her merely indignant she looked straight at their own villa halfway up the side of the mountain the most familiar view seen framed through glass has a certain unfamiliar distinction and she grew calm as she gazed then she remembered that she was in the presence of some one she did not know well and she turned and looked at mrs flushing mrs flushing was still sitting on the edge of the bed looking up with her lips parted so that her strong white teeth showed in two rows  tell me she said which dyou like best mr hewet or mr hirst  mr hewet rachel replied but her voice did not sound natural  which is the one who reads greek in church mrs flushing demanded  it might have been either of them and while mrs flushing proceeded to describe them both and to say that both frightened her but one frightened her more than the other rachel looked for a chair the room of course was one of the largest and most luxurious in the hotel there were a great many armchairs and settees covered in brown holland but each of these was occupied by a large square piece of yellow cardboard and all the pieces of cardboard were dotted or lined with spots or dashes of bright oil paint  but youre not to look at those said mrs flushing as she saw rachels eye wander she jumped up and turned as many as she could face downwards upon the floor rachel however managed to possess herself of one of them and with the vanity of an artist mrs flushing demanded anxiously well well  its a hill rachel replied there could be no doubt that mrs flushing had represented the vigorous and abrupt fling of the earth up into the air you could almost see the clods flying as it whirled  rachel passed from one to another they were all marked by something of the jerk and decision of their maker they were all perfectly untrained onslaughts of the brush upon some halfrealised idea suggested by hill or tree and they were all in some way characteristic of mrs flushing  i see things movin mrs flushing explained soshe swept her hand through a yard of the air she then took up one of the cardboards which rachel had laid aside seated herself on a stool and began to flourish a stump of charcoal while she occupied herself in strokes which seemed to serve her as speech serves others rachel who was very restless looked about her  open the wardrobe said mrs flushing after a pause speaking indistinctly because of a paintbrush in her mouth and look at the things  as rachel hesitated mrs flushing came forward still with a paintbrush in her mouth flung open the wings of her wardrobe and tossed a quantity of shawls stuffs cloaks embroideries on to the bed rachel began to finger them mrs flushing came up once more and dropped a quantity of beads brooches earrings bracelets tassels and combs among the draperies then she went back to her stool and began to paint in silence the stuffs were coloured and dark and pale they made a curious swarm of lines and colours upon the counterpane with the reddish lumps of stone and peacocks feathers and clear pale tortoiseshell combs lying among them  the women wore them hundreds of years ago they wear em still mrs flushing remarked my husband rides about and finds em they dont know what theyre worth so we get em cheap and we shall sell em to smart women in london she chuckled as though the thought of these ladies and their absurd appearance amused her after painting for some minutes she suddenly laid down her brush and fixed her eyes upon rachel  i tell you what i want to do she said i want to go up there and see things for myself its silly stayin here with a pack of old maids as though we were at the seaside in england i want to go up the river and see the natives in their camps its only a matter of ten days under canvas my husbands done it one would lie out under the trees at night and be towed down the river by day and if we saw anythin nice wed shout out and tell em to stop she rose and began piercing the bed again and again with a long golden pin as she watched to see what effect her suggestion had upon rachel  we must make up a party she went on ten people could hire a launch now youll come and mrs ambrosell come and will mr hirst and tother gentleman come wheres a pencil  she became more and more determined and excited as she evolved her plan she sat on the edge of the bed and wrote down a list of surnames which she invariably spelt wrong rachel was enthusiastic for indeed the idea was immeasurably delightful to her she had always had a great desire to see the river and the name of terence threw a lustre over the prospect which made it almost too good to come true she did what she could to help mrs flushing by suggesting names helping her to spell them and counting up the days of the week upon her fingers as mrs flushing wanted to know all she could tell her about the birth and pursuits of every person she suggested and threw in wild stories of her own as to the temperaments and habits of artists and people of the same name who used to come to chillingley in the old days but were doubtless not the same though they too were very clever men interested in egyptology the business took some time  at last mrs flushing sought her diary for help the method of reckoning dates on the fingers proving unsatisfactory she opened and shut every drawer in her writingtable and then cried furiously yarmouth yarmouth drat the woman shes always out of the way when shes wanted  at this moment the luncheon gong began to work itself into its midday frenzy mrs flushing rang her bell violently the door was opened by a handsome maid who was almost as upright as her mistress  oh yarmouth said mrs flushing just find my diary and see where ten days from now would bring us to and ask the hall porter how many men ud be wanted to row eight people up the river for a week and what it ud cost and put it on a slip of paper and leave it on my dressingtable now she pointed at the door with a superb forefinger so that rachel had to lead the way  oh and yarmouth mrs flushing called back over her shoulder put those things away and hang em in their right places theres a good girl or it fusses mr flushin  to all of which yarmouth merely replied yes maam  as they entered the long diningroom it was obvious that the day was still sunday although the mood was slightly abating the flushings table was set by the side in the window so that mrs flushing could scrutinise each figure as it entered and her curiosity seemed to be intense  old mrs paley she whispered as the wheeled chair slowly made its way through the door arthur pushing behind thornburys came next that nice woman she nudged rachel to look at miss allan whats her name the painted lady who always came in late tripping into the room with a prepared smile as though she came out upon a stage might well have quailed before mrs flushings stare which expressed her steely hostility to the whole tribe of painted ladies next came the two young men whom mrs flushing called collectively the hirsts they sat down opposite across the gangway  mr flushing treated his wife with a mixture of admiration and indulgence making up by the suavity and fluency of his speech for the abruptness of hers while she darted and ejaculated he gave rachel a sketch of the history of south american art he would deal with one of his wifes exclamations and then return as smoothly as ever to his theme he knew very well how to make a luncheon pass agreeably without being dull or intimate he had formed the opinion so he told rachel that wonderful treasures lay hid in the depths of the land the things rachel had seen were merely trifles picked up in the course of one short journey he thought there might be giant gods hewn out of stone in the mountainside and colossal figures standing by themselves in the middle of vast green pasture lands where none but natives had ever trod before the dawn of european art he believed that the primitive huntsmen and priests had built temples of massive stone slabs had formed out of the dark rocks and the great cedar trees majestic figures of gods and of beasts and symbols of the great forces water air and forest among which they lived there might be prehistoric towns like those in greece and asia standing in open places among the trees filled with the works of this early race nobody had been there scarcely anything was known thus talking and displaying the most picturesque of his theories rachels attention was fixed upon him  she did not see that hewet kept looking at her across the gangway between the figures of waiters hurrying past with plates he was inattentive and hirst was finding him also very cross and disagreeable they had touched upon all the usual topicsupon politics and literature gossip and christianity they had quarrelled over the service which was every bit as fine as sappho according to hewet so that hirsts paganism was mere ostentation why go to church he demanded merely in order to read sappho hirst observed that he had listened to every word of the sermon as he could prove if hewet would like a repetition of it and he went to church in order to realise the nature of his creator which he had done very vividly that morning thanks to mr bax who had inspired him to write three of the most superb lines in english literature an invocation to the deity  i wrote em on the back of the envelope of my aunts last letter he said and pulled it from between the pages of sappho  well lets hear them said hewet slightly mollified by the prospect of a literary discussion  my dear hewet do you wish us both to be flung out of the hotel by an enraged mob of thornburys and elliots hirst enquired the merest whisper would be sufficient to incriminate me for ever god he broke out whats the use of attempting to write when the worlds peopled by such damned fools seriously hewet i advise you to give up literature whats the good of it theres your audience  he nodded his head at the tables where a very miscellaneous collection of europeans were now engaged in eating in some cases in gnawing the stringy foreign fowls hewet looked and grew more out of temper than ever hirst looked too his eyes fell upon rachel and he bowed to her  i rather think rachels in love with me he remarked as his eyes returned to his plate thats the worst of friendships with young womenthey tend to fall in love with one  to that hewet made no answer whatever and sat singularly still hirst did not seem to mind getting no answer for he returned to mr bax again quoting the peroration about the drop of water and when hewet scarcely replied to these remarks either he merely pursed his lips chose a fig and relapsed quite contentedly into his own thoughts of which he always had a very large supply when luncheon was over they separated taking their cups of coffee to different parts of the hall  from his chair beneath the palmtree hewet saw rachel come out of the diningroom with the flushings he saw them look round for chairs and choose three in a corner where they could go on talking in private mr flushing was now in the full tide of his discourse he produced a sheet of paper upon which he made drawings as he went on with his talk he saw rachel lean over and look pointing to this and that with her finger hewet unkindly compared mr flushing who was extremely well dressed for a hot climate and rather elaborate in his manner to a very persuasive shopkeeper meanwhile as he sat looking at them he was entangled in the thornburys and miss allan who after hovering about for a minute or two settled in chairs round him holding their cups in their hands they wanted to know whether he could tell them anything about mr bax mr thornbury as usual sat saying nothing looking vaguely ahead of him occasionally raising his eyeglasses as if to put them on but always thinking better of it at the last moment and letting them fall again after some discussion the ladies put it beyond a doubt that mr bax was not the son of mr william bax there was a pause then mrs thornbury remarked that she was still in the habit of saying queen instead of king in the national anthem there was another pause then miss allan observed reflectively that going to church abroad always made her feel as if she had been to a sailors funeral  there was then a very long pause which threatened to be final when mercifully a bird about the size of a magpie but of a metallic blue colour appeared on the section of the terrace that could be seen from where they sat mrs thornbury was led to enquire whether we should like it if all our rooks were bluewhat do you think william she asked touching her husband on the knee  if all our rooks were blue he saidhe raised his glasses he actually placed them on his nosethey would not live long in wiltshire he concluded he dropped his glasses to his side again the three elderly people now gazed meditatively at the bird which was so obliging as to stay in the middle of the view for a considerable space of time thus making it unnecessary for them to speak again hewet began to wonder whether he might not cross over to the flushings corner when hirst appeared from the background slipped into a chair by rachels side and began to talk to her with every appearance of familiarity hewet could stand it no longer he rose took his hat and dashed out of doors      chapter xviii   everything he saw was distasteful to him he hated the blue and white the intensity and definiteness the hum and heat of the south the landscape seemed to him as hard and as romantic as a cardboard background on the stage and the mountain but a wooden screen against a sheet painted blue he walked fast in spite of the heat of the sun  two roads led out of the town on the eastern side one branched off towards the ambroses villa the other struck into the country eventually reaching a village on the plain but many footpaths which had been stamped in the earth when it was wet led off from it across great dry fields to scattered farmhouses and the villas of rich natives hewet stepped off the road on to one of these in order to avoid the hardness and heat of the main road the dust of which was always being raised in small clouds by carts and ramshackle flies which carried parties of festive peasants or turkeys swelling unevenly like a bundle of air balls beneath a net or the brass bedstead and black wooden boxes of some newly wedded pair  the exercise indeed served to clear away the superficial irritations of the morning but he remained miserable it seemed proved beyond a doubt that rachel was indifferent to him for she had scarcely looked at him and she had talked to mr flushing with just the same interest with which she talked to him finally hirsts odious words flicked his mind like a whip and he remembered that he had left her talking to hirst she was at this moment talking to him and it might be true as he said that she was in love with him he went over all the evidence for this suppositionher sudden interest in hirsts writing her way of quoting his opinions respectfully or with only half a laugh her very nickname for him the great man might have some serious meaning in it supposing that there were an understanding between them what would it mean to him  damn it all he demanded am i in love with her to that he could only return himself one answer he certainly was in love with her if he knew what love meant ever since he had first seen her he had been interested and attracted more and more interested and attracted until he was scarcely able to think of anything except rachel but just as he was sliding into one of the long feasts of meditation about them both he checked himself by asking whether he wanted to marry her that was the real problem for these miseries and agonies could not be endured and it was necessary that he should make up his mind he instantly decided that he did not want to marry any one partly because he was irritated by rachel the idea of marriage irritated him it immediately suggested the picture of two people sitting alone over the fire the man was reading the woman sewing there was a second picture he saw a man jump up say goodnight leave the company and hasten away with the quiet secret look of one who is stealing to certain happiness both these pictures were very unpleasant and even more so was a third picture of husband and wife and friend and the married people glancing at each other as though they were content to let something pass unquestioned being themselves possessed of the deeper truth other pictureshe was walking very fast in his irritation and they came before him without any conscious effort like pictures on a sheetsucceeded these here were the worn husband and wife sitting with their children round them very patient tolerant and wise but that too was an unpleasant picture he tried all sorts of pictures taking them from the lives of friends of his for he knew many different married couples but he saw them always walled up in a warm firelit room when on the other hand he began to think of unmarried people he saw them active in an unlimited world above all standing on the same ground as the rest without shelter or advantage all the most individual and humane of his friends were bachelors and spinsters indeed he was surprised to find that the women he most admired and knew best were unmarried women marriage seemed to be worse for them than it was for men leaving these general pictures he considered the people whom he had been observing lately at the hotel he had often revolved these questions in his mind as he watched susan and arthur or mr and mrs thornbury or mr and mrs elliot he had observed how the shy happiness and surprise of the engaged couple had gradually been replaced by a comfortable tolerant state of mind as if they had already done with the adventure of intimacy and were taking up their parts susan used to pursue arthur about with a sweater because he had one day let slip that a brother of his had died of pneumonia the sight amused him but was not pleasant if you substituted terence and rachel for arthur and susan and arthur was far less eager to get you in a corner and talk about flying and the mechanics of aeroplanes they would settle down he then looked at the couples who had been married for several years it was true that mrs thornbury had a husband and that for the most part she was wonderfully successful in bringing him into the conversation but one could not imagine what they said to each other when they were alone there was the same difficulty with regard to the elliots except that they probably bickered openly in private they sometimes bickered in public though these disagreements were painfully covered over by little insincerities on the part of the wife who was afraid of public opinion because she was much stupider than her husband and had to make efforts to keep hold of him there could be no doubt he decided that it would have been far better for the world if these couples had separated even the ambroses whom he admired and respected profoundlyin spite of all the love between them was not their marriage too a compromise she gave way to him she spoilt him she arranged things for him she who was all truth to others was not true to her husband was not true to her friends if they came in conflict with her husband it was a strange and piteous flaw in her nature perhaps rachel had been right then when she said that night in the garden we bring out whats worst in each otherwe should live separate  no rachel had been utterly wrong every argument seemed to be against undertaking the burden of marriage until he came to rachels argument which was manifestly absurd from having been the pursued he turned and became the pursuer allowing the case against marriage to lapse he began to consider the peculiarities of character which had led to her saying that had she meant it surely one ought to know the character of the person with whom one might spend all ones life being a novelist let him try to discover what sort of person she was when he was with her he could not analyse her qualities because he seemed to know them instinctively but when he was away from her it sometimes seemed to him that he did not know her at all she was young but she was also old she had little selfconfidence and yet she was a good judge of people she was happy but what made her happy if they were alone and the excitement had worn off and they had to deal with the ordinary facts of the day what would happen casting his eye upon his own character two things appeared to him that he was very unpunctual and that he disliked answering notes as far as he knew rachel was inclined to be punctual but he could not remember that he had ever seen her with a pen in her hand let him next imagine a dinnerparty say at the crooms and wilson who had taken her down talking about the state of the liberal party she would sayof course she was absolutely ignorant of politics nevertheless she was intelligent certainly and honest too her temper was uncertainthat he had noticedand she was not domestic and she was not easy and she was not quiet or beautiful except in some dresses in some lights but the great gift she had was that she understood what was said to her there had never been any one like her for talking to you could say anythingyou could say everything and yet she was never servile here he pulled himself up for it seemed to him suddenly that he knew less about her than about any one all these thoughts had occurred to him many times already often had he tried to argue and reason and again he had reached the old state of doubt he did not know her and he did not know what she felt or whether they could live together or whether he wanted to marry her and yet he was in love with her  supposing he went to her and said he slackened his pace and began to speak aloud as if he were speaking to rachel  i worship you but i loathe marriage i hate its smugness its safety its compromise and the thought of you interfering in my work hindering me what would you answer  he stopped leant against the trunk of a tree and gazed without seeing them at some stones scattered on the bank of the dry riverbed he saw rachels face distinctly the grey eyes the hair the mouth the face that could look so many thingsplain vacant almost insignificant or wild passionate almost beautiful yet in his eyes was always the same because of the extraordinary freedom with which she looked at him and spoke as she felt what would she answer what did she feel did she love him or did she feel nothing at all for him or for any other man being as she had said that afternoon free like the wind or the sea  oh youre free he exclaimed in exultation at the thought of her and id keep you free wed be free together wed share everything together no happiness would be like ours no lives would compare with ours he opened his arms wide as if to hold her and the world in one embrace  no longer able to consider marriage or to weigh coolly what her nature was or how it would be if they lived together he dropped to the ground and sat absorbed in the thought of her and soon tormented by the desire to be in her presence again      chapter xix   but hewet need not have increased his torments by imagining that hirst was still talking to rachel the party very soon broke up the flushings going in one direction hirst in another and rachel remaining in the hall pulling the illustrated papers about turning from one to another her movements expressing the unformed restless desire in her mind she did not know whether to go or to stay though mrs flushing had commanded her to appear at tea the hall was empty save for miss willett who was playing scales with her fingers upon a sheet of sacred music and the carters an opulent couple who disliked the girl because her shoe laces were untied and she did not look sufficiently cheery which by some indirect process of thought led them to think that she would not like them rachel certainly would not have liked them if she had seen them for the excellent reason that mr carter waxed his moustache and mrs carter wore bracelets and they were evidently the kind of people who would not like her but she was too much absorbed by her own restlessness to think or to look  she was turning over the slippery pages of an american magazine when the hall door swung a wedge of light fell upon the floor and a small white figure upon whom the light seemed focussed made straight across the room to her  what you here evelyn exclaimed just caught a glimpse of you at lunch but you wouldnt condescend to look at me  it was part of evelyns character that in spite of many snubs which she received or imagined she never gave up the pursuit of people she wanted to know and in the long run generally succeeded in knowing them and even in making them like her  she looked round her i hate this place i hate these people she said i wish youd come up to my room with me i do want to talk to you  as rachel had no wish to go or to stay evelyn took her by the wrist and drew her out of the hall and up the stairs as they went upstairs two steps at a time evelyn who still kept hold of rachels hand ejaculated broken sentences about not caring a hang what people said why should one if one knows ones right and let em all go to blazes thems my opinions  she was in a state of great excitement and the muscles of her arms were twitching nervously it was evident that she was only waiting for the door to shut to tell rachel all about it indeed directly they were inside her room she sat on the end of the bed and said i suppose you think im mad  rachel was not in the mood to think clearly about any ones state of mind she was however in the mood to say straight out whatever occurred to her without fear of the consequences  somebodys proposed to you she remarked  how on earth did you guess that evelyn exclaimed some pleasure mingling with her surprise do as i look as if id just had a proposal  you look as if you had them every day rachel replied  but i dont suppose ive had more than youve had evelyn laughed rather insincerely  ive never had one  but you willlotsits the easiest thing in the worldbut thats not whats happened this afternoon exactly itsoh its a muddle a detestable horrible disgusting muddle  she went to the washstand and began sponging her cheeks with cold water for they were burning hot still sponging them and trembling slightly she turned and explained in the high pitched voice of nervous excitement alfred perrott says ive promised to marry him and i say i never did sinclair says hell shoot himself if i dont marry him and i say well shoot yourself but of course he doesntthey never do and sinclair got hold of me this afternoon and began bothering me to give an answer and accusing me of flirting with alfred perrott and told me id no heart and was merely a siren oh and quantities of pleasant things like that so at last i said to him well sinclair youve said enough now you can just let me go and then he caught me and kissed methe disgusting brutei can still feel his nasty hairy face just thereas if hed any right to after what hed said  she sponged a spot on her left cheek energetically  ive never met a man that was fit to compare with a woman she cried theyve no dignity theyve no courage theyve nothing but their beastly passions and their brute strength would any woman have behaved like thatif a man had said he didnt want her weve too much selfrespect were infinitely finer than they are  she walked about the room dabbing her wet cheeks with a towel tears were now running down with the drops of cold water  it makes me angry she explained drying her eyes  rachel sat watching her she did not think of evelyns position she only thought that the world was full or people in torment  theres only one man here i really like evelyn continued terence hewet one feels as if one could trust him  at these words rachel suffered an indescribable chill her heart seemed to be pressed together by cold hands  why she asked why can you trust him  i dont know said evelyn dont you have feelings about people feelings youre absolutely certain are right i had a long talk with terence the other night i felt we were really friends after that theres something of a woman in him she paused as though she were thinking of very intimate things that terence had told her so at least rachel interpreted her gaze  she tried to force herself to say has to be proposed to you but the question was too tremendous and in another moment evelyn was saying that the finest men were like women and women were nobler than menfor example one couldnt imagine a woman like lillah harrison thinking a mean thing or having anything base about her  how id like you to know her she exclaimed  she was becoming much calmer and her cheeks were now quite dry her eyes had regained their usual expression of keen vitality and she seemed to have forgotten alfred and sinclair and her emotion lillah runs a home for inebriate women in the deptford road she continued she started it managed it did everything off her own bat and its now the biggest of its kind in england you cant think what those women are likeand their homes but she goes among them at all hours of the day and night ive often been with her    thats whats the matter with us    we dont do things what do you do she demanded looking at rachel with a slightly ironical smile rachel had scarcely listened to any of this and her expression was vacant and unhappy she had conceived an equal dislike for lillah harrison and her work in the deptford road and for evelyn m and her profusion of love affairs  i play she said with an affection of stolid composure  thats about it evelyn laughed we none of us do anything but play and thats why women like lillah harrison whos worth twenty of you and me have to work themselves to the bone but im tired of playing she went on lying flat on the bed and raising her arms above her head thus stretched out she looked more diminutive than ever  im going to do something ive got a splendid idea look here you must join im sure youve got any amount of stuff in you though you lookwell as if youd lived all your life in a garden she sat up and began to explain with animation i belong to a club in london it meets every saturday so its called the saturday club were supposed to talk about art but im sick of talking about artwhats the good of it with all kinds of real things going on round one it isnt as if theyd got anything to say about art either so what im going to tell em is that weve talked enough about art and wed better talk about life for a change questions that really matter to peoples lives the white slave traffic women suffrage the insurance bill and so on and when weve made up our mind what we want to do we could form ourselves into a society for doing it    im certain that if people like ourselves were to take things in hand instead of leaving it to policemen and magistrates we could put a stop toprostitutionshe lowered her voice at the ugly wordin six months my idea is that men and women ought to join in these matters we ought to go into piccadilly and stop one of these poor wretches and say now look here im no better than you are and i dont pretend to be any better but youre doing what you know to be beastly and i wont have you doing beastly things because were all the same under our skins and if you do a beastly thing it does matter to me thats what mr bax was saying this morning and its true though you clever peopleyoure clever too arent youdont believe it  when evelyn began talkingit was a fact she often regrettedher thoughts came so quickly that she never had any time to listen to other peoples thoughts she continued without more pause than was needed for taking breath  i dont see why the saturday club people shouldnt do a really great work in that way she went on of course it would want organisation some one to give their life to it but im ready to do that my notions to think of the human beings first and let the abstract ideas take care of themselves whats wrong with lillahif there is anything wrongis that she thinks of temperance first and the women afterwards now theres one thing ill say to my credit she continued im not intellectual or artistic or anything of that sort but im jolly human she slipped off the bed and sat on the floor looking up at rachel she searched up into her face as if she were trying to read what kind of character was concealed behind the face she put her hand on rachels knee  it is being human that counts isnt it she continued being real whatever mr hirst may say are you real  rachel felt much as terence had felt that evelyn was too close to her and that there was something exciting in this closeness although it was also disagreeable she was spared the need of finding an answer to the question for evelyn proceeded do you believe in anything  in order to put an end to the scrutiny of these bright blue eyes and to relieve her own physical restlessness rachel pushed back her chair and exclaimed in everything and began to finger different objects the books on the table the photographs the freshly leaved plant with the stiff bristles which stood in a large earthenware pot in the window  i believe in the bed in the photographs in the pot in the balcony in the sun in mrs flushing she remarked still speaking recklessly with something at the back of her mind forcing her to say the things that one usually does not say but i dont believe in god i dont believe in mr bax i dont believe in the hospital nurse i dont believe she took up a photograph and looking at it did not finish her sentence  thats my mother said evelyn who remained sitting on the floor binding her knees together with her arms and watching rachel curiously  rachel considered the portrait well i dont much believe in her she remarked after a time in a low tone of voice  mrs murgatroyd looked indeed as if the life had been crushed out of her she knelt on a chair gazing piteously from behind the body of a pomeranian dog which she clasped to her cheek as if for protection  and thats my dad said evelyn for there were two photographs in one frame the second photograph represented a handsome soldier with high regular features and a heavy black moustache his hand rested on the hilt of his sword there was a decided likeness between him and evelyn  and its because of them said evelyn that im going to help the other women youve heard about me i suppose they werent married you see im not anybody in particular im not a bit ashamed of it they loved each other anyhow and thats more than most people can say of their parents  rachel sat down on the bed with the two pictures in her hands and compared themthe man and the woman who had so evelyn said loved each other that fact interested her more than the campaign on behalf of unfortunate women which evelyn was once more beginning to describe she looked again from one to the other  what dyou think its like she asked as evelyn paused for a minute being in love  have you never been in love evelyn asked oh noones only got to look at you to see that she added she considered i really was in love once she said she fell into reflection her eyes losing their bright vitality and approaching something like an expression of tenderness it was heavenlywhile it lasted the worst of it is it dont last not with me thats the bother  she went on to consider the difficulty with alfred and sinclair about which she had pretended to ask rachels advice but she did not want advice she wanted intimacy when she looked at rachel who was still looking at the photographs on the bed she could not help seeing that rachel was not thinking about her what was she thinking about then evelyn was tormented by the little spark of life in her which was always trying to work through to other people and was always being rebuffed falling silent she looked at her visitor her shoes her stockings the combs in her hair all the details of her dress in short as though by seizing every detail she might get closer to the life within  rachel at last put down the photographs walked to the window and remarked its odd people talk as much about love as they do about religion  i wish youd sit down and talk said evelyn impatiently  instead rachel opened the window which was made in two long panes and looked down into the garden below  thats where we got lost the first night she said it must have been in those bushes  they kill hens down there said evelyn they cut their heads off with a knifedisgusting but tell mewhat  id like to explore the hotel rachel interrupted she drew her head in and looked at evelyn who still sat on the floor  its just like other hotels said evelyn  that might be although every room and passage and chair in the place had a character of its own in rachels eyes but she could not bring herself to stay in one place any longer she moved slowly towards the door  what is it you want said evelyn you make me feel as if you were always thinking of something you dont say    do say it  but rachel made no response to this invitation either she stopped with her fingers on the handle of the door as if she remembered that some sort of pronouncement was due from her  i suppose youll marry one of them she said and then turned the handle and shut the door behind her she walked slowly down the passage running her hand along the wall beside her she did not think which way she was going and therefore walked down a passage which only led to a window and a balcony she looked down at the kitchen premises the wrong side of the hotel life which was cut off from the right side by a maze of small bushes the ground was bare old tins were scattered about and the bushes wore towels and aprons upon their heads to dry every now and then a waiter came out in a white apron and threw rubbish on to a heap two large women in cotton dresses were sitting on a bench with bloodsmeared tin trays in front of them and yellow bodies across their knees they were plucking the birds and talking as they plucked suddenly a chicken came floundering half flying half running into the space pursued by a third woman whose age could hardly be under eighty although wizened and unsteady on her legs she kept up the chase egged on by the laughter of the others her face was expressive of furious rage and as she ran she swore in spanish frightened by handclapping here a napkin there the bird ran this way and that in sharp angles and finally fluttered straight at the old woman who opened her scanty grey skirts to enclose it dropped upon it in a bundle and then holding it out cut its head off with an expression of vindictive energy and triumph combined the blood and the ugly wriggling fascinated rachel so that although she knew that some one had come up behind and was standing beside her she did not turn round until the old woman had settled down on the bench beside the others then she looked up sharply because of the ugliness of what she had seen it was miss allan who stood beside her  not a pretty sight said miss allan although i daresay its really more humane than our method    i dont believe youve ever been in my room she added and turned away as if she meant rachel to follow her rachel followed for it seemed possible that each new person might remove the mystery which burdened her  the bedrooms at the hotel were all on the same pattern save that some were larger and some smaller they had a floor of dark red tiles they had a high bed draped in mosquito curtains they had each a writingtable and a dressingtable and a couple of armchairs but directly a box was unpacked the rooms became very different so that miss allans room was very unlike evelyns room there were no variously coloured hatpins on her dressingtable no scentbottles no narrow curved pairs of scissors no great variety of shoes and boots no silk petticoats lying on the chairs the room was extremely neat there seemed to be two pairs of everything the writingtable however was piled with manuscript and a table was drawn out to stand by the armchair on which were two separate heaps of dark library books in which there were many slips of paper sticking out at different degrees of thickness miss allan had asked rachel to come in out of kindness thinking that she was waiting about with nothing to do moreover she liked young women for she had taught many of them and having received so much hospitality from the ambroses she was glad to be able to repay a minute part of it she looked about accordingly for something to show her the room did not provide much entertainment she touched her manuscript age of chaucer age of elizabeth age of dryden she reflected im glad there arent many more ages im still in the middle of the eighteenth century wont you sit down miss vinrace the chair though small is firm    euphues the germ of the english novel she continued glancing at another page is that the kind of thing that interests you  she looked at rachel with great kindness and simplicity as though she would do her utmost to provide anything she wished to have this expression had a remarkable charm in a face otherwise much lined with care and thought  oh no its music with you isnt it she continued recollecting and i generally find that they dont go together sometimes of course we have prodigies she was looking about her for something and now saw a jar on the mantelpiece which she reached down and gave to rachel if you put your finger into this jar you may be able to extract a piece of preserved ginger are you a prodigy  but the ginger was deep and could not be reached  dont bother she said as miss allan looked about for some other implement i daresay i shouldnt like preserved ginger  youve never tried enquired miss allan then i consider that it is your duty to try now why you may add a new pleasure to life and as you are still young she wondered whether a buttonhook would do i make it a rule to try everything she said dont you think it would be very annoying if you tasted ginger for the first time on your deathbed and found you never liked anything so much i should be so exceedingly annoyed that i think i should get well on that account alone  she was now successful and a lump of ginger emerged on the end of the buttonhook while she went to wipe the buttonhook rachel bit the ginger and at once cried i must spit it out  are you sure you have really tasted it miss allan demanded  for answer rachel threw it out of the window  an experience anyhow said miss allan calmly let me seei have nothing else to offer you unless you would like to taste this a small cupboard hung above her bed and she took out of it a slim elegant jar filled with a bright green fluid  creme de menthe she said liqueur you know it looks as if i drank doesnt it as a matter of fact it goes to prove what an exceptionally abstemious person i am ive had that jar for sixandtwenty years she added looking at it with pride as she tipped it over and from the height of the liquid it could be seen that the bottle was still untouched  twentysix years rachel exclaimed  miss allan was gratified for she had meant rachel to be surprised  when i went to dresden sixandtwenty years ago she said a certain friend of mine announced her intention of making me a present she thought that in the event of shipwreck or accident a stimulant might be useful however as i had no occasion for it i gave it back on my return on the eve of any foreign journey the same bottle always makes its appearance with the same note on my return in safety it is always handed back i consider it a kind of charm against accidents though i was once detained twentyfour hours by an accident to the train in front of me i have never met with any accident myself yes she continued now addressing the bottle we have seen many climes and cupboards together have we not i intend one of these days to have a silver label made with an inscription it is a gentleman as you may observe and his name is oliver    i do not think i could forgive you miss vinrace if you broke my oliver she said firmly taking the bottle out of rachels hands and replacing it in the cupboard  rachel was swinging the bottle by the neck she was interested by miss allan to the point of forgetting the bottle  well she exclaimed i do think that odd to have had a friend for twentysix years and a bottle andto have made all those journeys  not at all i call it the reverse of odd miss allan replied i always consider myself the most ordinary person i know its rather distinguished to be as ordinary as i am i forgetare you a prodigy or did you say you were not a prodigy  she smiled at rachel very kindly she seemed to have known and experienced so much as she moved cumbrously about the room that surely there must be balm for all anguish in her words could one induce her to have recourse to them but miss allan who was now locking the cupboard door showed no signs of breaking the reticence which had snowed her under for years an uncomfortable sensation kept rachel silent on the one hand she wished to whirl high and strike a spark out of the cool pink flesh on the other she perceived there was nothing to be done but to drift past each other in silence  im not a prodigy i find it very difficult to say what i mean she observed at length  its a matter of temperament i believe miss allan helped her there are some people who have no difficulty for myself i find there are a great many things i simply cannot say but then i consider myself very slow one of my colleagues now knows whether she likes you or notlet me see how does she do itby the way you say goodmorning at breakfast it is sometimes a matter of years before i can make up my mind but most young people seem to find it easy  oh no said rachel its hard  miss allan looked at rachel quietly saying nothing she suspected that there were difficulties of some kind then she put her hand to the back of her head and discovered that one of the grey coils of hair had come loose  i must ask you to be so kind as to excuse me she said rising if i do my hair i have never yet found a satisfactory type of hairpin i must change my dress too for the matter of that and i should be particularly glad of your assistance because there is a tiresome set of hooks which i can fasten for myself but it takes from ten to fifteen minutes whereas with your help  she slipped off her coat and skirt and blouse and stood doing her hair before the glass a massive homely figure her petticoat being so short that she stood on a pair of thick slategrey legs  people say youth is pleasant i myself find middle age far pleasanter she remarked removing hair pins and combs and taking up her brush when it fell loose her hair only came down to her neck  when one was young she continued things could seem so very serious if one was made that way    and now my dress  in a wonderfully short space of time her hair had been reformed in its usual loops the upper half of her body now became dark green with black stripes on it the skirt however needed hooking at various angles and rachel had to kneel on the floor fitting the eyes to the hooks  our miss johnson used to find life very unsatisfactory i remember miss allan continued she turned her back to the light and then she took to breeding guineapigs for their spots and became absorbed in that i have just heard that the yellow guineapig has had a black baby we had a bet of sixpence on about it she will be very triumphant  the skirt was fastened she looked at herself in the glass with the curious stiffening of her face generally caused by looking in the glass  am i in a fit state to encounter my fellowbeings she asked i forget which way it isbut they find black animals very rarely have coloured babiesit may be the other way round i have had it so often explained to me that it is very stupid of me to have forgotten again  she moved about the room acquiring small objects with quiet force and fixing them about hera locket a watch and chain a heavy gold bracelet and the particoloured button of a suffrage society finally completely equipped for sunday tea she stood before rachel and smiled at her kindly she was not an impulsive woman and her life had schooled her to restrain her tongue at the same time she was possessed of an amount of goodwill towards others and in particular towards the young which often made her regret that speech was so difficult  shall we descend she said  she put one hand upon rachels shoulder and stooping picked up a pair of walkingshoes with the other and placed them neatly side by side outside her door as they walked down the passage they passed many pairs of boots and shoes some black and some brown all side by side and all different even to the way in which they lay together  i always think that people are so like their boots said miss allan that is mrs paleys but as she spoke the door opened and mrs paley rolled out in her chair equipped also for tea  she greeted miss allan and rachel  i was just saying that people are so like their boots said miss allan mrs paley did not hear she repeated it more loudly still mrs paley did not hear she repeated it a third time mrs paley heard but she did not understand she was apparently about to repeat it for the fourth time when rachel suddenly said something inarticulate and disappeared down the corridor this misunderstanding which involved a complete block in the passage seemed to her unbearable she walked quickly and blindly in the opposite direction and found herself at the end of a cul de sac there was a window and a table and a chair in the window and upon the table stood a rusty inkstand an ashtray an old copy of a french newspaper and a pen with a broken nib rachel sat down as if to study the french newspaper but a tear fell on the blurred french print raising a soft blot she lifted her head sharply exclaiming aloud its intolerable looking out of the window with eyes that would have seen nothing even had they not been dazed by tears she indulged herself at last in violent abuse of the entire day it had been miserable from start to finish first the service in the chapel then luncheon then evelyn then miss allan then old mrs paley blocking up the passage all day long she had been tantalized and put off she had now reached one of those eminences the result of some crisis from which the world is finally displayed in its true proportions she disliked the look of it immenselychurches politicians misfits and huge imposturesmen like mr dalloway men like mr bax evelyn and her chatter mrs paley blocking up the passage meanwhile the steady beat of her own pulse represented the hot current of feeling that ran down beneath beating struggling fretting for the time her own body was the source of all the life in the world which tried to burst forth herethereand was repressed now by mr bax now by evelyn now by the imposition of ponderous stupidity the weight of the entire world thus tormented she would twist her hands together for all things were wrong all people stupid vaguely seeing that there were people down in the garden beneath she represented them as aimless masses of matter floating hither and thither without aim except to impede her what were they doing those other people in the world  nobody knows she said the force of her rage was beginning to spend itself and the vision of the world which had been so vivid became dim  its a dream she murmured she considered the rusty inkstand the pen the ashtray and the old french newspaper these small and worthless objects seemed to her to represent human lives  were asleep and dreaming she repeated but the possibility which now suggested itself that one of the shapes might be the shape of terence roused her from her melancholy lethargy she became as restless as she had been before she sat down she was no longer able to see the world as a town laid out beneath her it was covered instead by a haze of feverish red mist she had returned to the state in which she had been all day thinking was no escape physical movement was the only refuge in and out of rooms in and out of peoples minds seeking she knew not what therefore she rose pushed back the table and went downstairs she went out of the hall door and turning the corner of the hotel found herself among the people whom she had seen from the window but owing to the broad sunshine after shaded passages and to the substance of living people after dreams the group appeared with startling intensity as though the dusty surface had been peeled off everything leaving only the reality and the instant it had the look of a vision printed on the dark at night white and grey and purple figures were scattered on the green round wicker tables in the middle the flame of the teaurn made the air waver like a faulty sheet of glass a massive green tree stood over them as if it were a moving force held at rest as she approached she could hear evelyns voice repeating monotonously here thenheregood doggie come here for a moment nothing seemed to happen it all stood still and then she realised that one of the figures was helen ambrose and the dust again began to settle  the group indeed had come together in a miscellaneous way one teatable joining to another teatable and deckchairs serving to connect two groups but even at a distance it could be seen that mrs flushing upright and imperious dominated the party she was talking vehemently to helen across the table  ten days under canvas she was saying no comforts if you want comforts dont come but i may tell you if you dont come youll regret it all your life you say yes  at this moment mrs flushing caught sight of rachel  ah theres your niece shes promised youre coming arent you having adopted the plan she pursued it with the energy of a child  rachel took her part with eagerness  of course im coming so are you helen and mr pepper too as she sat she realised that she was surrounded by people she knew but that terence was not among them from various angles people began saying what they thought of the proposed expedition according to some it would be hot but the nights would be cold according to others the difficulties would lie rather in getting a boat and in speaking the language mrs flushing disposed of all objections whether due to man or due to nature by announcing that her husband would settle all that  meanwhile mr flushing quietly explained to helen that the expedition was really a simple matter it took five days at the outside and the placea native villagewas certainly well worth seeing before she returned to england helen murmured ambiguously and did not commit herself to one answer rather than to another  the teaparty however included too many different kinds of people for general conversation to flourish and from rachels point of view possessed the great advantage that it was quite unnecessary for her to talk over there susan and arthur were explaining to mrs paley that an expedition had been proposed and mrs paley having grasped the fact gave the advice of an old traveller that they should take nice canned vegetables fur cloaks and insect powder she leant over to mrs flushing and whispered something which from the twinkle in her eyes probably had reference to bugs then helen was reciting toll for the brave to st john hirst in order apparently to win a sixpence which lay upon the table while mr hughling elliot imposed silence upon his section of the audience by his fascinating anecdote of lord curzon and the undergraduates bicycle mrs thornbury was trying to remember the name of a man who might have been another garibaldi and had written a book which they ought to read and mr thornbury recollected that he had a pair of binoculars at anybodys service miss allan meanwhile murmured with the curious intimacy which a spinster often achieves with dogs to the foxterrier which evelyn had at last induced to come over to them little particles of dust or blossom fell on the plates now and then when the branches sighed above rachel seemed to see and hear a little of everything much as a river feels the twigs that fall into it and sees the sky above but her eyes were too vague for evelyns liking she came across and sat on the ground at rachels feet  well she asked suddenly what are you thinking about  miss warrington rachel replied rashly because she had to say something she did indeed see susan murmuring to mrs elliot while arthur stared at her with complete confidence in his own love both rachel and evelyn then began to listen to what susan was saying  theres the ordering and the dogs and the garden and the children coming to be taught her voice proceeded rhythmically as if checking the list and my tennis and the village and letters to write for father and a thousand little things that dont sound much but i never have a moment to myself and when i got to bed im so sleepy im off before my head touches the pillow besides i like to be a great deal with my auntsim a great bore arent i aunt emma she smiled at old mrs paley who with head slightly drooped was regarding the cake with speculative affection and father has to be very careful about chills in winter which means a great deal of running about because he wont look after himself any more than you will arthur so it all mounts up  her voice mounted too in a mild ecstasy of satisfaction with her life and her own nature rachel suddenly took a violent dislike to susan ignoring all that was kindly modest and even pathetic about her she appeared insincere and cruel she saw her grown stout and prolific the kind blue eyes now shallow and watery the bloom of the cheeks congealed to a network of dry red canals  helen turned to her did you go to church she asked she had won her sixpence and seemed making ready to go  yes said rachel for the last time she added  in preparing to put on her gloves helen dropped one  youre not going evelyn asked taking hold of one glove as if to keep them  its high time we went said helen dont you see how silent every ones getting  a silence had fallen upon them all caused partly by one of the accidents of talk and partly because they saw some one approaching helen could not see who it was but keeping her eyes fixed upon rachel observed something which made her say to herself so its hewet she drew on her gloves with a curious sense of the significance of the moment then she rose for mrs flushing had seen hewet too and was demanding information about rivers and boats which showed that the whole conversation would now come over again  rachel followed her and they walked in silence down the avenue in spite of what helen had seen and understood the feeling that was uppermost in her mind was now curiously perverse if she went on this expedition she would not be able to have a bath the effort appeared to her to be great and disagreeable  its so unpleasant being cooped up with people one hardly knows she remarked people who mind being seen naked  you dont mean to go rachel asked  the intensity with which this was spoken irritated mrs ambrose  i dont mean to go and i dont mean not to go she replied she became more and more casual and indifferent  after all i daresay weve seen all there is to be seen and theres the bother of getting there and whatever they may say its bound to be vilely uncomfortable  for some time rachel made no reply but every sentence helen spoke increased her bitterness at last she broke out  thank god helen im not like you i sometimes think you dont think or feel or care to do anything but exist youre like mr hirst you see that things are bad and you pride yourself on saying so its what you call being honest as a matter of fact its being lazy being dull being nothing you dont help you put an end to things  helen smiled as if she rather enjoyed the attack  well she enquired  it seems to me badthats all rachel replied  quite likely said helen  at any other time rachel would probably have been silenced by her aunts candour but this afternoon she was not in the mood to be silenced by any one a quarrel would be welcome  youre only half alive she continued  is that because i didnt accept mr flushings invitation helen asked or do you always think that  at the moment it appeared to rachel that she had always seen the same faults in helen from the very first night on board the euphrosyne in spite of her beauty in spite of her magnanimity and their love  oh its only whats the matter with every one she exclaimed no one feelsno one does anything but hurt i tell you helen the worlds bad its an agony living wanting  here she tore a handful of leaves from a bush and crushed them to control herself  the lives of these people she tried to explain the aimlessness the way they live one goes from one to another and its all the same one never gets what one wants out of any of them  her emotional state and her confusion would have made her an easy prey if helen had wished to argue or had wished to draw confidences but instead of talking she fell into a profound silence as they walked on aimless trivial meaningless oh nowhat she had seen at tea made it impossible for her to believe that the little jokes the chatter the inanities of the afternoon had shrivelled up before her eyes underneath the likings and spites the comings together and partings great things were happeningterrible things because they were so great her sense of safety was shaken as if beneath twigs and dead leaves she had seen the movement of a snake it seemed to her that a moments respite was allowed a moments makebelieve and then again the profound and reasonless law asserted itself moulding them all to its liking making and destroying  she looked at rachel walking beside her still crushing the leaves in her fingers and absorbed in her own thoughts she was in love and she pitied her profoundly but she roused herself from these thoughts and apologised im very sorry she said but if im dull its my nature and it cant be helped if it was a natural defect however she found an easy remedy for she went on to say that she thought mr flushings scheme a very good one only needing a little consideration which it appeared she had given it by the time they reached home by that time they had settled that if anything more was said they would accept the invitation      chapter xx   when considered in detail by mr flushing and mrs ambrose the expedition proved neither dangerous nor difficult they found also that it was not even unusual every year at this season english people made parties which steamed a short way up the river landed and looked at the native village bought a certain number of things from the natives and returned again without damage done to mind or body when it was discovered that six people really wished the same thing the arrangements were soon carried out  since the time of elizabeth very few people had seen the river and nothing has been done to change its appearance from what it was to the eyes of the elizabethan voyagers the time of elizabeth was only distant from the present time by a moment of space compared with the ages which had passed since the water had run between those banks and the green thickets swarmed there and the small trees had grown to huge wrinkled trees in solitude changing only with the change of the sun and the clouds the waving green mass had stood there for century after century and the water had run between its banks ceaselessly sometimes washing away earth and sometimes the branches of trees while in other parts of the world one town had risen upon the ruins of another town and the men in the towns had become more and more articulate and unlike each other a few miles of this river were visible from the top of the mountain where some weeks before the party from the hotel had picnicked susan and arthur had seen it as they kissed each other and terence and rachel as they sat talking about richmond and evelyn and perrott as they strolled about imagining that they were great captains sent to colonise the world they had seen the broad blue mark across the sand where it flowed into the sea and the green cloud of trees mass themselves about it farther up and finally hide its waters altogether from sight at intervals for the first twenty miles or so houses were scattered on the bank by degrees the houses became huts and later still there was neither hut nor house but trees and grass which were seen only by hunters explorers or merchants marching or sailing but making no settlement  by leaving santa marina early in the morning driving twenty miles and riding eight the party which was composed finally of six english people reached the riverside as the night fell they came cantering through the treesmr and mrs flushing helen ambrose rachel terence and st john the tired little horses then stopped automatically and the english dismounted mrs flushing strode to the riverbank in high spirits the day had been long and hot but she had enjoyed the speed and the open air she had left the hotel which she hated and she found the company to her liking the river was swirling past in the darkness they could just distinguish the smooth moving surface of the water and the air was full of the sound of it they stood in an empty space in the midst of great treetrunks and out there a little green light moving slightly up and down showed them where the steamer lay in which they were to embark  when they all stood upon its deck they found that it was a very small boat which throbbed gently beneath them for a few minutes and then shoved smoothly through the water they seemed to be driving into the heart of the night for the trees closed in front of them and they could hear all round them the rustling of leaves the great darkness had the usual effect of taking away all desire for communication by making their words sound thin and small and after walking round the deck three or four times they clustered together yawning deeply and looking at the same spot of deep gloom on the banks murmuring very low in the rhythmical tone of one oppressed by the air mrs flushing began to wonder where they were to sleep for they could not sleep downstairs they could not sleep in a doghole smelling of oil they could not sleep on deck they could not sleepshe yawned profoundly it was as helen had foreseen the question of nakedness had risen already although they were half asleep and almost invisible to each other with st johns help she stretched an awning and persuaded mrs flushing that she could take off her clothes behind this and that no one would notice if by chance some part of her which had been concealed for fortyfive years was laid bare to the human eye mattresses were thrown down rugs provided and the three women lay near each other in the soft open air  the gentlemen having smoked a certain number of cigarettes dropped the glowing ends into the river and looked for a time at the ripples wrinkling the black water beneath them undressed too and lay down at the other end of the boat they were very tired and curtained from each other by the darkness the light from one lantern fell upon a few ropes a few planks of the deck and the rail of the boat but beyond that there was unbroken darkness no light reached their faces or the trees which were massed on the sides of the river  soon wilfrid flushing slept and hirst slept hewet alone lay awake looking straight up into the sky the gentle motion and the black shapes that were drawn ceaselessly across his eyes had the effect of making it impossible for him to think rachels presence so near him lulled thought asleep being so near him only a few paces off at the other end of the boat she made it as impossible for him to think about her as it would have been impossible to see her if she had stood quite close to him her forehead against his forehead in some strange way the boat became identified with himself and just as it would have been useless for him to get up and steer the boat so was it useless for him to struggle any longer with the irresistible force of his own feelings he was drawn on and on away from all he knew slipping over barriers and past landmarks into unknown waters as the boat glided over the smooth surface of the river in profound peace enveloped in deeper unconsciousness than had been his for many nights he lay on deck watching the treetops change their position slightly against the sky and arch themselves and sink and tower huge until he passed from seeing them into dreams where he lay beneath the shadow of the vast trees looking up into the sky  when they woke next morning they had gone a considerable way up the river on the right was a high yellow bank of sand tufted with trees on the left a swamp quivering with long reeds and tall bamboos on the top of which swaying slightly perched vivid green and yellow birds the morning was hot and still after breakfast they drew chairs together and sat in an irregular semicircle in the bow an awning above their heads protected them from the heat of the sun and the breeze which the boat made aired them softly mrs flushing was already dotting and striping her canvas her head jerking this way and that with the action of a bird nervously picking up grain the others had books or pieces of paper or embroidery on their knees at which they looked fitfully and again looked at the river ahead at one point hewet read part of a poem aloud but the number of moving things entirely vanquished his words he ceased to read and no one spoke they moved on under the shelter of the trees there was now a covey of red birds feeding on one of the little islets to the left or again a bluegreen parrot flew shrieking from tree to tree as they moved on the country grew wilder and wilder the trees and the undergrowth seemed to be strangling each other near the ground in a multitudinous wrestle while here and there a splendid tree towered high above the swarm shaking its thin green umbrellas lightly in the upper air hewet looked at his books again the morning was peaceful as the night had been only it was very strange because he could see it was light and he could see rachel and hear her voice and be near to her he felt as if he were waiting as if somehow he were stationary among things that passed over him and around him voices peoples bodies birds only rachel too was waiting with him he looked at her sometimes as if she must know that they were waiting together and being drawn on together without being able to offer any resistance again he read from his book       whoever you are holding me now in your hand      without one thing all will be useless  a bird gave a wild laugh a monkey chuckled a malicious question and as fire fades in the hot sunshine his words flickered and went out  by degrees as the river narrowed and the high sandbanks fell to level ground thickly grown with trees the sounds of the forest could be heard it echoed like a hall there were sudden cries and then long spaces of silence such as there are in a cathedral when a boys voice has ceased and the echo of it still seems to haunt about the remote places of the roof once mr flushing rose and spoke to a sailor and even announced that some time after luncheon the steamer would stop and they could walk a little way through the forest  there are tracks all through the trees there he explained were no distance from civilisation yet  he scrutinised his wifes painting too polite to praise it openly he contented himself with cutting off one half of the picture with one hand and giving a flourish in the air with the other  god hirst exclaimed staring straight ahead dont you think its amazingly beautiful  beautiful helen enquired it seemed a strange little word and hirst and herself both so small that she forgot to answer him  hewet felt that he must speak  thats where the elizabethans got their style he mused staring into the profusion of leaves and blossoms and prodigious fruits  shakespeare i hate shakespeare mrs flushing exclaimed and wilfrid returned admiringly i believe youre the only person who dares to say that alice but mrs flushing went on painting she did not appear to attach much value to her husbands compliment and painted steadily sometimes muttering a halfaudible word or groan  the morning was now very hot  look at hirst mr flushing whispered his sheet of paper had slipped on to the deck his head lay back and he drew a long snoring breath  terence picked up the sheet of paper and spread it out before rachel it was a continuation of the poem on god which he had begun in the chapel and it was so indecent that rachel did not understand half of it although she saw that it was indecent hewet began to fill in words where hirst had left spaces but he soon ceased his pencil rolled on deck gradually they approached nearer and nearer to the bank on the righthand side so that the light which covered them became definitely green falling through a shade of green leaves and mrs flushing set aside her sketch and stared ahead of her in silence hirst woke up they were then called to luncheon and while they ate it the steamer came to a standstill a little way out from the bank the boat which was towed behind them was brought to the side and the ladies were helped into it  for protection against boredom helen put a book of memoirs beneath her arm and mrs flushing her paintbox and thus equipped they allowed themselves to be set on shore on the verge of the forest  they had not strolled more than a few hundred yards along the track which ran parallel with the river before helen professed to find it was unbearably hot the river breeze had ceased and a hot steamy atmosphere thick with scents came from the forest  i shall sit down here she announced pointing to the trunk of a tree which had fallen long ago and was now laced across and across by creepers and thonglike brambles she seated herself opened her parasol and looked at the river which was barred by the stems of trees she turned her back to the trees which disappeared in black shadow behind her  i quite agree said mrs flushing and proceeded to undo her paintbox her husband strolled about to select an interesting point of view for her hirst cleared a space on the ground by helens side and seated himself with great deliberation as if he did not mean to move until he had talked to her for a long time terence and rachel were left standing by themselves without occupation terence saw that the time had come as it was fated to come but although he realised this he was completely calm and master of himself he chose to stand for a few moments talking to helen and persuading her to leave her seat rachel joined him too in advising her to come with them  of all the people ive ever met he said youre the least adventurous you might be sitting on green chairs in hyde park are you going to sit there the whole afternoon arent you going to walk  oh no said helen ones only got to use ones eye theres everything hereeverything she repeated in a drowsy tone of voice what will you gain by walking  youll be hot and disagreeable by teatime we shall be cool and sweet put in hirst into his eyes as he looked up at them had come yellow and green reflections from the sky and the branches robbing them of their intentness and he seemed to think what he did not say it was thus taken for granted by them both that terence and rachel proposed to walk into the woods together with one look at each other they turned away  goodbye cried rachel  goodby beware of snakes hirst replied he settled himself still more comfortably under the shade of the fallen tree and helens figure as they went mr flushing called after them we must start in an hour hewet please remember that an hour  whether made by man or for some reason preserved by nature there was a wide pathway striking through the forest at right angles to the river it resembled a drive in an english forest save that tropical bushes with their swordlike leaves grew at the side and the ground was covered with an unmarked springy moss instead of grass starred with little yellow flowers as they passed into the depths of the forest the light grew dimmer and the noises of the ordinary world were replaced by those creaking and sighing sounds which suggest to the traveller in a forest that he is walking at the bottom of the sea the path narrowed and turned it was hedged in by dense creepers which knotted tree to tree and burst here and there into starshaped crimson blossoms the sighing and creaking up above were broken every now and then by the jarring cry of some startled animal the atmosphere was close and the air came at them in languid puffs of scent the vast green light was broken here and there by a round of pure yellow sunlight which fell through some gap in the immense umbrella of green above and in these yellow spaces crimson and black butterflies were circling and settling terence and rachel hardly spoke  not only did the silence weigh upon them but they were both unable to frame any thoughts there was something between them which had to be spoken of one of them had to begin but which of them was it to be then hewet picked up a red fruit and threw it as high as he could when it dropped he would speak they heard the flapping of great wings they heard the fruit go pattering through the leaves and eventually fall with a thud the silence was again profound  does this frighten you terence asked when the sound of the fruit falling had completely died away  no she answered i like it  she repeated i like it she was walking fast and holding herself more erect than usual there was another pause  you like being with me terence asked  yes with you she replied  he was silent for a moment silence seemed to have fallen upon the world  that is what i have felt ever since i knew you he replied we are happy together he did not seem to be speaking or she to be hearing  very happy she answered  they continued to walk for some time in silence their steps unconsciously quickened  we love each other terence said  we love each other she repeated  the silence was then broken by their voices which joined in tones of strange unfamiliar sound which formed no words faster and faster they walked simultaneously they stopped clasped each other in their arms then releasing themselves dropped to the earth they sat side by side sounds stood out from the background making a bridge across their silence they heard the swish of the trees and some beast croaking in a remote world  we love each other terence repeated searching into her face their faces were both very pale and quiet and they said nothing he was afraid to kiss her again by degrees she drew close to him and rested against him in this position they sat for some time she said terence once he answered rachel  terribleterrible she murmured after another pause but in saying this she was thinking as much of the persistent churning of the water as of her own feeling on and on it went in the distance the senseless and cruel churning of the water she observed that the tears were running down terences cheeks  the next movement was on his part a very long time seemed to have passed he took out his watch  flushing said an hour weve been gone more than half an hour  and it takes that to get back said rachel she raised herself very slowly when she was standing up she stretched her arms and drew a deep breath half a sigh half a yawn she appeared to be very tired her cheeks were white which way she asked  there said terence  they began to walk back down the mossy path again the sighing and creaking continued far overhead and the jarring cries of animals the butterflies were circling still in the patches of yellow sunlight at first terence was certain of his way but as they walked he became doubtful they had to stop to consider and then to return and start once more for although he was certain of the direction of the river he was not certain of striking the point where they had left the others rachel followed him stopping where he stopped turning where he turned ignorant of the way ignorant why he stopped or why he turned  i dont want to be late he said because he put a flower into her hand and her fingers closed upon it quietly were so lateso lateso horribly late he repeated as if he were talking in his sleep ahthis is right we turn here  they found themselves again in the broad path like the drive in the english forest where they had started when they left the others they walked on in silence as people walking in their sleep and were oddly conscious now and again of the mass of their bodies then rachel exclaimed suddenly helen  in the sunny space at the edge of the forest they saw helen still sitting on the treetrunk her dress showing very white in the sun with hirst still propped on his elbow by her side they stopped instinctively at the sight of other people they could not go on they stood hand in hand for a minute or two in silence they could not bear to face other people  but we must go on rachel insisted at last in the curious dull tone of voice in which they had both been speaking and with a great effort they forced themselves to cover the short distance which lay between them and the pair sitting on the treetrunk  as they approached helen turned round and looked at them she looked at them for some time without speaking and when they were close to her she said quietly  did you meet mr flushing he has gone to find you he thought you must be lost though i told him you werent lost  hirst half turned round and threw his head back so that he looked at the branches crossing themselves in the air above him  well was it worth the effort he enquired dreamily  hewet sat down on the grass by his side and began to fan himself  rachel had balanced herself near helen on the end of the tree trunk  very hot she said  you look exhausted anyhow said hirst  its fearfully close in those trees helen remarked picking up her book and shaking it free from the dried blades of grass which had fallen between the leaves then they were all silent looking at the river swirling past in front of them between the trunks of the trees until mr flushing interrupted them he broke out of the trees a hundred yards to the left exclaiming sharply  ah so you found the way after all but its latemuch later than we arranged hewet  he was slightly annoyed and in his capacity as leader of the expedition inclined to be dictatorial he spoke quickly using curiously sharp meaningless words  being late wouldnt matter normally of course he said but when its a question of keeping the men up to time  he gathered them together and made them come down to the riverbank where the boat was waiting to row them out to the steamer  the heat of the day was going down and over their cups of tea the flushings tended to become communicative it seemed to terence as he listened to them talking that existence now went on in two different layers here were the flushings talking talking somewhere high up in the air above him and he and rachel had dropped to the bottom of the world together but with something of a childs directness mrs flushing had also the instinct which leads a child to suspect what its elders wish to keep hidden she fixed terence with her vivid blue eyes and addressed herself to him in particular what would he do she wanted to know if the boat ran upon a rock and sank  would you care for anythin but savin yourself should i no no she laughed not one scrapdont tell me theres only two creatures the ordinary woman cares about she continued her child and her dog and i dont believe its even two with men one reads a lot about lovethats why poetrys so dull but what happens in real life he it aint love she cried  terence murmured something unintelligible mr flushing however had recovered his urbanity he was smoking a cigarette and he now answered his wife  you must always remember alice he said that your upbringing was very unnaturalunusual i should say they had no mother he explained dropping something of the formality of his tone and a fatherhe was a very delightful man ive no doubt but he cared only for racehorses and greek statues tell them about the bath alice  in the stableyard said mrs flushing covered with ice in winter we had to get in if we didnt we were whipped the strong ones livedthe others died what you call survival of the fittesta most excellent plan i daresay if youve thirteen children  and all this going on in the heart of england in the nineteenth century mr flushing exclaimed turning to helen  id treat my children just the same if i had any said mrs flushing  every word sounded quite distinctly in terences ears but what were they saying and who were they talking to and who were they these fantastic people detached somewhere high up in the air now that they had drunk their tea they rose and leant over the bow of the boat the sun was going down and the water was dark and crimson the river had widened again and they were passing a little island set like a dark wedge in the middle of the stream two great white birds with red lights on them stood there on stiltlike legs and the beach of the island was unmarked save by the skeleton print of birds feet the branches of the trees on the bank looked more twisted and angular than ever and the green of the leaves was lurid and splashed with gold then hirst began to talk leaning over the bow  it makes one awfully queer dont you find he complained these trees get on ones nervesits all so crazy gods undoubtedly mad what sane person could have conceived a wilderness like this and peopled it with apes and alligators i should go mad if i lived hereraving mad  terence attempted to answer him but mrs ambrose replied instead she bade him look at the way things massed themselveslook at the amazing colours look at the shapes of the trees she seemed to be protecting terence from the approach of the others  yes said mr flushing and in my opinion he continued the absence of population to which hirst objects is precisely the significant touch you must admit hirst that a little italian town even would vulgarise the whole scene would detract from the vastnessthe sense of elemental grandeur he swept his hands towards the forest and paused for a moment looking at the great green mass which was now falling silent i own it makes us seem pretty smallus not them he nodded his head at a sailor who leant over the side spitting into the river and that i think is what my wife feels the essential superiority of the peasant under cover of mr flushings words which continued now gently reasoning with st john and persuading him terence drew rachel to the side pointing ostensibly to a great gnarled treetrunk which had fallen and lay half in the water he wished at any rate to be near her but he found that he could say nothing they could hear mr flushing flowing on now about his wife now about art now about the future of the country little meaningless words floating high in air as it was becoming cold he began to pace the deck with hirst fragments of their talk came out distinctly as they passedart emotion truth reality  is it true or is it a dream rachel murmured when they had passed  its true its true he replied  but the breeze freshened and there was a general desire for movement when the party rearranged themselves under cover of rugs and cloaks terence and rachel were at opposite ends of the circle and could not speak to each other but as the dark descended the words of the others seemed to curl up and vanish as the ashes of burnt paper and left them sitting perfectly silent at the bottom of the world occasional starts of exquisite joy ran through them and then they were peaceful again      chapter xxi   thanks to mr flushings discipline the right stages of the river were reached at the right hours and when next morning after breakfast the chairs were again drawn out in a semicircle in the bow the launch was within a few miles of the native camp which was the limit of the journey mr flushing as he sat down advised them to keep their eyes fixed on the left bank where they would soon pass a clearing and in that clearing was a hut where mackenzie the famous explorer had died of fever some ten years ago almost within reach of civilisationmackenzie he repeated the man who went farther inland than any ones been yet their eyes turned that way obediently the eyes of rachel saw nothing yellow and green shapes did it is true pass before them but she only knew that one was large and another small she did not know that they were trees these directions to look here and there irritated her as interruptions irritate a person absorbed in thought although she was not thinking of anything she was annoyed with all that was said and with the aimless movements of peoples bodies because they seemed to interfere with her and to prevent her from speaking to terence very soon helen saw her staring moodily at a coil of rope and making no effort to listen mr flushing and st john were engaged in more or less continuous conversation about the future of the country from a political point of view and the degree to which it had been explored the others with their legs stretched out or chins poised on the hands gazed in silence  mrs ambrose looked and listened obediently enough but inwardly she was prey to an uneasy mood not readily to be ascribed to any one cause looking on shore as mr flushing bade her she thought the country very beautiful but also sultry and alarming she did not like to feel herself the victim of unclassified emotions and certainly as the launch slipped on and on in the hot morning sun she felt herself unreasonably moved whether the unfamiliarity of the forest was the cause of it or something less definite she could not determine her mind left the scene and occupied itself with anxieties for ridley for her children for faroff things such as old age and poverty and death hirst too was depressed he had been looking forward to this expedition as to a holiday for once away from the hotel surely wonderful things would happen instead of which nothing happened and here they were as uncomfortable as restrained as selfconscious as ever that of course was what came of looking forward to anything one was always disappointed he blamed wilfrid flushing who was so well dressed and so formal he blamed hewet and rachel why didnt they talk he looked at them sitting silent and selfabsorbed and the sight annoyed him he supposed that they were engaged or about to become engaged but instead of being in the least romantic or exciting that was as dull as everything else it annoyed him too to think that they were in love he drew close to helen and began to tell her how uncomfortable his night had been lying on the deck sometimes too hot sometimes too cold and the stars so bright that he couldnt get to sleep he had lain awake all night thinking and when it was light enough to see he had written twenty lines of his poem on god and the awful thing was that hed practically proved the fact that god did not exist he did not see that he was teasing her and he went on to wonder what would happen if god did existan old gentleman in a beard and a long blue dressing gown extremely testy and disagreeable as hes bound to be can you suggest a rhyme god rod sodall used any others  although he spoke much as usual helen could have seen had she looked that he was also impatient and disturbed but she was not called upon to answer for mr flushing now exclaimed there they looked at the hut on the bank a desolate place with a large rent in the roof and the ground round it yellow scarred with fires and scattered with rusty open tins  did they find his dead body there mrs flushing exclaimed leaning forward in her eagerness to see the spot where the explorer had died  they found his body and his skins and a notebook her husband replied but the boat had soon carried them on and left the place behind  it was so hot that they scarcely moved except now to change a foot or again to strike a match their eyes concentrated upon the bank were full of the same green reflections and their lips were slightly pressed together as though the sights they were passing gave rise to thoughts save that hirsts lips moved intermittently as half consciously he sought rhymes for god whatever the thoughts of the others no one said anything for a considerable space they had grown so accustomed to the wall of trees on either side that they looked up with a start when the light suddenly widened out and the trees came to an end  it almost reminds one of an english park said mr flushing  indeed no change could have been greater on both banks of the river lay an open lawnlike space grass covered and planted for the gentleness and order of the place suggested human care with graceful trees on the top of little mounds as far as they could gaze this lawn rose and sank with the undulating motion of an old english park the change of scene naturally suggested a change of position grateful to most of them they rose and leant over the rail  it might be arundel or windsor mr flushing continued if you cut down that bush with the yellow flowers and by jove look  rows of brown backs paused for a moment and then leapt with a motion as if they were springing over waves out of sight for a moment no one of them could believe that they had really seen live animals in the opena herd of wild deer and the sight aroused a childlike excitement in them dissipating their gloom  ive never in my life seen anything bigger than a hare hirst exclaimed with genuine excitement what an ass i was not to bring my kodak  soon afterwards the launch came gradually to a standstill and the captain explained to mr flushing that it would be pleasant for the passengers if they now went for a stroll on shore if they chose to return within an hour he would take them on to the village if they chose to walkit was only a mile or two farther onhe would meet them at the landingplace  the matter being settled they were once more put on shore the sailors producing raisins and tobacco leant upon the rail and watched the six english whose coats and dresses looked so strange upon the green wander off a joke that was by no means proper set them all laughing and then they turned round and lay at their ease upon the deck  directly they landed terence and rachel drew together slightly in advance of the others  thank god terence exclaimed drawing a long breath at last were alone  and if we keep ahead we can talk said rachel  nevertheless although their position some yards in advance of the others made it possible for them to say anything they chose they were both silent  you love me terence asked at length breaking the silence painfully to speak or to be silent was equally an effort for when they were silent they were keenly conscious of each others presence and yet words were either too trivial or too large  she murmured inarticulately ending and you  yes yes he replied but there were so many things to be said and now that they were alone it seemed necessary to bring themselves still more near and to surmount a barrier which had grown up since they had last spoken it was difficult frightening even oddly embarrassing at one moment he was clearsighted and at the next confused  now im going to begin at the beginning he said resolutely im going to tell you what i ought to have told you before in the first place ive never been in love with other women but ive had other women then ive great faults im very lazy im moody he persisted in spite of her exclamation youve got to know the worst of me im lustful im overcome by a sense of futilityincompetence i ought never to have asked you to marry me i expect im a bit of a snob im ambitious  oh our faults she cried what do they matter then she demanded am i in loveis this being in loveare we to marry each other  overcome by the charm of her voice and her presence he exclaimed oh youre free rachel to you time will make no difference or marriage or  the voices of the others behind them kept floating now farther now nearer and mrs flushings laugh rose clearly by itself  marriage rachel repeated  the shouts were renewed behind warning them that they were bearing too far to the left improving their course he continued yes marriage the feeling that they could not be united until she knew all about him made him again endeavour to explain  all thats been bad in me the things ive put up withthe second best  she murmured considered her own life but could not describe how it looked to her now  and the loneliness he continued a vision of walking with her through the streets of london came before his eyes we will go for walks together he said the simplicity of the idea relieved them and for the first time they laughed they would have liked had they dared to take each other by the hand but the consciousness of eyes fixed on them from behind had not yet deserted them  books people sightsmrs nutt greeley hutchinson hewet murmured  with every word the mist which had enveloped them making them seem unreal to each other since the previous afternoon melted a little further and their contact became more and more natural up through the sultry southern landscape they saw the world they knew appear clearer and more vividly than it had ever appeared before as upon that occasion at the hotel when she had sat in the window the world once more arranged itself beneath her gaze very vividly and in its true proportions she glanced curiously at terence from time to time observing his grey coat and his purple tie observing the man with whom she was to spend the rest of her life  after one of these glances she murmured yes im in love theres no doubt im in love with you  nevertheless they remained uncomfortably apart drawn so close together as she spoke that there seemed no division between them and the next moment separate and far away again feeling this painfully she exclaimed it will be a fight  but as she looked at him she perceived from the shape of his eyes the lines about his mouth and other peculiarities that he pleased her and she added  where i want to fight you have compassion youre finer than i am youre much finer  he returned her glance and smiled perceiving much as she had done the very small individual things about her which made her delightful to him she was his for ever this barrier being surmounted innumerable delights lay before them both  im not finer he answered im only older lazier a man not a woman  a man she repeated and a curious sense of possession coming over her it struck her that she might now touch him she put out her hand and lightly touched his cheek his fingers followed where hers had been and the touch of his hand upon his face brought back the overpowering sense of unreality this body of his was unreal the whole world was unreal  whats happened he began why did i ask you to marry me how did it happen  did you ask me to marry you she wondered they faded far away from each other and neither of them could remember what had been said  we sat upon the ground he recollected  we sat upon the ground she confirmed him the recollection of sitting upon the ground such as it was seemed to unite them again and they walked on in silence their minds sometimes working with difficulty and sometimes ceasing to work their eyes alone perceiving the things round them now he would attempt again to tell her his faults and why he loved her and she would describe what she had felt at this time or at that time and together they would interpret her feeling so beautiful was the sound of their voices that by degrees they scarcely listened to the words they framed long silences came between their words which were no longer silences of struggle and confusion but refreshing silences in which trivial thoughts moved easily they began to speak naturally of ordinary things of the flowers and the trees how they grew there so red like garden flowers at home and there bent and crooked like the arm of a twisted old man  very gently and quietly almost as if it were the blood singing in her veins or the water of the stream running over stones rachel became conscious of a new feeling within her she wondered for a moment what it was and then said to herself with a little surprise at recognising in her own person so famous a thing  this is happiness i suppose and aloud to terence she spoke this is happiness  on the heels of her words he answered this is happiness upon which they guessed that the feeling had sprung in both of them the same time they began therefore to describe how this felt and that felt how like it was and yet how different for they were very different  voices crying behind them never reached through the waters in which they were now sunk the repetition of hewets name in short dissevered syllables was to them the crack of a dry branch or the laughter of a bird the grasses and breezes sounding and murmuring all round them they never noticed that the swishing of the grasses grew louder and louder and did not cease with the lapse of the breeze a hand dropped abrupt as iron on rachels shoulder it might have been a bolt from heaven she fell beneath it and the grass whipped across her eyes and filled her mouth and ears through the waving stems she saw a figure large and shapeless against the sky helen was upon her rolled this way and that now seeing only forests of green and now the high blue heaven she was speechless and almost without sense at last she lay still all the grasses shaken round her and before her by her panting over her loomed two great heads the heads of a man and woman of terence and helen  both were flushed both laughing and the lips were moving they came together and kissed in the air above her broken fragments of speech came down to her on the ground she thought she heard them speak of love and then of marriage raising herself and sitting up she too realised helens soft body the strong and hospitable arms and happiness swelling and breaking in one vast wave when this fell away and the grasses once more lay low and the sky became horizontal and the earth rolled out flat on each side and the trees stood upright she was the first to perceive a little row of human figures standing patiently in the distance for the moment she could not remember who they were  who are they she asked and then recollected  falling into line behind mr flushing they were careful to leave at least three yards distance between the toe of his boot and the rim of her skirt  he led them across a stretch of green by the riverbank and then through a grove of trees and bade them remark the signs of human habitation the blackened grass the charred treestumps and there through the trees strange wooden nests drawn together in an arch where the trees drew apart the village which was the goal of their journey  stepping cautiously they observed the women who were squatting on the ground in triangular shapes moving their hands either plaiting straw or in kneading something in bowls but when they had looked for a moment undiscovered they were seen and mr flushing advancing into the centre of the clearing was engaged in talk with a lean majestic man whose bones and hollows at once made the shapes of the englishmans body appear ugly and unnatural the women took no notice of the strangers except that their hands paused for a moment and their long narrow eyes slid round and fixed upon them with the motionless inexpensive gaze of those removed from each other far far beyond the plunge of speech their hands moved again but the stare continued it followed them as they walked as they peered into the huts where they could distinguish guns leaning in the corner and bowls upon the floor and stacks of rushes in the dusk the solemn eyes of babies regarded them and old women stared out too as they sauntered about the stare followed them passing over their legs their bodies their heads curiously not without hostility like the crawl of a winter fly as she drew apart her shawl and uncovered her breast to the lips of her baby the eyes of a woman never left their faces although they moved uneasily under her stare and finally turned away rather than stand there looking at her any longer when sweetmeats were offered them they put out great red hands to take them and felt themselves treading cumbrously like tightcoated soldiers among these soft instinctive people but soon the life of the village took no notice of them they had become absorbed in it the womens hands became busy again with the straw their eyes dropped if they moved it was to fetch something from the hut or to catch a straying child or to cross the space with a jar balanced on their heads if they spoke it was to cry some harsh unintelligible cry voices rose when a child was beaten and fell again voices rose in song which slid up a little way and down a little way and settled again upon the same low and melancholy note seeking each other terence and rachel drew together under a tree peaceful and even beautiful at first the sight of the women who had given up looking at them made them now feel very cold and melancholy  well terence sighed at length it makes us seem insignificant doesnt it  rachel agreed so it would go on for ever and ever she said those women sitting under the trees the trees and the river they turned away and began to walk through the trees leaning without fear of discovery upon each others arms they had not gone far before they began to assure each other once more that they were in love were happy were content but why was it so painful being in love why was there so much pain in happiness  the sight of the village indeed affected them all curiously though all differently st john had left the others and was walking slowly down to the river absorbed in his own thoughts which were bitter and unhappy for he felt himself alone and helen standing by herself in the sunny space among the native women was exposed to presentiments of disaster the cries of the senseless beasts rang in her ears high and low in the air as they ran from treetrunk to treetop how small the little figures looked wandering through the trees she became acutely conscious of the little limbs the thin veins the delicate flesh of men and women which breaks so easily and lets the life escape compared with these great trees and deep waters a falling branch a foot that slips and the earth has crushed them or the water drowned them thus thinking she kept her eyes anxiously fixed upon the lovers as if by doing so she could protect them from their fate turning she found the flushings by her side  they were talking about the things they had bought and arguing whether they were really old and whether there were not signs here and there of european influence helen was appealed to she was made to look at a brooch and then at a pair of earrings but all the time she blamed them for having come on this expedition for having ventured too far and exposed themselves then she roused herself and tried to talk but in a few moments she caught herself seeing a picture of a boat upset on the river in england at midday it was morbid she knew to imagine such things nevertheless she sought out the figures of the others between the trees and whenever she saw them she kept her eyes fixed on them so that she might be able to protect them from disaster  but when the sun went down and the steamer turned and began to steam back towards civilisation again her fears were calmed in the semidarkness the chairs on deck and the people sitting in them were angular shapes the mouth being indicated by a tiny burning spot and the arm by the same spot moving up or down as the cigar or cigarette was lifted to and from the lips words crossed the darkness but not knowing where they fell seemed to lack energy and substance deep sights proceeded regularly although with some attempt at suppression from the large white mound which represented the person of mrs flushing the day had been long and very hot and now that all the colours were blotted out the cool night air seemed to press soft fingers upon the eyelids sealing them down some philosophical remark directed apparently at st john hirst missed its aim and hung so long suspended in the air until it was engulfed by a yawn that it was considered dead and this gave the signal for stirring of legs and murmurs about sleep the white mound moved finally lengthened itself and disappeared and after a few turns and paces st john and mr flushing withdrew leaving the three chairs still occupied by three silent bodies the light which came from a lamp high on the mast and a sky pale with stars left them with shapes but without features but even in this darkness the withdrawal of the others made them feel each other very near for they were all thinking of the same thing for some time no one spoke then helen said with a sigh so youre both very happy  as if washed by the air her voice sounded more spiritual and softer than usual voices at a little distance answered her yes  through the darkness she was looking at them both and trying to distinguish him what was there for her to say rachel had passed beyond her guardianship a voice might reach her ears but never again would it carry as far as it had carried twentyfour hours ago nevertheless speech seemed to be due from her before she went to bed she wished to speak but she felt strangely old and depressed  dyou realise what youre doing she demanded shes young youre both young and marriage here she ceased they begged her however to continue with such earnestness in their voices as if they only craved advice that she was led to add  marriage well its not easy  thats what we want to know they answered and she guessed that now they were looking at each other  it depends on both of you she stated her face was turned towards terence and although he could hardly see her he believed that her words really covered a genuine desire to know more about him he raised himself from his semirecumbent position and proceeded to tell her what she wanted to know he spoke as lightly as he could in order to take away her depression  im twentyseven and ive about seven hundred a year he began my temper is good on the whole and health excellent though hirst detects a gouty tendency well then i think im very intelligent he paused as if for confirmation  helen agreed  though unfortunately rather lazy i intend to allow rachel to be a fool if she wants to anddo you find me on the whole satisfactory in other respects he asked shyly  yes i like what i know of you helen replied  but thenone knows so little  we shall live in london he continued and with one voice they suddenly enquired whether she did not think them the happiest people that she had ever known  hush she checked them mrs flushing remember shes behind us  then they fell silent and terence and rachel felt instinctively that their happiness had made her sad and while they were anxious to go on talking about themselves they did not like to  weve talked too much about ourselves terence said tell us  yes tell us rachel echoed they were both in the mood to believe that every one was capable of saying something very profound  what can i tell you helen reflected speaking more to herself in a rambling style than as a prophetess delivering a message she forced herself to speak  after all though i scold rachel im not much wiser myself im older of course im halfway through and youre just beginning its puzzlingsometimes i think disappointing the great things arent as great perhaps as one expectsbut its interestingoh yes youre certain to find it interestingand so it goes on they became conscious here of the procession of dark trees into which as far as they could see helen was now looking and there are pleasures where one doesnt expect them you must write to your father and youll be very happy ive no doubt but i must go to bed and if you are sensible you will follow in ten minutes and so she rose and stood before them almost featureless and very large goodnight she passed behind the curtain  after sitting in silence for the greater part of the ten minutes she allowed them they rose and hung over the rail beneath them the smooth black water slipped away very fast and silently the spark of a cigarette vanished behind them a beautiful voice terence murmured  rachel assented helen had a beautiful voice  after a silence she asked looking up into the sky are we on the deck of a steamer on a river in south america am i rachel are you terence  the great black world lay round them as they were drawn smoothly along it seemed possessed of immense thickness and endurance they could discern pointed treetops and blunt rounded treetops raising their eyes above the trees they fixed them on the stars and the pale border of sky above the trees the little points of frosty light infinitely far away drew their eyes and held them fixed so that it seemed as if they stayed a long time and fell a great distance when once more they realised their hands grasping the rail and their separate bodies standing side by side  youd forgotten completely about me terence reproached her taking her arm and beginning to pace the deck and i never forget you  oh no she whispered she had not forgotten only the starsthe nightthe dark  youre like a bird half asleep in its nest rachel youre asleep youre talking in your sleep  half asleep and murmuring broken words they stood in the angle made by the bow of the boat it slipped on down the river now a bell struck on the bridge and they heard the lapping of water as it rippled away on either side and once a bird startled in its sleep creaked flew on to the next tree and was silent again the darkness poured down profusely and left them with scarcely any feeling of life except that they were standing there together in the darkness      chapter xxii   the darkness fell but rose again and as each day spread widely over the earth and parted them from the strange day in the forest when they had been forced to tell each other what they wanted this wish of theirs was revealed to other people and in the process became slightly strange to themselves apparently it was not anything unusual that had happened it was that they had become engaged to marry each other the world which consisted for the most part of the hotel and the villa expressed itself glad on the whole that two people should marry and allowed them to see that they were not expected to take part in the work which has to be done in order that the world shall go on but might absent themselves for a time they were accordingly left alone until they felt the silence as if playing in a vast church the door had been shut on them they were driven to walk alone and sit alone to visit secret places where the flowers had never been picked and the trees were solitary in solitude they could express those beautiful but too vast desires which were so oddly uncomfortable to the ears of other men and womendesires for a world such as their own world which contained two people seemed to them to be where people knew each other intimately and thus judged each other by what was good and never quarrelled because that was waste of time  they would talk of such questions among books or out in the sun or sitting in the shade of a tree undisturbed they were no longer embarrassed or halfchoked with meaning which could not express itself they were not afraid of each other or like travellers down a twisting river dazzled with sudden beauties when the corner is turned the unexpected happened but even the ordinary was lovable and in many ways preferable to the ecstatic and mysterious for it was refreshingly solid and called out effort and effort under such circumstances was not effort but delight  while rachel played the piano terence sat near her engaged as far as the occasional writing of a word in pencil testified in shaping the world as it appeared to him now that he and rachel were going to be married it was different certainly the book called silence would not now be the same book that it would have been he would then put down his pencil and stare in front of him and wonder in what respects the world was differentit had perhaps more solidity more coherence more importance greater depth why even the earth sometimes seemed to him very deep not carved into hills and cities and fields but heaped in great masses he would look out of the window for ten minutes at a time but no he did not care for the earth swept of human beings he liked human beingshe liked them he suspected better than rachel did there she was swaying enthusiastically over her music quite forgetful of himbut he liked that quality in her he liked the impersonality which it produced in her at last having written down a series of little sentences with notes of interrogation attached to them he observed aloud womenunder the heading women ive written  not really vainer than men lack of selfconfidence at the base of most serious faults dislike of own sex traditional or founded on fact every woman not so much a rake at heart as an optimist because they dont think what do you say rachel he paused with his pencil in his hand and a sheet of paper on his knee  rachel said nothing up and up the steep spiral of a very late beethoven sonata she climbed like a person ascending a ruined staircase energetically at first then more laboriously advancing her feet with effort until she could go no higher and returned with a run to begin at the very bottom again  again its the fashion now to say that women are more practical and less idealistic than men also that they have considerable organising ability but no sense of honourquery what is meant by masculine term honourwhat corresponds to it in your sex eh  attacking her staircase once more rachel again neglected this opportunity of revealing the secrets of her sex she had indeed advanced so far in the pursuit of wisdom that she allowed these secrets to rest undisturbed it seemed to be reserved for a later generation to discuss them philosophically  crashing down a final chord with her left hand she exclaimed at last swinging round upon him  no terence its no good here am i the best musician in south america not to speak of europe and asia and i cant play a note because of you in the room interrupting me every other second  you dont seem to realise that thats what ive been aiming at for the last halfhour he remarked ive no objection to nice simple tunesindeed i find them very helpful to my literary composition but that kind of thing is merely like an unfortunate old dog going round on its hind legs in the rain  he began turning over the little sheets of notepaper which were scattered on the table conveying the congratulations of their friends  all possible wishes for all possible happiness he read correct but not very vivid are they  theyre sheer nonsense rachel exclaimed think of words compared with sounds she continued think of novels and plays and histories perched on the edge of the table she stirred the red and yellow volumes contemptuously she seemed to herself to be in a position where she could despise all human learning terence looked at them too  god rachel you do read trash he exclaimed and youre behind the times too my dear no one dreams of reading this kind of thing nowantiquated problem plays harrowing descriptions of life in the east endoh no weve exploded all that read poetry rachel poetry poetry poetry  picking up one of the books he began to read aloud his intention being to satirise the short sharp bark of the writers english but she paid no attention and after an interval of meditation exclaimed  does it ever seem to you terence that the world is composed entirely of vast blocks of matter and that were nothing but patches of light she looked at the soft spots of sun wavering over the carpet and up the walllike that  no said terence i feel solid immensely solid the legs of my chair might be rooted in the bowels of the earth but at cambridge i can remember there were times when one fell into ridiculous states of semicoma about five oclock in the morning hirst does now i expectoh no hirst wouldnt  rachel continued the day your note came asking us to go on the picnic i was sitting where youre sitting now thinking that i wonder if i could think that again i wonder if the worlds changed and if so when itll stop changing and which is the real world  when i first saw you he began i thought you were like a creature whod lived all its life among pearls and old bones your hands were wet dyou remember and you never said a word until i gave you a bit of bread and then you said human beings  and i thought youa prig she recollected no thats not quite it there were the ants who stole the tongue and i thought you and st john were like those antsvery big very ugly very energetic with all your virtues on your backs however when i talked to you i liked you  you fell in love with me he corrected her you were in love with me all the time only you didnt know it  no i never fell in love with you she asserted  rachelwhat a liedidnt you sit here looking at my windowdidnt you wander about the hotel like an owl in the sun  no she repeated i never fell in love if falling in love is what people say it is and its the world that tells the lies and i tell the truth oh what lieswhat lies  she crumpled together a handful of letters from evelyn m from mr pepper from mrs thornbury and miss allan and susan warrington it was strange considering how very different these people were that they used almost the same sentences when they wrote to congratulate her upon her engagement  that any one of these people had ever felt what she felt or could ever feel it or had even the right to pretend for a single second that they were capable of feeling it appalled her much as the church service had done much as the face of the hospital nurse had done and if they didnt feel a thing why did they go and pretend to the simplicity and arrogance and hardness of her youth now concentrated into a single spark as it was by her love of him puzzled terence being engaged had not that effect on him the world was different but not in that way he still wanted the things he had always wanted and in particular he wanted the companionship of other people more than ever perhaps he took the letters out of her hand and protested  of course theyre absurd rachel of course they say things just because other people say them but even so what a nice woman miss allan is you cant deny that and mrs thornbury too shes got too many children i grant you but if halfadozen of them had gone to the bad instead of rising infallibly to the tops of their treeshasnt she a kind of beautyof elemental simplicity as flushing would say isnt she rather like a large old tree murmuring in the moonlight or a river going on and on and on by the way ralphs been made governor of the carroway islandsthe youngest governor in the service very good isnt it  but rachel was at present unable to conceive that the vast majority of the affairs of the world went on unconnected by a single thread with her own destiny  i wont have eleven children she asserted i wont have the eyes of an old woman she looks at one up and down up and down as if one were a horse  we must have a son and we must have a daughter said terence putting down the letters because let alone the inestimable advantage of being our children theyd be so well brought up they went on to sketch an outline of the ideal educationhow their daughter should be required from infancy to gaze at a large square of cardboard painted blue to suggest thoughts of infinity for women were grown too practical and their sonhe should be taught to laugh at great men that is at distinguished successful men at men who wore ribands and rose to the tops of their trees he should in no way resemble rachel added st john hirst  at this terence professed the greatest admiration for st john hirst dwelling upon his good qualities he became seriously convinced of them he had a mind like a torpedo he declared aimed at falsehood where should we all be without him and his like choked in weeds christians bigotswhy rachel herself would be a slave with a fan to sing songs to men when they felt drowsy  but youll never see it he exclaimed because with all your virtues you dont and you never will care with every fibre of your being for the pursuit of truth youve no respect for facts rachel youre essentially feminine she did not trouble to deny it nor did she think good to produce the one unanswerable argument against the merits which terence admired st john hirst said that she was in love with him she would never forgive that but the argument was not one to appeal to a man  but i like him she said and she thought to herself that she also pitied him as one pities those unfortunate people who are outside the warm mysterious globe full of changes and miracles in which we ourselves move about she thought that it must be very dull to be st john hirst  she summed up what she felt about him by saying that she would not kiss him supposing he wished it which was not likely  as if some apology were due to hirst for the kiss which she then bestowed upon him terence protested  and compared with hirst im a perfect zany  the clock here struck twelve instead of eleven  were wasting the morningi ought to be writing my book and you ought to be answering these  weve only got twentyone whole mornings left said rachel and my fatherll be here in a day or two  however she drew a pen and paper towards her and began to write laboriously  my dear evelyn  terence meanwhile read a novel which some one else had written a process which he found essential to the composition of his own for a considerable time nothing was to be heard but the ticking of the clock and the fitful scratch of rachels pen as she produced phrases which bore a considerable likeness to those which she had condemned she was struck by it herself for she stopped writing and looked up looked at terence deep in the armchair looked at the different pieces of furniture at her bed in the corner at the windowpane which showed the branches of a tree filled in with sky heard the clock ticking and was amazed at the gulf which lay between all that and her sheet of paper would there ever be a time when the world was one and indivisible even with terence himselfhow far apart they could be how little she knew what was passing in his brain now she then finished her sentence which was awkward and ugly and stated that they were both very happy and going to be married in the autumn probably and hope to live in london where we hope you will come and see us when we get back choosing affectionately after some further speculation rather than sincerely she signed the letter and was doggedly beginning on another when terence remarked quoting from his book  listen to this rachel it is probable that hugh hes the hero a literary man had not realised at the time of his marriage any more than the young man of parts and imagination usually does realise the nature of the gulf which separates the needs and desires of the male from the needs and desires of the female    at first they had been very happy the walking tour in switzerland had been a time of jolly companionship and stimulating revelations for both of them betty had proved herself the ideal comrade    they had shouted love in the valley to each other across the snowy slopes of the riffelhorn and so on and so onill skip the descriptions    but in london after the boys birth all was changed betty was an admirable mother but it did not take her long to find out that motherhood as that function is understood by the mother of the upper middle classes did not absorb the whole of her energies she was young and strong with healthy limbs and a body and brain that called urgently for exercise    in short she began to give teaparties    coming in late from this singular talk with old bob murphy in his smoky booklined room where the two men had each unloosened his soul to the other with the sound of the traffic humming in his ears and the foggy london sky slung tragically across his mind    he found womens hats dotted about among his papers womens wraps and absurd little feminine shoes and umbrellas were in the hall    then the bills began to come in    he tried to speak frankly to her he found her lying on the great polarbear skin in their bedroom halfundressed for they were dining with the greens in wilton crescent the ruddy firelight making the diamonds wink and twinkle on her bare arms and in the delicious curve of her breasta vision of adorable femininity he forgave her all well this goes from bad to worse and finally about fifty pages later hugh takes a weekend ticket to swanage and has it out with himself on the downs above corfe    here theres fifteen pages or so which well skip the conclusion is    they were different perhaps in the far future when generations of men had struggled and failed as he must now struggle and fail woman would be indeed what she now made a pretence of beingthe friend and companionnot the enemy and parasite of man  the end of it is you see hugh went back to his wife poor fellow it was his duty as a married man lord rachel he concluded will it be like that when were married  instead of answering him she asked  why dont people write about the things they do feel  ah thats the difficulty he sighed tossing the book away  well then what will it be like when were married what are the things people do feel  she seemed doubtful  sit on the floor and let me look at you he commanded resting her chin on his knee she looked straight at him  he examined her curiously  youre not beautiful he began but i like your face i like the way your hair grows down in a point and your eyes toothey never see anything your mouths too big and your cheeks would be better if they had more colour in them but what i like about your face is that it makes one wonder what the devil youre thinking aboutit makes me want to do that he clenched his fist and shook it so near her that she started back because now you look as if youd blow my brains out there are moments he continued when if we stood on a rock together youd throw me into the sea  hypnotised by the force of his eyes in hers she repeated if we stood on a rock together  to be flung into the sea to be washed hither and thither and driven about the roots of the worldthe idea was incoherently delightful she sprang up and began moving about the room bending and thrusting aside the chairs and tables as if she were indeed striking through the waters he watched her with pleasure she seemed to be cleaving a passage for herself and dealing triumphantly with the obstacles which would hinder their passage through life  it does seem possible he exclaimed though ive always thought it the most unlikely thing in the worldi shall be in love with you all my life and our marriage will be the most exciting thing thats ever been done well never have a moments peace he caught her in his arms as she passed him and they fought for mastery imagining a rock and the sea heaving beneath them at last she was thrown to the floor where she lay gasping and crying for mercy  im a mermaid i can swim she cried so the games up her dress was torn across and peace being established she fetched a needle and thread and began to mend the tear  and now she said be quiet and tell me about the world tell me about everything thats ever happened and ill tell youlet me see what can i tell youill tell you about miss montgomerie and the river party she was left you see with one foot in the boat and the other on shore  they had spent much time already in thus filling out for the other the course of their past lives and the characters of their friends and relations so that very soon terence knew not only what rachels aunts might be expected to say upon every occasion but also how their bedrooms were furnished and what kind of bonnets they wore he could sustain a conversation between mrs hunt and rachel and carry on a teaparty including the rev william johnson and miss macquoid the christian scientists with remarkable likeness to the truth but he had known many more people and was far more highly skilled in the art of narrative than rachel was whose experiences were for the most part of a curiously childlike and humorous kind so that it generally fell to her lot to listen and ask questions  he told her not only what had happened but what he had thought and felt and sketched for her portraits which fascinated her of what other men and women might be supposed to be thinking and feeling so that she became very anxious to go back to england which was full of people where she could merely stand in the streets and look at them according to him too there was an order a pattern which made life reasonable or if that word was foolish made it of deep interest anyhow for sometimes it seemed possible to understand why things happened as they did nor were people so solitary and uncommunicative as she believed she should look for vanityfor vanity was a common qualityfirst in herself and then in helen in ridley in st john they all had their share of itand she would find it in ten people out of every twelve she met and once linked together by one such tie she would find them not separate and formidable but practically indistinguishable and she would come to love them when she found that they were like herself  if she denied this she must defend her belief that human beings were as various as the beasts at the zoo which had stripes and manes and horns and humps and so wrestling over the entire list of their acquaintances and diverging into anecdote and theory and speculation they came to know each other the hours passed quickly and seemed to them full to leakingpoint after a nights solitude they were always ready to begin again  the virtues which mrs ambrose had once believed to exist in free talk between men and women did in truth exist for both of them although not quite in the measure she prescribed far more than upon the nature of sex they dwelt upon the nature of poetry but it was true that talk which had no boundaries deepened and enlarged the strangely small bright view of a girl in return for what he could tell her she brought him such curiosity and sensitiveness of perception that he was led to doubt whether any gift bestowed by much reading and living was quite the equal of that for pleasure and pain what would experience give her after all except a kind of ridiculous formal balance like that of a drilled dog in the street he looked at her face and wondered how it would look in twenty years time when the eyes had dulled and the forehead wore those little persistent wrinkles which seem to show that the middleaged are facing something hard which the young do not see what would the hard thing be for them he wondered then his thoughts turned to their life in england  the thought of england was delightful for together they would see the old things freshly it would be england in june and there would be june nights in the country and the nightingales singing in the lanes into which they could steal when the room grew hot and there would be english meadows gleaming with water and set with stolid cows and clouds dipping low and trailing across the green hills as he sat in the room with her he wished very often to be back again in the thick of life doing things with rachel  he crossed to the window and exclaimed lord how good it is to think of lanes muddy lanes with brambles and nettles you know and real grass fields and farmyards with pigs and cows and men walking beside carts with pitchforkstheres nothing to compare with that herelook at the stony red earth and the bright blue sea and the glaring white houseshow tired one gets of it and the air without a stain or a wrinkle id give anything for a sea mist  rachel too had been thinking of the english country the flat land rolling away to the sea and the woods and the long straight roads where one can walk for miles without seeing any one and the great church towers and the curious houses clustered in the valleys and the birds and the dusk and the rain falling against the windows  but london londons the place terence continued they looked together at the carpet as though london itself were to be seen there lying on the floor with all its spires and pinnacles pricking through the smoke  on the whole what i should like best at this moment terence pondered would be to find myself walking down kingsway by those big placards you know and turning into the strand perhaps i might go and look over waterloo bridge for a moment then id go along the strand past the shops with all the new books in them and through the little archway into the temple i always like the quiet after the uproar you hear your own footsteps suddenly quite loud the temples very pleasant i think i should go and see if i could find dear old hodgkinthe man who writes books about van eyck you know when i left england he was very sad about his tame magpie he suspected that a man had poisoned it and then russell lives on the next staircase i think youd like him hes a passion for handel well rachel he concluded dismissing the vision of london we shall be doing that together in six weeks time and itll be the middle of june thenand june in londonmy god how pleasant it all is  and were certain to have it too she said it isnt as if we were expecting a great dealonly to walk about and look at things  only a thousand a year and perfect freedom he replied how many people in london dyou think have that  and now youve spoilt it she complained now weve got to think of the horrors she looked grudgingly at the novel which had once caused her perhaps an hours discomfort so that she had never opened it again but kept it on her table and looked at it occasionally as some medieval monk kept a skull or a crucifix to remind him of the frailty of the body  is it true terence she demanded that women die with bugs crawling across their faces  i think its very probable he said but you must admit rachel that we so seldom think of anything but ourselves that an occasional twinge is really rather pleasant  accusing him of an affection of cynicism which was just as bad as sentimentality itself she left her position by his side and knelt upon the window sill twisting the curtain tassels between her fingers a vague sense of dissatisfaction filled her  whats so detestable in this country she exclaimed is the bluealways blue sky and blue sea its like a curtainall the things one wants are on the other side of that i want to know whats going on behind it i hate these divisions dont you terence one person all in the dark about another person now i liked the dalloways she continued and theyre gone i shall never see them again just by going on a ship we cut ourselves off entirely from the rest of the world i want to see england therelondon thereall sorts of peoplewhy shouldnt one why should one be shut up all by oneself in a room  while she spoke thus half to herself and with increasing vagueness because her eye was caught by a ship that had just come into the bay she did not see that terence had ceased to stare contentedly in front of him and was looking at her keenly and with dissatisfaction she seemed to be able to cut herself adrift from him and to pass away to unknown places where she had no need of him the thought roused his jealousy  i sometimes think youre not in love with me and never will be he said energetically she started and turned round at his words  i dont satisfy you in the way you satisfy me he continued theres something i cant get hold of in you you dont want me as i want youyoure always wanting something else  he began pacing up and down the room  perhaps i ask too much he went on perhaps it isnt really possible to have what i want men and women are too different you cant understandyou dont understand  he came up to where she stood looking at him in silence  it seemed to her now that what he was saying was perfectly true and that she wanted many more things than the love of one human beingthe sea the sky she turned again the looked at the distant blue which was so smooth and serene where the sky met the sea she could not possibly want only one human being  or is it only this damnable engagement he continued lets be married here before we go backor is it too great a risk are we sure we want to marry each other  they began pacing up and down the room but although they came very near each other in their pacing they took care not to touch each other the hopelessness of their position overcame them both they were impotent they could never love each other sufficiently to overcome all these barriers and they could never be satisfied with less realising this with intolerable keenness she stopped in front of him and exclaimed  lets break it off then  the words did more to unite them than any amount of argument as if they stood on the edge of a precipice they clung together they knew that they could not separate painful and terrible it might be but they were joined for ever they lapsed into silence and after a time crept together in silence merely to be so close soothed them and sitting side by side the divisions disappeared and it seemed as if the world were once more solid and entire and as if in some strange way they had grown larger and stronger  it was long before they moved and when they moved it was with great reluctance they stood together in front of the lookingglass and with a brush tried to make themselves look as if they had been feeling nothing all the morning neither pain nor happiness but it chilled them to see themselves in the glass for instead of being vast and indivisible they were really very small and separate the size of the glass leaving a large space for the reflection of other things      chapter xxiii   but no brush was able to efface completely the expression of happiness so that mrs ambrose could not treat them when they came downstairs as if they had spent the morning in a way that could be discussed naturally this being so she joined in the worlds conspiracy to consider them for the time incapacitated from the business of life struck by their intensity of feeling into enmity against life and almost succeeded in dismissing them from her thoughts  she reflected that she had done all that it was necessary to do in practical matters she had written a great many letters and had obtained willoughbys consent she had dwelt so often upon mr hewets prospects his profession his birth appearance and temperament that she had almost forgotten what he was really like when she refreshed herself by a look at him she used to wonder again what he was like and then concluding that they were happy at any rate thought no more about it  she might more profitably consider what would happen in three years time or what might have happened if rachel had been left to explore the world under her fathers guidance the result she was honest enough to own might have been betterwho knows she did not disguise from herself that terence had faults she was inclined to think him too easy and tolerant just as he was inclined to think her perhaps a trifle hardno it was rather that she was uncompromising in some ways she found st john preferable but then of course he would never have suited rachel her friendship with st john was established for although she fluctuated between irritation and interest in a way that did credit to the candour of her disposition she liked his company on the whole he took her outside this little world of love and emotion he had a grasp of facts supposing for instance that england made a sudden move towards some unknown port on the coast of morocco st john knew what was at the back of it and to hear him engaged with her husband in argument about finance and the balance of power gave her an odd sense of stability she respected their arguments without always listening to them much as she respected a solid brick wall or one of those immense municipal buildings which although they compose the greater part of our cities have been built day after day and year after year by unknown hands she liked to sit and listen and even felt a little elated when the engaged couple after showing their profound lack of interest slipped from the room and were seen pulling flowers to pieces in the garden it was not that she was jealous of them but she did undoubtedly envy them their great unknown future that lay before them slipping from one such thought to another she was at the diningroom with fruit in her hands sometimes she stopped to straighten a candle stooping with the heat or disturbed some too rigid arrangement of the chairs she had reason to suspect that chailey had been balancing herself on the top of a ladder with a wet duster during their absence and the room had never been quite like itself since returning from the diningroom for the third time she perceived that one of the armchairs was now occupied by st john he lay back in it with his eyes half shut looking as he always did curiously buttoned up in a neat grey suit and fenced against the exuberance of a foreign climate which might at any moment proceed to take liberties with him her eyes rested on him gently and then passed on over his head finally she took the chair opposite  i didnt want to come here he said at last but i was positively driven to it    evelyn m he groaned  he sat up and began to explain with mock solemnity how the detestable woman was set upon marrying him  she pursues me about the place this morning she appeared in the smokingroom all i could do was to seize my hat and fly i didnt want to come but i couldnt stay and face another meal with her  well we must make the best of it helen replied philosophically it was very hot and they were indifferent to any amount of silence so that they lay back in their chairs waiting for something to happen the bell rang for luncheon but there was no sound of movement in the house was there any news helen asked anything in the papers st john shook his head o yes he had a letter from home a letter from his mother describing the suicide of the parlourmaid she was called susan jane and she came into the kitchen one afternoon and said that she wanted cook to keep her money for her she had twenty pounds in gold then she went out to buy herself a hat she came in at halfpast five and said that she had taken poison they had only just time to get her into bed and call a doctor before she died  well helen enquired  therell have to be an inquest said st john  why had she done it he shrugged his shoulders why do people kill themselves why do the lower orders do any of the things they do do nobody knows they sat in silence  the bells run fifteen minutes and theyre not down said helen at length  when they appeared st john explained why it had been necessary for him to come to luncheon he imitated evelyns enthusiastic tone as she confronted him in the smokingroom she thinks there can be nothing quite so thrilling as mathematics so ive lent her a large work in two volumes itll be interesting to see what she makes of it  rachel could now afford to laugh at him she reminded him of gibbon she had the first volume somewhere still if he were undertaking the education of evelyn that surely was the test or she had heard that burke upon the american rebellionevelyn ought to read them both simultaneously when st john had disposed of her argument and had satisfied his hunger he proceeded to tell them that the hotel was seething with scandals some of the most appalling kind which had happened in their absence he was indeed much given to the study of his kind  evelyn m for examplebut that was told me in confidence  nonsense terence interposed  youve heard about poor sinclair too  oh yes ive heard about sinclair hes retired to his mine with a revolver he writes to evelyn daily that hes thinking of committing suicide ive assured her that hes never been so happy in his life and on the whole shes inclined to agree with me  but then shes entangled herself with perrott st john continued and i have reason to think from something i saw in the passage that everything isnt as it should be between arthur and susan theres a young female lately arrived from manchester a very good thing if it were broken off in my opinion their married life is something too horrible to contemplate oh and i distinctly heard old mrs paley rapping out the most fearful oaths as i passed her bedroom door its supposed that she tortures her maid in privateits practically certain she does one can tell it from the look in her eyes  when youre eighty and the gout tweezes you youll be swearing like a trooper terence remarked youll be very fat very testy very disagreeable cant you imagine himbald as a coot with a pair of spongebag trousers a little spotted tie and a corporation  after a pause hirst remarked that the worst infamy had still to be told he addressed himself to helen  theyve hoofed out the prostitute one night while we were away that old numskull thornbury was doddering about the passages very late nobody seems to have asked him what he was up to he saw the signora lola mendoza as she calls herself cross the passage in her nightgown he communicated his suspicions next morning to elliot with the result that rodriguez went to the woman and gave her twentyfour hours in which to clear out of the place no one seems to have enquired into the truth of the story or to have asked thornbury and elliot what business it was of theirs they had it entirely their own way i propose that we should all sign a round robin go to rodriguez in a body and insist upon a full enquiry somethings got to be done dont you agree  hewet remarked that there could be no doubt as to the ladys profession  still he added its a great shame poor woman only i dont see whats to be done  i quite agree with you st john helen burst out its monstrous the hypocritical smugness of the english makes my blood boil a man whos made a fortune in trade as mr thornbury has is bound to be twice as bad as any prostitute  she respected st johns morality which she took far more seriously than any one else did and now entered into a discussion with him as to the steps that were to be taken to enforce their peculiar view of what was right the argument led to some profoundly gloomy statements of a general nature who were they after allwhat authority had theywhat power against the mass of superstition and ignorance it was the english of course there must be something wrong in the english blood directly you met an english person of the middle classes you were conscious of an indefinable sensation of loathing directly you saw the brown crescent of houses above dover the same thing came over you but unfortunately st john added you couldnt trust these foreigners  they were interrupted by sounds of strife at the further end of the table rachel appealed to her aunt  terence says we must go to tea with mrs thornbury because shes been so kind but i dont see it in fact id rather have my right hand sawn in piecesjust imagine the eyes of all those women  fiddlesticks rachel terence replied who wants to look at you youre consumed with vanity youre a monster of conceit surely helen you ought to have taught her by this time that shes a person of no conceivable importance whatevernot beautiful or well dressed or conspicuous for elegance or intellect or deportment a more ordinary sight than you are he concluded except for the tear across your dress has never been seen however stay at home if you want to im going  she appealed again to her aunt it wasnt the being looked at she explained but the things people were sure to say the women in particular she liked women but where emotion was concerned they were as flies on a lump of sugar they would be certain to ask her questions evelyn m would say are you in love is it nice being in love and mrs thornburyher eyes would go up and down up and downshe shuddered at the thought of it indeed the retirement of their life since their engagement had made her so sensitive that she was not exaggerating her case  she found an ally in helen who proceeded to expound her views of the human race as she regarded with complacency the pyramid of variegated fruits in the centre of the table it wasnt that they were cruel or meant to hurt or even stupid exactly but she had always found that the ordinary person had so little emotion in his own life that the scent of it in the lives of others was like the scent of blood in the nostrils of a bloodhound warming to the theme she continued  directly anything happensit may be a marriage or a birth or a deathon the whole they prefer it to be a deathevery one wants to see you they insist upon seeing you theyve got nothing to say they dont care a rap for you but youve got to go to lunch or to tea or to dinner and if you dont youre damned its the smell of blood she continued i dont blame em only they shant have mind if i know it  she looked about her as if she had called up a legion of human beings all hostile and all disagreeable who encircled the table with mouths gaping for blood and made it appear a little island of neutral country in the midst of the enemys country  her words roused her husband who had been muttering rhythmically to himself surveying his guests and his food and his wife with eyes that were now melancholy and now fierce according to the fortunes of the lady in his ballad he cut helen short with a protest he hated even the semblance of cynicism in women nonsense nonsense he remarked abruptly  terence and rachel glanced at each other across the table which meant that when they were married they would not behave like that the entrance of ridley into the conversation had a strange effect it became at once more formal and more polite it would have been impossible to talk quite easily of anything that came into their heads and to say the word prostitute as simply as any other word the talk now turned upon literature and politics and ridley told stories of the distinguished people he had known in his youth such talk was of the nature of an art and the personalities and informalities of the young were silenced as they rose to go helen stopped for a moment leaning her elbows on the table  youve all been sitting here she said for almost an hour and you havent noticed my figs or my flowers or the way the light comes through or anything i havent been listening because ive been looking at you you looked very beautiful i wish youd go on sitting for ever  she led the way to the drawingroom where she took up her embroidery and began again to dissuade terence from walking down to the hotel in this heat but the more she dissuaded the more he was determined to go he became irritated and obstinate there were moments when they almost disliked each other he wanted other people he wanted rachel to see them with him he suspected that mrs ambrose would now try to dissuade her from going he was annoyed by all this space and shade and beauty and hirst recumbent drooping a magazine from his wrist  im going he repeated rachel neednt come unless she wants to  if you go hewet i wish youd make enquiries about the prostitute said hirst look here he added ill walk half the way with you  greatly to their surprise he raised himself looked at his watch and remarked that as it was now half an hour since luncheon the gastric juices had had sufficient time to secrete he was trying a system he explained which involved short spells of exercise interspaced by longer intervals of rest  i shall be back at four he remarked to helen when i shall lie down on the sofa and relax all my muscles completely  so youre going rachel helen asked you wont stay with me  she smiled but she might have been sad  was she sad or was she really laughing rachel could not tell and she felt for the moment very uncomfortable between helen and terence then she turned away saying merely that she would go with terence on condition that he did all the talking  a narrow border of shadow ran along the road which was broad enough for two but not broad enough for three st john therefore dropped a little behind the pair and the distance between them increased by degrees walking with a view to digestion and with one eye upon his watch he looked from time to time at the pair in front of him they seemed to be so happy so intimate although they were walking side by side much as other people walk they turned slightly toward each other now and then and said something which he thought must be something very private they were really disputing about helens character and terence was trying to explain why it was that she annoyed him so much sometimes but st john thought that they were saying things which they did not want him to hear and was led to think of his own isolation these people were happy and in some ways he despised them for being made happy so simply and in other ways he envied them he was much more remarkable than they were but he was not happy people never liked him he doubted sometimes whether even helen liked him to be simple to be able to say simply what one felt without the terrific selfconsciousness which possessed him and showed him his own face and words perpetually in a mirror that would be worth almost any other gift for it made one happy happiness happiness what was happiness he was never happy he saw too clearly the little vices and deceits and flaws of life and seeing them it seemed to him honest to take notice of them that was the reason no doubt why people generally disliked him and complained that he was heartless and bitter certainly they never told him the things he wanted to be told that he was nice and kind and that they liked him but it was true that half the sharp things that he said about them were said because he was unhappy or hurt himself but he admitted that he had very seldom told any one that he cared for them and when he had been demonstrative he had generally regretted it afterwards his feelings about terence and rachel were so complicated that he had never yet been able to bring himself to say that he was glad that they were going to be married he saw their faults so clearly and the inferior nature of a great deal of their feeling for each other and he expected that their love would not last he looked at them again and very strangely for he was so used to thinking that he seldom saw anything the look of them filled him with a simple emotion of affection in which there were some traces of pity also what after all did peoples faults matter in comparison with what was good in them he resolved that he would now tell them what he felt he quickened his pace and came up with them just as they reached the corner where the lane joined the main road they stood still and began to laugh at him and to ask him whether the gastric juicesbut he stopped them and began to speak very quickly and stiffly  dyou remember the morning after the dance he demanded it was here we sat and you talked nonsense and rachel made little heaps of stones i on the other hand had the whole meaning of life revealed to me in a flash he paused for a second and drew his lips together in a tight little purse love he said it seems to me to explain everything so on the whole im very glad that you two are going to be married he then turned round abruptly without looking at them and walked back to the villa he felt both exalted and ashamed of himself for having thus said what he felt probably they were laughing at him probably they thought him a fool and after all had he really said what he felt  it was true that they laughed when he was gone but the dispute about helen which had become rather sharp ceased and they became peaceful and friendly      chapter xxiv   they reached the hotel rather early in the afternoon so that most people were still lying down or sitting speechless in their bedrooms and mrs thornbury although she had asked them to tea was nowhere to be seen they sat down therefore in the shady hall which was almost empty and full of the light swishing sounds of air going to and fro in a large empty space yes this armchair was the same armchair in which rachel had sat that afternoon when evelyn came up and this was the magazine she had been looking at and this the very picture a picture of new york by lamplight how odd it seemednothing had changed  by degrees a certain number of people began to come down the stairs and to pass through the hall and in this dim light their figures possessed a sort of grace and beauty although they were all unknown people sometimes they went straight through and out into the garden by the swing door sometimes they stopped for a few minutes and bent over the tables and began turning over the newspapers terence and rachel sat watching them through their halfclosed eyelidsthe johnsons the parkers the baileys the simmons the lees the morleys the campbells the gardiners some were dressed in white flannels and were carrying racquets under their arms some were short some tall some were only children and some perhaps were servants but they all had their standing their reason for following each other through the hall their money their position whatever it might be terence soon gave up looking at them for he was tired and closing his eyes he fell half asleep in his chair rachel watched the people for some time longer she was fascinated by the certainty and the grace of their movements and by the inevitable way in which they seemed to follow each other and loiter and pass on and disappear but after a time her thoughts wandered and she began to think of the dance which had been held in this room only then the room itself looked quite different glancing round she could hardly believe that it was the same room it had looked so bare and so bright and formal on that night when they came into it out of the darkness it had been filled too with little red excited faces always moving and people so brightly dressed and so animated that they did not seem in the least like real people nor did you feel that you could talk to them and now the room was dim and quiet and beautiful silent people passed through it to whom you could go and say anything you liked she felt herself amazingly secure as she sat in her armchair and able to review not only the night of the dance but the entire past tenderly and humorously as if she had been turning in a fog for a long time and could now see exactly where she had turned for the methods by which she had reached her present position seemed to her very strange and the strangest thing about them was that she had not known where they were leading her that was the strange thing that one did not know where one was going or what one wanted and followed blindly suffering so much in secret always unprepared and amazed and knowing nothing but one thing led to another and by degrees something had formed itself out of nothing and so one reached at last this calm this quiet this certainty and it was this process that people called living perhaps then every one really knew as she knew now where they were going and things formed themselves into a pattern not only for her but for them and in that pattern lay satisfaction and meaning when she looked back she could see that a meaning of some kind was apparent in the lives of her aunts and in the brief visit of the dalloways whom she would never see again and in the life of her father  the sound of terence breathing deep in his slumber confirmed her in her calm she was not sleepy although she did not see anything very distinctly but although the figures passing through the hall became vaguer and vaguer she believed that they all knew exactly where they were going and the sense of their certainty filled her with comfort for the moment she was as detached and disinterested as if she had no longer any lot in life and she thought that she could now accept anything that came to her without being perplexed by the form in which it appeared what was there to frighten or to perplex in the prospect of life why should this insight ever again desert her the world was in truth so large so hospitable and after all it was so simple love st john had said that seems to explain it all yes but it was not the love of man for woman of terence for rachel although they sat so close together they had ceased to be little separate bodies they had ceased to struggle and desire one another there seemed to be peace between them it might be love but it was not the love of man for woman  through her halfclosed eyelids she watched terence lying back in his chair and she smiled as she saw how big his mouth was and his chin so small and his nose curved like a switchback with a knob at the end naturally looking like that he was lazy and ambitious and full of moods and faults she remembered their quarrels and in particular how they had been quarreling about helen that very afternoon and she thought how often they would quarrel in the thirty or forty or fifty years in which they would be living in the same house together catching trains together and getting annoyed because they were so different but all this was superficial and had nothing to do with the life that went on beneath the eyes and the mouth and the chin for that life was independent of her and independent of everything else so too although she was going to marry him and to live with him for thirty or forty or fifty years and to quarrel and to be so close to him she was independent of him she was independent of everything else nevertheless as st john said it was love that made her understand this for she had never felt this independence this calm and this certainty until she fell in love with him and perhaps this too was love she wanted nothing else  for perhaps two minutes miss allan had been standing at a little distance looking at the couple lying back so peacefully in their armchairs she could not make up her mind whether to disturb them or not and then seeming to recollect something she came across the hall the sound of her approach woke terence who sat up and rubbed his eyes he heard miss allan talking to rachel  well she was saying this is very nice it is very nice indeed getting engaged seems to be quite the fashion it cannot often happen that two couples who have never seen each other before meet in the same hotel and decide to get married then she paused and smiled and seemed to have nothing more to say so that terence rose and asked her whether it was true that she had finished her book some one had said that she had really finished it her face lit up she turned to him with a livelier expression than usual  yes i think i can fairly say i have finished it she said that is omitting swinburnebeowulf to browningi rather like the two bs myself beowulf to browning she repeated i think that is the kind of title which might catch ones eye on a railway bookstall  she was indeed very proud that she had finished her book for no one knew what an amount of determination had gone to the making of it also she thought that it was a good piece of work and considering what anxiety she had been in about her brother while she wrote it she could not resist telling them a little more about it  i must confess she continued that if i had known how many classics there are in english literature and how verbose the best of them contrive to be i should never have undertaken the work they only allow one seventy thousand words you see  only seventy thousand words terence exclaimed  yes and one has to say something about everybody miss allan added that is what i find so difficult saying something different about everybody then she thought that she had said enough about herself and she asked whether they had come down to join the tennis tournament the young people are very keen about it it begins again in half an hour  her gaze rested benevolently upon them both and after a momentary pause she remarked looking at rachel as if she had remembered something that would serve to keep her distinct from other people  youre the remarkable person who doesnt like ginger but the kindness of the smile in her rather worn and courageous face made them feel that although she would scarcely remember them as individuals she had laid upon them the burden of the new generation  and in that i quite agree with her said a voice behind mrs thornbury had overheard the last few words about not liking ginger its associated in my mind with a horrid old aunt of ours poor thing she suffered dreadfully so it isnt fair to call her horrid who used to give it to us when we were small and we never had the courage to tell her we didnt like it we just had to put it out in the shrubberyshe had a big house near bath  they began moving slowly across the hall when they were stopped by the impact of evelyn who dashed into them as though in running downstairs to catch them her legs had got beyond her control  well she exclaimed with her usual enthusiasm seizing rachel by the arm i call this splendid i guessed it was going to happen from the very beginning i saw you two were made for each other now youve just got to tell me all about itwhens it to be where are you going to liveare you both tremendously happy  but the attention of the group was diverted to mrs elliot who was passing them with her eager but uncertain movement carrying in her hands a plate and an empty hotwater bottle she would have passed them but mrs thornbury went up and stopped her  thank you hughlings better she replied in answer to mrs thornburys enquiry but hes not an easy patient he wants to know what his temperature is and if i tell him he gets anxious and if i dont tell him he suspects you know what men are when theyre ill and of course there are none of the proper appliances and though he seems very willing and anxious to help here she lowered her voice mysteriously one cant feel that dr rodriguez is the same as a proper doctor if you would come and see him mr hewet she added i know it would cheer him uplying there in bed all dayand the fliesbut i must go and find angelothe food hereof course with an invalid one wants things particularly nice and she hurried past them in search of the head waiter the worry of nursing her husband had fixed a plaintive frown upon her forehead she was pale and looked unhappy and more than usually inefficient and her eyes wandered more vaguely than ever from point to point  poor thing mrs thornbury exclaimed she told them that for some days hughling elliot had been ill and the only doctor available was the brother of the proprietor or so the proprietor said whose right to the title of doctor was not above suspicion  i know how wretched it is to be ill in a hotel mrs thornbury remarked once more leading the way with rachel to the garden i spent six weeks on my honeymoon in having typhoid at venice she continued but even so i look back upon them as some of the happiest weeks in my life ah yes she said taking rachels arm you think yourself happy now but its nothing to the happiness that comes afterwards and i assure you i could find it in my heart to envy you young people youve a much better time than we had i may tell you when i look back upon it i can hardly believe how things have changed when we were engaged i wasnt allowed to go for walks with william alonesome one had always to be in the room with usi really believe i had to show my parents all his lettersthough they were very fond of him too indeed i may say they looked upon him as their own son it amuses me she continued to think how strict they were to us when i see how they spoil their grandchildren  the table was laid under the tree again and taking her place before the teacups mrs thornbury beckoned and nodded until she had collected quite a number of people susan and arthur and mr pepper who were strolling about waiting for the tournament to begin a murmuring tree a river brimming in the moonlight terences words came back to rachel as she sat drinking the tea and listening to the words which flowed on so lightly so kindly and with such silvery smoothness this long life and all these children had left her very smooth they seemed to have rubbed away the marks of individuality and to have left only what was old and maternal  and the things you young people are going to see mrs thornbury continued she included them all in her forecast she included them all in her maternity although the party comprised william pepper and miss allan both of whom might have been supposed to have seen a fair share of the panorama when i see how the world has changed in my lifetime she went on i can set no limit to what may happen in the next fifty years ah no mr pepper i dont agree with you in the least she laughed interrupting his gloomy remark about things going steadily from bad to worse i know i ought to feel that but i dont im afraid theyre going to be much better people than we were surely everything goes to prove that all round me i see women young women women with household cares of every sort going out and doing things that we should not have thought it possible to do  mr pepper thought her sentimental and irrational like all old women but her manner of treating him as if he were a cross old baby baffled him and charmed him and he could only reply to her with a curious grimace which was more a smile than a frown  and they remain women mrs thornbury added they give a great deal to their children  as she said this she smiled slightly in the direction of susan and rachel they did not like to be included in the same lot but they both smiled a little selfconsciously and arthur and terence glanced at each other too she made them feel that they were all in the same boat together and they looked at the women they were going to marry and compared them it was inexplicable how any one could wish to marry rachel incredible that any one should be ready to spend his life with susan but singular though the others taste must be they bore each other no illwill on account of it indeed they liked each other rather the better for the eccentricity of their choice  i really must congratulate you susan remarked as she leant across the table for the jam  there seemed to be no foundation for st johns gossip about arthur and susan sunburnt and vigorous they sat side by side with their racquets across their knees not saying much but smiling slightly all the time through the thin white clothes which they wore it was possible to see the lines of their bodies and legs the beautiful curves of their muscles his leanness and her flesh and it was natural to think of the firmfleshed sturdy children that would be theirs their faces had too little shape in them to be beautiful but they had clear eyes and an appearance of great health and power of endurance for it seemed as if the blood would never cease to run in his veins or to lie deeply and calmly in her cheeks their eyes at the present moment were brighter than usual and wore the peculiar expression of pleasure and selfconfidence which is seen in the eyes of athletes for they had been playing tennis and they were both firstrate at the game  evelyn had not spoken but she had been looking from susan to rachel wellthey had both made up their minds very easily they had done in a very few weeks what it sometimes seemed to her that she would never be able to do although they were so different she thought that she could see in each the same look of satisfaction and completion the same calmness of manner and the same slowness of movement it was that slowness that confidence that content which she hated she thought to herself they moved so slowly because they were not single but double and susan was attached to arthur and rachel to terence and for the sake of this one man they had renounced all other men and movement and the real things of life love was all very well and those snug domestic houses with the kitchen below and the nursery above which were so secluded and selfcontained like little islands in the torrents of the world but the real things were surely the things that happened the causes the wars the ideals which happened in the great world outside and went so independently of these women turning so quietly and beautifully towards the men she looked at them sharply of course they were happy and content but there must be better things than that surely one could get nearer to life one could get more out of life one could enjoy more and feel more than they would ever do rachel in particular looked so youngwhat could she know of life she became restless and getting up crossed over to sit beside rachel she reminded her that she had promised to join her club  the bother is she went on that i maynt be able to start work seriously till october ive just had a letter from a friend of mine whose brother is in business in moscow they want me to stay with them and as theyre in the thick of all the conspiracies and anarchists ive a good mind to stop on my way home it sounds too thrilling she wanted to make rachel see how thrilling it was my friend knows a girl of fifteen whos been sent to siberia for life merely because they caught her addressing a letter to an anarchist and the letter wasnt from her either id give all i have in the world to help on a revolution against the russian government and its bound to come  she looked from rachel to terence they were both a little touched by the sight of her remembering how lately they had been listening to evil words about her and terence asked her what her scheme was and she explained that she was going to found a cluba club for doing things really doing them she became very animated as she talked on and on for she professed herself certain that if once twenty peopleno ten would be enough if they were keenset about doing things instead of talking about doing them they could abolish almost every evil that exists it was brains that were needed if only people with brainsof course they would want a room a nice room in bloomsbury preferably where they could meet once a week     as she talked terence could see the traces of fading youth in her face the lines that were being drawn by talk and excitement round her mouth and eyes but he did not pity her looking into those bright rather hard and very courageous eyes he saw that she did not pity herself or feel any desire to exchange her own life for the more refined and orderly lives of people like himself and st john although as the years went by the fight would become harder and harder perhaps though she would settle down perhaps after all she would marry perrott while his mind was half occupied with what she was saying he thought of her probable destiny the light clouds of tobacco smoke serving to obscure his face from her eyes  terence smoked and arthur smoked and evelyn smoked so that the air was full of the mist and fragrance of good tobacco in the intervals when no one spoke they heard far off the low murmur of the sea as the waves quietly broke and spread the beach with a film of water and withdrew to break again the cool green light fell through the leaves of the tree and there were soft crescents and diamonds of sunshine upon the plates and the tablecloth mrs thornbury after watching them all for a time in silence began to ask rachel kindly questionswhen did they all go back oh they expected her father she must want to see her fatherthere would be a great deal to tell him and she looked sympathetically at terence he would be so happy she felt sure years ago she continued it might have been ten or twenty years ago she remembered meeting mr vinrace at a party and being so much struck by his face which was so unlike the ordinary face one sees at a party that she had asked who he was and she was told that it was mr vinrace and she had always remembered the namean uncommon nameand he had a lady with him a very sweetlooking woman but it was one of those dreadful london crushes where you dont talkyou only look at each otherand although she had shaken hands with mr vinrace she didnt think they had said anything she sighed very slightly remembering the past  then she turned to mr pepper who had become very dependent on her so that he always chose a seat near her and attended to what she was saying although he did not often make any remark of his own  you who know everything mr pepper she said tell us how did those wonderful french ladies manage their salons did we ever do anything of the same kind in england or do you think that there is some reason why we cannot do it in england  mr pepper was pleased to explain very accurately why there has never been an english salon there were three reasons and they were very good ones he said as for himself when he went to a party as one was sometimes obliged to from a wish not to give offencehis niece for example had been married the other dayhe walked into the middle of the room said ha ha as loud as ever he could considered that he had done his duty and walked away again mrs thornbury protested she was going to give a party directly she got back and they were all to be invited and she should set people to watch mr pepper and if she heard that he had been caught saying ha ha she wouldshe would do something very dreadful indeed to him arthur venning suggested that what she must do was to rig up something in the nature of a surprisea portrait for example of a nice old lady in a lace cap concealing a bath of cold water which at a signal could be sprung on peppers head or theyd have a chair which shot him twenty feet high directly he sat on it  susan laughed she had done her tea she was feeling very well contented partly because she had been playing tennis brilliantly and then every one was so nice she was beginning to find it so much easier to talk and to hold her own even with quite clever people for somehow clever people did not frighten her any more even mr hirst whom she had disliked when she first met him really wasnt disagreeable and poor man he always looked so ill perhaps he was in love perhaps he had been in love with rachelshe really shouldnt wonder or perhaps it was evelynshe was of course very attractive to men leaning forward she went on with the conversation she said that she thought that the reason why parties were so dull was mainly because gentlemen will not dress even in london she stated it struck her very much how people dont think it necessary to dress in the evening and of course if they dont dress in london they wont dress in the country it was really quite a treat at christmastime when there were the hunt balls and the gentlemen wore nice red coats but arthur didnt care for dancing so she supposed that they wouldnt go even to the ball in their little country town she didnt think that people who were fond of one sport often care for another although her father was an exception but then he was an exception in every waysuch a gardener and he knew all about birds and animals and of course he was simply adored by all the old women in the village and at the same time what he really liked best was a book you always knew where to find him if he were wanted he would be in his study with a book very likely it would be an old old book some fusty old thing that no one else would dream of reading she used to tell him that he would have made a firstrate old bookworm if only he hadnt had a family of six to support and six children she added charmingly confident of universal sympathy didnt leave one much time for being a bookworm  still talking about her father of whom she was very proud she rose for arthur upon looking at his watch found that it was time they went back again to the tennis court the others did not move  theyre very happy said mrs thornbury looking benignantly after them rachel agreed they seemed to be so certain of themselves they seemed to know exactly what they wanted  dyou think they are happy evelyn murmured to terence in an undertone and she hoped that he would say that he did not think them happy but instead he said that they must go toogo home for they were always being late for meals and mrs ambrose who was very stern and particular didnt like that evelyn laid hold of rachels skirt and protested why should they go it was still early and she had so many things to say to them no said terence we must go because we walk so slowly we stop and look at things and we talk  what dyou talk about evelyn enquired upon which he laughed and said that they talked about everything  mrs thornbury went with them to the gate trailing very slowly and gracefully across the grass and the gravel and talking all the time about flowers and birds she told them that she had taken up the study of botany since her daughter married and it was wonderful what a number of flowers there were which she had never seen although she had lived in the country all her life and she was now seventytwo it was a good thing to have some occupation which was quite independent of other people she said when one got old but the odd thing was that one never felt old she always felt that she was twentyfive not a day more or a day less but of course one couldnt expect other people to agree to that  it must be very wonderful to be twentyfive and not merely to imagine that youre twentyfive she said looking from one to the other with her smooth bright glance it must be very wonderful very wonderful indeed she stood talking to them at the gate for a long time she seemed reluctant that they should go      chapter xxv   the afternoon was very hot so hot that the breaking of the waves on the shore sounded like the repeated sigh of some exhausted creature and even on the terrace under an awning the bricks were hot and the air danced perpetually over the short dry grass the red flowers in the stone basins were drooping with the heat and the white blossoms which had been so smooth and thick only a few weeks ago were now dry and their edges were curled and yellow only the stiff and hostile plants of the south whose fleshy leaves seemed to be grown upon spines still remained standing upright and defied the sun to beat them down it was too hot to talk and it was not easy to find any book that would withstand the power of the sun many books had been tried and then let fall and now terence was reading milton aloud because he said the words of milton had substance and shape so that it was not necessary to understand what he was saying one could merely listen to his words one could almost handle them  there is a gentle nymph not far from hence  he read       that with moist curb sways the smooth severn stream        sabrina is her name a virgin pure      whilom she was the daughter of locrine        that had the sceptre from his father brute  the words in spite of what terence had said seemed to be laden with meaning and perhaps it was for this reason that it was painful to listen to them they sounded strange they meant different things from what they usually meant rachel at any rate could not keep her attention fixed upon them but went off upon curious trains of thought suggested by words such as curb and locrine and brute which brought unpleasant sights before her eyes independently of their meaning owing to the heat and the dancing air the garden too looked strangethe trees were either too near or too far and her head almost certainly ached she was not quite certain and therefore she did not know whether to tell terence now or to let him go on reading she decided that she would wait until he came to the end of a stanza and if by that time she had turned her head this way and that and it ached in every position undoubtedly she would say very calmly that her head ached       sabrina fair        listen where thou art sitting      under the glassy cool translucent wave        in twisted braids of lilies knitting      the loose train of thy amber dropping hair        listen for dear honours sake      goddess of the silver lake        listen and save  but her head ached it ached whichever way she turned it  she sat up and said as she had determined my head aches so that i shall go indoors he was halfway through the next verse but he dropped the book instantly  your head aches he repeated  for a few moments they sat looking at one another in silence holding each others hands during this time his sense of dismay and catastrophe were almost physically painful all round him he seemed to hear the shiver of broken glass which as it fell to earth left him sitting in the open air but at the end of two minutes noticing that she was not sharing his dismay but was only rather more languid and heavyeyed than usual he recovered fetched helen and asked her to tell him what they had better do for rachel had a headache  mrs ambrose was not discomposed but advised that she should go to bed and added that she must expect her head to ache if she sat up to all hours and went out in the heat but a few hours in bed would cure it completely terence was unreasonably reassured by her words as he had been unreasonably depressed the moment before helens sense seemed to have much in common with the ruthless good sense of nature which avenged rashness by a headache and like natures good sense might be depended upon  rachel went to bed she lay in the dark it seemed to her for a very long time but at length waking from a transparent kind of sleep she saw the windows white in front of her and recollected that some time before she had gone to bed with a headache and that helen had said it would be gone when she woke she supposed therefore that she was now quite well again at the same time the wall of her room was painfully white and curved slightly instead of being straight and flat turning her eyes to the window she was not reassured by what she saw there the movement of the blind as it filled with air and blew slowly out drawing the cord with a little trailing sound along the floor seemed to her terrifying as if it were the movement of an animal in the room she shut her eyes and the pulse in her head beat so strongly that each thump seemed to tread upon a nerve piercing her forehead with a little stab of pain it might not be the same headache but she certainly had a headache she turned from side to side in the hope that the coolness of the sheets would cure her and that when she next opened her eyes to look the room would be as usual after a considerable number of vain experiments she resolved to put the matter beyond a doubt she got out of bed and stood upright holding on to the brass ball at the end of the bedstead icecold at first it soon became as hot as the palm of her hand and as the pains in her head and body and the instability of the floor proved that it would be far more intolerable to stand and walk than to lie in bed she got into bed again but though the change was refreshing at first the discomfort of bed was soon as great as the discomfort of standing up she accepted the idea that she would have to stay in bed all day long and as she laid her head on the pillow relinquished the happiness of the day  when helen came in an hour or two later suddenly stopped her cheerful words looked startled for a second and then unnaturally calm the fact that she was ill was put beyond a doubt it was confirmed when the whole household knew of it when the song that some one was singing in the garden stopped suddenly and when maria as she brought water slipped past the bed with averted eyes there was all the morning to get through and then all the afternoon and at intervals she made an effort to cross over into the ordinary world but she found that her heat and discomfort had put a gulf between her world and the ordinary world which she could not bridge at one point the door opened and helen came in with a little dark man who hadit was the chief thing she noticed about himvery hairy hands she was drowsy and intolerably hot and as he seemed shy and obsequious she scarcely troubled to answer him although she understood that he was a doctor at another point the door opened and terence came in very gently smiling too steadily as she realised for it to be natural he sat down and talked to her stroking her hands until it became irksome to her to lie any more in the same position and she turned round and when she looked up again helen was beside her and terence had gone it did not matter she would see him tomorrow when things would be ordinary again her chief occupation during the day was to try to remember how the lines went       under the glassy cool translucent wave      in twisted braids of lilies knitting        the loose train of thy amber dropping hair  and the effort worried her because the adjectives persisted in getting into the wrong places  the second day did not differ very much from the first day except that her bed had become very important and the world outside when she tried to think of it appeared distinctly further off the glassy cool translucent wave was almost visible before her curling up at the end of the bed and as it was refreshingly cool she tried to keep her mind fixed upon it helen was here and helen was there all day long sometimes she said that it was lunchtime and sometimes that it was teatime but by the next day all landmarks were obliterated and the outer world was so far away that the different sounds such as the sounds of people moving overhead could only be ascribed to their cause by a great effort of memory the recollection of what she had felt or of what she had been doing and thinking three days before had faded entirely on the other hand every object in the room and the bed itself and her own body with its various limbs and their different sensations were more and more important each day she was completely cut off and unable to communicate with the rest of the world isolated alone with her body  hours and hours would pass thus without getting any further through the morning or again a few minutes would lead from broad daylight to the depths of the night one evening when the room appeared very dim either because it was evening or because the blinds were drawn helen said to her some one is going to sit here tonight you wont mind  opening her eyes rachel saw not only helen but a nurse in spectacles whose face vaguely recalled something that she had once seen she had seen her in the chapel nurse mcinnis said helen and the nurse smiled steadily as they all did and said that she did not find many people who were frightened of her after waiting for a moment they both disappeared and having turned on her pillow rachel woke to find herself in the midst of one of those interminable nights which do not end at twelve but go on into the double figuresthirteen fourteen and so on until they reach the twenties and then the thirties and then the forties she realised that there is nothing to prevent nights from doing this if they choose at a great distance an elderly woman sat with her head bent down rachel raised herself slightly and saw with dismay that she was playing cards by the light of a candle which stood in the hollow of a newspaper the sight had something inexplicably sinister about it and she was terrified and cried out upon which the woman laid down her cards and came across the room shading the candle with her hands coming nearer and nearer across the great space of the room she stood at last above rachels head and said not asleep let me make you comfortable  she put down the candle and began to arrange the bedclothes it struck rachel that a woman who sat playing cards in a cavern all night long would have very cold hands and she shrunk from the touch of them  why theres a toe all the way down there the woman said proceeding to tuck in the bedclothes rachel did not realise that the toe was hers  you must try and lie still she proceeded because if you lie still you will be less hot and if you toss about you will make yourself more hot and we dont want you to be any hotter than you are she stood looking down upon rachel for an enormous length of time  and the quieter you lie the sooner you will be well she repeated  rachel kept her eyes fixed upon the peaked shadow on the ceiling and all her energy was concentrated upon the desire that this shadow should move but the shadow and the woman seemed to be eternally fixed above her she shut her eyes when she opened them again several more hours had passed but the night still lasted interminably the woman was still playing cards only she sat now in a tunnel under a river and the light stood in a little archway in the wall above her she cried terence and the peaked shadow again moved across the ceiling as the woman with an enormous slow movement rose and they both stood still above her  its just as difficult to keep you in bed as it was to keep mr forrest in bed the woman said and he was such a tall gentleman  in order to get rid of this terrible stationary sight rachel again shut her eyes and found herself walking through a tunnel under the thames where there were little deformed women sitting in archways playing cards while the bricks of which the wall was made oozed with damp which collected into drops and slid down the wall but the little old women became helen and nurse mcinnis after a time standing in the window together whispering whispering incessantly  meanwhile outside her room the sounds the movements and the lives of the other people in the house went on in the ordinary light of the sun throughout the usual succession of hours when on the first day of her illness it became clear that she would not be absolutely well for her temperature was very high until friday that day being tuesday terence was filled with resentment not against her but against the force outside them which was separating them he counted up the number of days that would almost certainly be spoilt for them he realised with an odd mixture of pleasure and annoyance that for the first time in his life he was so dependent upon another person that his happiness was in her keeping the days were completely wasted upon trifling immaterial things for after three weeks of such intimacy and intensity all the usual occupations were unbearably flat and beside the point the least intolerable occupation was to talk to st john about rachels illness and to discuss every symptom and its meaning and when this subject was exhausted to discuss illness of all kinds and what caused them and what cured them  twice every day he went in to sit with rachel and twice every day the same thing happened on going into her room which was not very dark where the music was lying about as usual and her books and letters his spirits rose instantly when he saw her he felt completely reassured she did not look very ill sitting by her side he would tell her what he had been doing using his natural voice to speak to her only a few tones lower down than usual but by the time he had sat there for five minutes he was plunged into the deepest gloom she was not the same he could not bring them back to their old relationship but although he knew that it was foolish he could not prevent himself from endeavouring to bring her back to make her remember and when this failed he was in despair he always concluded as he left her room that it was worse to see her than not to see her but by degrees as the day wore on the desire to see her returned and became almost too great to be borne  on thursday morning when terence went into her room he felt the usual increase of confidence she turned round and made an effort to remember certain facts from the world that was so many millions of miles away  you have come up from the hotel she asked  no im staying here for the present he said weve just had luncheon he continued and the mail has come in theres a bundle of letters for youletters from england  instead of saying as he meant her to say that she wished to see them she said nothing for some time  you see there they go rolling off the edge of the hill she said suddenly  rolling rachel what do you see rolling theres nothing rolling  the old woman with the knife she replied not speaking to terence in particular and looking past him as she appeared to be looking at a vase on the shelf opposite he rose and took it down  now they cant roll any more he said cheerfully nevertheless she lay gazing at the same spot and paid him no further attention although he spoke to her he became so profoundly wretched that he could not endure to sit with her but wandered about until he found st john who was reading the times in the verandah he laid it aside patiently and heard all that terence had to say about delirium he was very patient with terence he treated him like a child  by friday it could not be denied that the illness was no longer an attack that would pass off in a day or two it was a real illness that required a good deal of organisation and engrossed the attention of at least five people but there was no reason to be anxious instead of lasting five days it was going to last ten days rodriguez was understood to say that there were wellknown varieties of this illness rodriguez appeared to think that they were treating the illness with undue anxiety his visits were always marked by the same show of confidence and in his interviews with terence he always waved aside his anxious and minute questions with a kind of flourish which seemed to indicate that they were all taking it much too seriously he seemed curiously unwilling to sit down  a high temperature he said looking furtively about the room and appearing to be more interested in the furniture and in helens embroidery than in anything else in this climate you must expect a high temperature you need not be alarmed by that it is the pulse we go by he tapped his own hairy wrist and the pulse continues excellent  thereupon he bowed and slipped out the interview was conducted laboriously upon both sides in french and this together with the fact that he was optimistic and that terence respected the medical profession from hearsay made him less critical than he would have been had he encountered the doctor in any other capacity unconsciously he took rodriguez side against helen who seemed to have taken an unreasonable prejudice against him  when saturday came it was evident that the hours of the day must be more strictly organised than they had been st john offered his services he said that he had nothing to do and that he might as well spend the day at the villa if he could be of use as if they were starting on a difficult expedition together they parcelled out their duties between them writing out an elaborate scheme of hours upon a large sheet of paper which was pinned to the drawingroom door their distance from the town and the difficulty of procuring rare things with unknown names from the most unexpected places made it necessary to think very carefully and they found it unexpectedly difficult to do the simple but practical things that were required of them as if they being very tall were asked to stoop down and arrange minute grains of sand in a pattern on the ground  it was st johns duty to fetch what was needed from the town so that terence would sit all through the long hot hours alone in the drawingroom near the open door listening for any movement upstairs or call from helen he always forgot to pull down the blinds so that he sat in bright sunshine which worried him without his knowing what was the cause of it the room was terribly stiff and uncomfortable there were hats in the chairs and medicine bottles among the books he tried to read but good books were too good and bad books were too bad and the only thing he could tolerate was the newspaper which with its news of london and the movements of real people who were giving dinnerparties and making speeches seemed to give a little background of reality to what was otherwise mere nightmare then just as his attention was fixed on the print a soft call would come from helen or mrs chailey would bring in something which was wanted upstairs and he would run up very quietly in his socks and put the jug on the little table which stood crowded with jugs and cups outside the bedroom door or if he could catch helen for a moment he would ask how is she  rather restless    on the whole quieter i think  the answer would be one or the other  as usual she seemed to reserve something which she did not say and terence was conscious that they disagreed and without saying it aloud were arguing against each other but she was too hurried and preoccupied to talk  the strain of listening and the effort of making practical arrangements and seeing that things worked smoothly absorbed all terences power involved in this long dreary nightmare he did not attempt to think what it amounted to rachel was ill that was all he must see that there was medicine and milk and that things were ready when they were wanted thought had ceased life itself had come to a standstill sunday was rather worse than saturday had been simply because the strain was a little greater every day although nothing else had changed the separate feelings of pleasure interest and pain which combine to make up the ordinary day were merged in one longdrawn sensation of sordid misery and profound boredom he had never been so bored since he was shut up in the nursery alone as a child the vision of rachel as she was now confused and heedless had almost obliterated the vision of her as she had been once long ago he could hardly believe that they had ever been happy or engaged to be married for what were feelings what was there to be felt confusion covered every sight and person and he seemed to see st john ridley and the stray people who came up now and then from the hotel to enquire through a mist the only people who were not hidden in this mist were helen and rodriguez because they could tell him something definite about rachel  nevertheless the day followed the usual forms at certain hours they went into the diningroom and when they sat round the table they talked about indifferent things st john usually made it his business to start the talk and to keep it from dying out  ive discovered the way to get sancho past the white house said st john on sunday at luncheon you crackle a piece of paper in his ear then he bolts for about a hundred yards but he goes on quite well after that  yes but he wants corn you should see that he has corn  i dont think much of the stuff they give him and angelo seems a dirty little rascal  there was then a long silence ridley murmured a few lines of poetry under his breath and remarked as if to conceal the fact that he had done so very hot today  two degrees higher than it was yesterday said st john i wonder where these nuts come from he observed taking a nut out of the plate turning it over in his fingers and looking at it curiously  london i should think said terence looking at the nut too  a competent man of business could make a fortune here in no time st john continued i suppose the heat does something funny to peoples brains even the english go a little queer anyhow theyre hopeless people to deal with they kept me threequarters of an hour waiting at the chemists this morning for no reason whatever  there was another long pause then ridley enquired rodriguez seems satisfied  quite said terence with decision its just got to run its course whereupon ridley heaved a deep sigh he was genuinely sorry for every one but at the same time he missed helen considerably and was a little aggrieved by the constant presence of the two young men  they moved back into the drawingroom  look here hirst said terence theres nothing to be done for two hours he consulted the sheet pinned to the door you go and lie down ill wait here chailey sits with rachel while helen has her luncheon  it was asking a good deal of hirst to tell him to go without waiting for a sight of helen these little glimpses of helen were the only respites from strain and boredom and very often they seemed to make up for the discomfort of the day although she might not have anything to tell them however as they were on an expedition together he had made up his mind to obey  helen was very late in coming down she looked like a person who has been sitting for a long time in the dark she was pale and thinner and the expression of her eyes was harassed but determined she ate her luncheon quickly and seemed indifferent to what she was doing she brushed aside terences enquiries and at last as if he had not spoken she looked at him with a slight frown and said  we cant go on like this terence either youve got to find another doctor or you must tell rodriguez to stop coming and ill manage for myself its no use for him to say that rachels better shes not better shes worse  terence suffered a terrific shock like that which he had suffered when rachel said my head aches he stilled it by reflecting that helen was overwrought and he was upheld in this opinion by his obstinate sense that she was opposed to him in the argument  do you think shes in danger he asked  no one can go on being as ill as that day after day helen replied she looked at him and spoke as if she felt some indignation with somebody  very well ill talk to rodriguez this afternoon he replied  helen went upstairs at once  nothing now could assuage terences anxiety he could not read nor could he sit still and his sense of security was shaken in spite of the fact that he was determined that helen was exaggerating and that rachel was not very ill but he wanted a third person to confirm him in his belief  directly rodriguez came down he demanded well how is she do you think her worse  there is no reason for anxiety i tell younone rodriguez replied in his execrable french smiling uneasily and making little movements all the time as if to get away  hewet stood firmly between him and the door he was determined to see for himself what kind of man he was his confidence in the man vanished as he looked at him and saw his insignificance his dirty appearance his shiftiness and his unintelligent hairy face it was strange that he had never seen this before  you wont object of course if we ask you to consult another doctor he continued  at this the little man became openly incensed  ah he cried you have not confidence in me you object to my treatment you wish me to give up the case  not at all terence replied but in serious illness of this kind  rodriguez shrugged his shoulders  it is not serious i assure you you are overanxious the young lady is not seriously ill and i am a doctor the lady of course is frightened he sneered i understand that perfectly  the name and address of the doctor is terence continued  there is no other doctor rodriguez replied sullenly every one has confidence in me look i will show you  he took out a packet of old letters and began turning them over as if in search of one that would confute terences suspicions as he searched he began to tell a story about an english lord who had trusted hima great english lord whose name he had unfortunately forgotten  there is no other doctor in the place he concluded still turning over the letters  never mind said terence shortly i will make enquiries for myself rodriguez put the letters back in his pocket  very well he remarked i have no objection  he lifted his eyebrows shrugged his shoulders as if to repeat that they took the illness much too seriously and that there was no other doctor and slipped out leaving behind him an impression that he was conscious that he was distrusted and that his malice was aroused  after this terence could no longer stay downstairs he went up knocked at rachels door and asked helen whether he might see her for a few minutes he had not seen her yesterday she made no objection and went and sat at a table in the window  terence sat down by the bedside rachels face was changed she looked as though she were entirely concentrated upon the effort of keeping alive her lips were drawn and her cheeks were sunken and flushed though without colour her eyes were not entirely shut the lower half of the white part showing not as if she saw but as if they remained open because she was too much exhausted to close them she opened them completely when he kissed her but she only saw an old woman slicing a mans head off with a knife  there it falls she murmured she then turned to terence and asked him anxiously some question about a man with mules which he could not understand why doesnt he come why doesnt he come she repeated he was appalled to think of the dirty little man downstairs in connection with illness like this and turning instinctively to helen but she was doing something at a table in the window and did not seem to realise how great the shock to him must be he rose to go for he could not endure to listen any longer his heart beat quickly and painfully with anger and misery as he passed helen she asked him in the same weary unnatural but determined voice to fetch her more ice and to have the jug outside filled with fresh milk  when he had done these errands he went to find hirst exhausted and very hot st john had fallen asleep on a bed but terence woke him without scruple  helen thinks shes worse he said theres no doubt shes frightfully ill rodriguez is useless we must get another doctor  but there is no other doctor said hirst drowsily sitting up and rubbing his eyes  dont be a damned fool terence exclaimed of course theres another doctor and if there isnt youve got to find one it ought to have been done days ago im going down to saddle the horse he could not stay still in one place  in less than ten minutes st john was riding to the town in the scorching heat in search of a doctor his orders being to find one and bring him back if he had to be fetched in a special train  we ought to have done it days ago hewet repeated angrily  when he went back into the drawingroom he found that mrs flushing was there standing very erect in the middle of the room having arrived as people did in these days by the kitchen or through the garden unannounced  shes better mrs flushing enquired abruptly they did not attempt to shake hands  no said terence if anything they think shes worse  mrs flushing seemed to consider for a moment or two looking straight at terence all the time  let me tell you she said speaking in nervous jerks its always about the seventh day one begins to get anxious i daresay youve been sittin here worryin by yourself you think shes bad but any one comin with a fresh eye would see she was better mr elliots had fever hes all right now she threw out it wasnt anythin she caught on the expedition whats it mattera few days fever my brother had fever for twentysix days once and in a week or two he was up and about we gave him nothin but milk and arrowroot  here mrs chailey came in with a message  im wanted upstairs said terence  you seeshell be better mrs flushing jerked out as he left the room her anxiety to persuade terence was very great and when he left her without saying anything she felt dissatisfied and restless she did not like to stay but she could not bear to go she wandered from room to room looking for some one to talk to but all the rooms were empty  terence went upstairs stood inside the door to take helens directions looked over at rachel but did not attempt to speak to her she appeared vaguely conscious of his presence but it seemed to disturb her and she turned so that she lay with her back to him  for six days indeed she had been oblivious of the world outside because it needed all her attention to follow the hot red quick sights which passed incessantly before her eyes she knew that it was of enormous importance that she should attend to these sights and grasp their meaning but she was always being just too late to hear or see something which would explain it all for this reason the faceshelens face the nurses terences the doctorswhich occasionally forced themselves very close to her were worrying because they distracted her attention and she might miss the clue however on the fourth afternoon she was suddenly unable to keep helens face distinct from the sights themselves her lips widened as she bent down over the bed and she began to gabble unintelligibly like the rest the sights were all concerned in some plot some adventure some escape the nature of what they were doing changed incessantly although there was always a reason behind it which she must endeavour to grasp now they were among trees and savages now they were on the sea now they were on the tops of high towers now they jumped now they flew but just as the crisis was about to happen something invariably slipped in her brain so that the whole effort had to begin over again the heat was suffocating at last the faces went further away she fell into a deep pool of sticky water which eventually closed over her head she saw nothing and heard nothing but a faint booming sound which was the sound of the sea rolling over her head while all her tormentors thought that she was dead she was not dead but curled up at the bottom of the sea there she lay sometimes seeing darkness sometimes light while every now and then some one turned her over at the bottom of the sea  after st john had spent some hours in the heat of the sun wrangling with evasive and very garrulous natives he extracted the information that there was a doctor a french doctor who was at present away on a holiday in the hills it was quite impossible so they said to find him with his experience of the country st john thought it unlikely that a telegram would either be sent or received but having reduced the distance of the hill town in which he was staying from a hundred miles to thirty miles and having hired a carriage and horses he started at once to fetch the doctor himself he succeeded in finding him and eventually forced the unwilling man to leave his young wife and return forthwith they reached the villa at midday on tuesday  terence came out to receive them and st john was struck by the fact that he had grown perceptibly thinner in the interval he was white too his eyes looked strange but the curt speech and the sulky masterful manner of dr lesage impressed them both favourably although at the same time it was obvious that he was very much annoyed at the whole affair coming downstairs he gave his directions emphatically but it never occurred to him to give an opinion either because of the presence of rodriguez who was now obsequious as well as malicious or because he took it for granted that they knew already what was to be known  of course he said with a shrug of his shoulders when terence asked him is she very ill  they were both conscious of a certain sense of relief when dr lesage was gone leaving explicit directions and promising another visit in a few hours time but unfortunately the rise of their spirits led them to talk more than usual and in talking they quarrelled they quarrelled about a road the portsmouth road st john said that it is macadamised where it passes hindhead and terence knew as well as he knew his own name that it is not macadamised at that point in the course of the argument they said some very sharp things to each other and the rest of the dinner was eaten in silence save for an occasional halfstifled reflection from ridley  when it grew dark and the lamps were brought in terence felt unable to control his irritation any longer st john went to bed in a state of complete exhaustion bidding terence goodnight with rather more affection than usual because of their quarrel and ridley retired to his books left alone terence walked up and down the room he stood at the open window  the lights were coming out one after another in the town beneath and it was very peaceful and cool in the garden so that he stepped out on to the terrace as he stood there in the darkness able only to see the shapes of trees through the fine grey light he was overcome by a desire to escape to have done with this suffering to forget that rachel was ill he allowed himself to lapse into forgetfulness of everything as if a wind that had been raging incessantly suddenly fell asleep the fret and strain and anxiety which had been pressing on him passed away he seemed to stand in an unvexed space of air on a little island by himself he was free and immune from pain it did not matter whether rachel was well or ill it did not matter whether they were apart or together nothing matterednothing mattered the waves beat on the shore far away and the soft wind passed through the branches of the trees seeming to encircle him with peace and security with dark and nothingness surely the world of strife and fret and anxiety was not the real world but this was the real world the world that lay beneath the superficial world so that whatever happened one was secure the quiet and peace seemed to lap his body in a fine cool sheet soothing every nerve his mind seemed once more to expand and become natural  but when he had stood thus for a time a noise in the house roused him he turned instinctively and went into the drawingroom the sight of the lamplit room brought back so abruptly all that he had forgotten that he stood for a moment unable to move he remembered everything the hour the minute even what point they had reached and what was to come he cursed himself for making believe for a minute that things were different from what they are the night was now harder to face than ever  unable to stay in the empty drawingroom he wandered out and sat on the stairs halfway up to rachels room he longed for some one to talk to but hirst was asleep and ridley was asleep there was no sound in rachels room the only sound in the house was the sound of chailey moving in the kitchen at last there was a rustling on the stairs overhead and nurse mcinnis came down fastening the links in her cuffs in preparation for the nights watch terence rose and stopped her he had scarcely spoken to her but it was possible that she might confirm him in the belief which still persisted in his own mind that rachel was not seriously ill he told her in a whisper that dr lesage had been and what he had said  now nurse he whispered please tell me your opinion do you consider that she is very seriously ill is she in any danger  the doctor has said she began  yes but i want your opinion you have had experience of many cases like this  i could not tell you more than dr lesage mr hewet she replied cautiously as though her words might be used against her the case is serious but you may feel quite certain that we are doing all we can for miss vinrace she spoke with some professional selfapprobation but she realised perhaps that she did not satisfy the young man who still blocked her way for she shifted her feet slightly upon the stair and looked out of the window where they could see the moon over the sea  if you ask me she began in a curiously stealthy tone i never like may for my patients  may terence repeated  it may be a fancy but i dont like to see anybody fall ill in may she continued things seem to go wrong in may perhaps its the moon they say the moon affects the brain dont they sir  he looked at her but he could not answer her like all the others when one looked at her she seemed to shrivel beneath ones eyes and become worthless malicious and untrustworthy  she slipped past him and disappeared  though he went to his room he was unable even to take his clothes off for a long time he paced up and down and then leaning out of the window gazed at the earth which lay so dark against the paler blue of the sky with a mixture of fear and loathing he looked at the slim black cypress trees which were still visible in the garden and heard the unfamiliar creaking and grating sounds which show that the earth is still hot all these sights and sounds appeared sinister and full of hostility and foreboding together with the natives and the nurse and the doctor and the terrible force of the illness itself they seemed to be in conspiracy against him they seemed to join together in their effort to extract the greatest possible amount of suffering from him he could not get used to his pain it was a revelation to him he had never realised before that underneath every action underneath the life of every day pain lies quiescent but ready to devour he seemed to be able to see suffering as if it were a fire curling up over the edges of all action eating away the lives of men and women he thought for the first time with understanding of words which had before seemed to him empty the struggle of life the hardness of life now he knew for himself that life is hard and full of suffering he looked at the scattered lights in the town beneath and thought of arthur and susan or evelyn and perrott venturing out unwittingly and by their happiness laying themselves open to suffering such as this how did they dare to love each other he wondered how had he himself dared to live as he had lived rapidly and carelessly passing from one thing to another loving rachel as he had loved her never again would he feel secure he would never believe in the stability of life or forget what depths of pain lie beneath small happiness and feelings of content and safety it seemed to him as he looked back that their happiness had never been so great as his pain was now there had always been something imperfect in their happiness something they had wanted and had not been able to get it had been fragmentary and incomplete because they were so young and had not known what they were doing  the light of his candle flickered over the boughs of a tree outside the window and as the branch swayed in the darkness there came before his mind a picture of all the world that lay outside his window he thought of the immense river and the immense forest the vast stretches of dry earth and the plains of the sea that encircled the earth from the sea the sky rose steep and enormous and the air washed profoundly between the sky and the sea how vast and dark it must be tonight lying exposed to the wind and in all this great space it was curious to think how few the towns were and how small little rings of light or single glowworms he figured them scattered here and there among the swelling uncultivated folds of the world and in those towns were little men and women tiny men and women oh it was absurd when one thought of it to sit here in a little room suffering and caring what did anything matter rachel a tiny creature lay ill beneath him and here in his little room he suffered on her account the nearness of their bodies in this vast universe and the minuteness of their bodies seemed to him absurd and laughable nothing mattered he repeated they had no power no hope he leant on the windowsill thinking until he almost forgot the time and the place nevertheless although he was convinced that it was absurd and laughable and that they were small and hopeless he never lost the sense that these thoughts somehow formed part of a life which he and rachel would live together  owing perhaps to the change of doctor rachel appeared to be rather better next day terribly pale and worn though helen looked there was a slight lifting of the cloud which had hung all these days in her eyes  she talked to me she said voluntarily she asked me what day of the week it was like herself  then suddenly without any warning or any apparent reason the tears formed in her eyes and rolled steadily down her cheeks she cried with scarcely any attempt at movement of her features and without any attempt to stop herself as if she did not know that she was crying in spite of the relief which her words gave him terence was dismayed by the sight had everything given way were there no limits to the power of this illness would everything go down before it helen had always seemed to him strong and determined and now she was like a child he took her in his arms and she clung to him like a child crying softly and quietly upon his shoulder then she roused herself and wiped her tears away it was silly to behave like that she said very silly she repeated when there could be no doubt that rachel was better she asked terence to forgive her for her folly she stopped at the door and came back and kissed him without saying anything  on this day indeed rachel was conscious of what went on round her she had come to the surface of the dark sticky pool and a wave seemed to bear her up and down with it she had ceased to have any will of her own she lay on the top of the wave conscious of some pain but chiefly of weakness the wave was replaced by the side of a mountain her body became a drift of melting snow above which her knees rose in huge peaked mountains of bare bone it was true that she saw helen and saw her room but everything had become very pale and semitransparent sometimes she could see through the wall in front of her sometimes when helen went away she seemed to go so far that rachels eyes could hardly follow her the room also had an odd power of expanding and though she pushed her voice out as far as possible until sometimes it became a bird and flew away she thought it doubtful whether it ever reached the person she was talking to there were immense intervals or chasms for things still had the power to appear visibly before her between one moment and the next it sometimes took an hour for helen to raise her arm pausing long between each jerky movement and pour out medicine helens form stooping to raise her in bed appeared of gigantic size and came down upon her like the ceiling falling but for long spaces of time she would merely lie conscious of her body floating on the top of the bed and her mind driven to some remote corner of her body or escaped and gone flitting round the room all sights were something of an effort but the sight of terence was the greatest effort because he forced her to join mind to body in the desire to remember something she did not wish to remember it troubled her when people tried to disturb her loneliness she wished to be alone she wished for nothing else in the world  although she had cried terence observed helens greater hopefulness with something like triumph in the argument between them she had made the first sign of admitting herself in the wrong he waited for dr lesage to come down that afternoon with considerable anxiety but with the same certainty at the back of his mind that he would in time force them all to admit that they were in the wrong  as usual dr lesage was sulky in his manner and very short in his answers to terences demand she seems to be better he replied looking at him in an odd way she has a chance of life  the door shut and terence walked across to the window he leant his forehead against the pane  rachel he repeated to himself she has a chance of life rachel  how could they say these things of rachel had any one yesterday seriously believed that rachel was dying they had been engaged for four weeks a fortnight ago she had been perfectly well what could fourteen days have done to bring her from that state to this to realise what they meant by saying that she had a chance of life was beyond him knowing as he did that they were engaged he turned still enveloped in the same dreary mist and walked towards the door suddenly he saw it all he saw the room and the garden and the trees moving in the air they could go on without her she could die for the first time since she fell ill he remembered exactly what she looked like and the way in which they cared for each other the immense happiness of feeling her close to him mingled with a more intense anxiety than he had felt yet he could not let her die he could not live without her but after a momentary struggle the curtain fell again and he saw nothing and felt nothing clearly it was all going ongoing on still in the same way as before save for a physical pain when his heart beat and the fact that his fingers were icy cold he did not realise that he was anxious about anything within his mind he seemed to feel nothing about rachel or about any one or anything in the world he went on giving orders arranging with mrs chailey writing out lists and every now and then he went upstairs and put something quietly on the table outside rachels door that night dr lesage seemed to be less sulky than usual he stayed voluntarily for a few moments and addressing st john and terence equally as if he did not remember which of them was engaged to the young lady said i consider that her condition tonight is very grave  neither of them went to bed or suggested that the other should go to bed they sat in the drawingroom playing picquet with the door open st john made up a bed upon the sofa and when it was ready insisted that terence should lie upon it they began to quarrel as to who should lie on the sofa and who should lie upon a couple of chairs covered with rugs st john forced terence at last to lie down upon the sofa  dont be a fool terence he said youll only get ill if you dont sleep  old fellow he began as terence still refused and stopped abruptly fearing sentimentality he found that he was on the verge of tears  he began to say what he had long been wanting to say that he was sorry for terence that he cared for him that he cared for rachel did she know how much he cared for herhad she said anything asked perhaps he was very anxious to say this but he refrained thinking that it was a selfish question after all and what was the use of bothering terence to talk about such things he was already half asleep but st john could not sleep at once if only he thought to himself as he lay in the darkness something would happenif only this strain would come to an end he did not mind what happened so long as the succession of these hard and dreary days was broken he did not mind if she died he felt himself disloyal in not minding it but it seemed to him that he had no feelings left  all night long there was no call or movement except the opening and shutting of the bedroom door once by degrees the light returned into the untidy room at six the servants began to move at seven they crept downstairs into the kitchen and half an hour later the day began again  nevertheless it was not the same as the days that had gone before although it would have been hard to say in what the difference consisted perhaps it was that they seemed to be waiting for something there were certainly fewer things to be done than usual people drifted through the drawingroommr flushing mr and mrs thornbury they spoke very apologetically in low tones refusing to sit down but remaining for a considerable time standing up although the only thing they had to say was is there anything we can do and there was nothing they could do  feeling oddly detached from it all terence remembered how helen had said that whenever anything happened to you this was how people behaved was she right or was she wrong he was too little interested to frame an opinion of his own he put things away in his mind as if one of these days he would think about them but not now the mist of unreality had deepened and deepened until it had produced a feeling of numbness all over his body was it his body were those really his own hands  this morning also for the first time ridley found it impossible to sit alone in his room he was very uncomfortable downstairs and as he did not know what was going on constantly in the way but he would not leave the drawingroom too restless to read and having nothing to do he began to pace up and down reciting poetry in an undertone occupied in various waysnow in undoing parcels now in uncorking bottles now in writing directions the sound of ridleys song and the beat of his pacing worked into the minds of terence and st john all the morning as a half comprehended refrain       they wrestled up they wrestled down        they wrestled sore and still      the fiend who blinds the eyes of men        that night he had his will       like stags full spent among the bent        they dropped awhile to rest  oh its intolerable hirst exclaimed and then checked himself as if it were a breach of their agreement again and again terence would creep halfway up the stairs in case he might be able to glean news of rachel but the only news now was of a very fragmentary kind she had drunk something she had slept a little she seemed quieter in the same way dr lesage confined himself to talking about details save once when he volunteered the information that he had just been called in to ascertain by severing a vein in the wrist that an old lady of eightyfive was really dead she had a horror of being buried alive  it is a horror he remarked that we generally find in the very old and seldom in the young they both expressed their interest in what he told them it seemed to them very strange another strange thing about the day was that the luncheon was forgotten by all of them until it was late in the afternoon and then mrs chailey waited on them and looked strange too because she wore a stiff print dress and her sleeves were rolled up above her elbows she seemed as oblivious of her appearance however as if she had been called out of her bed by a midnight alarm of fire and she had forgotten too her reserve and her composure she talked to them quite familiarly as if she had nursed them and held them naked on her knee she assured them over and over again that it was their duty to eat  the afternoon being thus shortened passed more quickly than they expected once mrs flushing opened the door but on seeing them shut it again quickly once helen came down to fetch something but she stopped as she left the room to look at a letter addressed to her she stood for a moment turning it over and the extraordinary and mournful beauty of her attitude struck terence in the way things struck him nowas something to be put away in his mind and to be thought about afterwards they scarcely spoke the argument between them seeming to be suspended or forgotten  now that the afternoon sun had left the front of the house ridley paced up and down the terrace repeating stanzas of a long poem in a subdued but suddenly sonorous voice fragments of the poem were wafted in at the open window as he passed and repassed       peor and baalim        forsake their temples dim      with that twice batterd god of palestine        and mooned astaroth  the sound of these words were strangely discomforting to both the young men but they had to be borne as the evening drew on and the red light of the sunset glittered far away on the sea the same sense of desperation attacked both terence and st john at the thought that the day was nearly over and that another night was at hand the appearance of one light after another in the town beneath them produced in hirst a repetition of his terrible and disgusting desire to break down and sob then the lamps were brought in by chailey she explained that maria in opening a bottle had been so foolish as to cut her arm badly but she had bound it up it was unfortunate when there was so much work to be done chailey herself limped because of the rheumatism in her feet but it appeared to her mere waste of time to take any notice of the unruly flesh of servants the evening went on dr lesage arrived unexpectedly and stayed upstairs a very long time he came down once and drank a cup of coffee  she is very ill he said in answer to ridleys question all the annoyance had by this time left his manner he was grave and formal but at the same time it was full of consideration which had not marked it before he went upstairs again the three men sat together in the drawingroom ridley was quite quiet now and his attention seemed to be thoroughly awakened save for little halfvoluntary movements and exclamations that were stifled at once they waited in complete silence it seemed as if they were at last brought together face to face with something definite  it was nearly eleven oclock when dr lesage again appeared in the room he approached them very slowly and did not speak at once he looked first at st john and then at terence and said to terence mr hewet i think you should go upstairs now  terence rose immediately leaving the others seated with dr lesage standing motionless between them  chailey was in the passage outside repeating over and over again its wickedits wicked  terence paid her no attention he heard what she was saying but it conveyed no meaning to his mind all the way upstairs he kept saying to himself this has not happened to me it is not possible that this has happened to me  he looked curiously at his own hand on the banisters the stairs were very steep and it seemed to take him a long time to surmount them instead of feeling keenly as he knew that he ought to feel he felt nothing at all when he opened the door he saw helen sitting by the bedside there were shaded lights on the table and the room though it seemed to be full of a great many things was very tidy there was a faint and not unpleasant smell of disinfectants helen rose and gave up her chair to him in silence as they passed each other their eyes met in a peculiar level glance he wondered at the extraordinary clearness of his eyes and at the deep calm and sadness that dwelt in them he sat down by the bedside and a moment afterwards heard the door shut gently behind her he was alone with rachel and a faint reflection of the sense of relief that they used to feel when they were left alone possessed him he looked at her he expected to find some terrible change in her but there was none she looked indeed very thin and as far as he could see very tired but she was the same as she had always been moreover she saw him and knew him she smiled at him and said hullo terence  the curtain which had been drawn between them for so long vanished immediately  well rachel he replied in his usual voice upon which she opened her eyes quite widely and smiled with her familiar smile he kissed her and took her hand  its been wretched without you he said  she still looked at him and smiled but soon a slight look of fatigue or perplexity came into her eyes and she shut them again  but when were together were perfectly happy he said he continued to hold her hand  the light being dim it was impossible to see any change in her face an immense feeling of peace came over terence so that he had no wish to move or to speak the terrible torture and unreality of the last days were over and he had come out now into perfect certainty and peace his mind began to work naturally again and with great ease the longer he sat there the more profoundly was he conscious of the peace invading every corner of his soul once he held his breath and listened acutely she was still breathing he went on thinking for some time they seemed to be thinking together he seemed to be rachel as well as himself and then he listened again no she had ceased to breathe so much the betterthis was death it was nothing it was to cease to breathe it was happiness it was perfect happiness they had now what they had always wanted to have the union which had been impossible while they lived unconscious whether he thought the words or spoke them aloud he said no two people have ever been so happy as we have been no one has ever loved as we have loved  it seemed to him that their complete union and happiness filled the room with rings eddying more and more widely he had no wish in the world left unfulfilled they possessed what could never be taken from them  he was not conscious that any one had come into the room but later moments later or hours later perhaps he felt an arm behind him the arms were round him he did not want to have arms round him and the mysterious whispering voices annoyed him he laid rachels hand which was now cold upon the counterpane and rose from his chair and walked across to the window the windows were uncurtained and showed the moon and a long silver pathway upon the surface of the waves  why he said in his ordinary tone of voice look at the moon theres a halo round the moon we shall have rain tomorrow  the arms whether they were the arms of man or of woman were round him again they were pushing him gently towards the door he turned of his own accord and walked steadily in advance of the arms conscious of a little amusement at the strange way in which people behaved merely because some one was dead he would go if they wished it but nothing they could do would disturb his happiness  as he saw the passage outside the room and the table with the cups and the plates it suddenly came over him that here was a world in which he would never see rachel again  rachel rachel he shrieked trying to rush back to her but they prevented him and pushed him down the passage and into a bedroom far from her room downstairs they could hear the thud of his feet on the floor as he struggled to break free and twice they heard him shout rachel rachel      chapter xxvi   for two or three hours longer the moon poured its light through the empty air unbroken by clouds it fell straightly and lay almost like a chill white frost over the sea and the earth during these hours the silence was not broken and the only movement was caused by the movement of trees and branches which stirred slightly and then the shadows that lay across the white spaces of the land moved too in this profound silence one sound only was audible the sound of a slight but continuous breathing which never ceased although it never rose and never fell it continued after the birds had begun to flutter from branch to branch and could be heard behind the first thin notes of their voices it continued all through the hours when the east whitened and grew red and a faint blue tinged the sky but when the sun rose it ceased and gave place to other sounds  the first sounds that were heard were little inarticulate cries the cries it seemed of children or of the very poor of people who were very weak or in pain but when the sun was above the horizon the air which had been thin and pale grew every moment richer and warmer and the sounds of life became bolder and more full of courage and authority by degrees the smoke began to ascend in wavering breaths over the houses and these slowly thickened until they were as round and straight as columns and instead of striking upon pale white blinds the sun shone upon dark windows beyond which there was depth and space  the sun had been up for many hours and the great dome of air was warmed through and glittering with thin gold threads of sunlight before any one moved in the hotel white and massive it stood in the early light half asleep with its blinds down  at about halfpast nine miss allan came very slowly into the hall and walked very slowly to the table where the morning papers were laid but she did not put out her hand to take one she stood still thinking with her head a little sunk upon her shoulders she looked curiously old and from the way in which she stood a little hunched together and very massive you could see what she would be like when she was really old how she would sit day after day in her chair looking placidly in front of her other people began to come into the room and to pass her but she did not speak to any of them or even look at them and at last as if it were necessary to do something she sat down in a chair and looked quietly and fixedly in front of her she felt very old this morning and useless too as if her life had been a failure as if it had been hard and laborious to no purpose she did not want to go on living and yet she knew that she would she was so strong that she would live to be a very old woman she would probably live to be eighty and as she was now fifty that left thirty years more for her to live she turned her hands over and over in her lap and looked at them curiously her old hands that had done so much work for her there did not seem to be much point in it all one went on of course one went on    she looked up to see mrs thornbury standing beside her with lines drawn upon her forehead and her lips parted as if she were about to ask a question  miss allan anticipated her  yes she said she died this morning very early about three oclock  mrs thornbury made a little exclamation drew her lips together and the tears rose in her eyes through them she looked at the hall which was now laid with great breadths of sunlight and at the careless casual groups of people who were standing beside the solid armchairs and tables they looked to her unreal or as people look who remain unconscious that some great explosion is about to take place beside them but there was no explosion and they went on standing by the chairs and the tables mrs thornbury no longer saw them but penetrating through them as though they were without substance she saw the house the people in the house the room the bed in the room and the figure of the dead lying still in the dark beneath the sheets she could almost see the dead she could almost hear the voices of the mourners  they expected it she asked at length  miss allan could only shake her head  i know nothing she replied except what mrs flushings maid told me she died early this morning  the two women looked at each other with a quiet significant gaze and then feeling oddly dazed and seeking she did not know exactly what mrs thornbury went slowly upstairs and walked quietly along the passages touching the wall with her fingers as if to guide herself housemaids were passing briskly from room to room but mrs thornbury avoided them she hardly saw them they seemed to her to be in another world she did not even look up directly when evelyn stopped her it was evident that evelyn had been lately in tears and when she looked at mrs thornbury she began to cry again together they drew into the hollow of a window and stood there in silence broken words formed themselves at last among evelyns sobs it was wicked she sobbed it was cruelthey were so happy  mrs thornbury patted her on the shoulder  it seems hardvery hard she said she paused and looked out over the slope of the hill at the ambroses villa the windows were blazing in the sun and she thought how the soul of the dead had passed from those windows something had passed from the world it seemed to her strangely empty  and yet the older one grows she continued her eyes regaining more than their usual brightness the more certain one becomes that there is a reason how could one go on if there were no reason she asked  she asked the question of some one but she did not ask it of evelyn evelyns sobs were becoming quieter there must be a reason she said it cant only be an accident for it was an accidentit need never have happened  mrs thornbury sighed deeply  but we must not let ourselves think of that she added and let us hope that they dont either whatever they had done it might have been the same these terrible illnesses  theres no reasoni dont believe theres any reason at all evelyn broke out pulling the blind down and letting it fly back with a little snap  why should these things happen why should people suffer i honestly believe she went on lowering her voice slightly that rachels in heaven but terence     whats the good of it all she demanded  mrs thornbury shook her head slightly but made no reply and pressing evelyns hand she went on down the passage impelled by a strong desire to hear something although she did not know exactly what there was to hear she was making her way to the flushings room as she opened their door she felt that she had interrupted some argument between husband and wife mrs flushing was sitting with her back to the light and mr flushing was standing near her arguing and trying to persuade her of something  ah here is mrs thornbury he began with some relief in his voice you have heard of course my wife feels that she was in some way responsible she urged poor miss vinrace to come on the expedition im sure you will agree with me that it is most unreasonable to feel that we dont even knowin fact i think it most unlikelythat she caught her illness there these diseasesbesides she was set on going she would have gone whether you asked her or not alice  dont wilfrid said mrs flushing neither moving nor taking her eyes off the spot on the floor upon which they rested whats the use of talking whats the use she ceased  i was coming to ask you said mrs thornbury addressing wilfrid for it was useless to speak to his wife is there anything you think that one could do has the father arrived could one go and see  the strongest wish in her being at this moment was to be able to do something for the unhappy peopleto see themto assure themto help them it was dreadful to be so far away from them but mr flushing shook his head he did not think that nowlater perhaps one might be able to help here mrs flushing rose stiffly turned her back to them and walked to the dressingroom opposite as she walked they could see her breast slowly rise and slowly fall but her grief was silent she shut the door behind her  when she was alone by herself she clenched her fists together and began beating the back of a chair with them she was like a wounded animal she hated death she was furious outraged indignant with death as if it were a living creature she refused to relinquish her friends to death she would not submit to dark and nothingness she began to pace up and down clenching her hands and making no attempt to stop the quick tears which raced down her cheeks she sat still at last but she did not submit she looked stubborn and strong when she had ceased to cry  in the next room meanwhile wilfrid was talking to mrs thornbury with greater freedom now that his wife was not sitting there  thats the worst of these places he said people will behave as though they were in england and theyre not ive no doubt myself that miss vinrace caught the infection up at the villa itself she probably ran risks a dozen times a day that might have given her the illness its absurd to say she caught it with us  if he had not been sincerely sorry for them he would have been annoyed pepper tells me he continued that he left the house because he thought them so careless he says they never washed their vegetables properly poor people its a fearful price to pay but its only what ive seen over and over againpeople seem to forget that these things happen and then they do happen and theyre surprised  mrs thornbury agreed with him that they had been very careless and that there was no reason whatever to think that she had caught the fever on the expedition and after talking about other things for a short time she left him and went sadly along the passage to her own room there must be some reason why such things happen she thought to herself as she shut the door only at first it was not easy to understand what it was it seemed so strangeso unbelievable why only three weeks agoonly a fortnight ago she had seen rachel when she shut her eyes she could almost see her now the quiet shy girl who was going to be married she thought of all that she would have missed had she died at rachels age the children the married life the unimaginable depths and miracles that seemed to her as she looked back to have lain about her day after day and year after year the stunned feeling which had been making it difficult for her to think gradually gave way to a feeling of the opposite nature she thought very quickly and very clearly and looking back over all her experiences tried to fit them into a kind of order there was undoubtedly much suffering much struggling but on the whole surely there was a balance of happinesssurely order did prevail nor were the deaths of young people really the saddest things in lifethey were saved so much they kept so much the deadshe called to mind those who had died early accidentallywere beautiful she often dreamt of the dead and in time terence himself would come to feelshe got up and began to wander restlessly about the room  for an old woman of her age she was very restless and for one of her clear quick mind she was unusually perplexed she could not settle to anything so that she was relieved when the door opened she went up to her husband took him in her arms and kissed him with unusual intensity and then as they sat down together she began to pat him and question him as if he were a baby an old tired querulous baby she did not tell him about miss vinraces death for that would only disturb him and he was put out already she tried to discover why he was uneasy politics again what were those horrid people doing she spent the whole morning in discussing politics with her husband and by degrees she became deeply interested in what they were saying but every now and then what she was saying seemed to her oddly empty of meaning  at luncheon it was remarked by several people that the visitors at the hotel were beginning to leave there were fewer every day there were only forty people at luncheon instead of the sixty that there had been so old mrs paley computed gazing about her with her faded eyes as she took her seat at her own table in the window her party generally consisted of mr perrott as well as arthur and susan and today evelyn was lunching with them also  she was unusually subdued having noticed that her eyes were red and guessing the reason the others took pains to keep up an elaborate conversation between themselves she suffered it to go on for a few minutes leaning both elbows on the table and leaving her soup untouched when she exclaimed suddenly i dont know how you feel but i can simply think of nothing else  the gentlemen murmured sympathetically and looked grave  susan replied yesisnt it perfectly awful when you think what a nice girl she wasonly just engaged and this need never have happenedit seems too tragic she looked at arthur as though he might be able to help her with something more suitable  hard lines said arthur briefly but it was a foolish thing to doto go up that river he shook his head they should have known better you cant expect englishwomen to stand roughing it as the natives do whove been acclimatised id half a mind to warn them at tea that day when it was being discussed but its no good saying these sort of thingsit only puts peoples backs upit never makes any difference  old mrs paley hitherto contented with her soup here intimated by raising one hand to her ear that she wished to know what was being said  you heard aunt emma that poor miss vinrace has died of the fever susan informed her gently she could not speak of death loudly or even in her usual voice so that mrs paley did not catch a word arthur came to the rescue  miss vinrace is dead he said very distinctly  mrs paley merely bent a little towards him and asked eh  miss vinrace is dead he repeated it was only by stiffening all the muscles round his mouth that he could prevent himself from bursting into laughter and forced himself to repeat for the third time miss vinrace    shes dead  let alone the difficulty of hearing the exact words facts that were outside her daily experience took some time to reach mrs paleys consciousness a weight seemed to rest upon her brain impeding though not damaging its action she sat vagueeyed for at least a minute before she realised what arthur meant  dead she said vaguely miss vinrace dead dear me    thats very sad but i dont at the moment remember which she was we seem to have made so many new acquaintances here she looked at susan for help a tall dark girl who just missed being handsome with a high colour  no susan interposed she was then she gave it up in despair there was no use in explaining that mrs paley was thinking of the wrong person  she ought not to have died mrs paley continued she looked so strong but people will drink the water i can never make out why it seems such a simple thing to tell them to put a bottle of seltzer water in your bedroom thats all the precaution ive ever taken and ive been in every part of the world i may sayitaly a dozen times over    but young people always think they know better and then they pay the penalty poor thingi am very sorry for her but the difficulty of peering into a dish of potatoes and helping herself engrossed her attention  arthur and susan both secretly hoped that the subject was now disposed of for there seemed to them something unpleasant in this discussion but evelyn was not ready to let it drop why would people never talk about the things that mattered  i dont believe you care a bit she said turning savagely upon mr perrott who had sat all this time in silence  i oh yes i do he answered awkwardly but with obvious sincerity evelyns questions made him too feel uncomfortable  it seems so inexplicable evelyn continued death i mean why should she be dead and not you or i it was only a fortnight ago that she was here with the rest of us what dyou believe she demanded of mr perrott dyou believe that things go on that shes still somewhereor dyou think its simply a gamewe crumble up to nothing when we die im positive rachels not dead  mr perrott would have said almost anything that evelyn wanted him to say but to assert that he believed in the immortality of the soul was not in his power he sat silent more deeply wrinkled than usual crumbling his bread  lest evelyn should next ask him what he believed arthur after making a pause equivalent to a full stop started a completely different topic  supposing he said a man were to write and tell you that he wanted five pounds because he had known your grandfather what would you do it was this way my grandfather  invented a stove said evelyn i know all about that we had one in the conservatory to keep the plants warm  didnt know i was so famous said arthur well he continued determined at all costs to spin his story out at length the old chap being about the second best inventor of his day and a capable lawyer too died as they always do without making a will now fielding his clerk with how much justice i dont know always claimed that he meant to do something for him the poor old boys come down in the world through trying inventions on his own account lives in penge over a tobacconists shop ive been to see him there the question ismust i stump up or not what does the abstract spirit of justice require perrott remember i didnt benefit under my grandfathers will and ive no way of testing the truth of the story  i dont know much about the abstract spirit of justice said susan smiling complacently at the others but im certain of one thinghell get his five pounds  as mr perrott proceeded to deliver an opinion and evelyn insisted that he was much too stingy like all lawyers thinking of the letter and not of the spirit while mrs paley required to be kept informed between the courses as to what they were all saying the luncheon passed with no interval of silence and arthur congratulated himself upon the tact with which the discussion had been smoothed over  as they left the room it happened that mrs paleys wheeled chair ran into the elliots who were coming through the door as she was going out brought thus to a standstill for a moment arthur and susan congratulated hughling elliot upon his convalescencehe was down cadaverous enough for the first timeand mr perrott took occasion to say a few words in private to evelyn  would there be any chance of seeing you this afternoon about threethirty say i shall be in the garden by the fountain  the block dissolved before evelyn answered but as she left them in the hall she looked at him brightly and said halfpast three did you say thatll suit me  she ran upstairs with the feeling of spiritual exaltation and quickened life which the prospect of an emotional scene always aroused in her that mr perrott was again about to propose to her she had no doubt and she was aware that on this occasion she ought to be prepared with a definite answer for she was going away in three days time but she could not bring her mind to bear upon the question to come to a decision was very difficult to her because she had a natural dislike of anything final and done with she liked to go on and onalways on and on she was leaving and therefore she occupied herself in laying her clothes out side by side upon the bed she observed that some were very shabby she took the photograph of her father and mother and before she laid it away in her box she held it for a minute in her hand rachel had looked at it suddenly the keen feeling of some ones personality which things that they have owned or handled sometimes preserves overcame her she felt rachel in the room with her it was as if she were on a ship at sea and the life of the day was as unreal as the land in the distance but by degrees the feeling of rachels presence passed away and she could no longer realise her for she had scarcely known her but this momentary sensation left her depressed and fatigued what had she done with her life what future was there before her what was makebelieve and what was real were these proposals and intimacies and adventures real or was the contentment which she had seen on the faces of susan and rachel more real than anything she had ever felt  she made herself ready to go downstairs absentmindedly but her fingers were so well trained that they did the work of preparing her almost of their own accord when she was actually on the way downstairs the blood began to circle through her body of its own accord too for her mind felt very dull  mr perrott was waiting for her indeed he had gone straight into the garden after luncheon and had been walking up and down the path for more than half an hour in a state of acute suspense  im late as usual she exclaimed as she caught sight of him well you must forgive me i had to pack up    my word it looks stormy and thats a new steamer in the bay isnt it  she looked at the bay in which a steamer was just dropping anchor the smoke still hanging about it while a swift black shudder ran through the waves ones quite forgotten what rain looks like she added  but mr perrott paid no attention to the steamer or to the weather  miss murgatroyd he began with his usual formality i asked you to come here from a very selfish motive i fear i do not think you need to be assured once more of my feelings but as you are leaving so soon i felt that i could not let you go without asking you to tell mehave i any reason to hope that you will ever come to care for me  he was very pale and seemed unable to say any more  the little gush of vitality which had come into evelyn as she ran downstairs had left her and she felt herself impotent there was nothing for her to say she felt nothing now that he was actually asking her in his elderly gentle words to marry him she felt less for him than she had ever felt before  lets sit down and talk it over she said rather unsteadily  mr perrott followed her to a curved green seat under a tree they looked at the fountain in front of them which had long ceased to play evelyn kept looking at the fountain instead of thinking of what she was saying the fountain without any water seemed to be the type of her own being  of course i care for you she began rushing her words out in a hurry i should be a brute if i didnt i think youre quite one of the nicest people ive ever known and one of the finest too but i wish    i wish you didnt care for me in that way are you sure you do for the moment she honestly desired that he should say no  quite sure said mr perrott  you see im not as simple as most women evelyn continued i think i want more i dont know exactly what i feel  he sat by her watching her and refraining from speech  i sometimes think i havent got it in me to care very much for one person only some one else would make you a better wife i can imagine you very happy with some one else  if you think that there is any chance that you will come to care for me i am quite content to wait said mr perrott  welltheres no hurry is there said evelyn suppose i thought it over and wrote and told you when i get back im going to moscow ill write from moscow  but mr perrott persisted  you cannot give me any kind of idea i do not ask for a date    that would be most unreasonable he paused looking down at the gravel path  as she did not immediately answer he went on  i know very well that i am notthat i have not much to offer you either in myself or in my circumstances and i forget it cannot seem the miracle to you that it does to me until i met you i had gone on in my own quiet waywe are both very quiet people my sister and iquite content with my lot my friendship with arthur was the most important thing in my life now that i know you all that has changed you seem to put such a spirit into everything life seems to hold so many possibilities that i had never dreamt of  thats splendid evelyn exclaimed grasping his hand now youll go back and start all kinds of things and make a great name in the world and well go on being friends whatever happens    well be great friends wont we  evelyn he moaned suddenly and took her in his arms and kissed her she did not resent it although it made little impression on her  as she sat upright again she said i never see why one shouldnt go on being friendsthough some people do and friendships do make a difference dont they they are the kind of things that matter in ones life  he looked at her with a bewildered expression as if he did not really understand what she was saying with a considerable effort he collected himself stood up and said now i think i have told you what i feel and i will only add that i can wait as long as ever you wish  left alone evelyn walked up and down the path what did matter than what was the meaning of it all      chapter xxvii   all that evening the clouds gathered until they closed entirely over the blue of the sky they seemed to narrow the space between earth and heaven so that there was no room for the air to move in freely and the waves too lay flat and yet rigid as if they were restrained the leaves on the bushes and trees in the garden hung closely together and the feeling of pressure and restraint was increased by the short chirping sounds which came from birds and insects  so strange were the lights and the silence that the busy hum of voices which usually filled the diningroom at meal times had distinct gaps in it and during these silences the clatter of the knives upon plates became audible the first roll of thunder and the first heavy drop striking the pane caused a little stir  its coming was said simultaneously in many different languages  there was then a profound silence as if the thunder had withdrawn into itself people had just begun to eat again when a gust of cold air came through the open windows lifting tablecloths and skirts a light flashed and was instantly followed by a clap of thunder right over the hotel the rain swished with it and immediately there were all those sounds of windows being shut and doors slamming violently which accompany a storm  the room grew suddenly several degrees darker for the wind seemed to be driving waves of darkness across the earth no one attempted to eat for a time but sat looking out at the garden with their forks in the air the flashes now came frequently lighting up faces as if they were going to be photographed surprising them in tense and unnatural expressions the clap followed close and violently upon them several women half rose from their chairs and then sat down again but dinner was continued uneasily with eyes upon the garden the bushes outside were ruffled and whitened and the wind pressed upon them so that they seemed to stoop to the ground the waiters had to press dishes upon the diners notice and the diners had to draw the attention of waiters for they were all absorbed in looking at the storm as the thunder showed no signs of withdrawing but seemed massed right overhead while the lightning aimed straight at the garden every time an uneasy gloom replaced the first excitement  finishing the meal very quickly people congregated in the hall where they felt more secure than in any other place because they could retreat far from the windows and although they heard the thunder they could not see anything a little boy was carried away sobbing in the arms of his mother  while the storm continued no one seemed inclined to sit down but they collected in little groups under the central skylight where they stood in a yellow atmosphere looking upwards now and again their faces became white as the lightning flashed and finally a terrific crash came making the panes of the skylight lift at the joints  ah several voices exclaimed at the same moment  something struck said a mans voice  the rain rushed down the rain seemed now to extinguish the lightning and the thunder and the hall became almost dark  after a minute or two when nothing was heard but the rattle of water upon the glass there was a perceptible slackening of the sound and then the atmosphere became lighter  its over said another voice  at a touch all the electric lights were turned on and revealed a crowd of people all standing all looking with rather strained faces up at the skylight but when they saw each other in the artificial light they turned at once and began to move away for some minutes the rain continued to rattle upon the skylight and the thunder gave another shake or two but it was evident from the clearing of the darkness and the light drumming of the rain upon the roof that the great confused ocean of air was travelling away from them and passing high over head with its clouds and its rods of fire out to sea the building which had seemed so small in the tumult of the storm now became as square and spacious as usual  as the storm drew away the people in the hall of the hotel sat down and with a comfortable sense of relief began to tell each other stories about great storms and produced in many cases their occupations for the evening the chessboard was brought out and mr elliot who wore a stock instead of a collar as a sign of convalescence but was otherwise much as usual challenged mr pepper to a final contest round them gathered a group of ladies with pieces of needlework or in default of needlework with novels to superintend the game much as if they were in charge of two small boys playing marbles every now and then they looked at the board and made some encouraging remark to the gentlemen  mrs paley just round the corner had her cards arranged in long ladders before her with susan sitting near to sympathise but not to correct and the merchants and the miscellaneous people who had never been discovered to possess names were stretched in their armchairs with their newspapers on their knees the conversation in these circumstances was very gentle fragmentary and intermittent but the room was full of the indescribable stir of life every now and then the moth which was now grey of wing and shiny of thorax whizzed over their heads and hit the lamps with a thud  a young woman put down her needlework and exclaimed poor creature it would be kinder to kill it but nobody seemed disposed to rouse himself in order to kill the moth they watched it dash from lamp to lamp because they were comfortable and had nothing to do  on the sofa beside the chessplayers mrs elliot was imparting a new stitch in knitting to mrs thornbury so that their heads came very near together and were only to be distinguished by the old lace cap which mrs thornbury wore in the evening mrs elliot was an expert at knitting and disclaimed a compliment to that effect with evident pride  i suppose were all proud of something she said and im proud of my knitting i think things like that run in families we all knit well i had an uncle who knitted his own socks to the day of his deathand he did it better than any of his daughters dear old gentleman now i wonder that you miss allan who use your eyes so much dont take up knitting in the evenings youd find it such a relief i should saysuch a rest to the eyesand the bazaars are so glad of things her voice dropped into the smooth halfconscious tone of the expert knitter the words came gently one after another as much as i do i can always dispose of which is a comfort for then i feel that i am not wasting my time  miss allan being thus addressed shut her novel and observed the others placidly for a time at last she said it is surely not natural to leave your wife because she happens to be in love with you but thatas far as i can make outis what the gentleman in my story does  tut tut that doesnt sound goodno that doesnt sound at all natural murmured the knitters in their absorbed voices  still its the kind of book people call very clever miss allan added  maternityby michael jessopi presume mr elliot put in for he could never resist the temptation of talking while he played chess  dyou know said mrs elliot after a moment i dont think people do write good novels nownot as good as they used to anyhow  no one took the trouble to agree with her or to disagree with her arthur venning who was strolling about sometimes looking at the game sometimes reading a page of a magazine looked at miss allan who was half asleep and said humorously a penny for your thoughts miss allan  the others looked up they were glad that he had not spoken to them but miss allan replied without any hesitation i was thinking of my imaginary uncle hasnt every one got an imaginary uncle she continued i have onea most delightful old gentleman hes always giving me things sometimes its a gold watch sometimes its a carriage and pair sometimes its a beautiful little cottage in the new forest sometimes its a ticket to the place i most want to see  she set them all thinking vaguely of the things they wanted mrs elliot knew exactly what she wanted she wanted a child and the usual little pucker deepened on her brow  were such lucky people she said looking at her husband we really have no wants she was apt to say this partly in order to convince herself and partly in order to convince other people but she was prevented from wondering how far she carried conviction by the entrance of mr and mrs flushing who came through the hall and stopped by the chessboard mrs flushing looked wilder than ever a great strand of black hair looped down across her brow her cheeks were whipped a dark blood red and drops of rain made wet marks upon them  mr flushing explained that they had been on the roof watching the storm  it was a wonderful sight he said the lightning went right out over the sea and lit up the waves and the ships far away you cant think how wonderful the mountains looked too with the lights on them and the great masses of shadow its all over now  he slid down into a chair becoming interested in the final struggle of the game  and you go back tomorrow said mrs thornbury looking at mrs flushing  yes she replied  and indeed one is not sorry to go back said mrs elliot assuming an air of mournful anxiety after all this illness  are you afraid of dyin mrs flushing demanded scornfully  i think we are all afraid of that said mrs elliot with dignity  i suppose were all cowards when it comes to the point said mrs flushing rubbing her cheek against the back of the chair im sure i am  not a bit of it said mr flushing turning round for mr pepper took a very long time to consider his move its not cowardly to wish to live alice its the very reverse of cowardly personally id like to go on for a hundred yearsgranted of course that i had the full use of my faculties think of all the things that are bound to happen that is what i feel mrs thornbury rejoined the changes the improvements the inventionsand beauty dyou know i feel sometimes that i couldnt bear to die and cease to see beautiful things about me  it would certainly be very dull to die before they have discovered whether there is life in mars miss allan added  do you really believe theres life in mars asked mrs flushing turning to her for the first time with keen interest who tells you that some one who knows dyou know a man called  here mrs thornbury laid down her knitting and a look of extreme solicitude came into her eyes  there is mr hirst she said quietly  st john had just come through the swing door he was rather blown about by the wind and his cheeks looked terribly pale unshorn and cavernous after taking off his coat he was going to pass straight through the hall and up to his room but he could not ignore the presence of so many people he knew especially as mrs thornbury rose and went up to him holding out her hand but the shock of the warm lamplit room together with the sight of so many cheerful human beings sitting together at their ease after the dark walk in the rain and the long days of strain and horror overcame him completely he looked at mrs thornbury and could not speak  every one was silent mr peppers hand stayed upon his knight mrs thornbury somehow moved him to a chair sat herself beside him and with tears in her own eyes said gently you have done everything for your friend  her action set them all talking again as if they had never stopped and mr pepper finished the move with his knight  there was nothing to be done said st john he spoke very slowly it seems impossible  he drew his hand across his eyes as if some dream came between him and the others and prevented him from seeing where he was  and that poor fellow said mrs thornbury the tears falling again down her cheeks  impossible st john repeated  did he have the consolation of knowing mrs thornbury began very tentatively  but st john made no reply he lay back in his chair halfseeing the others halfhearing what they said he was terribly tired and the light and warmth the movements of the hands and the soft communicative voices soothed him they gave him a strange sense of quiet and relief as he sat there motionless this feeling of relief became a feeling of profound happiness without any sense of disloyalty to terence and rachel he ceased to think about either of them the movements and the voices seemed to draw together from different parts of the room and to combine themselves into a pattern before his eyes he was content to sit silently watching the pattern build itself up looking at what he hardly saw  the game was really a good one and mr pepper and mr elliot were becoming more and more set upon the struggle mrs thornbury seeing that st john did not wish to talk resumed her knitting  lightning again mrs flushing suddenly exclaimed a yellow light flashed across the blue window and for a second they saw the green trees outside she strode to the door pushed it open and stood half out in the open air  but the light was only the reflection of the storm which was over the rain had ceased the heavy clouds were blown away and the air was thin and clear although vapourish mists were being driven swiftly across the moon the sky was once more a deep and solemn blue and the shape of the earth was visible at the bottom of the air enormous dark and solid rising into the tapering mass of the mountain and pricked here and there on the slopes by the tiny lights of villas the driving air the drone of the trees and the flashing light which now and again spread a broad illumination over the earth filled mrs flushing with exultation her breasts rose and fell  splendid splendid she muttered to herself then she turned back into the hall and exclaimed in a peremptory voice come outside and see wilfrid its wonderful  some halfstirred some rose some dropped their balls of wool and began to stoop to look for them  to bedto bed said miss allan  it was the move with your queen that gave it away pepper exclaimed mr elliot triumphantly sweeping the pieces together and standing up he had won the game  what pepper beaten at last i congratulate you said arthur venning who was wheeling old mrs paley to bed  all these voices sounded gratefully in st johns ears as he lay halfasleep and yet vividly conscious of everything around him across his eyes passed a procession of objects black and indistinct the figures of people picking up their books their cards their balls of wool their workbaskets and passing him one after another on their way to bed
