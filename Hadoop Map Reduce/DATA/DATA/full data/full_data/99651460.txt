  xxv  through the forest primeval   xxvi  the passing of the apeman     chapter i  the affair on the liner   magnifique ejaculated the countess de coude beneath her breath  eh questioned the count turning toward his young wife  what is it that is magnificent and the count bent his eyes in various directions in quest of the object of her admiration  oh nothing at all my dear replied the countess a slight flush momentarily coloring her already pink cheek  i was but recalling with admiration those stupendous skyscrapers as they call them of new york and the fair countess settled herself more comfortably in her steamer chair and resumed the magazine which nothing at all had caused her to let fall upon her lap  her husband again buried himself in his book but not without a mild wonderment that three days out from new york his countess should suddenly have realized an admiration for the very buildings she had but recently characterized as horrid  presently the count put down his book  it is very tiresome olga he said  i think that i shall hunt up some others who may be equally bored and see if we cannot find enough for a game of cards  you are not very gallant my husband replied the young woman smiling but as i am equally bored i can forgive you  go and play at your tiresome old cards then if you will  when he had gone she let her eyes wander slyly to the figure of a tall young man stretched lazily in a chair not far distant  magnifique she breathed once more  the countess olga de coude was twenty  her husband forty  she was a very faithful and loyal wife but as she had had nothing whatever to do with the selection of a husband it is not at all unlikely that she was not wildly and passionately in love with the one that fate and her titled russian father had selected for her  however simply because she was surprised into a tiny exclamation of approval at sight of a splendid young stranger it must not be inferred therefrom that her thoughts were in any way disloyal to her spouse  she merely admired as she might have admired a particularly fine specimen of any species furthermore the young man was unquestionably good to look at  as her furtive glance rested upon his profile he rose to leave the deck  the countess de coude beckoned to a passing steward  who is that gentleman she asked  he is booked madam as monsieur tarzan of africa replied the steward  rather a large estate thought the girl but now her interest was still further aroused  as tarzan walked slowly toward the smokingroom he came unexpectedly upon two men whispering excitedly just without  he would have vouchsafed them not even a passing thought but for the strangely guilty glance that one of them shot in his direction  they reminded tarzan of melodramatic villains he had seen at the theaters in paris  both were very dark and this in connection with the shrugs and stealthy glances that accompanied their palpable intriguing lent still greater force to the similarity  tarzan entered the smokingroom and sought a chair a little apart from the others who were there  he felt in no mood for conversation and as he sipped his absinth he let his mind run rather sorrowfully over the past few weeks of his life  time and again he had wondered if he had acted wisely in renouncing his birthright to a man to whom he owed nothing  it is true that he liked clayton butah but that was not the question  it was not for william cecil clayton lord greystoke that he had denied his birth  it was for the woman whom both he and clayton had loved and whom a strange freak of fate had given to clayton instead of to him  that she loved him made the thing doubly difficult to bear yet he knew that he could have done nothing less than he did do that night within the little railway station in the far wisconsin woods  to him her happiness was the first consideration of all and his brief experience with civilization and civilized men had taught him that without money and position life to most of them was unendurable  jane porter had been born to both and had tarzan taken them away from her future husband it would doubtless have plunged her into a life of misery and torture  that she would have spurned clayton once he had been stripped of both his title and his estates never for once occurred to tarzan for he credited to others the same honest loyalty that was so inherent a quality in himself  nor in this instance had he erred could any one thing have further bound jane porter to her promise to clayton it would have been in the nature of some such misfortune as this overtaking him  tarzans thoughts drifted from the past to the future  he tried to look forward with pleasurable sensations to his return to the jungle of his birth and boyhood the cruel fierce jungle in which he had spent twenty of his twentytwo years  but who or what of all the myriad jungle life would there be to welcome his return  not one  only tantor the elephant could he call friend  the others would hunt him or flee from him as had been their way in the past  not even the apes of his own tribe would extend the hand of fellowship to him  if civilization had done nothing else for tarzan of the apes it had to some extent taught him to crave the society of his own kind and to feel with genuine pleasure the congenial warmth of companionship  and in the same ratio had it made any other life distasteful to him  it was difficult to imagine a world without a friendwithout a living thing who spoke the new tongues which tarzan had learned to love so well  and so it was that tarzan looked with little relish upon the future he had mapped out for himself  as he sat musing over his cigarette his eyes fell upon a mirror before him and in it he saw reflected a table at which four men sat at cards presently one of them rose to leave and then another approached and tarzan could see that he courteously offered to fill the vacant chair that the game might not be interrupted  he was the smaller of the two whom tarzan had seen whispering just outside the smokingroom  it was this fact that aroused a faint spark of interest in tarzan and so as he speculated upon the future he watched in the mirror the reflection of the players at the table behind him  aside from the man who had but just entered the game tarzan knew the name of but one of the other players  it was he who sat opposite the new player count raoul de coude whom an overattentive steward had pointed out as one of the celebrities of the passage describing him as a man high in the official family of the french minister of war  suddenly tarzans attention was riveted upon the picture in the glass the other swarthy plotter had entered and was standing behind the counts chair  tarzan saw him turn and glance furtively about the room but his eyes did not rest for a sufficient time upon the mirror to note the reflection of tarzans watchful eyes  stealthily the man withdrew something from his pocket  tarzan could not discern what the object was for the mans hand covered it  slowly the hand approached the count and then very deftly the thing that was in it was transferred to the counts pocket  the man remained standing where he could watch the frenchmans cards  tarzan was puzzled but he was all attention now nor did he permit another detail of the incident to escape him  the play went on for some ten minutes after this until the count won a considerable wager from him who had last joined the game and then tarzan saw the fellow back of the counts chair nod his head to his confederate  instantly the player arose and pointed a finger at the count  had i known that monsieur was a professional card sharp i had not been so ready to be drawn into the game he said  instantly the count and the two other players were upon their feet  de coudes face went white  what do you mean sir he cried  do you know to whom you speak  i know that i speak for the last time to one who cheats at cards replied the fellow  the count leaned across the table and struck the man full in the mouth with his open palm and then the others closed in between them  there is some mistake sir cried one of the other players  why this is count de coude of france if i am mistaken said the accuser i shall gladly apologize but before i do so first let monsieur le count explain the extra cards which i saw him drop into his side pocket  and then the man whom tarzan had seen drop them there turned to sneak from the room but to his annoyance he found the exit barred by a tall grayeyed stranger  pardon said the man brusquely attempting to pass to one side  wait said tarzan  but why monsieur exclaimed the other petulantly  permit me to pass monsieur  wait said tarzan  i think that there is a matter in here that you may doubtless be able to explain  the fellow had lost his temper by this time and with a low oath seized tarzan to push him to one side  the apeman but smiled as he twisted the big fellow about and grasping him by the collar of his coat escorted him back to the table struggling cursing and striking in futile remonstrance  it was nikolas rokoffs first experience with the muscles that had brought their savage owner victorious through encounters with numa the lion and terkoz the great bull ape  the man who had accused de coude and the two others who had been playing stood looking expectantly at the count  several other passengers had drawn toward the scene of the altercation and all awaited the denouement  the fellow is crazy said the count  gentlemen i implore that one of you search me  the accusation is ridiculous  this from one of the players  you have but to slip your hand in the counts coat pocket and you will see that the accusation is quite serious insisted the accuser  and then as the others still hesitated to do so come i shall do it myself if no other will and he stepped forward toward the count  no monsieur said de coude  i will submit to a search only at the hands of a gentleman  it is unnecessary to search the count  the cards are in his pocket i myself saw them placed there  all turned in surprise toward this new speaker to behold a very wellbuilt young man urging a resisting captive toward them by the scruff of his neck  it is a conspiracy cried de coude angrily  there are no cards in my coat and with that he ran his hand into his pocket  as he did so tense silence reigned in the little group  the count went dead white and then very slowly he withdrew his hand and in it were three cards  he looked at them in mute and horrified surprise and slowly the red of mortification suffused his face  expressions of pity and contempt tinged the features of those who looked on at the death of a mans honor  it is a conspiracy monsieur  it was the grayeyed stranger who spoke  gentlemen he continued monsieur le count did not know that those cards were in his pocket  they were placed there without his knowledge as he sat at play  from where i sat in that chair yonder i saw the reflection of it all in the mirror before me  this person whom i just intercepted in an effort to escape placed the cards in the counts pocket  de coude had glanced from tarzan to the man in his grasp  mon dieu nikolas he cried  you  then he turned to his accuser and eyed him intently for a moment  and you monsieur i did not recognize you without your beard  it quite disguises you paulvitch  i see it all now  it is quite clear gentlemen  what shall we do with them monsieur asked tarzan  turn them over to the captain  no my friend said the count hastily  it is a personal matter and i beg that you will let it drop  it is sufficient that i have been exonerated from the charge  the less we have to do with such fellows the better  but monsieur how can i thank you for the great kindness you have done me  permit me to offer you my card and should the time come when i may serve you remember that i am yours to command  tarzan had released rokoff who with his confederate paulvitch had hastened from the smokingroom  just as he was leaving rokoff turned to tarzan  monsieur will have ample opportunity to regret his interference in the affairs of others  tarzan smiled and then bowing to the count handed him his own card  the count read  m jean c tarzan   monsieur tarzan he said may indeed wish that he had never befriended me for i can assure him that he has won the enmity of two of the most unmitigated scoundrels in all europe  avoid them monsieur by all means  i have had more aweinspiring enemies my dear count replied tarzan with a quiet smile yet i am still alive and unworried  i think that neither of these two will ever find the means to harm me  let us hope not monsieur said de coude but yet it will do no harm to be on the alert and to know that you have made at least one enemy today who never forgets and never forgives and in whose malignant brain there are always hatching new atrocities to perpetrate upon those who have thwarted or offended him  to say that nikolas rokoff is a devil would be to place a wanton affront upon his satanic majesty  that night as tarzan entered his cabin he found a folded note upon the floor that had evidently been pushed beneath the door  he opened it and read  m tarzan  doubtless you did not realize the gravity of your offense or you would not have done the thing you did today  i am willing to believe that you acted in ignorance and without any intention to offend a stranger for this reason i shall gladly permit you to offer an apology and on receiving your assurances that you will not again interfere in affairs that do not concern you i shall drop the matter  otherwisebut i am sure that you will see the wisdom of adopting the course i suggest                                      very respectfully                                                 nikolas rokoff   tarzan permitted a grim smile to play about his lips for a moment then he promptly dropped the matter from his mind and went to bed  in a nearby cabin the countess de coude was speaking to her husband  why so grave my dear raoul she asked  you have been as glum as could be all evening  what worries you  olga nikolas is on board  did you know it  nikolas she exclaimed  but it is impossible raoul  it cannot be nikolas is under arrest in germany  so i thought myself until i saw him todayhim and that other arch scoundrel paulvitch  olga i cannot endure his persecution much longer  no not even for you  sooner or later i shall turn him over to the authorities  in fact i am half minded to explain all to the captain before we land  on a french liner it were an easy matter olga permanently to settle this nemesis of ours  oh no raoul cried the countess sinking to her knees before him as he sat with bowed head upon a divan  do not do that  remember your promise to me  tell me raoul that you will not do that  do not even threaten him raoul  de coude took his wifes hands in his and gazed upon her pale and troubled countenance for some time before he spoke as though he would wrest from those beautiful eyes the real reason which prompted her to shield this man  let it be as you wish olga he said at length  i cannot understand  he has forfeited all claim upon your love loyalty or respect  he is a menace to your life and honor and the life and honor of your husband  i trust you may never regret championing him  i do not champion him raoul she interrupted vehemently  i believe that i hate him as much as you do butoh raoul blood is thicker than water  i should today have liked to sample the consistency of his growled de coude grimly  the two deliberately attempted to besmirch my honor olga and then he told her of all that had happened in the smokingroom  had it not been for this utter stranger they had succeeded for who would have accepted my unsupported word against the damning evidence of those cards hidden on my person  i had almost begun to doubt myself when this monsieur tarzan dragged your precious nikolas before us and explained the whole cowardly transaction  monsieur tarzan asked the countess in evident surprise  yes  do you know him olga  i have seen him  a steward pointed him out to me  i did not know that he was a celebrity said the count  olga de coude changed the subject  she discovered suddenly that she might find it difficult to explain just why the steward had pointed out the handsome monsieur tarzan to her  perhaps she flushed the least little bit for was not the count her husband gazing at her with a strangely quizzical expression  ah she thought a guilty conscience is a most suspicious thing     chapter 2  forging bonds of hate and    it was not until late the following afternoon that tarzan saw anything more of the fellow passengers into the midst of whose affairs his love of fair play had thrust him  and then he came most unexpectedly upon rokoff and paulvitch at a moment when of all others the two might least appreciate his company  they were standing on deck at a point which was temporarily deserted and as tarzan came upon them they were in heated argument with a woman tarzan noted that she was richly appareled and that her slender wellmodeled figure denoted youth but as she was heavily veiled he could not discern her features  the men were standing on either side of her and the backs of all were toward tarzan so that he was quite close to them without their being aware of his presence  he noticed that rokoff seemed to be threatening the woman pleading but they spoke in a strange tongue and he could only guess from appearances that the girl was afraid  rokoffs attitude was so distinctly filled with the threat of physical violence that the apeman paused for an instant just behind the trio instinctively sensing an atmosphere of danger  scarcely had he hesitated ere the man seized the woman roughly by the wrist twisting it as though to wring a promise from her through torture  what would have happened next had rokoff had his way we may only conjecture since he did not have his way at all  instead steel fingers gripped his shoulder and he was swung unceremoniously around to meet the cold gray eyes of the stranger who had thwarted him on the previous day  sapristi screamed the infuriated rokoff  what do you mean  are you a fool that you thus again insult nikolas rokoff  this is my answer to your note monsieur said tarzan in a low voice  and then he hurled the fellow from him with such force that rokoff lunged sprawling against the rail  name of a name shrieked rokoff  pig but you shall die for this and springing to his feet he rushed upon tarzan tugging the meanwhile to draw a revolver from his hip pocket  the girl shrank back in terror  nikolas she cried  do notoh do not do that  quick monsieur fly or he will surely kill you  but instead of flying tarzan advanced to meet the fellow  do not make a fool of yourself monsieur he said  rokoff who was in a perfect frenzy of rage at the humiliation the stranger had put upon him had at last succeeded in drawing the revolver  he had stopped and now he deliberately raised it to tarzans breast and pulled the trigger  the hammer fell with a futile click on an empty chamberthe apemans hand shot out like the head of an angry python there was a quick wrench and the revolver sailed far out across the ships rail and dropped into the atlantic  for a moment the two men stood there facing one another  rokoff had regained his selfpossession  he was the first to speak  twice now has monsieur seen fit to interfere in matters which do not concern him  twice he has taken it upon himself to humiliate nikolas rokoff  the first offense was overlooked on the assumption that monsieur acted through ignorance but this affair shall not be overlooked  if monsieur does not know who nikolas rokoff is this last piece of effrontery will insure that monsieur later has good reason to remember him  that you are a coward and a scoundrel monsieur replied tarzan is all that i care to know of you and he turned to ask the girl if the man had hurt her but she had disappeared  then without even a glance toward rokoff and his companion he continued his stroll along the deck  tarzan could not but wonder what manner of conspiracy was on foot or what the scheme of the two men might be  there had been something rather familiar about the appearance of the veiled woman to whose rescue he had just come but as he had not seen her face he could not be sure that he had ever seen her before  the only thing about her that he had particularly noticed was a ring of peculiar workmanship upon a finger of the hand that rokoff had seized and he determined to note the fingers of the women passengers he came upon thereafter that he might discover the identity of her whom rokoff was persecuting and learn if the fellow had offered her further annoyance  tarzan had sought his deck chair where he sat speculating on the numerous instances of human cruelty selfishness and spite that had fallen to his lot to witness since that day in the jungle four years since that his eyes had first fallen upon a human being other than himselfthe sleek black kulonga whose swift spear had that day found the vitals of kala the great sheape and robbed the youth tarzan of the only mother he had ever known  he recalled the murder of king by the ratfaced snipes the abandonment of professor porter and his party by the mutineers of the arrow the cruelty of the black warriors and women of mbonga to their captives the petty jealousies of the civil and military officers of the west coast colony that had afforded him his first introduction to the civilized world  mon dieu he soliloquized but they are all alike  cheating murdering lying fighting and all for things that the beasts of the jungle would not deign to possessmoney to purchase the effeminate pleasures of weaklings  and yet withal bound down by silly customs that make them slaves to their unhappy lot while firm in the belief that they be the lords of creation enjoying the only real pleasures of existence  in the jungle one would scarcely stand supinely aside while another took his mate  it is a silly world an idiotic world and tarzan of the apes was a fool to renounce the freedom and the happiness of his jungle to come into it  presently as he sat there the sudden feeling came over him that eyes were watching from behind and the old instinct of the wild beast broke through the thin veneer of civilization so that tarzan wheeled about so quickly that the eyes of the young woman who had been surreptitiously regarding him had not even time to drop before the gray eyes of the apeman shot an inquiring look straight into them  then as they fell tarzan saw a faint wave of crimson creep swiftly over the now halfaverted face  he smiled to himself at the result of his very uncivilized and ungallant action for he had not lowered his own eyes when they met those of the young woman  she was very young and equally good to look upon  further there was something rather familiar about her that set tarzan to wondering where he had seen her before  he resumed his former position and presently he was aware that she had arisen and was leaving the deck  as she passed tarzan turned to watch her in the hope that he might discover a clew to satisfy his mild curiosity as to her identity  nor was he disappointed entirely for as she walked away she raised one hand to the black waving mass at the nape of her neckthe peculiarly feminine gesture that admits cognizance of appraising eyes behind herand tarzan saw upon a finger of this hand the ring of strange workmanship that he had seen upon the finger of the veiled woman a short time before  so it was this beautiful young woman rokoff had been persecuting tarzan wondered in a lazy sort of way whom she might be and what relations one so lovely could have with the surly bearded russian  after dinner that evening tarzan strolled forward where he remained until after dark in conversation with the second officer and when that gentlemans duties called him elsewhere tarzan lolled lazily by the rail watching the play of the moonlight upon the gently rolling waters  he was half hidden by a davit so that two men who approached along the deck did not see him and as they passed tarzan caught enough of their conversation to cause him to fall in behind them to follow and learn what deviltry they were up to  he had recognized the voice as that of rokoff and had seen that his companion was paulvitch  tarzan had overheard but a few words  and if she screams you may choke her until  but those had been enough to arouse the spirit of adventure within him and so he kept the two men in sight as they walked briskly now along the deck  to the smokingroom he followed them but they merely halted at the doorway long enough apparently to assure themselves that one whose whereabouts they wished to establish was within  then they proceeded directly to the firstclass cabins upon the promenade deck  here tarzan found greater difficulty in escaping detection but he managed to do so successfully  as they halted before one of the polished hardwood doors tarzan slipped into the shadow of a passageway not a dozen feet from them  to their knock a womans voice asked in french  who is it  it is i olganikolas was the answer in rokoffs now familiar guttural  may i come in  why do you not cease persecuting me nikolas came the voice of the woman from beyond the thin panel  i have never harmed you  come come olga urged the man in propitiary tones i but ask a half dozen words with you  i shall not harm you nor shall i enter your cabin but i cannot shout my message through the door  tarzan heard the catch click as it was released from the inside  he stepped out from his hidingplace far enough to see what transpired when the door was opened for he could not but recall the sinister words he had heard a few moments before upon the deck and if she screams you may choke her  rokoff was standing directly in front of the door  paulvitch had flattened himself against the paneled wall of the corridor beyond  the door opened  rokoff half entered the room and stood with his back against the door speaking in a low whisper to the woman whom tarzan could not see  then tarzan heard the womans voice level but loud enough to distinguish her words  no nikolas she was saying it is useless  threaten as you will i shall never accede to your demands  leave the room please you have no right here  you promised not to enter  very well olga i shall not enter but before i am done with you you shall wish a thousand times that you had done at once the favor i have asked  in the end i shall win anyway so you might as well save trouble and time for me and disgrace for yourself and your  never nikolas interrupted the woman and then tarzan saw rokoff turn and nod to paulvitch who sprang quickly toward the doorway of the cabin rushing in past rokoff who held the door open for him  then the latter stepped quickly out  the door closed  tarzan heard the click of the lock as paulvitch turned it from the inside  rokoff remained standing before the door with head bent as though to catch the words of the two within  a nasty smile curled his bearded lip  tarzan could hear the womans voice commanding the fellow to leave her cabin  i shall send for my husband she cried  he will show you no mercy  paulvitchs sneering laugh came through the polished panels  the purser will fetch your husband madame said the man  in fact that officer has already been notified that you are entertaining a man other than your husband behind the locked door of your cabin  bah cried the woman  my husband will know  most assuredly your husband will know but the purser will not nor will the newspaper men who shall in some mysterious way hear of it on our landing  but they will think it a fine story and so will all your friends when they read of it at breakfast onlet me see this is tuesdayyes when they read of it at breakfast next friday morning nor will it detract from the interest they will all feel when they learn that the man whom madame entertained is a russian servanther brothers valet to be quite exact  alexis paulvitch came the womans voice cold and fearless you are a coward and when i whisper a certain name in your ear you will think better of your demands upon me and your threats against me and then you will leave my cabin quickly nor do i think that ever again will you at least annoy me and there came a moments silence in which tarzan could imagine the woman leaning toward the scoundrel and whispering the thing she had hinted at into his ear  only a moment of silence and then a startled oath from the manthe scuffling of feeta womans screamand silence  but scarcely had the cry ceased before the apeman had leaped from his hidingplace  rokoff started to run but tarzan grasped him by the collar and dragged him back  neither spoke for both felt instinctively that murder was being done in that room and tarzan was confident that rokoff had had no intention that his confederate should go that farhe felt that the mans aims were deeper than thatdeeper and even more sinister than brutal coldblooded murder  without hesitating to question those within the apeman threw his giant shoulder against the frail panel and in a shower of splintered wood he entered the cabin dragging rokoff after him  before him on a couch the woman lay and on top of her was paulvitch his fingers gripping the fair throat while his victims hands beat futilely at his face tearing desperately at the cruel fingers that were forcing the life from her  the noise of his entrance brought paulvitch to his feet where he stood glowering menacingly at tarzan  the girl rose falteringly to a sitting posture upon the couch  one hand was at her throat and her breath came in little gasps  although disheveled and very pale tarzan recognized her as the young woman whom he had caught staring at him on deck earlier in the day  what is the meaning of this said tarzan turning to rokoff whom he intuitively singled out as the instigator of the outrage  the man remained silent scowling  touch the button please continued the apeman we will have one of the ships officers herethis affair has gone quite far enough  no no cried the girl coming suddenly to her feet  please do not do that  i am sure that there was no real intention to harm me  i angered this person and he lost control of himself that is all  i would not care to have the matter go further please monsieur and there was such a note of pleading in her voice that tarzan could not press the matter though his better judgment warned him that there was something afoot here of which the proper authorities should be made cognizant  you wish me to do nothing then in the matter he asked  nothing please she replied  you are content that these two scoundrels should continue persecuting you  she did not seem to know what answer to make and looked very troubled and unhappy  tarzan saw a malicious grin of triumph curl rokoffs lip the girl evidently was in fear of these twoshe dared not express her real desires before them  then said tarzan i shall act on my own responsibility  to you he continued turning to rokoff and this includes your accomplice i may say that from now on to the end of the voyage i shall take it upon myself to keep an eye on you and should there chance to come to my notice any act of either one of you that might even remotely annoy this young woman you shall be called to account for it directly to me nor shall the calling or the accounting be pleasant experiences for either of you  now get out of here and he grabbed rokoff and paulvitch each by the scruff of the neck and thrust them forcibly through the doorway giving each an added impetus down the corridor with the toe of his boot  then he turned back to the stateroom and the girl  she was looking at him in wideeyed astonishment  and you madame will confer a great favor upon me if you will but let me know if either of those rascals troubles you further  ah monsieur she answered i hope that you will not suffer for the kind deed you attempted  you have made a very wicked and resourceful enemy who will stop at nothing to satisfy his hatred  you must be very careful indeed monsieur  pardon me madame my name is tarzan  monsieur tarzan  and because i would not consent to notify the officers do not think that i am not sincerely grateful to you for the brave and chivalrous protection you rendered me  good night monsieur tarzan  i shall never forget the debt i owe you and with a most winsome smile that displayed a row of perfect teeth the girl curtsied to tarzan who bade her good night and made his way on deck  it puzzled the man considerably that there should be two on boardthis girl and count de coudewho suffered indignities at the hands of rokoff and his companion and yet would not permit the offenders to be brought to justice  before he turned in that night his thoughts reverted many times to the beautiful young woman into the evidently tangled web of whose life fate had so strangely introduced him  it occurred to him that he had not learned her name  that she was married had been evidenced by the narrow gold band that encircled the third finger of her left hand  involuntarily he wondered who the lucky man might be  tarzan saw nothing further of any of the actors in the little drama that he had caught a fleeting glimpse of until late in the afternoon of the last day of the voyage  then he came suddenly face to face with the young woman as the two approached their deck chairs from opposite directions  she greeted him with a pleasant smile speaking almost immediately of the affair he had witnessed in her cabin two nights before  it was as though she had been perturbed by a conviction that he might have construed her acquaintance with such men as rokoff and paulvitch as a personal reflection upon herself  i trust monsieur has not judged me she said by the unfortunate occurrence of tuesday evening  i have suffered much on account of itthis is the first time that i have ventured from my cabin since i have been ashamed she concluded simply  one does not judge the gazelle by the lions that attack it replied tarzan  i had seen those two work beforein the smokingroom the day prior to their attack on you if i recollect it correctly and so knowing their methods i am convinced that their enmity is a sufficient guarantee of the integrity of its object  men such as they must cleave only to the vile hating all that is noblest and best  it is very kind of you to put it that way she replied smiling  i have already heard of the matter of the card game  my husband told me the entire story  he spoke especially of the strength and bravery of monsieur tarzan to whom he feels that he owes an immense debt of gratitude  your husband repeated tarzan questioningly  yes  i am the countess de coude  i am already amply repaid madame in knowing that i have rendered a service to the wife of the count de coude  alas monsieur i already am so greatly indebted to you that i may never hope to settle my own account so pray do not add further to my obligations and she smiled so sweetly upon him that tarzan felt that a man might easily attempt much greater things than he had accomplished solely for the pleasure of receiving the benediction of that smile  he did not see her again that day and in the rush of landing on the following morning he missed her entirely but there had been something in the expression of her eyes as they parted on deck the previous day that haunted him  it had been almost wistful as they had spoken of the strangeness of the swift friendships of an ocean crossing and of the equal ease with which they are broken forever  tarzan wondered if he should ever see her again     chapter 3  what happened in the rue maule   on his arrival in paris tarzan had gone directly to the apartments of his old friend darnot where the naval lieutenant had scored him roundly for his decision to renounce the title and estates that were rightly his from his father john clayton the late lord greystoke  you must be mad my friend said darnot thus lightly to give up not alone wealth and position but an opportunity to prove beyond doubt to all the world that in your veins flows the noble blood of two of englands most honored housesinstead of the blood of a savage sheape  it is incredible that they could have believed youmiss porter least of all  why i never did believe it even back in the wilds of your african jungle when you tore the raw meat of your kills with mighty jaws like some wild beast and wiped your greasy hands upon your thighs  even then before there was the slightest proof to the contrary i knew that you were mistaken in the belief that kala was your mother  and now with your fathers diary of the terrible life led by him and your mother on that wild african shore with the account of your birth and final and most convincing proof of all your own baby finger prints upon the pages of it it seems incredible to me that you are willing to remain a nameless penniless vagabond  i do not need any better name than tarzan replied the apeman and as for remaining a penniless vagabond i have no intention of so doing in fact the next and let us hope the last burden that i shall be forced to put upon your unselfish friendship will be the finding of employment for me  pooh pooh scoffed darnot  you know that i did not mean that have i not told you a dozen times that i have enough for twenty men and that half of what i have is yours  and if i gave it all to you would it represent even the tenth part of the value i place upon your friendship my tarzan  would it repay the services you did me in africa  i do not forget my friend that but for you and your wondrous bravery i had died at the stake in the village of mbongas cannibals nor do i forget that to your selfsacrificing devotion i owe the fact that i recovered from the terrible wounds i received at their handsi discovered later something of what it meant to you to remain with me in the amphitheater of apes while your heart was urging you on to the coast  when we finally came there and found that miss porter and her party had left i commenced to realize something of what you had done for an utter stranger  nor am i trying to repay you with money tarzan  it is that just at present you need money were it sacrifice that i might offer you it were the samemy friendship must always be yours because our tastes are similar and i admire you  that i cannot command but the money i can and shall  well laughed tarzan we shall not quarrel over the money  i must live and so i must have it but i shall be more contented with something to do  you cannot show me your friendship in a more convincing manner than to find employment for mei shall die of inactivity in a short while  as for my birthrightit is in good hands  clayton is not guilty of robbing me of it  he truly believes that he is the real lord greystoke and the chances are that he will make a better english lord than a man who was born and raised in an african jungle  you know that i am but half civilized even now  let me see red in anger but for a moment and all the instincts of the savage beast that i really am submerge what little i possess of the milder ways of culture and refinement  and then again had i declared myself i should have robbed the woman i love of the wealth and position that her marriage to clayton will now insure to her  i could not have done thatcould i paul  nor is the matter of birth of great importance to me he went on without waiting for a reply  raised as i have been i see no worth in man or beast that is not theirs by virtue of their own mental or physical prowess  and so i am as happy to think of kala as my mother as i would be to try to picture the poor unhappy little english girl who passed away a year after she bore me  kala was always kind to me in her fierce and savage way  i must have nursed at her hairy breast from the time that my own mother died  she fought for me against the wild denizens of the forest and against the savage members of our tribe with the ferocity of real mother love  and i on my part loved her paul  i did not realize how much until after the cruel spear and the poisoned arrow of mbongas black warrior had stolen her away from me  i was still a child when that occurred and i threw myself upon her dead body and wept out my anguish as a child might for his own mother  to you my friend she would have appeared a hideous and ugly creature but to me she was beautifulso gloriously does love transfigure its object  and so i am perfectly content to remain forever the son of kala the sheape  i do not admire you the less for your loyalty said darnot but the time will come when you will be glad to claim your own  remember what i say and let us hope that it will be as easy then as it is now  you must bear in mind that professor porter and mr philander are the only people in the world who can swear that the little skeleton found in the cabin with those of your father and mother was that of an infant anthropoid ape and not the offspring of lord and lady greystoke  that evidence is most important  they are both old men  they may not live many years longer  and then did it not occur to you that once miss porter knew the truth she would break her engagement with clayton  you might easily have your title your estates and the woman you love tarzan  had you not thought of that  tarzan shook his head  you do not know her he said  nothing could bind her closer to her bargain than some misfortune to clayton  she is from an old southern family in america and southerners pride themselves upon their loyalty  tarzan spent the two following weeks renewing his former brief acquaintance with paris  in the daytime he haunted the libraries and picture galleries  he had become an omnivorous reader and the world of possibilities that were opened to him in this seat of culture and learning fairly appalled him when he contemplated the very infinitesimal crumb of the sum total of human knowledge that a single individual might hope to acquire even after a lifetime of study and research but he learned what he could by day and threw himself into a search for relaxation and amusement at night  nor did he find paris a whit less fertile field for his nocturnal avocation  if he smoked too many cigarettes and drank too much absinth it was because he took civilization as he found it and did the things that he found his civilized brothers doing  the life was a new and alluring one and in addition he had a sorrow in his breast and a great longing which he knew could never be fulfilled and so he sought in study and in dissipationthe two extremesto forget the past and inhibit contemplation of the future  he was sitting in a music hall one evening sipping his absinth and admiring the art of a certain famous russian dancer when he caught a passing glimpse of a pair of evil black eyes upon him  the man turned and was lost in the crowd at the exit before tarzan could catch a good look at him but he was confident that he had seen those eyes before and that they had been fastened on him this evening through no passing accident  he had had the uncanny feeling for some time that he was being watched and it was in response to this animal instinct that was strong within him that he had turned suddenly and surprised the eyes in the very act of watching him  before he left the music hall the matter had been forgotten nor did he notice the swarthy individual who stepped deeper into the shadows of an opposite doorway as tarzan emerged from the brilliantly lighted amusement hall  had tarzan but known it he had been followed many times from this and other places of amusement but seldom if ever had he been alone tonight darnot had had another engagement and tarzan had come by himself  as he turned in the direction he was accustomed to taking from this part of paris to his apartments the watcher across the street ran from his hidingplace and hurried on ahead at a rapid pace  tarzan had been wont to traverse the rue maule on his way home at night  because it was very quiet and very dark it reminded him more of his beloved african jungle than did the noisy and garish streets surrounding it  if you are familiar with your paris you will recall the narrow forbidding precincts of the rue maule  if you are not you need but ask the police about it to learn that in all paris there is no street to which you should give a wider berth after dark  on this night tarzan had proceeded some two squares through the dense shadows of the squalid old tenements which line this dismal way when he was attracted by screams and cries for help from the third floor of an opposite building  the voice was a womans  before the echoes of her first cries had died tarzan was bounding up the stairs and through the dark corridors to her rescue  at the end of the corridor on the third landing a door stood slightly ajar and from within tarzan heard again the same appeal that had lured him from the street  another instant found him in the center of a dimlylighted room  an oil lamp burned upon a high oldfashioned mantel casting its dim rays over a dozen repulsive figures  all but one were men  the other was a woman of about thirty  her face marked by low passions and dissipation might once have been lovely  she stood with one hand at her throat crouching against the farther wall  help monsieur she cried in a low voice as tarzan entered the room they were killing me  as tarzan turned toward the men about him he saw the crafty evil faces of habitual criminals  he wondered that they had made no effort to escape  a movement behind him caused him to turn  two things his eyes saw and one of them caused him considerable wonderment  a man was sneaking stealthily from the room and in the brief glance that tarzan had of him he saw that it was rokoff  but the other thing that he saw was of more immediate interest  it was a great brute of a fellow tiptoeing upon him from behind with a huge bludgeon in his hand and then as the man and his confederates saw that he was discovered there was a concerted rush upon tarzan from all sides  some of the men drew knives  others picked up chairs while the fellow with the bludgeon raised it high above his head in a mighty swing that would have crushed tarzans head had it ever descended upon it  but the brain and the agility and the muscles that had coped with the mighty strength and cruel craftiness of terkoz and numa in the fastness of their savage jungle were not to be so easily subdued as these apaches of paris had believed  selecting his most formidable antagonist the fellow with the bludgeon tarzan charged full upon him dodging the falling weapon and catching the man a terrific blow on the point of the chin that felled him in his tracks  then he turned upon the others  this was sport  he was reveling in the joy of battle and the lust of blood  as though it had been but a brittle shell to break at the least rough usage the thin veneer of his civilization fell from him and the ten burly villains found themselves penned in a small room with a wild and savage beast against whose steel muscles their puny strength was less than futile  at the end of the corridor without stood rokoff waiting the outcome of the affair  he wished to be sure that tarzan was dead before he left but it was not a part of his plan to be one of those within the room when the murder occurred  the woman still stood where she had when tarzan entered but her face had undergone a number of changes with the few minutes which had elapsed  from the semblance of distress which it had worn when tarzan first saw it it had changed to one of craftiness as he had wheeled to meet the attack from behind but the change tarzan had not seen  later an expression of surprise and then one of horror superseded the others  and who may wonder  for the immaculate gentleman her cries had lured to what was to have been his death had been suddenly metamorphosed into a demon of revenge  instead of soft muscles and a weak resistance she was looking upon a veritable hercules gone mad  mon dieu she cried he is a beast  for the strong white teeth of the apeman had found the throat of one of his assailants and tarzan fought as he had learned to fight with the great bull apes of the tribe of kerchak  he was in a dozen places at once leaping hither and thither about the room in sinuous bounds that reminded the woman of a panther she had seen at the zoo  now a wristbone snapped in his iron grip now a shoulder was wrenched from its socket as he forced a victims arm backward and upward  with shrieks of pain the men escaped into the hallway as quickly as they could but even before the first one staggered bleeding and broken from the room rokoff had seen enough to convince him that tarzan would not be the one to lie dead in that house this night and so the russian had hastened to a nearby den and telephoned the police that a man was committing murder on the third floor of rue maule 27 when the officers arrived they found three men groaning on the floor a frightened woman lying upon a filthy bed her face buried in her arms and what appeared to be a welldressed young gentleman standing in the center of the room awaiting the reenforcements which he had thought the footsteps of the officers hurrying up the stairway had announcedbut they were mistaken in the last it was a wild beast that looked upon them through those narrowed lids and steelgray eyes  with the smell of blood the last vestige of civilization had deserted tarzan and now he stood at bay like a lion surrounded by hunters awaiting the next overt act and crouching to charge its author  what has happened here asked one of the policemen  tarzan explained briefly but when he turned to the woman for confirmation of his statement he was appalled by her reply  he lies she screamed shrilly addressing the policeman  he came to my room while i was alone and for no good purpose  when i repulsed him he would have killed me had not my screams attracted these gentlemen who were passing the house at the time  he is a devil monsieurs alone he has all but killed ten men with his bare hands and his teeth  so shocked was tarzan by her ingratitude that for a moment he was struck dumb  the police were inclined to be a little skeptical for they had had other dealings with this same lady and her lovely coterie of gentlemen friends  however they were policemen not judges so they decided to place all the inmates of the room under arrest and let another whose business it was separate the innocent from the guilty  but they found that it was one thing to tell this welldressed young man that he was under arrest but quite another to enforce it  i am guilty of no offense he said quietly  i have but sought to defend myself  i do not know why the woman has told you what she has she can have no enmity against me for never until i came to this room in response to her cries for help had i seen her  come come said one of the officers there are judges to listen to all that and he advanced to lay his hand upon tarzans shoulder  an instant later he lay crumpled in a corner of the room and then as his comrades rushed in upon the apeman they experienced a taste of what the apaches had but recently gone through  so quickly and so roughly did he handle them that they had not even an opportunity to draw their revolvers  during the brief fight tarzan had noted the open window and beyond the stem of a tree or a telegraph polehe could not tell which  as the last officer went down one of his fellows succeeded in drawing his revolver and from where he lay on the floor fired at tarzan  the shot missed and before the man could fire again tarzan had swept the lamp from the mantel and plunged the room into darkness  the next they saw was a lithe form spring to the sill of the open window and leap pantherlike onto the pole across the walk  when the police gathered themselves together and reached the street their prisoner was nowhere to be seen  they did not handle the woman and the men who had not escaped any too gently when they took them to the station they were a very sore and humiliated detail of police  it galled them to think that it would be necessary to report that a single unarmed man had wiped the floor with the whole lot of them and then escaped them as easily as though they had not existed  the officer who had remained in the street swore that no one had leaped from the window or left the building from the time they entered until they had come out  his comrades thought that he lied but they could not prove it  when tarzan found himself clinging to the pole outside the window he followed his jungle instinct and looked below for enemies before he ventured down  it was well he did for just beneath stood a policeman above tarzan saw no one so he went up instead of down  the top of the pole was opposite the roof of the building so it was but the work of an instant for the muscles that had for years sent him hurtling through the treetops of his primeval forest to carry him across the little space between the pole and the roof  from one building he went to another and so on with much climbing until at a cross street he discovered another pole down which he ran to the ground  for a square or two he ran swiftly then he turned into a little allnight cafe and in the lavatory removed the evidences of his overroof promenade from hands and clothes  when he emerged a few moments later it was to saunter slowly on toward his apartments  not far from them he came to a welllighted boulevard which it was necessary to cross  as he stood directly beneath a brilliant arc light waiting for a limousine that was approaching to pass him he heard his name called in a sweet feminine voice  looking up he met the smiling eyes of olga de coude as she leaned forward upon the back seat of the machine  he bowed very low in response to her friendly greeting  when he straightened up the machine had borne her away  rokoff and the countess de coude both in the same evening he soliloquized paris is not so large after all     chapter 4  the countess explains   your paris is more dangerous than my savage jungles paul concluded tarzan after narrating his adventures to his friend the morning following his encounter with the apaches and police in the rue maule why did they lure me there  were they hungry  darnot feigned a horrified shudder but he laughed at the quaint suggestion  it is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason by the light of civilized ways is it not my friend he queried banteringly  civilized ways forsooth scoffed tarzan  jungle standards do not countenance wanton atrocities  there we kill for food and for selfpreservation or in the winning of mates and the protection of the young  always you see in accordance with the dictates of some great natural law  but here  faugh your civilized man is more brutal than the brutes  he kills wantonly and worse than that he utilizes a noble sentiment the brotherhood of man as a lure to entice his unwary victim to his doom  it was in answer to an appeal from a fellow being that i hastened to that room where the assassins lay in wait for me  i did not realize i could not realize for a long time afterward that any woman could sink to such moral depravity as that one must have to call a wouldbe rescuer to death  but it must have been sothe sight of rokoff there and the womans later repudiation of me to the police make it impossible to place any other construction upon her acts rokoff must have known that i frequently passed through the rue maule he lay in wait for mehis entire scheme worked out to the last detail even to the womans story in case a hitch should occur in the program such as really did happen  it is all perfectly plain to me  well said darnot among other things it has taught you what i have been unable to impress upon youthat the rue maule is a good place to avoid after dark  on the contrary replied tarzan with a smile it has convinced me that it is the one worthwhile street in all paris  never again shall i miss an opportunity to traverse it for it has given me the first real entertainment i have had since i left africa  it may give you more than you will relish even without another visit said darnot  you are not through with the police yet remember  i know the paris police well enough to assure you that they will not soon forget what you did to them  sooner or later they will get you my dear tarzan and then they will lock the wild man of the woods up behind iron bars  how will you like that  they will never lock tarzan of the apes behind iron bars replied he grimly  there was something in the mans voice as he said it that caused darnot to look up sharply at his friend  what he saw in the set jaw and the cold gray eyes made the young frenchman very apprehensive for this great child who could recognize no law mightier than his own mighty physical prowess  he saw that something must be done to set tarzan right with the police before another encounter was possible  you have much to learn tarzan he said gravely  the law of man must be respected whether you relish it or no  nothing but trouble can come to you and your friends should you persist in defying the police  i can explain it to them once for you and that i shall do this very day but hereafter you must obey the law  if its representatives say come you must come if they say go you must go  now we shall go to my great friend in the department and fix up this matter of the rue maule  come  together they entered the office of the police official a half hour later  he was very cordial  he remembered tarzan from the visit the two had made him several months prior in the matter of finger prints  when darnot had concluded the narration of the events which had transpired the previous evening a grim smile was playing about the lips of the policeman  he touched a button near his hand and as he waited for the clerk to respond to its summons he searched through the papers on his desk for one which he finally located  here joubon he said as the clerk entered  summon these officershave them come to me at once and he handed the man the paper he had sought  then he turned to tarzan  you have committed a very grave offense monsieur he said not unkindly and but for the explanation made by our good friend here i should be inclined to judge you harshly  i am instead about to do a rather unheardofthing  i have summoned the officers whom you maltreated last night  they shall hear lieutenant darnots story and then i shall leave it to their discretion to say whether you shall be prosecuted or not  you have much to learn about the ways of civilization  things that seem strange or unnecessary to you you must learn to accept until you are able to judge the motives behind them  the officers whom you attacked were but doing their duty  they had no discretion in the matter  every day they risk their lives in the protection of the lives or property of others  they would do the same for you  they are very brave men and they are deeply mortified that a single unarmed man bested and beat them  make it easy for them to overlook what you did  unless i am gravely in error you are yourself a very brave man and brave men are proverbially magnanimous  further conversation was interrupted by the appearance of the four policemen  as their eyes fell on tarzan surprise was writ large on each countenance  my children said the official here is the gentleman whom you met in the rue maule last evening  he has come voluntarily to give himself up  i wish you to listen attentively to lieutenant darnot who will tell you a part of the story of monsieurs life  it may explain his attitude toward you of last night  proceed my dear lieutenant  darnot spoke to the policemen for half an hour  he told them something of tarzans wild jungle life  he explained the savage training that had taught him to battle like a wild beast in selfpreservation  it became plain to them that the man had been guided by instinct rather than reason in his attack upon them  he had not understood their intentions  to him they had been little different from any of the various forms of life he had been accustomed to in his native jungle where practically all were his enemies  your pride has been wounded said darnot in conclusion  it is the fact that this man overcame you that hurts the most  but you need feel no shame  you would not make apologies for defeat had you been penned in that small room with an african lion or with the great gorilla of the jungles  and yet you were battling with muscles that have time and time again been pitted and always victoriously against these terrors of the dark continent  it is no disgrace to fall beneath the superhuman strength of tarzan of the apes  and then as the men stood looking first at tarzan and then at their superior the apeman did the one thing which was needed to erase the last remnant of animosity which they might have felt for him  with outstretched hand he advanced toward them  i am sorry for the mistake i made he said simply  let us be friends  and that was the end of the whole matter except that tarzan became a subject of much conversation in the barracks of the police and increased the number of his friends by four brave men at least  on their return to darnots apartments the lieutenant found a letter awaiting him from an english friend william cecil clayton lord greystoke  the two had maintained a correspondence since the birth of their friendship on that illfated expedition in search of jane porter after her theft by terkoz the bull ape  they are to be married in london in about two months said darnot as he completed his perusal of the letter  tarzan did not need to be told who was meant by they he made no reply but he was very quiet and thoughtful during the balance of the day  that evening they attended the opera  tarzans mind was still occupied by his gloomy thoughts  he paid little or no attention to what was transpiring upon the stage  instead he saw only the lovely vision of a beautiful american girl and heard naught but a sad sweet voice acknowledging that his love was returned  and she was to marry another  he shook himself to be rid of his unwelcome thoughts and at the same instant he felt eyes upon him  with the instinct that was his by virtue of training he looked up squarely into the eyes that were looking at him to find that they were shining from the smiling face of olga countess de coude  as tarzan returned her bow he was positive that there was an invitation in her look almost a plea  the next intermission found him beside her in her box  i have so much wished to see you she was saying  it has troubled me not a little to think that after the service you rendered to both my husband and myself no adequate explanation was ever made you of what must have seemed ingratitude on our part in not taking the necessary steps to prevent a repetition of the attacks upon us by those two men  you wrong me replied tarzan  my thoughts of you have been only the most pleasant  you must not feel that any explanation is due me  have they annoyed you further  they never cease she replied sadly  i feel that i must tell some one and i do not know another who so deserves an explanation as you you must permit me to do so  it may be of service to you for i know nikolas rokoff quite well enough to be positive that you have not seen the last of him  he will find some means to be revenged upon you what i wish to tell you may be of aid to you in combating any scheme of revenge he may harbor  i cannot tell you here but tomorrow i shall be at home to monsieur tarzan at five  it will be an eternity until tomorrow at five he said as he bade her good night  from a corner of the theater rokoff and paulvitch saw monsieur tarzan in the box of the countess de coude and both men smiled  at fourthirty the following afternoon a swarthy bearded man rang the bell at the servants entrance of the palace of the count de coude the footman who opened the door raised his eyebrows in recognition as he saw who stood without  a low conversation passed between the two  at first the footman demurred from some proposition that the bearded one made but an instant later something passed from the hand of the caller to the hand of the servant  then the latter turned and led the visitor by a roundabout way to a little curtained alcove off the apartment in which the countess was wont to serve tea of an afternoon  a half hour later tarzan was ushered into the room and presently his hostess entered smiling and with outstretched hands  i am so glad that you came she said  nothing could have prevented he replied  for a few moments they spoke of the opera of the topics that were then occupying the attention of paris of the pleasure of renewing their brief acquaintance which had had its inception under such odd circumstances and this brought them to the subject that was uppermost in the minds of both  you must have wondered said the countess finally what the object of rokoffs persecution could be  it is very simple  the count is intrusted with many of the vital secrets of the ministry of war  he often has in his possession papers that foreign powers would give a fortune to possesssecrets of state that their agents would commit murder and worse than murder to learn  there is such a matter now in his possession that would make the fame and fortune of any russian who could divulge it to his government rokoff and paulvitch are russian spies  they will stop at nothing to procure this information  the affair on the lineri mean the matter of the card gamewas for the purpose of blackmailing the knowledge they seek from my husband  had he been convicted of cheating at cards his career would have been blighted  he would have had to leave the war department  he would have been socially ostracized  they intended to hold this club over himthe price of an avowal on their part that the count was but the victim of the plot of enemies who wished to besmirch his name was to have been the papers they seek  you thwarted them in this  then they concocted the scheme whereby my reputation was to be the price instead of the counts  when paulvitch entered my cabin he explained it to me  if i would obtain the information for them he promised to go no farther otherwise rokoff who stood without was to notify the purser that i was entertaining a man other than my husband behind the locked doors of my cabin  he was to tell every one he met on the boat and when we landed he was to have given the whole story to the newspaper men  was it not too horrible  but i happened to know something of monsieur paulvitch that would send him to the gallows in russia if it were known by the police of st petersburg  i dared him to carry out his plan and then i leaned toward him and whispered a name in his ear  like thatand she snapped her fingershe flew at my throat as a madman he would have killed me had you not interfered  the brutes muttered tarzan  they are worse than that my friend she said  they are devils  i fear for you because you have gained their hatred i wish you to be on your guard constantly  tell me that you will for my sake for i should never forgive myself should you suffer through the kindness you did me  i do not fear them he replied  i have survived grimmer enemies than rokoff and paulvitch  he saw that she knew nothing of the occurrence in the rue maule nor did he mention it fearing that it might distress her  for your own safety he continued why do you not turn the scoundrels over to the authorities  they should make quick work of them  she hesitated for a moment before replying  there are two reasons she said finally  one of them it is that keeps the count from doing that very thing  the other my real reason for fearing to expose them i have never toldonly rokoff and i know it  i wonder and then she paused looking intently at him for a long time  and what do you wonder he asked smiling  i was wondering why it is that i want to tell you the thing that i have not dared tell even to my husband  i believe that you would understand and that you could tell me the right course to follow  i believe that you would not judge me too harshly  i fear that i should prove a very poor judge madame tarzan replied for if you had been guilty of murder i should say that the victim should be grateful to have met so sweet a fate  oh dear no she expostulated it is not so terrible as that  but first let me tell you the reason the count has for not prosecuting these men then if i can hold my courage i shall tell you the real reason that i dare not  the first is that nikolas rokoff is my brother  we are russians  nikolas has been a bad man since i can remember  he was cashiered from the russian army in which he held a captaincy  there was a scandal for a time but after a while it was partially forgotten and my father obtained a position for him in the secret service  there have been many terrible crimes laid at nikolas door but he has always managed to escape punishment  of late he has accomplished it by trumpedup evidence convicting his victims of treason against the czar and the russian police who are always only too ready to fasten guilt of this nature upon any and all have accepted his version and exonerated him  have not his attempted crimes against you and your husband forfeited whatever rights the bonds of kinship might have accorded him asked tarzan  the fact that you are his sister has not deterred him from seeking to besmirch your honor  you owe him no loyalty madame  ah but there is that other reason  if i owe him no loyalty though he be my brother i cannot so easily disavow the fear i hold him in because of a certain episode in my life of which he is cognizant  i might as well tell you all she resumed after a pause for i see that it is in my heart to tell you sooner or later  i was educated in a convent  while there i met a man whom i supposed to be a gentleman i knew little or nothing about men and less about love  i got it into my foolish head that i loved this man and at his urgent request i ran away with him  we were to have been married  i was with him just three hours  all in the daytime and in public placesrailroad stations and upon a train  when we reached our destination where we were to have been married two officers stepped up to my escort as we descended from the train and placed him under arrest  they took me also but when i had told my story they did not detain me other than to send me back to the convent under the care of a matron  it seemed that the man who had wooed me was no gentleman at all but a deserter from the army as well as a fugitive from civil justice  he had a police record in nearly every country in europe  the matter was hushed up by the authorities of the convent  not even my parents knew of it  but nikolas met the man afterward and learned the whole story  now he threatens to tell the count if i do not do just as he wishes me to  tarzan laughed  you are still but a little girl  the story that you have told me cannot reflect in any way upon your reputation and were you not a little girl at heart you would know it  go to your husband tonight and tell him the whole story just as you have told it to me unless i am much mistaken he will laugh at you for your fears and take immediate steps to put that precious brother of yours in prison where he belongs  i only wish that i dared she said but i am afraid  i learned early to fear men  first my father then nikolas then the fathers in the convent  nearly all my friends fear their husbandswhy should i not fear mine  it does not seem right that women should fear men said tarzan an expression of puzzlement on his face  i am better acquainted with the jungle folk and there it is more often the other way around except among the black men and they to my mind are in most ways lower in the scale than the beasts  no i cannot understand why civilized women should fear men the beings that are created to protect them  i should hate to think that any woman feared me  i do not think that any woman would fear you my friend said olga de coude softly  i have known you but a short while yet though it may seem foolish to say it you are the only man i have ever known whom i think that i should never fearit is strange too for you are very strong  i wondered at the ease with which you handled nikolas and paulvitch that night in my cabin  it was marvellous as tarzan was leaving her a short time later he wondered a little at the clinging pressure of her hand at parting and the firm insistence with which she exacted a promise from him that he would call again on the morrow  the memory of her halfveiled eyes and perfect lips as she had stood smiling up into his face as he bade her goodby remained with him for the balance of the day  olga de coude was a very beautiful woman and tarzan of the apes a very lonely young man with a heart in him that was in need of the doctoring that only a woman may provide  as the countess turned back into the room after tarzans departure she found herself face to face with nikolas rokoff  how long have you been here she cried shrinking away from him  since before your lover came he answered with a nasty leer  stop she commanded  how dare you say such a thing to meyour sister  well my dear olga if he is not your lover accept my apologies but it is no fault of yours that he is not  had he onetenth the knowledge of women that i have you would be in his arms this minute  he is a stupid fool olga  why your every word and act was an open invitation to him and he had not the sense to see it  the woman put her hands to her ears  i will not listen  you are wicked to say such things as that  no matter what you may threaten me with you know that i am a good woman after tonight you will not dare to annoy me for i shall tell raoul all  he will understand and then monsieur nikolas beware  you shall tell him nothing said rokoff  i have this affair now and with the help of one of your servants whom i may trust it will lack nothing in the telling when the time comes that the details of the sworn evidence shall be poured into your husbands ears  the other affair served its purpose wellwe now have something tangible to work on olga  a real affairand you a trusted wife  shame olga and the brute laughed  so the countess told her count nothing and matters were worse than they had been  from a vague fear her mind was transferred to a very tangible one  it may be too that conscience helped to enlarge it out of all proportion     chapter 5  the plot that failed   for a month tarzan was a regular and very welcome devotee at the shrine of the beautiful countess de coude  often he met other members of the select little coterie that dropped in for tea of an afternoon  more often olga found devices that would give her an hour of tarzan alone  for a time she had been frightened by what nikolas had insinuated  she had not thought of this big young man as anything more than friend but with the suggestion implanted by the evil words of her brother she had grown to speculate much upon the strange force which seemed to attract her toward the grayeyed stranger  she did not wish to love him nor did she wish his love  she was much younger than her husband and without having realized it she had been craving the haven of a friendship with one nearer her own age  twenty is shy in exchanging confidences with forty  tarzan was but two years her senior  he could understand her she felt  then he was clean and honorable and chivalrous  she was not afraid of him that she could trust him she had felt instinctively from the first  from a distance rokoff had watched this growing intimacy with malicious glee  ever since he had learned that tarzan knew that he was a russian spy there had been added to his hatred for the apeman a great fear that he would expose him  he was but waiting now until the moment was propitious for a master stroke  he wanted to rid himself forever of tarzan and at the same time reap an ample revenge for the humiliations and defeats that he had suffered at his hands  tarzan was nearer to contentment than he had been since the peace and tranquility of his jungle had been broken in upon by the advent of the marooned porter party he enjoyed the pleasant social intercourse with olgas friends while the friendship which had sprung up between the fair countess and himself was a source of neverending delight  it broke in upon and dispersed his gloomy thoughts and served as a balm to his lacerated heart  sometimes darnot accompanied him on his visits to the de coude home for he had long known both olga and the count  occasionally de coude dropped in but the multitudinous affairs of his official position and the neverending demands of politics kept him from home usually until late at night  rokoff spied upon tarzan almost constantly waiting for the time that he should call at the de coude palace at night but in this he was doomed to disappointment  on several occasions tarzan accompanied the countess to her home after the opera but he invariably left her at the entrancemuch to the disgust of the ladys devoted brother  finding that it seemed impossible to trap tarzan through any voluntary act of his own rokoff and paulvitch put their heads together to hatch a plan that would trap the apeman in all the circumstantial evidence of a compromising position  for days they watched the papers as well as the movements of de coude and tarzan  at length they were rewarded  a morning paper made brief mention of a smoker that was to be given on the following evening by the german minister  de coudes name was among those of the invited guests  if he attended this meant that he would be absent from his home until after midnight  on the night of the banquet paulvitch waited at the curb before the residence of the german minister where he could scan the face of each guest that arrived  he had not long to wait before de coude descended from his car and passed him  that was enough  paulvitch hastened back to his quarters where rokoff awaited him  there they waited until after eleven then paulvitch took down the receiver of their telephone he called a number  the apartments of lieutenant darnot he asked when he had obtained his connection  a message for monsieur tarzan if he will be so kind as to step to the telephone  for a minute there was silence  monsieur tarzan  ah yes monsieur this is francoisin the service of the countess de coude  possibly monsieur does poor francois the honor to recall himyes  yes monsieur  i have a message an urgent message from the countess she asks that you hasten to her at onceshe is in trouble monsieur  no monsieur poor francois does not know  shall i tell madame that monsieur will be here shortly  thank you monsieur  the good god will bless you  paulvitch hung up the receiver and turned to grin at rokoff  it will take him thirty minutes to get there  if you reach the german ministers in fifteen de coude should arrive at his home in about fortyfive minutes  it all depends upon whether the fool will remain fifteen minutes after he finds that a trick has been played upon him but unless i am mistaken olga will be loath to let him go in so short a time as that  here is the note for de coude  hasten  paulvitch lost no time in reaching the german ministers  at the door he handed the note to a footman  this is for the count de coude  it is very urgent  you must see that it is placed in his hands at once and he dropped a piece of silver into the willing hand of the servant then he returned to his quarters  a moment later de coude was apologizing to his host as he tore open the envelope  what he read left his face white and his hand trembling  monsieur le count de coude  one who wishes to save the honor of your name takes this means to warn you that the sanctity of your home is this minute in jeopardy  a certain man who for months has been a constant visitor there during your absence is now with your wife  if you go at once to your countess boudoir you will find them together                                                  a friend   twenty minutes after paulvitch had called tarzan rokoff obtained a connection with olgas private line  her maid answered the telephone which was in the countess boudoir  but madame has retired said the maid in answer to rokoffs request to speak with her  this is a very urgent message for the countess ears alone replied rokoff  tell her that she must arise and slip something about her and come to the telephone  i shall call up again in five minutes  then he hung up his receiver  a moment later paulvitch entered  the count has the message asked rokoff  he should be on his way to his home by now replied paulvitch  good  my lady will be sitting in her boudoir very much in negligee about now  in a minute the faithful jacques will escort monsieur tarzan into her presence without announcing him  it will take a few minutes for explanations  olga will look very alluring in the filmy creation that is her nightdress and the clinging robe which but half conceals the charms that the former does not conceal at all  olga will be surprised but not displeased  if there is a drop of red blood in the man the count will break in upon a very pretty love scene in about fifteen minutes from now  i think we have planned marvelously my dear alexis  let us go out and drink to the very good health of monsieur tarzan in some of old plancons unparalleled absinth not forgetting that the count de coude is one of the best swordsmen in paris and by far the best shot in all france  when tarzan reached olgas jacques was awaiting him at the entrance  this way monsieur he said and led the way up the broad marble staircase  in another moment he had opened a door and drawing aside a heavy curtain obsequiously bowed tarzan into a dimly lighted apartment  then jacques vanished  across the room from him tarzan saw olga seated before a little desk on which stood her telephone  she was tapping impatiently upon the polished surface of the desk  she had not heard him enter  olga he said what is wrong  she turned toward him with a little cry of alarm  jean she cried  what are you doing here  who admitted you  what does it mean  tarzan was thunderstruck but in an instant he realized a part of the truth  then you did not send for me olga  send for you at this time of night  mon dieu  jean do you think that i am quite mad  francois telephoned me to come at once that you were in trouble and wanted me  francois  who in the world is francois  he said that he was in your service  he spoke as though i should recall the fact  there is no one by that name in my employ  some one has played a joke upon you jean and olga laughed  i fear that it may be a most sinister joke olga he replied there is more back of it than humor  what do you mean  you do not think that  where is the count he interrupted  at the german ambassadors  this is another move by your estimable brother  tomorrow the count will hear of it  he will question the servants  everything will point toto what rokoff wishes the count to think  the scoundrel cried olga  she had arisen and come close to tarzan where she stood looking up into his face  she was very frightened  in her eyes was an expression that the hunter sees in those of a poor terrified doepuzzledquestioning  she trembled and to steady herself raised her hands to his broad shoulders  what shall we do jean she whispered  it is terrible  tomorrow all paris will read of ithe will see to that  her look her attitude her words were eloquent of the ageold appeal of defenseless woman to her natural protectorman  tarzan took one of the warm little hands that lay on his breast in his own strong one the act was quite involuntary and almost equally so was the instinct of protection that threw a sheltering arm around the girls shoulders  the result was electrical  never before had he been so close to her in startled guilt they looked suddenly into each others eyes and where olga de coude should have been strong she was weak for she crept closer into the mans arms and clasped her own about his neck  and tarzan of the apes  he took the panting figure into his mighty arms and covered the hot lips with kisses  raoul de coude made hurried excuses to his host after he had read the note handed him by the ambassadors butler  never afterward could he recall the nature of the excuses he made  everything was quite a blur to him up to the time that he stood on the threshold of his own home then he became very cool moving quietly and with caution  for some inexplicable reason jacques had the door open before he was halfway to the steps  it did not strike him at the time as being unusual though afterward he remarked it  very softly he tiptoed up the stairs and along the gallery to the door of his wifes boudoir  in his hand was a heavy walking stickin his heart murder  olga was the first to see him  with a horrified shriek she tore herself from tarzans arms and the apeman turned just in time to ward with his arm a terrific blow that de coude had aimed at his head once twice three times the heavy stick fell with lightning rapidity and each blow aided in the transition of the apeman back to the primordial  with the low guttural snarl of the bull ape he sprang for the frenchman  the great stick was torn from his grasp and broken in two as though it had been matchwood to be flung aside as the now infuriated beast charged for his adversarys throat  olga de coude stood a horrified spectator of the terrible scene which ensued during the next brief moment then she sprang to where tarzan was murdering her husbandchoking the life from himshaking him as a terrier might shake a rat  frantically she tore at his great hands  mother of god she cried you are killing him you are killing him  oh jean you are killing my husband  tarzan was deaf with rage  suddenly he hurled the body to the floor and placing his foot upon the upturned breast raised his head  then through the palace of the count de coude rang the awesome challenge of the bull ape that has made a kill  from cellar to attic the horrid sound searched out the servants and left them blanched and trembling the woman in the room sank to her knees beside the body of her husband and prayed  slowly the red mist faded from before tarzans eyes  things began to take formhe was regaining the perspective of civilized man  his eyes fell upon the figure of the kneeling woman  olga he whispered  she looked up expecting to see the maniacal light of murder in the eyes above her  instead she saw sorrow and contrition  oh jean she cried  see what you have done  he was my husband  i loved him and you have killed him  very gently tarzan raised the limp form of the count de coude and bore it to a couch  then he put his ear to the mans breast  some brandy olga he said  she brought it and together they forced it between his lips presently a faint gasp came from the white lips  the head turned and de coude groaned  he will not die said tarzan  thank god  why did you do it jean she asked  i do not know  he struck me and i went mad  i have seen the apes of my tribe do the same thing  i have never told you my story olga  it would have been better had you known itthis might not have happened i never saw my father  the only mother i knew was a ferocious sheape until i was fifteen i had never seen a human being  i was twenty before i saw a white man  a little more than a year ago i was a naked beast of prey in an african jungle  do not judge me too harshly  two years is too short a time in which to attempt to work the change in an individual that it has taken countless ages to accomplish in the white race  i do not judge at all jean  the fault is mine  you must go nowhe must not find you here when he regains consciousness  goodby  it was a sorrowful tarzan who walked with bowed head from the palace of the count de coude  once outside his thoughts took definite shape to the end that twenty minutes later he entered a police station not far from the rue maule here he soon found one of the officers with whom he had had the encounter several weeks previous  the policeman was genuinely glad to see again the man who had so roughly handled him  after a moment of conversation tarzan asked if he had ever heard of nikolas rokoff or alexis paulvitch  very often indeed monsieur  each has a police record and while there is nothing charged against them now we make it a point to know pretty well where they may be found should the occasion demand  it is only the same precaution that we take with every known criminal  why does monsieur ask  they are known to me replied tarzan  i wish to see monsieur rokoff on a little matter of business  if you can direct me to his lodgings i shall appreciate it  a few minutes later he bade the policeman adieu and with a slip of paper in his pocket bearing a certain address in a semirespectable quarter he walked briskly toward the nearest taxi stand  rokoff and paulvitch had returned to their rooms and were sitting talking over the probable outcome of the evenings events  they had telephoned to the offices of two of the morning papers from which they momentarily expected representatives to hear the first report of the scandal that was to stir social paris on the morrow  a heavy step sounded on the stairway  ah but these newspaper men are prompt exclaimed rokoff and as a knock fell upon the door of their room  enter monsieur  the smile of welcome froze upon the russians face as he looked into the hard gray eyes of his visitor  name of a name he shouted springing to his feet what brings you here  sit down said tarzan so low that the men could barely catch the words but in a tone that brought rokoff to his chair and kept paulvitch in his  you know what has brought me here he continued in the same low tone  it should be to kill you but because you are olga de coudes brother i shall not do thatnow  i shall give you a chance for your lives  paulvitch does not count muchhe is merely a stupid foolish little tool and so i shall not kill him so long as i permit you to live  before i leave you two alive in this room you will have done two things  the first will be to write a full confession of your connection with tonights plotand sign it  the second will be to promise me upon pain of death that you will permit no word of this affair to get into the newspapers  if you do not do both neither of you will be alive when i pass next through that doorway  do you understand and without waiting for a reply  make haste there is ink before you and paper and a pen  rokoff assumed a truculent air attempting by bravado to show how little he feared tarzans threats  an instant later he felt the apemans steel fingers at his throat and paulvitch who attempted to dodge them and reach the door was lifted completely off the floor and hurled senseless into a corner  when rokoff commenced to blacken about the face tarzan released his hold and shoved the fellow back into his chair  after a moment of coughing rokoff sat sullenly glaring at the man standing opposite him  presently paulvitch came to himself and limped painfully back to his chair at tarzans command  now write said the apeman  if it is necessary to handle you again i shall not be so lenient  rokoff picked up a pen and commenced to write  see that you omit no detail and that you mention every name cautioned tarzan  presently there was a knock at the door  enter said tarzan  a dapper young man came in  i am from the matin he announced  i understand that monsieur rokoff has a story for me  then you are mistaken monsieur replied tarzan  you have no story for publication have you my dear nikolas  rokoff looked up from his writing with an ugly scowl upon his face  no he growled i have no story for publicationnow  nor ever my dear nikolas and the reporter did not see the nasty light in the apemans eye but nikolas rokoff did  nor ever he repeated hastily  it is too bad that monsieur has been troubled said tarzan turning to the newspaper man  i bid monsieur good evening and he bowed the dapper young man out of the room and closed the door in his face  an hour later tarzan with a rather bulky manuscript in his coat pocket turned at the door leading from rokoffs room  were i you i should leave france he said for sooner or later i shall find an excuse to kill you that will not in any way compromise your sister     chapter 6  a duel   darnot was asleep when tarzan entered their apartments after leaving rokoffs  tarzan did not disturb him but the following morning he narrated the happenings of the previous evening omitting not a single detail  what a fool i have been he concluded  de coude and his wife were both my friends  how have i returned their friendship  barely did i escape murdering the count  i have cast a stigma on the name of a good woman  it is very probable that i have broken up a happy home  do you love olga de coude asked darnot  were i not positive that she does not love me i could not answer your question paul but without disloyalty to her i tell you that i do not love her nor does she love me  for an instant we were the victims of a sudden madnessit was not loveand it would have left us unharmed as suddenly as it had come upon us even though de coude had not returned  as you know i have had little experience of women  olga de coude is very beautiful that and the dim light and the seductive surroundings and the appeal of the defenseless for protection might have been resisted by a more civilized man but my civilization is not even skin deepit does not go deeper than my clothes  paris is no place for me  i will but continue to stumble into more and more serious pitfalls  the manmade restrictions are irksome  i feel always that i am a prisoner  i cannot endure it my friend and so i think that i shall go back to my own jungle and lead the life that god intended that i should lead when he put me there  do not take it so to heart jean responded darnot  you have acquitted yourself much better than most civilized men would have under similar circumstances  as to leaving paris at this time i rather think that raoul de coude may be expected to have something to say on that subject before long  nor was darnot mistaken  a week later on monsieur flaubert was announced about eleven in the morning as darnot and tarzan were breakfasting  monsieur flaubert was an impressively polite gentleman with many low bows he delivered monsieur le count de coudes challenge to monsieur tarzan  would monsieur be so very kind as to arrange to have a friend meet monsieur flaubert at as early an hour as convenient that the details might be arranged to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned  certainly  monsieur tarzan would be delighted to place his interests unreservedly in the hands of his friend lieutenant darnot  and so it was arranged that darnot was to call on monsieur flaubert at two that afternoon and the polite monsieur flaubert with many bows left them  when they were again alone darnot looked quizzically at tarzan  well he said  now to my sins i must add murder or else myself be killed said tarzan  i am progressing rapidly in the ways of my civilized brothers  what weapons shall you select asked darnot  de coude is accredited with being a master with the sword and a splendid shot  i might then choose poisoned arrows at twenty paces or spears at the same distance laughed tarzan  make it pistols paul  he will kill you jean  i have no doubt of it replied tarzan  i must die some day  we had better make it swords said darnot  he will be satisfied with wounding you and there is less danger of a mortal wound pistols said tarzan with finality  darnot tried to argue him out of it but without avail so pistols it was  darnot returned from his conference with monsieur flaubert shortly after four  it is all arranged he said  everything is satisfactory  tomorrow morning at daylightthere is a secluded spot on the road not far from etamps  for some personal reason monsieur flaubert preferred it  i did not demur  good was tarzans only comment  he did not refer to the matter again even indirectly  that night he wrote several letters before he retired  after sealing and addressing them he placed them all in an envelope addressed to darnot  as he undressed darnot heard him humming a musichall ditty  the frenchman swore under his breath  he was very unhappy for he was positive that when the sun rose the next morning it would look down upon a dead tarzan  it grated upon him to see tarzan so unconcerned  this is a most uncivilized hour for people to kill each other remarked the apeman when he had been routed out of a comfortable bed in the blackness of the early morning hours  he had slept well and so it seemed that his head scarcely touched the pillow ere his man deferentially aroused him  his remark was addressed to darnot who stood fully dressed in the doorway of tarzans bedroom  darnot had scarcely slept at all during the night  he was nervous and therefore inclined to be irritable  i presume you slept like a baby all night he said  tarzan laughed  from your tone paul i infer that you rather harbor the fact against me  i could not help it really  no jean it is not that replied darnot himself smiling  but you take the entire matter with such infernal indifferenceit is exasperating  one would think that you were going out to shoot at a target rather than to face one of the best shots in france  tarzan shrugged his shoulders  i am going out to expiate a great wrong paul  a very necessary feature of the expiation is the marksmanship of my opponent  wherefore then should i be dissatisfied  have you not yourself told me that count de coude is a splendid marksman  you mean that you hope to be killed exclaimed darnot in horror  i cannot say that i hope to be but you must admit that there is little reason to believe that i shall not be killed  had darnot known the thing that was in the apemans mindthat had been in his mind almost from the first intimation that de coude would call him to account on the field of honorhe would have been even more horrified than he was  in silence they entered darnots great car and in similar silence they sped over the dim road that leads to etamps  each man was occupied with his own thoughts  darnots were very mournful for he was genuinely fond of tarzan  the great friendship which had sprung up between these two men whose lives and training had been so widely different had but been strengthened by association for they were both men to whom the same high ideals of manhood of personal courage and of honor appealed with equal force  they could understand one another and each could be proud of the friendship of the other  tarzan of the apes was wrapped in thoughts of the past pleasant memories of the happier occasions of his lost jungle life  he recalled the countless boyhood hours that he had spent crosslegged upon the table in his dead fathers cabin his little brown body bent over one of the fascinating picture books from which unaided he had gleaned the secret of the printed language long before the sounds of human speech fell upon his ears  a smile of contentment softened his strong face as he thought of that day of days that he had had alone with jane porter in the heart of his primeval forest  presently his reminiscences were broken in upon by the stopping of the carthey were at their destination  tarzans mind returned to the affairs of the moment  he knew that he was about to die but there was no fear of death in him  to a denizen of the cruel jungle death is a commonplace  the first law of nature compels them to cling tenaciously to lifeto fight for it but it does not teach them to fear death  darnot and tarzan were first upon the field of honor  a moment later de coude monsieur flaubert and a third gentleman arrived  the last was introduced to darnot and tarzan he was a physician  darnot and monsieur flaubert spoke together in whispers for a brief time  the count de coude and tarzan stood apart at opposite sides of the field  presently the seconds summoned them  darnot and monsieur flaubert had examined both pistols  the two men who were to face each other a moment later stood silently while monsieur flaubert recited the conditions they were to observe  they were to stand back to back  at a signal from monsieur flaubert they were to walk in opposite directions their pistols hanging by their sides  when each had proceeded ten paces darnot was to give the final signalthen they were to turn and fire at will until one fell or each had expended the three shots allowed  while monsieur flaubert spoke tarzan selected a cigarette from his case and lighted it  de coude was the personification of coolnesswas he not the best shot in france  presently monsieur flaubert nodded to darnot and each man placed his principal in position  are you quite ready gentlemen asked monsieur flaubert  quite replied de coude  tarzan nodded  monsieur flaubert gave the signal  he and darnot stepped back a few paces to be out of the line of fire as the men paced slowly apart  six  seven  eight  there were tears in darnots eyes  he loved tarzan very much  nine  another pace and the poor lieutenant gave the signal he so hated to give  to him it sounded the doom of his best friend  quickly de coude wheeled and fired  tarzan gave a little start  his pistol still dangled at his side  de coude hesitated as though waiting to see his antagonist crumple to the ground  the frenchman was too experienced a marksman not to know that he had scored a hit  still tarzan made no move to raise his pistol  de coude fired once more but the attitude of the apemanthe utter indifference that was so apparent in every line of the nonchalant ease of his giant figure and the even unruffled puffing of his cigarettehad disconcerted the best marksman in france  this time tarzan did not start but again de coude knew that he had hit  suddenly the explanation leaped to his mindhis antagonist was coolly taking these terrible chances in the hope that he would receive no staggering wound from any of de coudes three shots  then he would take his own time about shooting de coude down deliberately coolly and in cold blood  a little shiver ran up the frenchmans spine  it was fiendishdiabolical  what manner of creature was this that could stand complacently with two bullets in him waiting for the third  and so de coude took careful aim this time but his nerve was gone and he made a clean miss  not once had tarzan raised his pistol hand from where it hung beside his leg  for a moment the two stood looking straight into each others eyes  on tarzans face was a pathetic expression of disappointment  on de coudes a rapidly growing expression of horroryes of terror  he could endure it no longer  mother of god  monsieurshoot he screamed  but tarzan did not raise his pistol  instead he advanced toward de coude and when darnot and monsieur flaubert misinterpreting his intention would have rushed between them he raised his left hand in a sign of remonstrance  do not fear he said to them i shall not harm him  it was most unusual but they halted  tarzan advanced until he was quite close to de coude  there must have been something wrong with monsieurs pistol he said or monsieur is unstrung  take mine monsieur and try again and tarzan offered his pistol butt foremost to the astonished de coude  mon dieu monsieur cried the latter  are you mad  no my friend replied the apeman but i deserve to die  it is the only way in which i may atone for the wrong i have done a very good woman  take my pistol and do as i bid  it would be murder replied de coude  but what wrong did you do my wife  she swore to me that  i do not mean that said tarzan quickly  you saw all the wrong that passed between us  but that was enough to cast a shadow upon her name and to ruin the happiness of a man against whom i had no enmity  the fault was all mine and so i hoped to die for it this morning  i am disappointed that monsieur is not so wonderful a marksman as i had been led to believe  you say that the fault was all yours asked de coude eagerly  all mine monsieur  your wife is a very pure woman  she loves only you  the fault that you saw was all mine  the thing that brought me there was no fault of either the countess de coude or myself  here is a paper which will quite positively demonstrate that and tarzan drew from his pocket the statement rokoff had written and signed  de coude took it and read  darnot and monsieur flaubert had drawn near  they were interested spectators of this strange ending of a strange duel  none spoke until de coude had quite finished then he looked up at tarzan  you are a very brave and chivalrous gentleman he said  i thank god that i did not kill you  de coude was a frenchman  frenchmen are impulsive  he threw his arms about tarzan and embraced him  monsieur flaubert embraced darnot there was no one to embrace the doctor  so possibly it was pique which prompted him to interfere and demand that he be permitted to dress tarzans wounds  this gentleman was hit once at least he said  possibly thrice  twice said tarzan  once in the left shoulder and again in the left sideboth flesh wounds i think  but the doctor insisted upon stretching him upon the sward and tinkering with him until the wounds were cleansed and the flow of blood checked  one result of the duel was that they all rode back to paris together in darnots car the best of friends  de coude was so relieved to have had this double assurance of his wifes loyalty that he felt no rancor at all toward tarzan  it is true that the latter had assumed much more of the fault than was rightly his but if he lied a little he may be excused for he lied in the service of a woman and he lied like a gentleman  the apeman was confined to his bed for several days  he felt that it was foolish and unnecessary but the doctor and darnot took the matter so to heart that he gave in to please them though it made him laugh to think of it  it is droll he said to darnot  to lie abed because of a pin prick  why when bolgani the king gorilla tore me almost to pieces while i was still but a little boy did i have a nice soft bed to lie on  no only the damp rotting vegetation of the jungle  hidden beneath some friendly bush i lay for days and weeks with only kala to nurse mepoor faithful kala who kept the insects from my wounds and warned off the beasts of prey  when i called for water she brought it to me in her own mouththe only way she knew to carry it  there was no sterilized gauze there was no antiseptic bandagethere was nothing that would not have driven our dear doctor mad to have seen  yet i recoveredrecovered to lie in bed because of a tiny scratch that one of the jungle folk would scarce realize unless it were upon the end of his nose  but the time was soon over and before he realized it tarzan found himself abroad again  several times de coude had called and when he found that tarzan was anxious for employment of some nature he promised to see what could be done to find a berth for him  it was the first day that tarzan was permitted to go out that he received a message from de coude requesting him to call at the counts office that afternoon  he found de coude awaiting him with a very pleasant welcome and a sincere congratulation that he was once more upon his feet  neither had ever mentioned the duel or the cause of it since that morning upon the field of honor  i think that i have found just the thing for you monsieur tarzan said the count  it is a position of much trust and responsibility which also requires considerably physical courage and prowess  i cannot imagine a man better fitted than you my dear monsieur tarzan for this very position  it will necessitate travel and later it may lead to a very much better postpossibly in the diplomatic service  at first for a short time only you will be a special agent in the service of the ministry of war  come i will take you to the gentleman who will be your chief  he can explain the duties better than i and then you will be in a position to judge if you wish to accept or no  de coude himself escorted tarzan to the office of general rochere the chief of the bureau to which tarzan would be attached if he accepted the position  there the count left him after a glowing description to the general of the many attributes possessed by the apeman which should fit him for the work of the service  a half hour later tarzan walked out of the office the possessor of the first position he had ever held  on the morrow he was to return for further instructions though general rochere had made it quite plain that tarzan might prepare to leave paris for an almost indefinite period possibly on the morrow  it was with feelings of the keenest elation that he hastened home to bear the good news to darnot  at last he was to be of some value in the world  he was to earn money and best of all to travel and see the world  he could scarcely wait to get well inside darnots sitting room before he burst out with the glad tidings  darnot was not so pleased  it seems to delight you to think that you are to leave paris and that we shall not see each other for months perhaps  tarzan you are a most ungrateful beast and darnot laughed  no paul i am a little child  i have a new toy and i am tickled to death  and so it came that on the following day tarzan left paris en route for marseilles and oran     chapter 7  the dancing girl of sidi aissa   tarzans first mission did not bid fair to be either exciting or vastly important  there was a certain lieutenant of spahis whom the government had reason to suspect of improper relations with a great european power  this lieutenant gernois who was at present stationed at sidibelabbes had recently been attached to the general staff where certain information of great military value had come into his possession in the ordinary routine of his duties  it was this information which the government suspected the great power was bartering for with the officer  it was at most but a vague hint dropped by a certain notorious parisienne in a jealous mood that had caused suspicion to rest upon the lieutenant  but general staffs are jealous of their secrets and treason so serious a thing that even a hint of it may not be safely neglected  and so it was that tarzan had come to algeria in the guise of an american hunter and traveler to keep a close eye upon lieutenant gernois  he had looked forward with keen delight to again seeing his beloved africa but this northern aspect of it was so different from his tropical jungle home that he might as well have been back in paris for all the heart thrills of homecoming that he experienced  at oran he spent a day wandering through the narrow crooked alleys of the arab quarter enjoying the strange new sights  the next day found him at sidibelabbes where he presented his letters of introduction to both civil and military authoritiesletters which gave no clew to the real significance of his mission  tarzan possessed a sufficient command of english to enable him to pass among arabs and frenchmen as an american and that was all that was required of it  when he met an englishman he spoke french in order that he might not betray himself but occasionally talked in english to foreigners who understood that tongue but could not note the slight imperfections of accent and pronunciation that were his  here he became acquainted with many of the french officers and soon became a favorite among them  he met gernois whom he found to be a taciturn dyspepticlooking man of about forty having little or no social intercourse with his fellows  for a month nothing of moment occurred  gernois apparently had no visitors nor did he on his occasional visits to the town hold communication with any who might even by the wildest flight of imagination be construed into secret agents of a foreign power  tarzan was beginning to hope that after all the rumor might have been false when suddenly gernois was ordered to bou saada in the petit sahara far to the south  a company of spahis and three officers were to relieve another company already stationed there  fortunately one of the officers captain gerard had become an excellent friend of tarzans and so when the apeman suggested that he should embrace the opportunity of accompanying him to bou saada where he expected to find hunting it caused not the slightest suspicion  at bouira the detachment detrained and the balance of the journey was made in the saddle  as tarzan was dickering at bouira for a mount he caught a brief glimpse of a man in european clothes eying him from the doorway of a native coffeehouse but as tarzan looked the man turned and entered the little lowceilinged mud hut and but for a haunting impression that there had been something familiar about the face or figure of the fellow tarzan gave the matter no further thought  the march to aumale was fatiguing to tarzan whose equestrian experiences hitherto had been confined to a course of riding lessons in a parisian academy and so it was that he quickly sought the comforts of a bed in the hotel grossat while the officers and troops took up their quarters at the military post  although tarzan was called early the following morning the company of spahis was on the march before he had finished his breakfast  he was hurrying through his meal that the soldiers might not get too far in advance of him when he glanced through the door connecting the dining room with the bar  to his surprise he saw gernois standing there in conversation with the very stranger he had seen in the coffeehouse at bouira the day previous  he could not be mistaken for there was the same strangely familiar attitude and figure though the mans back was toward him  as his eyes lingered on the two gernois looked up and caught the intent expression on tarzans face  the stranger was talking in a low whisper at the time but the french officer immediately interrupted him and the two at once turned away and passed out of the range of tarzans vision  this was the first suspicious occurrence that tarzan had ever witnessed in connection with gernois actions but he was positive that the men had left the barroom solely because gernois had caught tarzans eyes upon them then there was the persistent impression of familiarity about the stranger to further augment the apemans belief that here at length was something which would bear watching  a moment later tarzan entered the barroom but the men had left nor did he see aught of them in the street beyond though he found a pretext to ride to various shops before he set out after the column which had now considerable start of him  he did not overtake them until he reached sidi aissa shortly after noon where the soldiers had halted for an hours rest  here he found gernois with the column but there was no sign of the stranger  it was market day at sidi aissa and the numberless caravans of camels coming in from the desert and the crowds of bickering arabs in the market place filled tarzan with a consuming desire to remain for a day that he might see more of these sons of the desert  thus it was that the company of spahis marched on that afternoon toward bou saada without him  he spent the hours until dark wandering about the market in company with a youthful arab one abdul who had been recommended to him by the innkeeper as a trustworthy servant and interpreter  here tarzan purchased a better mount than the one he had selected at bouira and entering into conversation with the stately arab to whom the animal had belonged learned that the seller was kadour ben saden sheik of a desert tribe far south of djelfa  through abdul tarzan invited his new acquaintance to dine with him  as the three were making their way through the crowds of marketers camels donkeys and horses that filled the market place with a confusing babel of sounds abdul plucked at tarzans sleeve  look master behind us and he turned pointing at a figure which disappeared behind a camel as tarzan turned  he has been following us about all afternoon continued abdul  i caught only a glimpse of an arab in a darkblue burnoose and white turban replied tarzan  is it he you mean  yes  i suspected him because he seems a stranger here without other business than following us which is not the way of the arab who is honest and also because he keeps the lower part of his face hidden only his eyes showing  he must be a bad man or he would have honest business of his own to occupy his time  he is on the wrong scent then abdul replied tarzan for no one here can have any grievance against me  this is my first visit to your country and none knows me  he will soon discover his error and cease to follow us  unless he be bent on robbery returned abdul  then all we can do is wait until he is ready to try his hand upon us laughed tarzan and i warrant that he will get his bellyful of robbing now that we are prepared for him and so he dismissed the subject from his mind though he was destined to recall it before many hours through a most unlookedfor occurrence  kadour ben saden having dined well prepared to take leave of his host  with dignified protestations of friendship he invited tarzan to visit him in his wild domain where the antelope the stag the boar the panther and the lion might still be found in sufficient numbers to tempt an ardent huntsman  on his departure the apeman with abdul wandered again into the streets of sidi aissa where he was soon attracted by the wild din of sound coming from the open doorway of one of the numerous cafes maures it was after eight and the dancing was in full swing as tarzan entered  the room was filled to repletion with arabs  all were smoking and drinking their thick hot coffee  tarzan and abdul found seats near the center of the room though the terrific noise produced by the musicians upon their arab drums and pipes would have rendered a seat farther from them more acceptable to the quietloving apeman  a rather goodlooking oulednail was dancing and perceiving tarzans european clothes and scenting a generous gratuity she threw her silken handkerchief upon his shoulder to be rewarded with a franc  when her place upon the floor had been taken by another the brighteyed abdul saw her in conversation with two arabs at the far side of the room near a side door that let upon an inner court around the gallery of which were the rooms occupied by the girls who danced in this cafe  at first he thought nothing of the matter but presently he noticed from the corner of his eye one of the men nod in their direction and the girl turn and shoot a furtive glance at tarzan  then the arabs melted through the doorway into the darkness of the court  when it came again the girls turn to dance she hovered close to tarzan and for the apeman alone were her sweetest smiles  many an ugly scowl was cast upon the tall european by swarthy darkeyed sons of the desert but neither smiles nor scowls produced any outwardly visible effect upon him  again the girl cast her handkerchief upon his shoulder and again was she rewarded with a franc piece  as she was sticking it upon her forehead after the custom of her kind she bent low toward tarzan whispering a quick word in his ear  there are two without in the court she said quickly in broken french who would harm msieur  at first i promised to lure you to them but you have been kind and i cannot do it  go quickly before they find that i have failed them  i think that they are very bad men  tarzan thanked the girl assuring her that he would be careful and having finished her dance she crossed to the little doorway and went out into the court  but tarzan did not leave the cafe as she had urged  for another half hour nothing unusual occurred then a surlylooking arab entered the cafe from the street  he stood near tarzan where he deliberately made insulting remarks about the european but as they were in his native tongue tarzan was entirely innocent of their purport until abdul took it upon himself to enlighten him  this fellow is looking for trouble warned abdul  he is not alone in fact in case of a disturbance nearly every man here would be against you  it would be better to leave quietly master  ask the fellow what he wants commanded tarzan  he says that the dog of a christian insulted the oulednail who belongs to him  he means trouble msieur  tell him that i did not insult his or any other oulednail that i wish him to go away and leave me alone  that i have no quarrel with him nor has he any with me  he says replied abdul after delivering this message to the arab that besides being a dog yourself that you are the son of one and that your grandmother was a hyena  incidentally you are a liar  the attention of those near by had now been attracted by the altercation and the sneering laughs that followed this torrent of invective easily indicated the trend of the sympathies of the majority of the audience  tarzan did not like being laughed at neither did he relish the terms applied to him by the arab but he showed no sign of anger as he arose from his seat upon the bench  a half smile played about his lips but of a sudden a mighty fist shot into the face of the scowling arab and back of it were the terrible muscles of the apeman  at the instant that the man fell a half dozen fierce plainsmen sprang into the room from where they had apparently been waiting for their cue in the street before the cafe  with cries of kill the unbeliever and down with the dog of a christian they made straight for tarzan a number of the younger arabs in the audience sprang to their feet to join in the assault upon the unarmed white man  tarzan and abdul were rushed back toward the end of the room by the very force of numbers opposing them  the young arab remained loyal to his master and with drawn knife fought at his side  with tremendous blows the apeman felled all who came within reach of his powerful hands  he fought quietly and without a word upon his lips the same half smile they had worn as he rose to strike down the man who had insulted him  it seemed impossible that either he or abdul could survive the sea of wickedlooking swords and knives that surrounded them but the very numbers of their assailants proved the best bulwark of their safety  so closely packed was the howling cursing mob that no weapon could be wielded to advantage and none of the arabs dared use a firearm for fear of wounding one of his compatriots  finally tarzan succeeded in seizing one of the most persistent of his attackers  with a quick wrench he disarmed the fellow and then holding him before them as a shield he backed slowly beside abdul toward the little door which led into the inner courtyard  at the threshold he paused for an instant and lifting the struggling arab above his head hurled him as though from a catapult full in the faces of his onpressing fellows  then tarzan and abdul stepped into the semidarkness of the court  the frightened oulednails were crouching at the tops of the stairs which led to their respective rooms the only light in the courtyard coming from the sickly candles which each girl had stuck with its own grease to the woodwork of her doorframe the better to display her charms to those who might happen to traverse the dark inclosure  scarcely had tarzan and abdul emerged from the room ere a revolver spoke close at their backs from the shadows beneath one of the stairways and as they turned to meet this new antagonist two muffled figures sprang toward them firing as they came  tarzan leaped to meet these two new assailants  the foremost lay a second later in the trampled dirt of the court disarmed and groaning from a broken wrist abduls knife found the vitals of the second in the instant that the fellows revolver missed fire as he held it to the faithful arabs forehead  the maddened horde within the cafe were now rushing out in pursuit of their quarry  the oulednails had extinguished their candles at a cry from one of their number and the only light within the yard came feebly from the open and halfblocked door of the cafe  tarzan had seized a sword from the man who had fallen before abduls knife and now he stood waiting for the rush of men that was coming in search of them through the darkness  suddenly he felt a light hand upon his shoulder from behind and a womans voice whispering quick msieur this way  follow me  come abdul said tarzan in a low tone to the youth we can be no worse off elsewhere than we are here  the woman turned and led them up the narrow stairway that ended at the door of her quarters  tarzan was close beside her  he saw the gold and silver bracelets upon her bare arms the strings of gold coin that depended from her hair ornaments and the gorgeous colors of her dress he saw that she was a oulednail and instinctively he knew that she was the same who had whispered the warning in his ear earlier in the evening  as they reached the top of the stairs they could hear the angry crowd searching the yard beneath  soon they will search here whispered the girl  they must not find you for though you fight with the strength of many men they will kill you in the end  hasten you can drop from the farther window of my room to the street beyond  before they discover that you are no longer in the court of the buildings you will be safe within the hotel  but even as she spoke several men had started up the stairway at the head of which they stood  there was a sudden cry from one of the searchers  they had been discovered  quickly the crowd rushed for the stairway  the foremost assailant leaped quickly upward but at the top he met the sudden sword that he had not expectedthe quarry had been unarmed before  with a cry the man toppled back upon those behind him  like tenpins they rolled down the stairs  the ancient and rickety structure could not withstand the strain of this unwonted weight and jarring  with a creaking and rending of breaking wood it collapsed beneath the arabs leaving tarzan abdul and the girl alone upon the frail platform at the top  come cried the oulednail  they will reach us from another stairway through the room next to mine  we have not a moment to spare  just as they were entering the room abdul heard and translated a cry from the yard below for several to hasten to the street and cut off escape from that side  we are lost now said the girl simply  we questioned tarzan  yes msieur she responded they will kill me as well  have i not aided you  this put a different aspect on the matter  tarzan had rather been enjoying the excitement and danger of the encounter  he had not for an instant supposed that either abdul or the girl could suffer except through accident and he had only retreated just enough to keep from being killed himself  he had had no intention of running away until he saw that he was hopelessly lost were he to remain  alone he could have sprung into the midst of that closepacked mob and laying about him after the fashion of numa the lion have struck the arabs with such consternation that escape would have been easy now he must think entirely of these two faithful friends  he crossed to the window which overlooked the street  in a minute there would be enemies below  already he could hear the mob clambering the stairway to the next quartersthey would be at the door beside him in another instant  he put a foot upon the sill and leaned out but he did not look down  above him within arms reach was the low roof of the building  he called to the girl  she came and stood beside him he put a great arm about her and lifted her across his shoulder  wait here until i reach down for you from above he said to abdul in the meantime shove everything in the room against that doorit may delay them long enough then he stepped to the sill of the narrow window with the girl upon his shoulders  hold tight he cautioned her  a moment later he had clambered to the roof above with the ease and dexterity of an ape  setting the girl down he leaned far over the roofs edge calling softly to abdul  the youth ran to the window  your hand whispered tarzan  the men in the room beyond were battering at the door  with a sudden crash it fell splintering in and at the same instant abdul felt himself lifted like a feather onto the roof above  they were not a moment too soon for as the men broke into the room which they had just quitted a dozen more rounded the corner in the street below and came running to a spot beneath the girls window     chapter 8  the fight in the desert   as the three squatted upon the roof above the quarters of the oulednails they heard the angry cursing of the arabs in the room beneath  abdul translated from time to time to tarzan  they are berating those in the street below now said abdul for permitting us to escape so easily  those in the street say that we did not come that waythat we are still within the building and that those above being too cowardly to attack us are attempting to deceive them into believing that we have escaped  in a moment they will have fighting of their own to attend to if they continue their brawling  presently those in the building gave up the search and returned to the cafe  a few remained in the street below smoking and talking  tarzan spoke to the girl thanking her for the sacrifice she had made for him a total stranger  i liked you she said simply  you were unlike the others who come to the cafe  you did not speak coarsely to methe manner in which you gave me money was not an insult  what shall you do after tonight he asked  you cannot return to the cafe  can you even remain with safety in sidi aissa  tomorrow it will be forgotten she replied  but i should be glad if it might be that i need never return to this or another cafe  i have not remained because i wished to i have been a prisoner  a prisoner ejaculated tarzan incredulously  a slave would be the better word she answered  i was stolen in the night from my fathers douar by a band of marauders  they brought me here and sold me to the arab who keeps this cafe  it has been nearly two years now since i saw the last of mine own people  they are very far to the south  they never come to sidi aissa  you would like to return to your people asked tarzan  then i shall promise to see you safely so far as bou saada at least  there we can doubtless arrange with the commandant to send you the rest of the way  oh msieur she cried how can i ever repay you  you cannot really mean that you will do so much for a poor oulednail  but my father can reward you and he will for is he not a great sheik  he is kadour ben saden  kadour ben saden ejaculated tarzan  why kadour ben saden is in sidi aissa this very night  he dined with me but a few hours since  my father in sidi aissa cried the amazed girl  allah be praised then for i am indeed saved  hssh cautioned abdul  listen  from below came the sound of voices quite distinguishable upon the still night air  tarzan could not understand the words but abdul and the girl translated  they have gone now said the latter  it is you they want msieur one of them said that the stranger who had offered money for your slaying lay in the house of akmed din soulef with a broken wrist but that he had offered a still greater reward if some would lay in wait for you upon the road to bou saada and kill you  it is he who followed msieur about the market today exclaimed abdul  i saw him again within the cafehim and another and the two went out into the inner court after talking with this girl here  it was they who attacked and fired upon us as we came out of the cafe why do they wish to kill you msieur  i do not know replied tarzan and then after a pause unless but he did not finish for the thought that had come to his mind while it seemed the only reasonable solution of the mystery appeared at the same time quite improbable  presently the men in the street went away the courtyard and the cafe were deserted  cautiously tarzan lowered himself to the sill of the girls window  the room was empty  he returned to the roof and let abdul down then he lowered the girl to the arms of the waiting arab  from the window abdul dropped the short distance to the street below while tarzan took the girl in his arms and leaped down as he had done on so many other occasions in his own forest with a burden in his arms a little cry of alarm was startled from the girls lips but tarzan landed in the street with but an imperceptible jar and lowered her in safety to her feet  she clung to him for a moment  how strong msieur is and how active she cried  el adrea the black lion himself is not more so  i should like to meet this el adrea of yours he said  i have heard much about him  and you come to the douar of my father you shall see him said the girl  he lives in a spur of the mountains north of us and comes down from his lair at night to rob my fathers douar  with a single blow of his mighty paw he crushes the skull of a bull and woe betide the belated wayfarer who meets el adrea abroad at night  without further mishap they reached the hotel  the sleepy landlord objected strenuously to instituting a search for kadour ben saden until the following morning but a piece of gold put a different aspect on the matter so that a few moments later a servant had started to make the rounds of the lesser native hostelries where it might be expected that a desert sheik would find congenial associations  tarzan had felt it necessary to find the girls father that night for fear he might start on his homeward journey too early in the morning to be intercepted  they had waited perhaps half an hour when the messenger returned with kadour ben saden  the old sheik entered the room with a questioning expression upon his proud face  monsieur has done me the honor to he commenced and then his eyes fell upon the girl  with outstretched arms he crossed the room to meet her  my daughter he cried  allah is merciful and tears dimmed the martial eyes of the old warrior  when the story of her abduction and her final rescue had been told to kadour ben saden he extended his hand to tarzan  all that is kadour ben sadens is thine my friend even to his life he said very simply but tarzan knew that those were no idle words  it was decided that although three of them would have to ride after practically no sleep it would be best to make an early start in the morning and attempt to ride all the way to bou saada in one day  it would have been comparatively easy for the men but for the girl it was sure to be a fatiguing journey  she however was the most anxious to undertake it for it seemed to her that she could not quickly enough reach the family and friends from whom she had been separated for two years  it seemed to tarzan that he had not closed his eyes before he was awakened and in another hour the party was on its way south toward bou saada  for a few miles the road was good and they made rapid progress but suddenly it became only a waste of sand into which the horses sank fetlock deep at nearly every step  in addition to tarzan abdul the sheik and his daughter were four of the wild plainsmen of the sheiks tribe who had accompanied him upon the trip to sidi aissa thus seven guns strong they entertained little fear of attack by day and if all went well they should reach bou saada before nightfall  a brisk wind enveloped them in the blowing sand of the desert until tarzans lips were parched and cracked  what little he could see of the surrounding country was far from alluringa vast expanse of rough country rolling in little barren hillocks and tufted here and there with clumps of dreary shrub  far to the south rose the dim lines of the saharan atlas range  how different thought tarzan from the gorgeous africa of his boyhood  abdul always on the alert looked backward quite as often as he did ahead  at the top of each hillock that they mounted he would draw in his horse and turning scan the country to the rear with utmost care at last his scrutiny was rewarded  look he cried  there are six horsemen behind us  your friends of last evening no doubt monsieur remarked kadour ben saden dryly to tarzan  no doubt replied the apeman  i am sorry that my society should endanger the safety of your journey  at the next village i shall remain and question these gentlemen while you ride on  there is no necessity for my being at bou saada tonight and less still why you should not ride in peace  if you stop we shall stop said kadour ben saden  until you are safe with your friends or the enemy has left your trail we shall remain with you  there is nothing more to say  tarzan nodded his head  he was a man of few words and possibly it was for this reason as much as any that kadour ben saden had taken to him for if there be one thing that an arab despises it is a talkative man  all the balance of the day abdul caught glimpses of the horsemen in their rear  they remained always at about the same distance  during the occasional halts for rest and at the longer halt at noon they approached no closer  they are waiting for darkness said kadour ben saden  and darkness came before they reached bou saada  the last glimpse that abdul had of the grim whiterobed figures that trailed them just before dusk made it impossible to distinguish them had made it apparent that they were rapidly closing up the distance that intervened between them and their intended quarry  he whispered this fact to tarzan for he did not wish to alarm the girl  the apeman drew back beside him  you will ride ahead with the others abdul said tarzan  this is my quarrel  i shall wait at the next convenient spot and interview these fellows  then abdul shall wait at thy side replied the young arab nor would any threats or commands move him from his decision  very well then replied tarzan  here is as good a place as we could wish  here are rocks at the top of this hillock  we shall remain hidden here and give an account of ourselves to these gentlemen when they appear  they drew in their horses and dismounted  the others riding ahead were already out of sight in the darkness  beyond them shone the lights of bou saada  tarzan removed his rifle from its boot and loosened his revolver in its holster  he ordered abdul to withdraw behind the rocks with the horses so that they should be shielded from the enemies bullets should they fire  the young arab pretended to do as he was bid but when he had fastened the two animals securely to a low shrub he crept back to lie on his belly a few paces behind tarzan  the apeman stood erect in the middle of the road waiting  nor did he have long to wait  the sound of galloping horses came suddenly out of the darkness below him and a moment later he discerned the moving blotches of lighter color against the solid background of the night  halt he cried or we fire  the white figures came to a sudden stop and for a moment there was silence  then came the sound of a whispered council and like ghosts the phantom riders dispersed in all directions  again the desert lay still about him yet it was an ominous stillness that foreboded evil  abdul raised himself to one knee  tarzan cocked his jungletrained ears and presently there came to him the sound of horses walking quietly through the sand to the east of him to the west to the north and to the south  they had been surrounded  then a shot came from the direction in which he was looking a bullet whirred through the air above his head and he fired at the flash of the enemys gun  instantly the soundless waste was torn with the quick staccato of guns upon every hand  abdul and tarzan fired only at the flashesthey could not yet see their foemen  presently it became evident that the attackers were circling their position drawing closer and closer in as they began to realize the paltry numbers of the party which opposed them  but one came too close for tarzan was accustomed to using his eyes in the darkness of the jungle night than which there is no more utter darkness this side the grave and with a cry of pain a saddle was emptied  the odds are evening abdul said tarzan with a low laugh  but they were still far too onesided and when the five remaining horsemen whirled at a signal and charged full upon them it looked as if there would be a sudden ending of the battle  both tarzan and abdul sprang to the shelter of the rocks that they might keep the enemy in front of them  there was a mad clatter of galloping hoofs a volley of shots from both sides and the arabs withdrew to repeat the maneuver but there were now only four against the two  for a few moments there came no sound from out of the surrounding blackness  tarzan could not tell whether the arabs satisfied with their losses had given up the fight or were waiting farther along the road to waylay them as they proceeded on toward bou saada  but he was not left long in doubt for now all from one direction came the sound of a new charge  but scarcely had the first gun spoken ere a dozen shots rang out behind the arabs  there came the wild shouts of a new party to the controversy and the pounding of the feet of many horses from down the road to bou saada  the arabs did not wait to learn the identity of the oncomers  with a parting volley as they dashed by the position which tarzan and abdul were holding they plunged off along the road toward sidi aissa  a moment later kadour ben saden and his men dashed up  the old sheik was much relieved to find that neither tarzan nor abdul had received a scratch  not even had their horses been wounded  they sought out the two men who had fallen before tarzans shots and finding that both were dead left them where they lay  why did you not tell me that you contemplated ambushing those fellows asked the sheik in a hurt tone  we might have had them all if the seven of us had stopped to meet them  then it would have been useless to stop at all replied tarzan for had we simply ridden on toward bou saada they would have been upon us presently and all could have been engaged  it was to prevent the transfer of my own quarrel to anothers shoulders that abdul and i stopped off to question them  then there is your daughteri could not be the cause of exposing her needlessly to the marksmanship of six men  kadour ben saden shrugged his shoulders  he did not relish having been cheated out of a fight  the little battle so close to bou saada had drawn out a company of soldiers  tarzan and his party met them just outside the town  the officer in charge halted them to learn the significance of the shots  a handful of marauders replied kadour ben saden  they attacked two of our number who had dropped behind but when we returned to them the fellows soon dispersed  they left two dead  none of my party was injured  this seemed to satisfy the officer and after taking the names of the party he marched his men on toward the scene of the skirmish to bring back the dead men for purposes of identification if possible  two days later kadour ben saden with his daughter and followers rode south through the pass below bou saada bound for their home in the far wilderness  the sheik had urged tarzan to accompany him and the girl had added her entreaties to those of her father but though he could not explain it to them tarzans duties loomed particularly large after the happenings of the past few days so that he could not think of leaving his post for an instant  but he promised to come later if it lay within his power to do so and they had to content themselves with that assurance  during these two days tarzan had spent practically all his time with kadour ben saden and his daughter  he was keenly interested in this race of stern and dignified warriors and embraced the opportunity which their friendship offered to learn what he could of their lives and customs  he even commenced to acquire the rudiments of their language under the pleasant tutorage of the browneyed girl  it was with real regret that he saw them depart and he sat his horse at the opening to the pass as far as which he had accompanied them gazing after the little party as long as he could catch a glimpse of them  here were people after his own heart  their wild rough lives filled with danger and hardship appealed to this halfsavage man as nothing had appealed to him in the midst of the effeminate civilization of the great cities he had visited  here was a life that excelled even that of the jungle for here he might have the society of menreal men whom he could honor and respect and yet be near to the wild nature that he loved  in his head revolved an idea that when he had completed his mission he would resign and return to live for the remainder of his life with the tribe of kadour ben saden  then he turned his horses head and rode slowly back to bou saada  the front of the hotel du petit sahara where tarzan stopped in bou saada is taken up with the bar two diningrooms and the kitchens both of the diningrooms open directly off the bar and one of them is reserved for the use of the officers of the garrison  as you stand in the barroom you may look into either of the diningrooms if you wish  it was to the bar that tarzan repaired after speeding kadour ben saden and his party on their way  it was yet early in the morning for kadour ben saden had elected to ride far that day so that it happened that when tarzan returned there were guests still at breakfast  as his casual glance wandered into the officers diningroom tarzan saw something which brought a look of interest to his eyes  lieutenant gernois was sitting there and as tarzan looked a whiterobed arab approached and bending whispered a few words into the lieutenants ear  then he passed on out of the building through another door  in itself the thing was nothing but as the man had stooped to speak to the officer tarzan had caught sight of something which the accidental parting of the mans burnoose had revealedhe carried his left arm in a sling     chapter 9  numa el adrea   on the same day that kadour ben saden rode south the diligence from the north brought tarzan a letter from darnot which had been forwarded from sidibelabbes  it opened the old wound that tarzan would have been glad to have forgotten yet he was not sorry that darnot had written for one at least of his subjects could never cease to interest the apeman  here is the letter  my dear jean  since last i wrote you i have been across to london on a matter of business  i was there but three days  the very first day i came upon an old friend of yoursquite unexpectedlyin henrietta street  now you never in the world would guess whom  none other than mr samuel t philander  but it is true  i can see your look of incredulity  nor is this all  he insisted that i return to the hotel with him and there i found the othersprofessor archimedes q porter miss porter and that enormous black woman miss porters maidesmeralda you will recall  while i was there clayton came in  they are to be married soon or rather sooner for i rather suspect that we shall receive announcements almost any day  on account of his fathers death it is to be a very quiet affaironly blood relatives  while i was alone with mr philander the old fellow became rather confidential  said miss porter had already postponed the wedding on three different occasions  he confided that it appeared to him that she was not particularly anxious to marry clayton at all but this time it seems that it is quite likely to go through  of course they all asked after you but i respected your wishes in the matter of your true origin and only spoke to them of your present affairs  miss porter was especially interested in everything i had to say about you and asked many questions  i am afraid i took a rather unchivalrous delight in picturing your desire and resolve to go back eventually to your native jungle  i was sorry afterward for it did seem to cause her real anguish to contemplate the awful dangers to which you wished to return  and yet she said i do not know there are more unhappy fates than the grim and terrible jungle presents to monsieur tarzan  at least his conscience will be free from remorse and there are moments of quiet and restfulness by day and vistas of exquisite beauty  you may find it strange that i should say it who experienced such terrifying experiences in that frightful forest yet at times i long to return for i cannot but feel that the happiest moments of my life were spent there  there was an expression of ineffable sadness on her face as she spoke and i could not but feel that she knew that i knew her secret and that this was her way of transmitting to you a last tender message from a heart that might still enshrine your memory though its possessor belonged to another  clayton appeared nervous and ill at ease while you were the subject of conversation  he wore a worried and harassed expression  yet he was very kindly in his expressions of interest in you  i wonder if he suspects the truth about you  tennington came in with clayton  they are great friends you know  he is about to set out upon one of his interminable cruises in that yacht of his and was urging the entire party to accompany him  tried to inveigle me into it too  is thinking of circumnavigating africa this time  i told him that his precious toy would take him and some of his friends to the bottom of the ocean one of these days if he didnt get it out of his head that she was a liner or a battleship  i returned to paris day before yesterday and yesterday i met the count and countess de coude at the races  they inquired after you  de coude really seems quite fond of you  doesnt appear to harbor the least ill will  olga is as beautiful as ever but a trifle subdued  i imagine that she learned a lesson through her acquaintance with you that will serve her in good stead during the balance of her life  it is fortunate for her and for de coude as well that it was you and not another man more sophisticated  had you really paid court to olgas heart i am afraid that there would have been no hope for either of you  she asked me to tell you that nikolas had left france  she paid him twenty thousand francs to go away and stay  she is congratulating herself that she got rid of him before he tried to carry out a threat he recently made her that he should kill you at the first opportunity she said that she should hate to think that her brothers blood was on your hands for she is very fond of you and made no bones in saying so before the count  it never for a moment seemed to occur to her that there might be any possibility of any other outcome of a meeting between you and nikolas  the count quite agreed with her in that  he added that it would take a regiment of rokoffs to kill you  he has a most healthy respect for your prowess  have been ordered back to my ship  she sails from havre in two days under sealed orders  if you will address me in her care the letters will find me eventually  i shall write you as soon as another opportunity presents                                      your sincere friend                                                 paul darnot   i fear mused tarzan half aloud that olga has thrown away her twenty thousand francs  he read over that part of darnots letter several times in which he had quoted from his conversation with jane porter  tarzan derived a rather pathetic happiness from it but it was better than no happiness at all  the following three weeks were quite uneventful  on several occasions tarzan saw the mysterious arab and once again he had been exchanging words with lieutenant gernois but no amount of espionage or shadowing by tarzan revealed the arabs lodgings the location of which tarzan was anxious to ascertain  gernois never cordial had kept more than ever aloof from tarzan since the episode in the diningroom of the hotel at aumale  his attitude on the few occasions that they had been thrown together had been distinctly hostile  that he might keep up the appearance of the character he was playing tarzan spent considerable time hunting in the vicinity of bou saada he would spend entire days in the foothills ostensibly searching for gazelle but on the few occasions that he came close enough to any of the beautiful little animals to harm them he invariably allowed them to escape without so much as taking his rifle from its boot  the apeman could see no sport in slaughtering the most harmless and defenseless of gods creatures for the mere pleasure of killing  in fact tarzan had never killed for pleasure nor to him was there pleasure in killing  it was the joy of righteous battle that he lovedthe ecstasy of victory  and the keen and successful hunt for food in which he pitted his skill and craftiness against the skill and craftiness of another but to come out of a town filled with food to shoot down a softeyed pretty gazelleah that was crueller than the deliberate and coldblooded murder of a fellow man  tarzan would have none of it and so he hunted alone that none might discover the sham that he was practicing  and once probably because of the fact that he rode alone he was like to have lost his life  he was riding slowly through a little ravine when a shot sounded close behind him and a bullet passed through the cork helmet he wore  although he turned at once and galloped rapidly to the top of the ravine there was no sign of any enemy nor did he see aught of another human being until he reached bou saada  yes he soliloquized in recalling the occurrence olga has indeed thrown away her twenty thousand francs  that night he was captain gerards guest at a little dinner  your hunting has not been very fortunate questioned the officer  no replied tarzan the game hereabout is timid nor do i care particularly about hunting game birds or antelope  i think i shall move on farther south and have a try at some of your algerian lions  good exclaimed the captain  we are marching toward djelfa on the morrow  you shall have company that far at least  lieutenant gernois and i with a hundred men are ordered south to patrol a district in which the marauders are giving considerable trouble  possibly we may have the pleasure of hunting the lion togetherwhat say you  tarzan was more than pleased nor did he hesitate to say so but the captain would have been astonished had he known the real reason of tarzans pleasure  gernois was sitting opposite the apeman  he did not seem so pleased with his captains invitation  you will find lion hunting more exciting than gazelle shooting remarked captain gerard and more dangerous  even gazelle shooting has its dangers replied tarzan  especially when one goes alone  i found it so today  i also found that while the gazelle is the most timid of animals it is not the most cowardly  he let his glance rest only casually upon gernois after he had spoken for he did not wish the man to know that he was under suspicion or surveillance no matter what he might think  the effect of his remark upon him however might tend to prove his connection with or knowledge of certain recent happenings  tarzan saw a dull red creep up from beneath gernois collar  he was satisfied and quickly changed the subject  when the column rode south from bou saada the next morning there were half a dozen arabs bringing up the rear  they are not attached to the command replied gerard in response to tarzans query  they merely accompany us on the road for companionship  tarzan had learned enough about arab character since he had been in algeria to know that this was no real motive for the arab is never overfond of the companionship of strangers and especially of french soldiers  so his suspicions were aroused and he decided to keep a sharp eye on the little party that trailed behind the column at a distance of about a quarter of a mile  but they did not come close enough even during the halts to enable him to obtain a close scrutiny of them  he had long been convinced that there were hired assassins on his trail nor was he in great doubt but that rokoff was at the bottom of the plot  whether it was to be revenge for the several occasions in the past that tarzan had defeated the russians purposes and humiliated him or was in some way connected with his mission in the gernois affair he could not determine  if the latter and it seemed probable since the evidence he had had that gernois suspected him then he had two rather powerful enemies to contend with for there would be many opportunities in the wilds of algeria for which they were bound to dispatch a suspected enemy quietly and without attracting suspicion  after camping at djelfa for two days the column moved to the southwest from whence word had come that the marauders were operating against the tribes whose douars were situated at the foot of the mountains  the little band of arabs who had accompanied them from bou saada had disappeared suddenly the very night that orders had been given to prepare for the morrows march from djelfa  tarzan made casual inquiries among the men but none could tell him why they had left or in what direction they had gone  he did not like the looks of it especially in view of the fact that he had seen gernois in conversation with one of them some half hour after captain gerard had issued his instructions relative to the new move  only gernois and tarzan knew the direction of the proposed march  all the soldiers knew was that they were to be prepared to break camp early the next morning  tarzan wondered if gernois could have revealed their destination to the arabs  late that afternoon they went into camp at a little oasis in which was the douar of a sheik whose flocks were being stolen and whose herdsmen were being killed  the arabs came out of their goatskin tents and surrounded the soldiers asking many questions in the native tongue for the soldiers were themselves natives  tarzan who by this time with the assistance of abdul had picked up quite a smattering of arab questioned one of the younger men who had accompanied the sheik while the latter paid his respects to captain gerard  no he had seen no party of six horsemen riding from the direction of djelfa  there were other oases scattered aboutpossibly they had been journeying to one of these  then there were the marauders in the mountains abovethey often rode north to bou saada in small parties and even as far as aumale and bouira  it might indeed have been a few marauders returning to the band from a pleasure trip to one of these cities  early the next morning captain gerard split his command in two giving lieutenant gernois command of one party while he headed the other they were to scour the mountains upon opposite sides of the plain  and with which detachment will monsieur tarzan ride asked the captain  or maybe it is that monsieur does not care to hunt marauders  oh i shall be delighted to go tarzan hastened to explain  he was wondering what excuse he could make to accompany gernois  his embarrassment was shortlived and was relieved from a most unexpected source  it was gernois himself who spoke  if my captain will forego the pleasure of monsieur tarzans company for this once i shall esteem it an honor indeed to have monsieur ride with me today he said nor was his tone lacking in cordiality  in fact tarzan imagined that he had overdone it a trifle but even so he was both astounded and pleased hastening to express his delight at the arrangement  and so it was that lieutenant gernois and tarzan rode off side by side at the head of the little detachment of spahis  gernois cordiality was shortlived  no sooner had they ridden out of sight of captain gerard and his men than he lapsed once more into his accustomed taciturnity  as they advanced the ground became rougher  steadily it ascended toward the mountains into which they filed through a narrow canon close to noon  by the side of a little rivulet gernois called the midday halt  here the men prepared and ate their frugal meal and refilled their canteens  after an hours rest they advanced again along the canon until they presently came to a little valley from which several rocky gorges diverged  here they halted while gernois minutely examined the surrounding heights from the center of the depression  we shall separate here he said several riding into each of these gorges and then he commenced to detail his various squads and issue instructions to the noncommissioned officers who were to command them when he had done he turned to tarzan  monsieur will be so good as to remain here until we return  tarzan demurred but the officer cut him short  there may be fighting for one of these sections he said and troops cannot be embarrassed by civilian noncombatants during action  but my dear lieutenant expostulated tarzan i am most ready and willing to place myself under command of yourself or any of your sergeants or corporals and to fight in the ranks as they direct  it is what i came for  i should be glad to think so retorted gernois with a sneer he made no attempt to disguise  then shortly you are under my orders and they are that you remain here until we return  let that end the matter and he turned and spurred away at the head of his men  a moment later tarzan found himself alone in the midst of a desolate mountain fastness  the sun was hot so he sought the shelter of a nearby tree where he tethered his horse and sat down upon the ground to smoke  inwardly he swore at gernois for the trick he had played upon him  a mean little revenge thought tarzan and then suddenly it occurred to him that the man would not be such a fool as to antagonize him through a trivial annoyance of so petty a description  there must be something deeper than this behind it  with the thought he arose and removed his rifle from its boot  he looked to its loads and saw that the magazine was full  then he inspected his revolver  after this preliminary precaution he scanned the surrounding heights and the mouths of the several gorgeshe was determined that he should not be caught napping  the sun sank lower and lower yet there was no sign of returning spahis  at last the valley was submerged in shadow tarzan was too proud to go back to camp until he had given the detachment ample time to return to the valley which he thought was to have been their rendezvous  with the closing in of night he felt safer from attack for he was at home in the dark  he knew that none might approach him so cautiously as to elude those alert and sensitive ears of his then there were his eyes too for he could see well at night and his nose if they came toward him from upwind would apprise him of the approach of an enemy while they were still a great way off  so he felt that he was in little danger and thus lulled to a sense of security he fell asleep with his back against the tree  he must have slept for several hours for when he was suddenly awakened by the frightened snorting and plunging of his horse the moon was shining full upon the little valley and there not ten paces before him stood the grim cause of the terror of his mount  superb majestic his graceful tail extended and quivering and his two eyes of fire riveted full upon his prey stood numa el adrea the black lion  a little thrill of joy tingled through tarzans nerves  it was like meeting an old friend after years of separation  for a moment he sat rigid to enjoy the magnificent spectacle of this lord of the wilderness  but now numa was crouching for the spring  very slowly tarzan raised his gun to his shoulder  he had never killed a large animal with a gun in all his lifeheretofore he had depended upon his spear his poisoned arrows his rope his knife or his bare hands  instinctively he wished that he had his arrows and his knifehe would have felt surer with them  numa was lying quite flat upon the ground now presenting only his head  tarzan would have preferred to fire a little from one side for he knew what terrific damage the lion could do if he lived two minutes or even a minute after he was hit  the horse stood trembling in terror at tarzans back  the apeman took a cautious step to one sidenuma but followed him with his eyes  another step he took and then another  numa had not moved  now he could aim at a point between the eye and the ear  his finger tightened upon the trigger and as he fired numa sprang  at the same instant the terrified horse made a last frantic effort to escapethe tether parted and he went careening down the canon toward the desert  no ordinary man could have escaped those frightful claws when numa sprang from so short a distance but tarzan was no ordinary man  from earliest childhood his muscles had been trained by the fierce exigencies of his existence to act with the rapidity of thought  as quick as was el adrea tarzan of the apes was quicker and so the great beast crashed against a tree where he had expected to feel the soft flesh of man while tarzan a couple of paces to the right pumped another bullet into him that brought him clawing and roaring to his side  twice more tarzan fired in quick succession and then el adrea lay still and roared no more  it was no longer monsieur jean tarzan it was tarzan of the apes that put a savage foot upon the body of his savage kill and raising his face to the full moon lifted his mighty voice in the weird and terrible challenge of his kinda bull ape had made his kill  and the wild things in the wild mountains stopped in their hunting and trembled at this new and awful voice while down in the desert the children of the wilderness came out of their goatskin tents and looked toward the mountains wondering what new and savage scourge had come to devastate their flocks  a half mile from the valley in which tarzan stood a score of whiterobed figures bearing long wickedlooking guns halted at the sound and looked at one another with questioning eyes  but presently as it was not repeated they took up their silent stealthy way toward the valley  tarzan was now confident that gernois had no intention of returning for him but he could not fathom the object that had prompted the officer to desert him yet leave him free to return to camp  his horse gone he decided that it would be foolish to remain longer in the mountains so he set out toward the desert  he had scarcely entered the confines of the canon when the first of the whiterobed figures emerged into the valley upon the opposite side for a moment they scanned the little depression from behind sheltering bowlders but when they had satisfied themselves that it was empty they advanced across it  beneath the tree at one side they came upon the body of el adrea  with muttered exclamations they crowded about it then a moment later they hurried down the canon which tarzan was threading a brief distance in advance of them  they moved cautiously and in silence taking advantage of shelter as men do who are stalking man     chapter 10  through the valley of the shadow   as tarzan walked down the wild canon beneath the brilliant african moon the call of the jungle was strong upon him  the solitude and the savage freedom filled his heart with life and buoyancy  again he was tarzan of the apesevery sense alert against the chance of surprise by some jungle enemyyet treading lightly and with head erect in proud consciousness of his might  the nocturnal sounds of the mountains were new to him yet they fell upon his ears like the soft voice of a halfforgotten love  many he intuitively sensedah there was one that was familiar indeed the distant coughing of sheeta the leopard but there was a strange note in the final wail which made him doubt  it was a panther he heard  presently a new sounda soft stealthy soundobtruded itself among the others  no human ears other than the apemans would have detected it  at first he did not translate it but finally he realized that it came from the bare feet of a number of human beings  they were behind him and they were coming toward him quietly  he was being stalked  in a flash he knew why he had been left in that little valley by gernois but there had been a hitch in the arrangementsthe men had come too late  closer and closer came the footsteps  tarzan halted and faced them his rifle ready in his hand  now he caught a fleeting glimpse of a white burnoose  he called aloud in french asking what they would of him  his reply was the flash of a long gun and with the sound of the shot tarzan of the apes plunged forward upon his face  the arabs did not rush out immediately instead they waited to be sure that their victim did not rise  then they came rapidly from their concealment and bent over him  it was soon apparent that he was not dead  one of the men put the muzzle of his gun to the back of tarzans head to finish him but another waved him aside  if we bring him alive the reward is to be greater explained the latter  so they bound his hands and feet and picking him up placed him on the shoulders of four of their number  then the march was resumed toward the desert  when they had come out of the mountains they turned toward the south and about daylight came to the spot where their horses stood in care of two of their number  from here on their progress was more rapid  tarzan who had regained consciousness was tied to a spare horse which they evidently had brought for the purpose  his wound was but a slight scratch which had furrowed the flesh across his temple  it had stopped bleeding but the dried and clotted blood smeared his face and clothing  he had said no word since he had fallen into the hands of these arabs nor had they addressed him other than to issue a few brief commands to him when the horses had been reached  for six hours they rode rapidly across the burning desert avoiding the oases near which their way led  about noon they came to a douar of about twenty tents  here they halted and as one of the arabs was releasing the alfagrass ropes which bound him to his mount they were surrounded by a mob of men women and children  many of the tribe and more especially the women appeared to take delight in heaping insults upon the prisoner and some had even gone so far as to throw stones at him and strike him with sticks when an old sheik appeared and drove them away  alibenahmed tells me he said that this man sat alone in the mountains and slew el adrea  what the business of the stranger who sent us after him may be i know not and what he may do with this man when we turn him over to him i care not but the prisoner is a brave man and while he is in our hands he shall be treated with the respect that be due one who hunts the lord with the large head alone and by nightand slays him  tarzan had heard of the respect in which arabs held a lionkiller and he was not sorry that chance had played into his hands thus favorably to relieve him of the petty tortures of the tribe  shortly after this he was taken to a goatskin tent upon the upper side of the douar there he was fed and then securely bound was left lying on a piece of native carpet alone in the tent  he could see a guard sitting before the door of his frail prison but when he attempted to force the stout bonds that held him he realized that any extra precaution on the part of his captors was quite unnecessary not even his giant muscles could part those numerous strands  just before dusk several men approached the tent where he lay and entered it  all were in arab dress but presently one of the number advanced to tarzans side and as he let the folds of cloth that had hidden the lower half of his face fall away the apeman saw the malevolent features of nikolas rokoff  there was a nasty smile on the bearded lips  ah monsieur tarzan he said this is indeed a pleasure  but why do you not rise and greet your guest  then with an ugly oath get up you dog and drawing back his booted foot he kicked tarzan heavily in the side  and here is another and another and another he continued as he kicked tarzan about the face and side  one for each of the injuries you have done me  the apeman made no replyhe did not even deign to look upon the russian again after the first glance of recognition  finally the sheik who had been standing a mute and frowning witness of the cowardly attack intervened  stop he commanded  kill him if you will but i will see no brave man subjected to such indignities in my presence  i have half a mind to turn him loose that i may see how long you would kick him then  this threat put a sudden end to rokoffs brutality for he had no craving to see tarzan loosed from his bonds while he was within reach of those powerful hands  very well he replied to the arab i shall kill him presently  not within the precincts of my douar returned the sheik  when he leaves here he leaves alive  what you do with him in the desert is none of my concern but i shall not have the blood of a frenchman on the hands of my tribe on account of another mans quarrelthey would send soldiers here and kill many of my people and burn our tents and drive away our flocks  as you say growled rokoff  ill take him out into the desert below the douar and dispatch him  you will take him a days ride from my country said the sheik firmly and some of my children shall follow you to see that you do not disobey meotherwise there may be two dead frenchmen in the desert  rokoff shrugged  then i shall have to wait until the morrowit is already dark  as you will said the sheik  but by an hour after dawn you must be gone from my douar  i have little liking for unbelievers and none at all for a coward  rokoff would have made some kind of retort but he checked himself for he realized that it would require but little excuse for the old man to turn upon him  together they left the tent  at the door rokoff could not resist the temptation to turn and fling a parting taunt at tarzan sleep well monsieur he said and do not forget to pray well for when you die tomorrow it will be in such agony that you will be unable to pray for blaspheming  no one had bothered to bring tarzan either food or water since noon and consequently he suffered considerably from thirst  he wondered if it would be worth while to ask his guard for water but after making two or three requests without receiving any response he decided that it would not  far up in the mountains he heard a lion roar  how much safer one was he soliloquized in the haunts of wild beasts than in the haunts of men  never in all his jungle life had he been more relentlessly tracked down than in the past few months of his experience among civilized men  never had he been any nearer death  again the lion roared  it sounded a little nearer  tarzan felt the old wild impulse to reply with the challenge of his kind  his kind he had almost forgotten that he was a man and not an ape  he tugged at his bonds  god if he could but get them near those strong teeth of his  he felt a wild wave of madness sweep over him as his efforts to regain his liberty met with failure  numa was roaring almost continually now  it was quite evident that he was coming down into the desert to hunt  it was the roar of a hungry lion  tarzan envied him for he was free  no one would tie him with ropes and slaughter him like a sheep  it was that which galled the apeman  he did not fear to die noit was the humiliation of defeat before death without even a chance to battle for his life  it must be near midnight thought tarzan  he had several hours to live  possibly he would yet find a way to take rokoff with him on the long journey  he could hear the savage lord of the desert quite close by now  possibly he sought his meat from among the penned animals within the douar  for a long time silence reigned then tarzans trained ears caught the sound of a stealthily moving body  it came from the side of the tent nearest the mountainsthe back  nearer and nearer it came  he waited listening intently for it to pass  for a time there was silence without such a terrible silence that tarzan was surprised that he did not hear the breathing of the animal he felt sure must be crouching close to the back wall of his tent  there  it is moving again  closer it creeps  tarzan turns his head in the direction of the sound  it is very dark within the tent slowly the back rises from the ground forced up by the head and shoulders of a body that looks all black in the semidarkness  beyond is a faint glimpse of the dimly starlit desert  a grim smile plays about tarzans lips  at least rokoff will be cheated  how mad he will be  and death will be more merciful than he could have hoped for at the hands of the russian  now the back of the tent drops into place and all is darkness againwhatever it is is inside the tent with him  he hears it creeping close to himnow it is beside him  he closes his eyes and waits for the mighty paw  upon his upturned face falls the gentle touch of a soft hand groping in the dark and then a girls voice in a scarcely audible whisper pronounces his name  yes it is i he whispers in reply  but in the name of heaven who are you  the oulednail of sisi aissa came the answer  while she spoke tarzan could feel her working about his bonds  occasionally the cold steel of a knife touched his flesh  a moment later he was free  come she whispered  on hands and knees he followed her out of the tent by the way she had come  she continued crawling thus flat to the ground until she reached a little patch of shrub  there she halted until he gained her side for a moment he looked at her before he spoke  i cannot understand he said at last  why are you here  how did you know that i was a prisoner in that tent  how does it happen that it is you who have saved me  she smiled  i have come a long way tonight she said and we have a long way to go before we shall be out of danger  come i shall tell you all about as we go  together they rose and set off across the desert in the direction of the mountains  i was not quite sure that i should ever reach you she said at last el adrea is abroad tonight and after i left the horses i think he winded me and was followingi was terribly frightened  what a brave girl he said  and you ran all that risk for a strangeran alienan unbeliever  she drew herself up very proudly  i am the daughter of the sheik kabour ben saden she answered  i should be no fit daughter of his if i would not risk my life to save that of the man who saved mine while he yet thought that i was but a common oulednail  nevertheless he insisted you are a very brave girl  but how did you know that i was a prisoner back there  achmetdintaieb who is my cousin on my fathers side was visiting some friends who belong to the tribe that captured you  he was at the douar when you were brought in  when he reached home he was telling us about the big frenchman who had been captured by alibenahmed for another frenchman who wished to kill him  from the description i knew that it must be you  my father was away  i tried to persuade some of the men to come and save you but they would not do it saying  let the unbelievers kill one another if they wish  it is none of our affair and if we go and interfere with alibenahmeds plans we shall only stir up a fight with our own people  so when it was dark i came alone riding one horse and leading another for you  they are tethered not far from here  by morning we shall be within my fathers douar  he should be there himself by nowthen let them come and try to take kadour ben sadens friend  for a few moments they walked on in silence  we should be near the horses she said  it is strange that i do not see them here  then a moment later she stopped with a little cry of consternation  they are gone she exclaimed  it is here that i tethered them  tarzan stooped to examine the ground  he found that a large shrub had been torn up by the roots  then he found something else  there was a wry smile on his face as he rose and turned toward the girl  el adrea has been here  from the signs though i rather think that his prey escaped him  with a little start they would be safe enough from him in the open  there was nothing to do but continue on foot  the way led them across a low spur of the mountains but the girl knew the trail as well as she did her mothers face  they walked in easy swinging strides tarzan keeping a hands breadth behind the girls shoulder that she might set the pace and thus be less fatigued  as they walked they talked occasionally stopping to listen for sounds of pursuit  it was now a beautiful moonlit night  the air was crisp and invigorating  behind them lay the interminable vista of the desert dotted here and there with an occasional oasis  the date palms of the little fertile spot they had just left and the circle of goatskin tents stood out in sharp relief against the yellow sanda phantom paradise upon a phantom sea  before them rose the grim and silent mountains  tarzans blood leaped in his veins  this was life  he looked down upon the girl beside hima daughter of the desert walking across the face of a dead world with a son of the jungle  he smiled at the thought  he wished that he had had a sister and that she had been like this girl  what a bully chum she would have been  they had entered the mountains now and were progressing more slowly for the trail was steeper and very rocky  for a few minutes they had been silent  the girl was wondering if they would reach her fathers douar before the pursuit had overtaken them tarzan was wishing that they might walk on thus forever  if the girl were only a man they might  he longed for a friend who loved the same wild life that he loved  he had learned to crave companionship but it was his misfortune that most of the men he knew preferred immaculate linen and their clubs to nakedness and the jungle  it was of course difficult to understand yet it was very evident that they did  the two had just turned a projecting rock around which the trail ran when they were brought to a sudden stop  there before them directly in the middle of the path stood numa el adrea the black lion  his green eyes looked very wicked and he bared his teeth and lashed his bayblack sides with his angry tail  then he roaredthe fearsome terrorinspiring roar of the hungry lion which is also angry  your knife said tarzan to the girl extending his hand  she slipped the hilt of the weapon into his waiting palm  as his fingers closed upon it he drew her back and pushed her behind him  walk back to the desert as rapidly as you can  if you hear me call you will know that all is well and you may return  it is useless she replied resignedly  this is the end  do as i tell you he commanded  quickly  he is about to charge the girl dropped back a few paces where she stood watching for the terrible sight that she knew she should soon witness  the lion was advancing slowly toward tarzan his nose to the ground like a challenging bull his tail extended now and quivering as though with intense excitement  the apeman stood half crouching the long arab knife glistening in the moonlight  behind him the tense figure of the girl motionless as a carven statue  she leaned slightly forward her lips parted her eyes wide  her only conscious thought was wonder at the bravery of the man who dared face with a puny knife the lord with the large head  a man of her own blood would have knelt in prayer and gone down beneath those awful fangs without resistance  in either case the result would be the sameit was inevitable but she could not repress a thrill of admiration as her eyes rested upon the heroic figure before her  not a tremor in the whole giant framehis attitude as menacing and defiant as that of el adrea himself  the lion was quite close to him nowbut a few paces intervenedhe crouched and then with a deafening roar he sprang     chapter 11  john caldwell london   as numa el adrea launched himself with widespread paws and bared fangs he looked to find this puny man as easy prey as the score who had gone down beneath him in the past  to him man was a clumsy slowmoving defenseless creaturehe had little respect for him  but this time he found that he was pitted against a creature as agile and as quick as himself  when his mighty frame struck the spot where the man had been he was no longer there  the watching girl was transfixed by astonishment at the ease with which the crouching man eluded the great paws  and now o allah  he had rushed in behind el adreas shoulder even before the beast could turn and had grasped him by the mane  the lion reared upon his hind legs like a horsetarzan had known that he would do this and he was ready a giant arm encircled the blackmaned throat and once twice a dozen times a sharp blade darted in and out of the bayblack side behind the left shoulder  frantic were the leaps of numaawful his roars of rage and pain but the giant upon his back could not be dislodged or brought within reach of fangs or talons in the brief interval of life that remained to the lord with the large head  he was quite dead when tarzan of the apes released his hold and arose  then the daughter of the desert witnessed a thing that terrified her even more than had the presence of el adrea the man placed a foot upon the carcass of his kill and with his handsome face raised toward the full moon gave voice to the most frightful cry that ever had smote upon her ears  with a little cry of fear she shrank away from himshe thought that the fearful strain of the encounter had driven him mad  as the last note of that fiendish challenge died out in the diminishing echoes of the distance the man dropped his eyes until they rested upon the girl  instantly his face was lighted by the kindly smile that was ample assurance of his sanity and the girl breathed freely once again smiling in response  what manner of man are you she asked  the thing you have done is unheard of  even now i cannot believe that it is possible for a lone man armed only with a knife to have fought hand to hand with el adrea and conquered him unscathedto have conquered him at all  and that cryit was not human  why did you do that  tarzan flushed  it is because i forget he said sometimes that i am a civilized man  when i kill it must be that i am another creature  he did not try to explain further for it always seemed to him that a woman must look with loathing upon one who was yet so nearly a beast  together they continued their journey  the sun was an hour high when they came out into the desert again beyond the mountains  beside a little rivulet they found the girls horses grazing  they had come this far on their way home and with the cause of their fear no longer present had stopped to feed  with little trouble tarzan and the girl caught them and mounting rode out into the desert toward the douar of sheik kadour ben saden  no sign of pursuit developed and they came in safety about nine oclock to their destination  the sheik had but just returned  he was frantic with grief at the absence of his daughter whom he thought had been again abducted by the marauders  with fifty men he was already mounted to go in search of her when the two rode into the douar  his joy at the safe return of his daughter was only equaled by his gratitude to tarzan for bringing her safely to him through the dangers of the night and his thankfulness that she had been in time to save the man who had once saved her  no honor that kadour ben saden could heap upon the apeman in acknowledgment of his esteem and friendship was neglected  when the girl had recited the story of the slaying of el adrea tarzan was surrounded by a mob of worshiping arabsit was a sure road to their admiration and respect  the old sheik insisted that tarzan remain indefinitely as his guest he even wished to adopt him as a member of the tribe and there was for some time a halfformed resolution in the apemans mind to accept and remain forever with these wild people whom he understood and who seemed to understand him  his friendship and liking for the girl were potent factors in urging him toward an affirmative decision  had she been a man he argued he should not have hesitated for it would have meant a friend after his own heart with whom he could ride and hunt at will but as it was they would be hedged by the conventionalities that are even more strictly observed by the wild nomads of the desert than by their more civilized brothers and sisters and in a little while she would be married to one of these swarthy warriors and there would be an end to their friendship  so he decided against the sheiks proposal though he remained a week as his guest  when he left kadour ben saden and fifty whiterobed warriors rode with him to bou saada  while they were mounting in the douar of kadour ben saden the morning of their departure the girl came to bid farewell to tarzan  i have prayed that you would remain with us she said simply as he leaned from his saddle to clasp her hand in farewell and now i shall pray that you will return there was an expression of wistfulness in her beautiful eyes and a pathetic droop at the corners of her mouth tarzan was touched  who knows and then he turned and rode after the departing arabs  outside bou saada he bade kadour ben saden and his men goodby for there were reasons which made him wish to make his entry into the town as secret as possible and when he had explained them to the sheik the latter concurred in his decision  the arabs were to enter bou saada ahead of him saying nothing as to his presence with them  later tarzan would come in alone and go directly to an obscure native inn  thus making his entrance after dark as he did he was not seen by any one who knew him and reached the inn unobserved  after dining with kadour ben saden as his guest he went to his former hotel by a roundabout way and coming in by a rear entrance sought the proprietor who seemed much surprised to see him alive  yes there was mail for monsieur he would fetch it  no he would mention monsieurs return to no one  presently he returned with a packet of letters  one was an order from his superior to lay off on his present work and hasten to cape town by the first steamer he could get  his further instructions would be awaiting him there in the hands of another agent whose name and address were given  that was allbrief but explicit  tarzan arranged to leave bou saada early the next morning  then he started for the garrison to see captain gerard whom the hotel man had told him had returned with his detachment the previous day  he found the officer in his quarters  he was filled with surprise and pleasure at seeing tarzan alive and well  when lieutenant gernois returned and reported that he had not found you at the spot that you had chosen to remain while the detachment was scouting i was filled with alarm  we searched the mountain for days then came word that you had been killed and eaten by a lion  as proof your gun was brought to us  your horse had returned to camp the second day after your disappearance  we could not doubt  lieutenant gernois was griefstrickenhe took all the blame upon himself  it was he who insisted on carrying on the search himself  it was he who found the arab with your gun  he will be delighted to know that you are safe  doubtless said tarzan with a grim smile  he is down in the town now or i should send for him continued captain gerard  i shall tell him as soon as he returns  tarzan let the officer think that he had been lost wandering finally into the douar of kadour ben saden who had escorted him back to bou saada  as soon as possible he bade the good officer adieu and hastened back into the town  at the native inn he had learned through kadour ben saden a piece of interesting information  it told of a blackbearded white man who went always disguised as an arab  for a time he had nursed a broken wrist  more recently he had been away from bou saada but now he was back and tarzan knew his place of concealment  it was for there he headed  through narrow stinking alleys black as erebus he groped and then up a rickety stairway at the end of which was a closed door and a tiny unglazed window  the window was high under the low eaves of the mud building  tarzan could just reach the sill  he raised himself slowly until his eyes topped it  the room within was lighted and at a table sat rokoff and gernois  gernois was speaking  rokoff you are a devil he was saying  you have hounded me until i have lost the last shred of my honor  you have driven me to murder for the blood of that man tarzan is on my hands  if it were not that that other devils spawn paulvitch still knew my secret i should kill you here tonight with my bare hands  rokoff laughed  you would not do that my dear lieutenant he said the moment i am reported dead by assassination that dear alexis will forward to the minister of war full proof of the affair you so ardently long to conceal and further will charge you with my murder  come be sensible  i am your best friend  have i not protected your honor as though it were my own  gernois sneered and spat out an oath  just one more little payment continued rokoff and the papers i wish and you have my word of honor that i shall never ask another cent from you or further information  and a good reason why growled gernois  what you ask will take my last cent and the only valuable military secret i hold  you ought to be paying me for the information instead of taking both it and money too  i am paying you by keeping a still tongue in my head retorted rokoff  but lets have done  will you or will you not  i give you three minutes to decide  if you are not agreeable i shall send a note to your commandant tonight that will end in the degradation that dreyfus sufferedthe only difference being that he did not deserve it  for a moment gernois sat with bowed head  at length he arose  he drew two pieces of paper from his blouse  here he said hopelessly  i had them ready for i knew that there could be but one outcome  he held them toward the russian  rokoffs cruel face lighted in malignant gloating  he seized the bits of paper  you have done well gernois he said  i shall not trouble you againunless you happen to accumulate some more money or information and he grinned  you never shall again you dog hissed gernois  the next time i shall kill you  i came near doing it tonight  for an hour i sat with these two pieces of paper on my table before me ere i came herebeside them lay my loaded revolver  i was trying to decide which i should bring  next time the choice shall be easier for i already have decided  you had a close call tonight rokoff do not tempt fate a second time  then gernois rose to leave  tarzan barely had time to drop to the landing and shrink back into the shadows on the far side of the door even then he scarcely hoped to elude detection  the landing was very small and though he flattened himself against the wall at its far edge he was scarcely more than a foot from the doorway  almost immediately it opened and gernois stepped out  rokoff was behind him  neither spoke  gernois had taken perhaps three steps down the stairway when he halted and half turned as though to retrace his steps  tarzan knew that discovery would be inevitable  rokoff still stood on the threshold a foot from him but he was looking in the opposite direction toward gernois  then the officer evidently reconsidered his decision and resumed his downward course  tarzan could hear rokoffs sigh of relief  a moment later the russian went back into the room and closed the door  tarzan waited until gernois had had time to get well out of hearing then he pushed open the door and stepped into the room  he was on top of rokoff before the man could rise from the chair where he sat scanning the paper gernois had given him  as his eyes turned and fell upon the apemans face his own went livid  you he gasped  i replied tarzan  what do you want whispered rokoff for the look in the apemans eyes frightened him  have you come to kill me  you do not dare they would guillotine you  you do not dare kill me  i dare kill you rokoff replied tarzan for no one knows that you are here or that i am here and paulvitch would tell them that it was gernois  i heard you tell gernois so  but that would not influence me rokoff  i would not care who knew that i had killed you the pleasure of killing you would more than compensate for any punishment they might inflict upon me  you are the most despicable cur of a coward rokoff i have ever heard of  you should be killed  i should love to kill you and tarzan approached closer to the man  rokoffs nerves were keyed to the breaking point  with a shriek he sprang toward an adjoining room but the apeman was upon his back while his leap was yet but half completed  iron fingers sought his throatthe great coward squealed like a stuck pig until tarzan had shut off his wind  then the apeman dragged him to his feet still choking him  the russian struggled futilelyhe was like a babe in the mighty grasp of tarzan of the apes  tarzan sat him in a chair and long before there was danger of the mans dying he released his hold upon his throat  when the russians coughing spell had abated tarzan spoke to him again  i have given you a taste of the suffering of death he said  but i shall not killthis time  i am sparing you solely for the sake of a very good woman whose great misfortune it was to have been born of the same woman who gave birth to you  but i shall spare you only this once on her account  should i ever learn that you have again annoyed her or her husbandshould you ever annoy me againshould i hear that you have returned to france or to any french possession i shall make it my sole business to hunt you down and complete the choking i commenced tonight  then he turned to the table on which the two pieces of paper still lay  as he picked them up rokoff gasped in horror  tarzan examined both the check and the other  he was amazed at the information the latter contained  rokoff had partially read it but tarzan knew that no one could remember the salient facts and figures it held which made it of real value to an enemy of france  these will interest the chief of staff he said as he slipped them into his pocket  rokoff groaned  he did not dare curse aloud  the next morning tarzan rode north on his way to bouira and algiers as he had ridden past the hotel lieutenant gernois was standing on the veranda  as his eyes discovered tarzan he went white as chalk  the apeman would have been glad had the meeting not occurred but he could not avoid it  he saluted the officer as he rode past  mechanically gernois returned the salute but those terrible wide eyes followed the horseman expressionless except for horror  it was as though a dead man looked upon a ghost  at sidi aissa tarzan met a french officer with whom he had become acquainted on the occasion of his recent sojourn in the town  you left bou saada early questioned the officer  then you have not heard about poor gernois  he was the last man i saw as i rode away replied tarzan  what about him  he is dead  he shot himself about eight oclock this morning  two days later tarzan reached algiers  there he found that he would have a two days wait before he could catch a ship bound for cape town he occupied his time in writing out a full report of his mission  the secret papers he had taken from rokoff he did not inclose for he did not dare trust them out of his own possession until he had been authorized to turn them over to another agent or himself return to paris with them  as tarzan boarded his ship after what seemed a most tedious wait to him two men watched him from an upper deck  both were fashionably dressed and smooth shaven  the taller of the two had sandy hair but his eyebrows were very black  later in the day they chanced to meet tarzan on deck but as one hurriedly called his companions attention to something at sea their faces were turned from tarzan as he passed so that he did not notice their features  in fact he had paid no attention to them at all  following the instructions of his chief tarzan had booked his passage under an assumed namejohn caldwell london  he did not understand the necessity of this and it caused him considerable speculation  he wondered what role he was to play in cape town  well he thought thank heaven that i am rid of rokoff  he was commencing to annoy me  i wonder if i am really becoming so civilized that presently i shall develop a set of nerves  he would give them to me if any one could for he does not fight fair  one never knows through what new agency he is going to strike  it is as though numa the lion had induced tantor the elephant and histah the snake to join him in attempting to kill me  i would then never have known what minute or by whom i was to be attacked next  but the brutes are more chivalrous than manthey do not stoop to cowardly intrigue  at dinner that night tarzan sat next to a young woman whose place was at the captains left  the officer introduced them  miss strong  where had he heard the name before  it was very familiar  and then the girls mother gave him the clew for when she addressed her daughter she called her hazel  hazel strong  what memories the name inspired  it had been a letter to this girl penned by the fair hand of jane porter that had carried to him the first message from the woman he loved  how vividly he recalled the night he had stolen it from the desk in the cabin of his longdead father where jane porter had sat writing it late into the night while he crouched in the darkness without  how terrorstricken she would have been that night had she known that the wild jungle beast squatted outside her window watching her every move  and this was hazel strongjane porters best friend     chapter 12  ships that pass   let us go back a few months to the little windswept platform of a railway station in northern wisconsin  the smoke of forest fires hangs low over the surrounding landscape its acrid fumes smarting the eyes of a little party of six who stand waiting the coming of the train that is to bear them away toward the south  professor archimedes q porter his hands clasped beneath the tails of his long coat paces back and forth under the everwatchful eye of his faithful secretary mr samuel t philander  twice within the past few minutes he has started absentmindedly across the tracks in the direction of a nearby swamp only to be rescued and dragged back by the tireless mr philander  jane porter the professors daughter is in strained and lifeless conversation with william cecil clayton and tarzan of the apes  within the little waiting room but a bare moment before a confession of love and a renunciation had taken place that had blighted the lives and happiness of two of the party but william cecil clayton lord greystoke was not one of them  behind miss porter hovered the motherly esmeralda  she too was happy for was she not returning to her beloved maryland  already she could see dimly through the fog of smoke the murky headlight of the oncoming engine  the men began to gather up the hand baggage suddenly clayton exclaimed  by jove  ive left my ulster in the waitingroom and hastened off to fetch it  goodbye jane said tarzan extending his hand  god bless you  goodbye replied the girl faintly  try to forget meno not thati could not bear to think that you had forgotten me  there is no danger of that dear he answered  i wish to heaven that i might forget  it would be so much easier than to go through life always remembering what might have been  you will be happy though i am sure you shallyou must be  you may tell the others of my decision to drive my car on to new yorki dont feel equal to bidding clayton goodbye  i want always to remember him kindly but i fear that i am too much of a wild beast yet to be trusted too long with the man who stands between me and the one person in all the world i want  as clayton stooped to pick up his coat in the waiting room his eyes fell on a telegraph blank lying face down upon the floor  he stooped to pick it up thinking it might be a message of importance which some one had dropped  he glanced at it hastily and then suddenly he forgot his coat the approaching traineverything but that terrible little piece of yellow paper in his hand  he read it twice before he could fully grasp the terrific weight of meaning that it bore to him  when he had picked it up he had been an english nobleman the proud and wealthy possessor of vast estatesa moment later he had read it and he knew that he was an untitled and penniless beggar  it was darnots cablegram to tarzan and it read   finger prints prove you greystoke  congratulations                                                       darnot   he staggered as though he had received a mortal blow  just then he heard the others calling to him to hurrythe train was coming to a stop at the little platform  like a man dazed he gathered up his ulster  he would tell them about the cablegram when they were all on board the train  then he ran out upon the platform just as the engine whistled twice in the final warning that precedes the first rumbling jerk of coupling pins  the others were on board leaning out from the platform of a pullman crying to him to hurry  quite five minutes elapsed before they were settled in their seats nor was it until then that clayton discovered that tarzan was not with them  where is tarzan he asked jane porter  in another car  no she replied at the last minute he determined to drive his machine back to new york  he is anxious to see more of america than is possible from a car window  he is returning to france you know  clayton did not reply  he was trying to find the right words to explain to jane porter the calamity that had befallen himand her  he wondered just what the effect of his knowledge would be on her  would she still wish to marry himto be plain mrs clayton  suddenly the awful sacrifice which one of them must make loomed large before his imagination  then came the question  will tarzan claim his own  the apeman had known the contents of the message before he calmly denied knowledge of his parentage  he had admitted that kala the ape was his mother  could it have been for love of jane porter  there was no other explanation which seemed reasonable  then having ignored the evidence of the message was it not reasonable to assume that he meant never to claim his birthright  if this were so what right had he william cecil clayton to thwart the wishes to balk the selfsacrifice of this strange man  if tarzan of the apes could do this thing to save jane porter from unhappiness why should he to whose care she was intrusting her whole future do aught to jeopardize her interests  and so he reasoned until the first generous impulse to proclaim the truth and relinquish his titles and his estates to their rightful owner was forgotten beneath the mass of sophistries which selfinterest had advanced  but during the balance of the trip and for many days thereafter he was moody and distraught  occasionally the thought obtruded itself that possibly at some later day tarzan would regret his magnanimity and claim his rights  several days after they reached baltimore clayton broached the subject of an early marriage to jane  what do you mean by early she asked  within the next few days  i must return to england at oncei want you to return with me dear  i cant get ready so soon as that replied jane  it will take a whole month at least  she was glad for she hoped that whatever called him to england might still further delay the wedding  she had made a bad bargain but she intended carrying her part loyally to the bitter endif she could manage to secure a temporary reprieve though she felt that she was warranted in doing so  his reply disconcerted her  very well jane he said  i am disappointed but i shall let my trip to england wait a month then we can go back together  but when the month was drawing to a close she found still another excuse upon which to hang a postponement until at last discouraged and doubting clayton was forced to go back to england alone  the several letters that passed between them brought clayton no nearer to a consummation of his hopes than he had been before and so it was that he wrote directly to professor porter and enlisted his services the old man had always favored the match  he liked clayton and being of an old southern family he put rather an exaggerated value on the advantages of a title which meant little or nothing to his daughter  clayton urged that the professor accept his invitation to be his guest in london an invitation which included the professors entire little familymr philander esmeralda and all  the englishman argued that once jane was there and home ties had been broken she would not so dread the step which she had so long hesitated to take  so the evening that he received claytons letter professor porter announced that they would leave for london the following week  but once in london jane porter was no more tractable than she had been in baltimore  she found one excuse after another and when finally lord tennington invited the party to cruise around africa in his yacht she expressed the greatest delight in the idea but absolutely refused to be married until they had returned to london  as the cruise was to consume a year at least for they were to stop for indefinite periods at various points of interest clayton mentally anathematized tennington for ever suggesting such a ridiculous trip  it was lord tenningtons plan to cruise through the mediterranean and the red sea to the indian ocean and thus down the east coast putting in at every port that was worth the seeing  and so it happened that on a certain day two vessels passed in the strait of gibraltar  the smaller a trim white yacht was speeding toward the east and on her deck sat a young woman who gazed with sad eyes upon a diamondstudded locket which she idly fingered  her thoughts were far away in the dim leafy fastness of a tropical jungleand her heart was with her thoughts  she wondered if the man who had given her the beautiful bauble that had meant so much more to him than the intrinsic value which he had not even known could ever have meant to him was back in his savage forest  and upon the deck of the larger vessel a passenger steamer passing toward the east the man sat with another young woman and the two idly speculated upon the identity of the dainty craft gliding so gracefully through the gentle swell of the lazy sea  when the yacht had passed the man resumed the conversation that her appearance had broken off  yes he said i like america very much and that means of course that i like americans for a country is only what its people make it i met some very delightful people while i was there  i recall one family from your own city miss strong whom i liked particularlyprofessor porter and his daughter  jane porter exclaimed the girl  do you mean to tell me that you know jane porter  why she is the very best friend i have in the world  we were little children togetherwe have known each other for ages  indeed he answered smiling  you would have difficulty in persuading any one of the fact who had seen either of you  ill qualify the statement then she answered with a laugh  we have known each other for two ageshers and mine  but seriously we are as dear to each other as sisters and now that i am going to lose her i am almost heartbroken  going to lose her exclaimed tarzan  why what do you mean  oh yes i understand  you mean that now that she is married and living in england you will seldom if ever see her  yes replied she and the saddest part of it all is that she is not marrying the man she loves  oh it is terrible  marrying from a sense of duty  i think it is perfectly wicked and i told her so  i have felt so strongly on the subject that although i was the only person outside of blood relations who was to have been asked to the wedding i would not let her invite me for i should not have gone to witness the terrible mockery  but jane porter is peculiarly positive  she has convinced herself that she is doing the only honorable thing that she can do and nothing in the world will ever prevent her from marrying lord greystoke except greystoke himself or death  i am sorry for her said tarzan  and i am sorry for the man she loves said the girl for he loves her  i never met him but from what jane tells me he must be a very wonderful person  it seems that he was born in an african jungle and brought up by fierce anthropoid apes  he had never seen a white man or woman until professor porter and his party were marooned on the coast right at the threshold of his tiny cabin  he saved them from all manner of terrible beasts and accomplished the most wonderful feats imaginable and then to cap the climax he fell in love with jane and she with him though she never really knew it for sure until she had promised herself to lord greystoke  most remarkable murmured tarzan cudgeling his brain for some pretext upon which to turn the subject  he delighted in hearing hazel strong talk of jane but when he was the subject of the conversation he was bored and embarrassed  but he was soon given a respite for the girls mother joined them and the talk became general  the next few days passed uneventfully  the sea was quiet  the sky was clear  the steamer plowed steadily on toward the south without pause tarzan spent quite a little time with miss strong and her mother  they whiled away their hours on deck reading talking or taking pictures with miss strongs camera  when the sun had set they walked  one day tarzan found miss strong in conversation with a stranger a man he had not seen on board before  as he approached the couple the man bowed to the girl and turned to walk away  wait monsieur thuran said miss strong you must meet mr caldwell we are all fellow passengers and should be acquainted  the two men shook hands  as tarzan looked into the eyes of monsieur thuran he was struck by the strange familiarity of their expression  i have had the honor of monsieurs acquaintance in the past i am sure said tarzan though i cannot recall the circumstances  monsieur thuran appeared ill at ease  i cannot say monsieur he replied  it may be so  i have had that identical sensation myself when meeting a stranger  monsieur thuran has been explaining some of the mysteries of navigation to me explained the girl  tarzan paid little heed to the conversation that ensuedhe was attempting to recall where he had met monsieur thuran before  that it had been under peculiar circumstances he was positive  presently the sun reached them and the girl asked monsieur thuran to move her chair farther back into the shade  tarzan happened to be watching the man at the time and noticed the awkward manner in which he handled the chairhis left wrist was stiff  that clew was sufficienta sudden train of associated ideas did the rest  monsieur thuran had been trying to find an excuse to make a graceful departure  the lull in the conversation following the moving of their position gave him an opportunity to make his excuses  bowing low to miss strong and inclining his head to tarzan he turned to leave them  just a moment said tarzan  if miss strong will pardon me i will accompany you  i shall return in a moment miss strong  monsieur thuran looked uncomfortable  when the two men had passed out of the girls sight tarzan stopped laying a heavy hand on the others shoulder  what is your game now rokoff he asked  i am leaving france as i promised you replied the other in a surly voice  i see you are said tarzan but i know you so well that i can scarcely believe that your being on the same boat with me is purely a coincidence  if i could believe it the fact that you are in disguise would immediately disabuse my mind of any such idea  well growled rokoff with a shrug i cannot see what you are going to do about it  this vessel flies the english flag  i have as much right on board her as you and from the fact that you are booked under an assumed name i imagine that i have more right  we will not discuss it rokoff  all i wanted to say to you is that you must keep away from miss strongshe is a decent woman  rokoff turned scarlet  if you dont i shall pitch you overboard continued tarzan  do not forget that i am just waiting for some excuse then he turned on his heel and left rokoff standing there trembling with suppressed rage  he did not see the man again for days but rokoff was not idle  in his stateroom with paulvitch he fumed and swore threatening the most terrible of revenges  i would throw him overboard tonight he cried were i sure that those papers were not on his person  i cannot chance pitching them into the ocean with him  if you were not such a stupid coward alexis you would find a way to enter his stateroom and search for the documents  paulvitch smiled  you are supposed to be the brains of this partnership my dear nikolas he replied  why do you not find the means to search monsieur caldwells stateroomeh  two hours later fate was kind to them for paulvitch who was ever on the watch saw tarzan leave his room without locking the door  five minutes later rokoff was stationed where he could give the alarm in case tarzan returned and paulvitch was deftly searching the contents of the apemans luggage  he was about to give up in despair when he saw a coat which tarzan had just removed  a moment later he grasped an official envelope in his hand  a quick glance at its contents brought a broad smile to the russians face  when he left the stateroom tarzan himself could not have told that an article in it had been touched since he left itpaulvitch was a past master in his chosen field  when he handed the packet to rokoff in the seclusion of their stateroom the larger man rang for a steward and ordered a pint of champagne  we must celebrate my dear alexis he said  it was luck nikolas explained paulvitch  it is evident that he carries these papers always upon his personjust by chance he neglected to transfer them when he changed coats a few minutes since but there will be the deuce to pay when he discovers his loss  i am afraid that he will immediately connect you with it  now that he knows that you are on board he will suspect you at once  it will make no difference whom he suspectsafter tonight said rokoff with a nasty grin  after miss strong had gone below that night tarzan stood leaning over the rail looking far out to sea  every night he had done this since he had come on boardsometimes he stood thus for an hour  and the eyes that had been watching his every movement since he had boarded the ship at algiers knew that this was his habit  even as he stood there this night those eyes were on him  presently the last straggler had left the deck  it was a clear night but there was no moonobjects on deck were barely discernible  from the shadows of the cabin two figures crept stealthily upon the apeman from behind  the lapping of the waves against the ships sides the whirring of the propeller the throbbing of the engines drowned the almost soundless approach of the two  they were quite close to him now and crouching low like tacklers on a gridiron  one of them raised his hand and lowered it as though counting off secondsonetwothree  as one man the two leaped for their victim  each grasped a leg and before tarzan of the apes lightning though he was could turn to save himself he had been pitched over the low rail and was falling into the atlantic  hazel strong was looking from her darkened port across the dark sea suddenly a body shot past her eyes from the deck above  it dropped so quickly into the dark waters below that she could not be sure of what it wasit might have been a man she could not say  she listened for some outcry from abovefor the alwaysfearsome call man overboard but it did not come  all was silence on the ship aboveall was silence in the sea below  the girl decided that she had but seen a bundle of refuse thrown overboard by one of the ships crew and a moment later sought her berth     chapter 13  the wreck of the lady alice   the next morning at breakfast tarzans place was vacant  miss strong was mildly curious for mr caldwell had always made it a point to wait that he might breakfast with her and her mother  as she was sitting on deck later monsieur thuran paused to exchange a half dozen pleasant words with her  he seemed in most excellent spiritshis manner was the extreme of affability  as he passed on miss strong thought what a very delightful man was monsieur thuran  the day dragged heavily  she missed the quiet companionship of mr caldwellthere had been something about him that had made the girl like him from the first he had talked so entertainingly of the places he had seenthe peoples and their customsthe wild beasts and he had always had a droll way of drawing striking comparisons between savage animals and civilized men that showed a considerable knowledge of the former and a keen though somewhat cynical estimate of the latter  when monsieur thuran stopped again to chat with her in the afternoon she welcomed the break in the days monotony  but she had begun to become seriously concerned in mr  caldwells continued absence somehow she constantly associated it with the start she had had the night before when the dark object fell past her port into the sea presently she broached the subject to monsieur thuran  had he seen mr caldwell today  he had not  why  he was not at breakfast as usual nor have i seen him once since yesterday explained the girl  monsieur thuran was extremely solicitous  i did not have the pleasure of intimate acquaintance with mr caldwell he said  he seemed a most estimable gentleman however can it be that he is indisposed and has remained in his stateroom  it would not be strange  no replied the girl it would not be strange of course but for some inexplicable reason i have one of those foolish feminine presentiments that all is not right with mr caldwell  it is the strangest feelingit is as though i knew that he was not on board the ship  monsieur thuran laughed pleasantly  mercy my dear miss strong he said where in the world could he be then  we have not been within sight of land for days  of course it is ridiculous of me she admitted  and then but i am not going to worry about it any longer i am going to find out where mr caldwell is and she motioned to a passing steward  that may be more difficult than you imagine my dear girl thought monsieur thuran but aloud he said  by all means  find mr caldwell please she said to the steward and tell him that his friends are much worried by his continued absence  you are very fond of mr caldwell suggested monsieur thuran  i think he is splendid replied the girl  and mamma is perfectly infatuated with him  he is the sort of man with whom one has a feeling of perfect securityno one could help but have confidence in mr caldwell  a moment later the steward returned to say that mr caldwell was not in his stateroom  i cannot find him miss strong andhe hesitatedi have learned that his berth was not occupied last night  i think that i had better report the matter to the captain  most assuredly exclaimed miss strong  i shall go with you to the captain myself  it is terrible  i know that something awful has happened  my presentiments were not false after all  it was a very frightened young woman and an excited steward who presented themselves before the captain a few moments later  he listened to their stories in silencea look of concern marking his expression as the steward assured him that he had sought for the missing passenger in every part of the ship that a passenger might be expected to frequent  and are you sure miss strong that you saw a body fall overboard last night he asked  there is not the slightest doubt about that she answered  i cannot say that it was a human bodythere was no outcry  it might have been only what i thought it wasa bundle of refuse  but if mr caldwell is not found on board i shall always be positive that it was he whom i saw fall past my port  the captain ordered an immediate and thorough search of the entire ship from stem to sternno nook or cranny was to be overlooked  miss strong remained in his cabin waiting the outcome of the quest  the captain asked her many questions but she could tell him nothing about the missing man other than what she had herself seen during their brief acquaintance on shipboard  for the first time she suddenly realized how very little indeed mr caldwell had told her about himself or his past life  that he had been born in africa and educated in paris was about all she knew and this meager information had been the result of her surprise that an englishman should speak english with such a marked french accent  did he ever speak of any enemies asked the captain  never  was he acquainted with any of the other passengers  only as he had been with methrough the circumstance of casual meeting as fellow shipmates  erwas he in your opinion miss strong a man who drank to excess  i do not know that he drank at allhe certainly had not been drinking up to half an hour before i saw that body fall overboard she answered for i was with him on deck up to that time  it is very strange said the captain  he did not look to me like a man who was subject to fainting spells or anything of that sort  and even had he been it is scarcely credible that he should have fallen completely over the rail had he been taken with an attack while leaning upon ithe would rather have fallen inside upon the deck  if he is not on board miss strong he was thrown overboardand the fact that you heard no outcry would lead to the assumption that he was dead before he left the ships deckmurdered  the girl shuddered  it was a full hour later that the first officer returned to report the outcome of the search  mr caldwell is not on board sir he said  i fear that there is something more serious than accident here mr brently said the captain  i wish that you would make a personal and very careful examination of mr caldwells effects to ascertain if there is any clew to a motive either for suicide or murdersift the thing to the bottom  aye aye sir responded mr brently and left to commence his investigation  hazel strong was prostrated  for two days she did not leave her cabin and when she finally ventured on deck she was very wan and white with great dark circles beneath her eyes  waking or sleeping it seemed that she constantly saw that dark body dropping swift and silent into the cold grim sea  shortly after her first appearance on deck following the tragedy monsieur thuran joined her with many expressions of kindly solicitude  oh but it is terrible miss strong he said  i cannot rid my mind of it  nor i said the girl wearily  i feel that he might have been saved had i but given the alarm  you must not reproach yourself my dear miss strong urged monsieur thuran  it was in no way your fault  another would have done as you did  who would think that because something fell into the sea from a ship that it must necessarily be a man  nor would the outcome have been different had you given an alarm  for a while they would have doubted your story thinking it but the nervous hallucination of a womanhad you insisted it would have been too late to have rescued him by the time the ship could have been brought to a stop and the boats lowered and rowed back miles in search of the unknown spot where the tragedy had occurred  no you must not censure yourself  you have done more than any other of us for poor mr caldwellyou were the only one to miss him  it was you who instituted the search  the girl could not help but feel grateful to him for his kind and encouraging words  he was with her oftenalmost constantly for the remainder of the voyageand she grew to like him very much indeed monsieur thuran had learned that the beautiful miss strong of baltimore was an american heiressa very wealthy girl in her own right and with future prospects that quite took his breath away when he contemplated them and since he spent most of his time in that delectable pastime it is a wonder that he breathed at all  it had been monsieur thurans intention to leave the ship at the first port they touched after the disappearance of tarzan  did he not have in his coat pocket the thing he had taken passage upon this very boat to obtain  there was nothing more to detain him here  he could not return to the continent fast enough that he might board the first express for st petersburg  but now another idea had obtruded itself and was rapidly crowding his original intentions into the background  that american fortune was not to be sneezed at nor was its possessor a whit less attractive  sapristi but she would cause a sensation in st petersburg and he would too with the assistance of her inheritance  after monsieur thuran had squandered a few million dollars he discovered that the vocation was so entirely to his liking that he would continue on down to cape town where he suddenly decided that he had pressing engagements that might detain him there for some time  miss strong had told him that she and her mother were to visit the latters brother therethey had not decided upon the duration of their stay and it would probably run into months  she was delighted when she found that monsieur thuran was to be there also  i hope that we shall be able to continue our acquaintance she said you must call upon mamma and me as soon as we are settled  monsieur thuran was delighted at the prospect and lost no time in saying so  mrs strong was not quite so favorably impressed by him as her daughter  i do not know why i should distrust him she said to hazel one day as they were discussing him  he seems a perfect gentleman in every respect but sometimes there is something about his eyesa fleeting expression which i cannot describe but which when i see it gives me a very uncanny feeling  the girl laughed  you are a silly dear mamma she said  i suppose so but i am sorry that we have not poor mr  caldwell for company instead  and i too replied her daughter  monsieur thuran became a frequent visitor at the home of hazel strongs uncle in cape town  his attentions were very marked but they were so punctiliously arranged to meet the girls every wish that she came to depend upon him more and more  did she or her mother or a cousin require an escortwas there a little friendly service to be rendered the genial and ubiquitous monsieur thuran was always available  her uncle and his family grew to like him for his unfailing courtesy and willingness to be of service  monsieur thuran was becoming indispensable  at length feeling the moment propitious he proposed miss strong was startled  she did not know what to say  i had never thought that you cared for me in any such way she told him  i have looked upon you always as a very dear friend  i shall not give you my answer now  forget that you have asked me to be your wife  let us go on as we have beenthen i can consider you from an entirely different angle for a time  it may be that i shall discover that my feeling for you is more than friendship  i certainly have not thought for a moment that i loved you  this arrangement was perfectly satisfactory to monsieur thuran  he deeply regretted that he had been hasty but he had loved her for so long a time and so devotedly that he thought that every one must know it  from the first time i saw you hazel he said i have loved you  i am willing to wait for i am certain that so great and pure a love as mine will be rewarded  all that i care to know is that you do not love another  will you tell me  i have never been in love in my life she replied and he was quite satisfied  on the way home that night he purchased a steam yacht and built a milliondollar villa on the black sea  the next day hazel strong enjoyed one of the happiest surprises of her lifeshe ran face to face upon jane porter as she was coming out of a jewelers shop  why jane porter she exclaimed  where in the world did you drop from  why i cant believe my own eyes  well of all things cried the equally astonished jane  and here i have been wasting whole reams of perfectly good imagination picturing you in baltimorethe very idea  and she threw her arms about her friend once more and kissed her a dozen times  by the time mutual explanations had been made hazel knew that lord tenningtons yacht had put in at cape town for at least a weeks stay and at the end of that time was to continue on her voyagethis time up the west coastand so back to england  where concluded jane i am to be married  then you are not married yet asked hazel  not yet replied jane and then quite irrelevantly i wish england were a million miles from here  visits were exchanged between the yacht and hazels relatives  dinners were arranged and trips into the surrounding country to entertain the visitors  monsieur thuran was a welcome guest at every function  he gave a dinner himself to the men of the party and managed to ingratiate himself in the good will of lord tennington by many little acts of hospitality  monsieur thuran had heard dropped a hint of something which might result from this unexpected visit of lord tenningtons yacht and he wanted to be counted in on it  once when he was alone with the englishman he took occasion to make it quite plain that his engagement to miss strong was to be announced immediately upon their return to america  but not a word of it my dear tenningtonnot a word of it  certainly i quite understand my dear fellow tennington had replied  but you are to be congratulatedripping girl dont you knowreally  the next day it came  mrs strong hazel and monsieur thuran were lord tenningtons guests aboard his yacht  mrs strong had been telling them how much she had enjoyed her visit at cape town and that she regretted that a letter just received from her attorneys in baltimore had necessitated her cutting her visit shorter than they had intended  when do you sail asked tennington  the first of the week i think she replied  indeed exclaimed monsieur thuran  i am very fortunate  i too have found that i must return at once and now i shall have the honor of accompanying and serving you  that is nice of you monsieur thuran replied mrs strong  i am sure that we shall be glad to place ourselves under your protection but in the bottom of her heart was the wish that they might escape him why she could not have told  by jove ejaculated lord tennington a moment later  bully idea by jove  yes tennington of course ventured clayton it must be a bully idea if you had it but what the deuce is it  goin to steam to china via the south pole  oh i say now clayton returned tennington you neednt be so rough on a fellow just because you didnt happen to suggest this trip yourselfyouve acted a regular bounder ever since we sailed  no sir he continued its a bully idea and youll all say so its to take mrs strong and miss strong and thuran too if hell come as far as england with us on the yacht  now isnt that a corker  forgive me tenny old boy cried clayton  it certainly is a corking ideai never should have suspected you of it  youre quite sure its original are you  and well sail the first of the week or any other time that suits your convenience mrs strong concluded the bighearted englishman as though the thing were all arranged except the sailing date  mercy lord tennington you havent even given us an opportunity to thank you much less decide whether we shall be able to accept your generous invitation said mrs strong  why of course youll come responded tennington  well make as good time as any passenger boat and youll be fully as comfortable and anyway we all want you and wont take no for an answer  and so it was settled that they should sail the following monday  two days out the girls were sitting in hazels cabin looking at some prints she had had finished in cape town  they represented all the pictures she had taken since she had left america and the girls were both engrossed in them jane asking many questions and hazel keeping up a perfect torrent of comment and explanation of the various scenes and people  and here she said suddenly heres a man you know  poor fellow i have so often intended asking you about him but i never have been able to think of it when we were together she was holding the little print so that jane did not see the face of the man it portrayed  his name was john caldwell continued hazel  do you recall him  he said that he met you in america  he is an englishman  i do not recollect the name replied jane  let me see the picture the poor fellow was lost overboard on our trip down the coast she said as she handed the print to jane  lost overwhy hazel hazeldont tell me that he is deaddrowned at sea  hazel  why dont you say that you are joking and before the astonished miss strong could catch her jane porter had slipped to the floor in a swoon  after hazel had restored her chum to consciousness she sat looking at her for a long time before either spoke  i did not know jane said hazel in a constrained voice that you knew mr caldwell so intimately that his death could prove such a shock to you  john caldwell questioned miss porter  you do not mean to tell me that you do not know who this man was hazel  why yes jane i know perfectly well who he washis name was john caldwell he was from london  oh hazel i wish i could believe it moaned the girl  i wish i could believe it but those features are burned so deep into my memory and my heart that i should recognize them anywhere in the world from among a thousand others who might appear identical to any one but me  what do you mean jane cried hazel now thoroughly alarmed  who do you think it is  i dont think hazel  i know that that is a picture of tarzan of the apes  jane  i cannot be mistaken  oh hazel are you sure that he is dead  can there be no mistake  i am afraid not dear answered hazel sadly  i wish i could think that you are mistaken but now a hundred and one little pieces of corroborative evidence occur to me that meant nothing to me while i thought that he was john caldwell of london  he said that he had been born in africa and educated in france  yes that would be true murmured jane porter dully  the first officer who searched his luggage found nothing to identify john caldwell of london  practically all his belongings had been made or purchased in paris  everything that bore an initial was marked either with a t alone or with j c t we thought that he was traveling incognito under his first two namesthe j c standing for john caldwell  tarzan of the apes took the name jean c tarzan said jane in the same lifeless monotone  and he is dead  oh  hazel it is horrible he died all alone in this terrible ocean  it is unbelievable that that brave heart should have ceased to beatthat those mighty muscles are quiet and cold forever  that he who was the personification of life and health and manly strength should be the prey of slimy crawling things that  but she could go no further and with a little moan she buried her head in her arms and sank sobbing to the floor  for days miss porter was ill and would see no one except hazel and the faithful esmeralda  when at last she came on deck all were struck by the sad change that had taken place in her  she was no longer the alert vivacious american beauty who had charmed and delighted all who came in contact with her  instead she was a very quiet and sad little girlwith an expression of hopeless wistfulness that none but hazel strong could interpret  the entire party strove their utmost to cheer and amuse her but all to no avail  occasionally the jolly lord tennington would wring a wan smile from her but for the most part she sat with wide eyes looking out across the sea  with jane porters illness one misfortune after another seemed to attack the yacht  first an engine broke down and they drifted for two days while temporary repairs were being made  then a squall struck them unaware that carried overboard nearly everything above deck that was portable  later two of the seamen fell to fighting in the forecastle with the result that one of them was badly wounded with a knife and the other had to be put in irons  then to cap the climax the mate fell overboard at night and was drowned before help could reach him  the yacht cruised about the spot for ten hours but no sign of the man was seen after he disappeared from the deck into the sea  every member of the crew and guests was gloomy and depressed after these series of misfortunes  all were apprehensive of worse to come and this was especially true of the seamen who recalled all sorts of terrible omens and warnings that had occurred during the early part of the voyage and which they could now clearly translate into the precursors of some grim and terrible tragedy to come  nor did the croakers have long to wait  the second night after the drowning of the mate the little yacht was suddenly wracked from stem to stern  about one oclock in the morning there was a terrific impact that threw the slumbering guests and crew from berth and bunk  a mighty shudder ran through the frail craft she lay far over to starboard the engines stopped  for a moment she hung there with her decks at an angle of fortyfive degreesthen with a sullen rending sound she slipped back into the sea and righted  instantly the men rushed upon deck followed closely by the women though the night was cloudy there was little wind or sea nor was it so dark but that just off the port bow a black mass could be discerned floating low in the water  a derelict was the terse explanation of the officer of the watch  presently the engineer hurried on deck in search of the captain  that patch we put on the cylinder heads blown out sir he reported and shes makin water fast forard on the port bow  an instant later a seaman rushed up from below  my gawd he cried  her whole bleedin bottoms ripped out  she cant float twenty minutes  shut up roared tennington  ladies go below and get some of your things together  it may not be so bad as that but we may have to take to the boats  it will be safer to be prepared  go at once please and captain jerrold send some competent man below please to ascertain the exact extent of the damage  in the meantime i might suggest that you have the boats provisioned  the calm low voice of the owner did much to reassure the entire party and a moment later all were occupied with the duties he had suggested by the time the ladies had returned to the deck the rapid provisioning of the boats had been about completed and a moment later the officer who had gone below had returned to report  but his opinion was scarcely needed to assure the huddled group of men and women that the end of the lady alice was at hand  well sir said the captain as his officer hesitated  i dislike to frighten the ladies sir he said but she cant float a dozen minutes in my opinion  theres a hole in her you could drive a bally cow through sir  for five minutes the lady alice had been settling rapidly by the bow already her stern loomed high in the air and foothold on the deck was of the most precarious nature  she carried four boats and these were all filled and lowered away in safety  as they pulled rapidly from the stricken little vessel jane porter turned to have one last look at her just then there came a loud crash and an ominous rumbling and pounding from the heart of the shipher machinery had broken loose and was dashing its way toward the bow tearing out partitions and bulkheads as it wentthe stern rose rapidly high above them for a moment she seemed to pause therea vertical shaft protruding from the bosom of the ocean and then swiftly she dove headforemost beneath the waves  in one of the boats the brave lord tennington wiped a tear from his eyehe had not seen a fortune in money go down forever into the sea but a dear beautiful friend whom he had loved  at last the long night broke and a tropical sun smote down upon the rolling water  jane porter had dropped into a fitful slumberthe fierce light of the sun upon her upturned face awoke her  she looked about her  in the boat with her were three sailors clayton and monsieur thuran  then she looked for the other boats but as far as the eye could reach there was nothing to break the fearful monotony of that waste of watersthey were alone in a small boat upon the broad atlantic     chapter 14  back to the primitive   as tarzan struck the water his first impulse was to swim clear of the ship and possible danger from her propellers  he knew whom to thank for his present predicament and as he lay in the sea just supporting himself by a gentle movement of his hands his chief emotion was one of chagrin that he had been so easily bested by rokoff  he lay thus for some time watching the receding and rapidly diminishing lights of the steamer without it ever once occurring to him to call for help  he never had called for help in his life and so it is not strange that he did not think of it now  always had he depended upon his own prowess and resourcefulness nor had there ever been since the days of kala any to answer an appeal for succor  when it did occur to him it was too late  there was thought tarzan a possible one chance in a hundred thousand that he might be picked up and an even smaller chance that he would reach land so he determined that to combine what slight chances there were he would swim slowly in the direction of the coastthe ship might have been closer in than he had known  his strokes were long and easyit would be many hours before those giant muscles would commence to feel fatigue  as he swam guided toward the east by the stars he noticed that he felt the weight of his shoes and so he removed them  his trousers went next and he would have removed his coat at the same time but for the precious papers in its pocket  to assure himself that he still had them he slipped his hand in to feel but to his consternation they were gone  now he knew that something more than revenge had prompted rokoff to pitch him overboardthe russian had managed to obtain possession of the papers tarzan had wrested from him at bou saada  the apeman swore softly and let his coat and shirt sink into the atlantic  before many hours he had divested himself of his remaining garments and was swimming easily and unencumbered toward the east  the first faint evidence of dawn was paling the stars ahead of him when the dim outlines of a lowlying black mass loomed up directly in his track  a few strong strokes brought him to its sideit was the bottom of a wavewashed derelict  tarzan clambered upon ithe would rest there until daylight at least  he had no intention to remain there inactivea prey to hunger and thirst  if he must die he preferred dying in action while making some semblance of an attempt to save himself  the sea was quiet so that the wreck had only a gently undulating motion that was nothing to the swimmer who had had no sleep for twenty hours  tarzan of the apes curled up upon the slimy timbers and was soon asleep  the heat of the sun awoke him early in the forenoon  his first conscious sensation was of thirst which grew almost to the proportions of suffering with full returning consciousness but a moment later it was forgotten in the joy of two almost simultaneous discoveries  the first was a mass of wreckage floating beside the derelict in the midst of which bottom up rose and fell an overturned lifeboat the other was the faint dim line of a fardistant shore showing on the horizon in the east  tarzan dove into the water and swam around the wreck to the lifeboat the cool ocean refreshed him almost as much as would a draft of water so that it was with renewed vigor that he brought the smaller boat alongside the derelict and after many herculean efforts succeeded in dragging it onto the slimy ships bottom  there he righted and examined itthe boat was quite sound and a moment later floated upright alongside the wreck  then tarzan selected several pieces of wreckage that might answer him as paddles and presently was making good headway toward the faroff shore  it was late in the afternoon by the time he came close enough to distinguish objects on land or to make out the contour of the shore line  before him lay what appeared to be the entrance to a little landlocked harbor  the wooded point to the north was strangely familiar  could it be possible that fate had thrown him up at the very threshold of his own beloved jungle  but as the bow of his boat entered the mouth of the harbor the last shred of doubt was cleared away for there before him upon the farther shore under the shadows of his primeval forest stood his own cabinbuilt before his birth by the hand of his longdead father john clayton lord greystoke  with long sweeps of his giant muscles tarzan sent the little craft speeding toward the beach  its prow had scarcely touched when the apeman leaped to shorehis heart beat fast in joy and exultation as each longfamiliar object came beneath his roving eyesthe cabin the beach the little brook the dense jungle the black impenetrable forest  the myriad birds in their brilliant plumagethe gorgeous tropical blooms upon the festooned creepers falling in great loops from the giant trees  tarzan of the apes had come into his own again and that all the world might know it he threw back his young head and gave voice to the fierce wild challenge of his tribe  for a moment silence reigned upon the jungle and then low and weird came an answering challengeit was the deep roar of numa the lion and from a great distance faintly the fearsome answering bellow of a bull ape  tarzan went to the brook first and slaked his thirst  then he approached his cabin  the door was still closed and latched as he and darnot had left it  he raised the latch and entered  nothing had been disturbed there were the table the bed and the little crib built by his fatherthe shelves and cupboards just as they had stood for ever twentythree yearsjust as he had left them nearly two years before  his eyes satisfied tarzans stomach began to call aloud for attentionthe pangs of hunger suggested a search for food  there was nothing in the cabin nor had he any weapons but upon a wall hung one of his old grass ropes  it had been many times broken and spliced so that he had discarded it for a better one long before  tarzan wished that he had a knife  well unless he was mistaken he should have that and a spear and bows and arrows before another sun had setthe rope would take care of that and in the meantime it must be made to procure food for him  he coiled it carefully and throwing it about his shoulder went out closing the door behind him  close to the cabin the jungle commenced and into it tarzan of the apes plunged wary and noiselessonce more a savage beast hunting its food for a time he kept to the ground but finally discovering no spoor indicative of nearby meat he took to the trees  with the first dizzy swing from tree to tree all the old joy of living swept over him  vain regrets and dull heartache were forgotten  now was he living  now indeed was the true happiness of perfect freedom his  who would go back to the stifling wicked cities of civilized man when the mighty reaches of the great jungle offered peace and liberty  not he  while it was yet light tarzan came to a drinking place by the side of a jungle river  there was a ford there and for countless ages the beasts of the forest had come down to drink at this spot  here of a night might always be found either sabor or numa crouching in the dense foliage of the surrounding jungle awaiting an antelope or a water buck for their meal  here came horta the boar to water and here came tarzan of the apes to make a kill for he was very empty  on a low branch he squatted above the trail  for an hour he waited it was growing dark  a little to one side of the ford in the densest thicket he heard the faint sound of padded feet and the brushing of a huge body against tall grasses and tangled creepers  none other than tarzan might have heard it but the apeman heard and translatedit was numa the lion on the same errand as himself  tarzan smiled  presently he heard an animal approaching warily along the trail toward the drinking place  a moment more and it came in viewit was horta the boar  here was delicious meatand tarzans mouth watered  the grasses where numa lay were very still nowominously still  horta passed beneath tarzana few more steps and he would be within the radius of numas spring  tarzan could imagine how old numas eyes were shininghow he was already sucking in his breath for the awful roar which would freeze his prey for the brief instant between the moment of the spring and the sinking of terrible fangs into splintering bones  but as numa gathered himself a slender rope flew through the air from the low branches of a nearby tree  a noose settled about hortas neck  there was a frightened grunt a squeal and then numa saw his quarry dragged backward up the trail and as he sprang horta the boar soared upward beyond his clutches into the tree above and a mocking face looked down and laughed into his own  then indeed did numa roar  angry threatening hungry he paced back and forth beneath the taunting apeman  now he stopped and rising on his hind legs against the stem of the tree that held his enemy sharpened his huge claws upon the bark tearing out great pieces that laid bare the white wood beneath  and in the meantime tarzan had dragged the struggling horta to the limb beside him  sinewy fingers completed the work the choking noose had commenced  the apeman had no knife but nature had equipped him with the means of tearing his food from the quivering flank of his prey and gleaming teeth sank into the succulent flesh while the raging lion looked on from below as another enjoyed the dinner that he had thought already his  it was quite dark by the time tarzan had gorged himself  ah but it had been delicious  never had he quite accustomed himself to the ruined flesh that civilized men had served him and in the bottom of his savage heart there had constantly been the craving for the warm meat of the fresh kill and the rich red blood  he wiped his bloody hands upon a bunch of leaves slung the remains of his kill across his shoulder and swung off through the middle terrace of the forest toward his cabin and at the same instant jane porter and william cecil clayton arose from a sumptuous dinner upon the lady alice thousands of miles to the east in the indian ocean  beneath tarzan walked numa the lion and when the apeman deigned to glance downward he caught occasional glimpses of the baleful green eyes following through the darkness  numa did not roar nowinstead he moved stealthily like the shadow of a great cat but yet he took no step that did not reach the sensitive ears of the apeman  tarzan wondered if he would stalk him to his cabin door  he hoped not for that would mean a nights sleep curled in the crotch of a tree and he much preferred the bed of grasses within his own abode  but he knew just the tree and the most comfortable crotch if necessity demanded that he sleep out  a hundred times in the past some great jungle cat had followed him home and compelled him to seek shelter in this same tree until another mood or the rising sun had sent his enemy away  but presently numa gave up the chase and with a series of bloodcurdling moans and roars turned angrily back in search of another and an easier dinner  so tarzan came to his cabin unattended and a few moments later was curled up in the mildewed remnants of what had once been a bed of grasses  thus easily did monsieur jean c tarzan slough the thin skin of his artificial civilization and sink happy and contented into the deep sleep of the wild beast that has fed to repletion  yet a womans yes would have bound him to that other life forever and made the thought of this savage existence repulsive  tarzan slept late into the following forenoon for he had been very tired from the labors and exertion of the long night and day upon the ocean and the jungle jaunt that had brought into play muscles that he had scarce used for nearly two years  when he awoke he ran to the brook first to drink  then he took a plunge into the sea swimming about for a quarter of an hour  afterward he returned to his cabin and breakfasted off the flesh of horta  this done he buried the balance of the carcass in the soft earth outside the cabin for his evening meal  once more he took his rope and vanished into the jungle  this time he hunted nobler quarryman although had you asked him his own opinion he could have named a dozen other denizens of the jungle which he considered far the superiors in nobility of the men he hunted  today tarzan was in quest of weapons  he wondered if the women and children had remained in mbongas village after the punitive expedition from the french cruiser had massacred all the warriors in revenge for darnots supposed death  he hoped that he should find warriors there for he knew not how long a quest he should have to make were the village deserted  the apeman traveled swiftly through the forest and about noon came to the site of the village but to his disappointment found that the jungle had overgrown the plantain fields and that the thatched huts had fallen in decay  there was no sign of man  he clambered about among the ruins for half an hour hoping that he might discover some forgotten weapon but his search was without fruit and so he took up his quest once more following up the stream which flowed from a southeasterly direction  he knew that near fresh water he would be most likely to find another settlement  as he traveled he hunted as he had hunted with his ape people in the past as kala had taught him to hunt turning over rotted logs to find some toothsome vermin running high into the trees to rob a birds nest or pouncing upon a tiny rodent with the quickness of a cat there were other things that he ate too but the less detailed the account of an apes diet the betterand tarzan was again an ape the same fierce brutal anthropoid that kala had taught him to be and that he had been for the first twenty years of his life  occasionally he smiled as he recalled some friend who might even at the moment be sitting placid and immaculate within the precincts of his select parisian clubjust as tarzan had sat but a few months before and then he would stop as though turned suddenly to stone as the gentle breeze carried to his trained nostrils the scent of some new prey or a formidable enemy  that night he slept far inland from his cabin securely wedged into the crotch of a giant tree swaying a hundred feet above the ground  he had eaten heartily againthis time from the flesh of bara the deer who had fallen prey to his quick noose  early the next morning he resumed his journey always following the course of the stream  for three days he continued his quest until he had come to a part of the jungle in which he never before had been occasionally upon the higher ground the forest was much thinner and in the far distance through the trees he could see ranges of mighty mountains with wide plains in the foreground  here in the open spaces were new gamecountless antelope and vast herds of zebra tarzan was entrancedhe would make a long visit to this new world  on the morning of the fourth day his nostrils were suddenly surprised by a faint new scent  it was the scent of man but yet a long way off the apeman thrilled with pleasure  every sense was on the alert as with crafty stealth he moved quickly through the trees upwind in the direction of his prey  presently he came upon ita lone warrior treading softly through the jungle  tarzan followed close above his quarry waiting for a clearer space in which to hurl his rope  as he stalked the unconscious man new thoughts presented themselves to the apemanthoughts born of the refining influences of civilization and of its cruelties  it came to him that seldom if ever did civilized man kill a fellow being without some pretext however slight  it was true that tarzan wished this mans weapons and ornaments but was it necessary to take his life to obtain them  the longer he thought about it the more repugnant became the thought of taking human life needlessly and thus it happened that while he was trying to decide just what to do they had come to a little clearing at the far side of which lay a palisaded village of beehive huts  as the warrior emerged from the forest tarzan caught a fleeting glimpse of a tawny hide worming its way through the matted jungle grasses in his wakeit was numa the lion  he too was stalking the black man  with the instant that tarzan realized the natives danger his attitude toward his erstwhile prey altered completelynow he was a fellow man threatened by a common enemy  numa was about to chargethere was little time in which to compare various methods or weigh the probable results of any  and then a number of things happened almost simultaneouslythe lion sprang from his ambush toward the retreating blacktarzan cried out in warningand the black turned just in time to see numa halted in midflight by a slender strand of grass rope the noosed end of which had fallen cleanly about his neck  the apeman had acted so quickly that he had been unable to prepare himself to withstand the strain and shock of numas great weight upon the rope and so it was that though the rope stopped the beast before his mighty talons could fasten themselves in the flesh of the black the strain overbalanced tarzan who came tumbling to the ground not six paces from the infuriated animal  like lightning numa turned upon this new enemy and defenseless as he was tarzan of the apes was nearer to death that instant than he ever before had been  it was the black who saved him  the warrior realized in an instant that he owed his life to this strange white man and he also saw that only a miracle could save his preserver from those fierce yellow fangs that had been so near to his own flesh  with the quickness of thought his spear arm flew back and then shot forward with all the force of the sinewy muscles that rolled beneath the shimmering ebon hide  true to its mark the ironshod weapon flew transfixing numas sleek carcass from the right groin to beneath the left shoulder with a hideous scream of rage and pain the brute turned again upon the black  a dozen paces he had gone when tarzans rope brought him to a stand once morethen he wheeled again upon the apeman only to feel the painful prick of a barbed arrow as it sank half its length in his quivering flesh  again he stopped and by this time tarzan had run twice around the stem of a great tree with his rope and made the end fast  the black saw the trick and grinned but tarzan knew that numa must be quickly finished before those mighty teeth had found and parted the slender cord that held him  it was a matter of but an instant to reach the blacks side and drag his long knife from its scabbard  then he signed the warrior to continue to shoot arrows into the great beast while he attempted to close in upon him with the knife so as one tantalized upon one side the other sneaked cautiously in upon the other  numa was furious  he raised his voice in a perfect frenzy of shrieks growls and hideous moans the while he reared upon his hind legs in futile attempt to reach first one and then the other of his tormentors  but at length the agile apeman saw his chance and rushed in upon the beasts left side behind the mighty shoulder  a giant arm encircled the tawny throat and a long blade sank once true as a die into the fierce heart  then tarzan arose and the black man and the white looked into each others eyes across the body of their killand the black made the sign of peace and friendship and tarzan of the apes answered in kind     chapter 15  from ape to savage   the noise of their battle with numa had drawn an excited horde of savages from the nearby village and a moment after the lions death the two men were surrounded by lithe ebon warriors gesticulating and jabberinga thousand questions that drowned each ventured reply  and then the women came and the childreneager curious and at sight of tarzan more questioning than ever  the apemans new friend finally succeeded in making himself heard and when he had done talking the men and women of the village vied with one another in doing honor to the strange creature who had saved their fellow and battled singlehanded with fierce numa  at last they led him back to their village where they brought him gifts of fowl and goats and cooked food  when he pointed to their weapons the warriors hastened to fetch spear shield arrows and a bow  his friend of the encounter presented him with the knife with which he had killed numa  there was nothing in all the village he could not have had for the asking  how much easier this was thought tarzan than murder and robbery to supply his wants  how close he had been to killing this man whom he never had seen before and who now was manifesting by every primitive means at his command friendship and affection for his wouldbe slayer tarzan of the apes was ashamed  hereafter he would at least wait until he knew men deserved it before he thought of killing them  the idea recalled rokoff to his mind  he wished that he might have the russian to himself in the dark jungle for a few minutes  there was a man who deserved killing if ever any one did  and if he could have seen rokoff at that moment as he assiduously bent every endeavor to the pleasant task of ingratiating himself into the affections of the beautiful miss strong he would have longed more than ever to mete out to the man the fate he deserved  tarzans first night with the savages was devoted to a wild orgy in his honor  there was feasting for the hunters had brought in an antelope and a zebra as trophies of their skill and gallons of the weak native beer were consumed  as the warriors danced in the firelight tarzan was again impressed by the symmetry of their figures and the regularity of their featuresthe flat noses and thick lips of the typical west coast savage were entirely missing  in repose the faces of the men were intelligent and dignified those of the women ofttimes prepossessing  it was during this dance that the apeman first noticed that some of the men and many of the women wore ornaments of goldprincipally anklets and armlets of great weight apparently beaten out of the solid metal  when he expressed a wish to examine one of these the owner removed it from her person and insisted through the medium of signs that tarzan accept it as a gift  a close scrutiny of the bauble convinced the apeman that the article was of virgin gold and he was surprised for it was the first time that he had ever seen golden ornaments among the savages of africa other than the trifling baubles those near the coast had purchased or stolen from europeans  he tried to ask them from whence the metal came but he could not make them understand  when the dance was done tarzan signified his intention to leave them but they almost implored him to accept the hospitality of a great hut which the chief set apart for his sole use  he tried to explain that he would return in the morning but they could not understand  when he finally walked away from them toward the side of the village opposite the gate they were still further mystified as to his intentions  tarzan however knew just what he was about  in the past he had had experience with the rodents and vermin that infest every native village and while he was not overscrupulous about such matters he much preferred the fresh air of the swaying trees to the fetid atmosphere of a hut  the natives followed him to where a great tree overhung the palisade and as tarzan leaped for a lower branch and disappeared into the foliage above precisely after the manner of manu the monkey there were loud exclamations of surprise and astonishment  for half an hour they called to him to return but as he did not answer them they at last desisted and sought the sleepingmats within their huts  tarzan went back into the forest a short distance until he had found a tree suited to his primitive requirements and then curling himself in a great crotch he fell immediately into a deep sleep  the following morning he dropped into the village street as suddenly as he had disappeared the preceding night  for a moment the natives were startled and afraid but when they recognized their guest of the night before they welcomed him with shouts and laughter  that day he accompanied a party of warriors to the nearby plains on a great hunt and so dexterous did they find this white man with their own crude weapons that another bond of respect and admiration was thereby wrought  for weeks tarzan lived with his savage friends hunting buffalo antelope and zebra for meat and elephant for ivory  quickly he learned their simple speech their native customs and the ethics of their wild primitive tribal life  he found that they were not cannibalsthat they looked with loathing and contempt upon men who ate men  busuli the warrior whom he had stalked to the village told him many of the tribal legendshow many years before his people had come many long marches from the north how once they had been a great and powerful tribe and how the slave raiders had wrought such havoc among them with their deathdealing guns that they had been reduced to a mere remnant of their former numbers and power  they hunted us down as one hunts a fierce beast said busuli  there was no mercy in them  when it was not slaves they sought it was ivory but usually it was both  our men were killed and our women driven away like sheep  we fought against them for many years but our arrows and spears could not prevail against the sticks which spit fire and lead and death to many times the distance that our mightiest warrior could place an arrow  at last when my father was a young man the arabs came again but our warriors saw them a long way off and chowambi who was chief then told his people to gather up their belongings and come away with himthat he would lead them far to the south until they found a spot to which the arab raiders did not come  and they did as he bid carrying all their belongings including many tusks of ivory  for months they wandered suffering untold hardships and privations for much of the way was through dense jungle and across mighty mountains but finally they came to this spot and although they sent parties farther on to search for an even better location none has ever been found  and the raiders have never found you here asked tarzan  about a year ago a small party of arabs and manyuema stumbled upon us but we drove them off killing many  for days we followed them stalking them for the wild beasts they are picking them off one by one until but a handful remained but these escaped us  as busuli talked he fingered a heavy gold armlet that encircled the glossy hide of his left arm  tarzans eyes had been upon the ornament but his thoughts were elsewhere  presently he recalled the question he had tried to ask when he first came to the tribethe question he could not at that time make them understand  for weeks he had forgotten so trivial a thing as gold for he had been for the time a truly primeval man with no thought beyond today  but of a sudden the sight of gold awakened the sleeping civilization that was in him and with it came the lust for wealth  that lesson tarzan had learned well in his brief experience of the ways of civilized man  he knew that gold meant power and pleasure  he pointed to the bauble  from whence came the yellow metal busuli he asked  the black pointed toward the southeast  a moons march awaymaybe more he replied  have you been there asked tarzan  no but some of our people were there years ago when my father was yet a young man  one of the parties that searched farther for a location for the tribe when first they settled here came upon a strange people who wore many ornaments of yellow metal  their spears were tipped with it as were their arrows and they cooked in vessels made all of solid metal like my armlet  they lived in a great village in huts that were built of stone and surrounded by a great wall  they were very fierce rushing out and falling upon our warriors before ever they learned that their errand was a peaceful one  our men were few in number but they held their own at the top of a little rocky hill until the fierce people went back at sunset into their wicked city  then our warriors came down from their hill and after taking many ornaments of yellow metal from the bodies of those they had slain they marched back out of the valley nor have any of us ever returned  they are wicked peopleneither white like you nor black like me but covered with hair as is bolgani the gorilla  yes they are very bad people indeed and chowambi was glad to get out of their country  and are none of those alive who were with chowambi and saw these strange people and their wonderful city asked tarzan  waziri our chief was there replied busuli  he was a very young man then but he accompanied chowambi who was his father  so that night tarzan asked waziri about it and waziri who was now an old man said that it was a long march but that the way was not difficult to follow  he remembered it well  for ten days we followed this river which runs beside our village  up toward its source we traveled until on the tenth day we came to a little spring far up upon the side of a lofty mountain range  in this little spring our river is born  the next day we crossed over the top of the mountain and upon the other side we came to a tiny rivulet which we followed down into a great forest  for many days we traveled along the winding banks of the rivulet that had now become a river until we came to a greater river into which it emptied and which ran down the center of a mighty valley  then we followed this large river toward its source hoping to come to more open land  after twenty days of marching from the time we had crossed the mountains and passed out of our own country we came again to another range of mountains  up their side we followed the great river that had now dwindled to a tiny rivulet until we came to a little cave near the mountaintop  in this cave was the mother of the river  i remember that we camped there that night and that it was very cold for the mountains were high  the next day we decided to ascend to the top of the mountains and see what the country upon the other side looked like and if it seemed no better than that which we had so far traversed we would return to our village and tell them that they had already found the best place in all the world to live  and so we clambered up the face of the rocky cliffs until we reached the summit and there from a flat mountaintop we saw not far beneath us a shallow valley very narrow and upon the far side of it was a great village of stone much of which had fallen and crumbled into decay  the balance of waziris story was practically the same as that which busuli had told  i should like to go there and see this strange city said tarzan and get some of their yellow metal from its fierce inhabitants  it is a long march replied waziri and i am an old man but if you will wait until the rainy season is over and the rivers have gone down i will take some of my warriors and go with you  and tarzan had to be contented with that arrangement though he would have liked it well enough to have set off the next morninghe was as impatient as a child  really tarzan of the apes was but a child or a primeval man which is the same thing in a way  the next day but one a small party of hunters returned to the village from the south to report a large herd of elephant some miles away  by climbing trees they had had a fairly good view of the herd which they described as numbering several large tuskers a great many cows and calves and fullgrown bulls whose ivory would be worth having  the balance of the day and evening was filled with preparation for a great huntspears were overhauled quivers were replenished bows were restrung and all the while the village witch doctor passed through the busy throngs disposing of various charms and amulets designed to protect the possessor from hurt or bring him good fortune in the morrows hunt  at dawn the hunters were off  there were fifty sleek black warriors and in their midst lithe and active as a young forest god strode tarzan of the apes his brown skin contrasting oddly with the ebony of his companions  except for color he was one of them  his ornaments and weapons were the same as theirshe spoke their languagehe laughed and joked with them and leaped and shouted in the brief wild dance that preceded their departure from the village to all intent and purpose a savage among savages  nor had he questioned himself is it to be doubted that he would have admitted that he was far more closely allied to these people and their life than to the parisian friends whose ways apelike he had successfully mimicked for a few short months  but he did think of darnot and a grin of amusement showed his strong white teeth as he pictured the immaculate frenchmans expression could he by some means see tarzan as he was that minute  poor paul who had prided himself on having eradicated from his friend the last traces of wild savagery  how quickly have i fallen thought tarzan but in his heart he did not consider it a fallrather he pitied the poor creatures of paris penned up like prisoners in their silly clothes and watched by policemen all their poor lives that they might do nothing that was not entirely artificial and tiresome  a two hours march brought them close to the vicinity in which the elephants had been seen the previous day  from there on they moved very quietly indeed searching for the spoor of the great beasts  at length they found the wellmarked trail along which the herd had passed not many hours before  in single file they followed it for about half an hour  it was tarzan who first raised his hand in signal that the quarry was at handhis sensitive nose had warned him that the elephants were not far ahead of them  the blacks were skeptical when he told them how he knew  come with me said tarzan and we shall see  with the agility of a squirrel he sprang into a tree and ran nimbly to the top  one of the blacks followed more slowly and carefully  when he had reached a lofty limb beside the apeman the latter pointed to the south and there some few hundred yards away the black saw a number of huge black backs swaying back and forth above the top of the lofty jungle grasses  he pointed the direction to the watchers below indicating with his fingers the number of beasts he could count  immediately the hunters started toward the elephants  the black in the tree hastened down but tarzan stalked after his own fashion along the leafy way of the middle terrace  it is no childs play to hunt wild elephants with the crude weapons of primitive man  tarzan knew that few native tribes ever attempted it and the fact that his tribe did so gave him no little pridealready he was commencing to think of himself as a member of the little community as tarzan moved silently through the trees he saw the warriors below creeping in a half circle upon the still unsuspecting elephants finally they were within sight of the great beasts  now they singled out two large tuskers and at a signal the fifty men rose from the ground where they had lain concealed and hurled their heavy war spears at the two marked beasts  there was not a single miss twentyfive spears were embedded in the sides of each of the giant animals  one never moved from the spot where it stood when the avalanche of spears struck it for two perfectly aimed had penetrated its heart and it lunged forward upon its knees rolling to the ground without a struggle  the other standing nearly headon toward the hunters had not proved so good a mark and though every spear struck not one entered the great heart  for a moment the huge bull stood trumpeting in rage and pain casting about with its little eyes for the author of its hurt  the blacks had faded into the jungle before the weak eyes of the monster had fallen upon any of them but now he caught the sound of their retreat and amid a terrific crashing of underbrush and branches he charged in the direction of the noise  it so happened that chance sent him in the direction of busuli whom he was overtaking so rapidly that it was as though the black were standing still instead of racing at full speed to escape the certain death which pursued him  tarzan had witnessed the entire performance from the branches of a nearby tree and now that he saw his friends peril he raced toward the infuriated beast with loud cries hoping to distract him  but it had been as well had he saved his breath for the brute was deaf and blind to all else save the particular object of his rage that raced futilely before him  and now tarzan saw that only a miracle could save busuli and with the same unconcern with which he had once hunted this very man he hurled himself into the path of the elephant to save the black warriors life  he still grasped his spear and while tantor was yet six or eight paces behind his prey a sinewy white warrior dropped as from the heavens almost directly in his path  with a vicious lunge the elephant swerved to the right to dispose of this temerarious foeman who dared intervene between himself and his intended victim but he had not reckoned on the lightning quickness that could galvanize those steel muscles into action so marvelously swift as to baffle even a keener eyesight than tantors  and so it happened that before the elephant realized that his new enemy had leaped from his path tarzan had driven his ironshod spear from behind the massive shoulder straight into the fierce heart and the colossal pachyderm had toppled to his death at the feet of the apeman  busuli had not beheld the manner of his deliverance but waziri the old chief had seen and several of the other warriors and they hailed tarzan with delight as they swarmed about him and his great kill  when he leaped upon the mighty carcass and gave voice to the weird challenge with which he announced a great victory the blacks shrank back in fear for to them it marked the brutal bolgani whom they feared fully as much as they feared numa the lion but with a fear with which was mixed a certain uncanny awe of the manlike thing to which they attributed supernatural powers  but when tarzan lowered his raised head and smiled upon them they were reassured though they did not understand  nor did they ever fully understand this strange creature who ran through the trees as quickly as manu yet was even more at home upon the ground than themselves who was except as to color like unto themselves yet as powerful as ten of them and singlehanded a match for the fiercest denizens of the fierce jungle  when the remainder of the warriors had gathered the hunt was again taken up and the stalking of the retreating herd once more begun but they had covered a bare hundred yards when from behind them at a great distance sounded faintly a strange popping  for an instant they stood like a group of statuary intently listening then tarzan spoke  guns he said  the village is being attacked  come cried waziri  the arab raiders have returned with their cannibal slaves for our ivory and our women     chapter 16  the ivory raiders   waziris warriors marched at a rapid trot through the jungle in the direction of the village  for a few minutes the sharp cracking of guns ahead warned them to haste but finally the reports dwindled to an occasional shot presently ceasing altogether  nor was this less ominous than the rattle of musketry for it suggested but a single solution to the little band of rescuersthat the illy garrisoned village had already succumbed to the onslaught of a superior force  the returning hunters had covered a little more than three miles of the five that had separated them from the village when they met the first of the fugitives who had escaped the bullets and clutches of the foe there were a dozen women youths and girls in the party and so excited were they that they could scarce make themselves understood as they tried to relate to waziri the calamity that had befallen his people  they are as many as the leaves of the forest cried one of the women in attempting to explain the enemys force  there are many arabs and countless manyuema and they all have guns  they crept close to the village before we knew that they were about and then with many shouts they rushed in upon us shooting down men and women and children  those of us who could fled in all directions into the jungle but more were killed  i do not know whether they took any prisoners or notthey seemed only bent upon killing us all  the manyuema called us many names saying that they would eat us all before they left our countrythat this was our punishment for killing their friends last year  i did not hear much for i ran away quickly  the march toward the village was now resumed more slowly and with greater stealth for waziri knew that it was too late to rescuetheir only mission could be one of revenge  inside the next mile a hundred more fugitives were met  there were many men among these and so the fighting strength of the party was augmented  now a dozen warriors were sent creeping ahead to reconnoiter  waziri remained with the main body which advanced in a thin line that spread in a great crescent through the forest  by the chiefs side walked tarzan  presently one of the scouts returned  he had come within sight of the village  they are all within the palisade he whispered  good said waziri  we shall rush in upon them and slay them all and he made ready to send word along the line that they were to halt at the edge of the clearing until they saw him rush toward the villagethen all were to follow  wait cautioned tarzan  if there are even fifty guns within the palisade we shall be repulsed and slaughtered  let me go alone through the trees so that i may look down upon them from above and see just how many there be and what chance we might have were we to charge  it were foolish to lose a single man needlessly if there be no hope of success  i have an idea that we can accomplish more by cunning than by force  will you wait waziri  yes said the old chief  go  so tarzan sprang into the trees and disappeared in the direction of the village  he moved more cautiously than was his wont for he knew that men with guns could reach him quite as easily in the treetops as on the ground  and when tarzan of the apes elected to adopt stealth no creature in all the jungle could move so silently or so completely efface himself from the sight of an enemy  in five minutes he had wormed his way to the great tree that overhung the palisade at one end of the village and from his point of vantage looked down upon the savage horde beneath  he counted fifty arabs and estimated that there were five times as many manyuema  the latter were gorging themselves upon food and under the very noses of their white masters preparing the gruesome feast which is the piece de resistance that follows a victory in which the bodies of their slain enemies fall into their horrid hands  the apeman saw that to charge that wild horde armed as they were with guns and barricaded behind the locked gates of the village would be a futile task and so he returned to waziri and advised him to wait that he tarzan had a better plan  but a moment before one of the fugitives had related to waziri the story of the atrocious murder of the old chiefs wife and so crazed with rage was the old man that he cast discretion to the winds calling his warriors about him he commanded them to charge and with brandishing spears and savage yells the little force of scarcely more than a hundred dashed madly toward the village gates  before the clearing had been half crossed the arabs opened up a withering fire from behind the palisade  with the first volley waziri fell  the speed of the chargers slackened  another volley brought down a half dozen more  a few reached the barred gates only to be shot in their tracks without the ghost of a chance to gain the inside of the palisade and then the whole attack crumpled and the remaining warriors scampered back into the forest  as they ran the raiders opened the gates rushing after them to complete the days work with the utter extermination of the tribe  tarzan had been among the last to turn back toward the forest and now as he ran slowly he turned from time to time to speed a wellaimed arrow into the body of a pursuer  once within the jungle he found a little knot of determined blacks waiting to give battle to the oncoming horde but tarzan cried to them to scatter keeping out of harms way until they could gather in force after dark  do as i tell you he urged and i will lead you to victory over these enemies of yours  scatter through the forest picking up as many stragglers as you can find and at night if you think that you have been followed come by roundabout ways to the spot where we killed the elephants today  then i will explain my plan and you will find that it is good  you cannot hope to pit your puny strength and simple weapons against the numbers and the guns of the arabs and the manyuema  they finally assented  when you scatter explained tarzan in conclusion your foes will have to scatter to follow you and so it may happen that if you are watchful you can drop many a manyuema with your arrows from behind some great trees  they had barely time to hasten away farther into the forest before the first of the raiders had crossed the clearing and entered it in pursuit of them  tarzan ran a short distance along the ground before he took to the trees  then he raced quickly to the upper terrace there doubling on his tracks and making his way rapidly back toward the village  here he found that every arab and manyuema had joined in the pursuit leaving the village deserted except for the chained prisoners and a single guard  the sentry stood at the open gate looking in the direction of the forest so that he did not see the agile giant that dropped to the ground at the far end of the village street  with drawn bow the apeman crept stealthily toward his unsuspecting victim  the prisoners had already discovered him and with wide eyes filled with wonder and with hope they watched their wouldbe rescuer  now he halted not ten paces from the unconscious manyuema  the shaft was drawn back its full length at the height of the keen gray eye that sighted along its polished surface  there was a sudden twang as the brown fingers released their hold and without a sound the raider sank forward upon his face a wooden shaft transfixing his heart and protruding a foot from his black chest  then tarzan turned his attention to the fifty women and youths chained neck to neck on the long slave chain  there was no releasing of the ancient padlocks in the time that was left him so the apeman called to them to follow him as they were and snatching the gun and cartridge belt from the dead sentry he led the now happy band out through the village gate and into the forest upon the far side of the clearing  it was a slow and arduous march for the slave chain was new to these people and there were many delays as one of their number would stumble and fall dragging others down with her  then too tarzan had been forced to make a wide detour to avoid any possibility of meeting with returning raiders  he was partially guided by occasional shots which indicated that the arab horde was still in touch with the villagers but he knew that if they would but follow his advice there would be but few casualties other than on the side of the marauders  toward dusk the firing ceased entirely and tarzan knew that the arabs had all returned to the village  he could scarce repress a smile of triumph as he thought of their rage on discovering that their guard had been killed and their prisoners taken away  tarzan had wished that he might have taken some of the great store of ivory the village contained solely for the purpose of still further augmenting the wrath of his enemies but he knew that that was not necessary for its salvation since he already had a plan mapped out which would effectually prevent the arabs leaving the country with a single tusk and it would have been cruel to have needlessly burdened these poor overwrought women with the extra weight of the heavy ivory  it was after midnight when tarzan with his slowmoving caravan approached the spot where the elephants lay  long before they reached it they had been guided by the huge fire the natives had built in the center of a hastily improvised boma partially for warmth and partially to keep off chance lions  when they had come close to the encampment tarzan called aloud to let them know that friends were coming  it was a joyous reception the little party received when the blacks within the boma saw the long file of fettered friends and relatives enter the firelight  these had all been given up as lost forever as had tarzan as well so that the happy blacks would have remained awake all night to feast on elephant meat and celebrate the return of their fellows had not tarzan insisted that they take what sleep they could against the work of the coming day  at that sleep was no easy matter for the women who had lost their men or their children in the days massacre and battle made night hideous with their continued wailing and howling  finally however tarzan succeeded in silencing them on the plea that their noise would attract the arabs to their hidingplace when all would be slaughtered  when dawn came tarzan explained his plan of battle to the warriors and without demur one and all agreed that it was the safest and surest way in which to rid themselves of their unwelcome visitors and be revenged for the murder of their fellows  first the women and children with a guard of some twenty old warriors and youths were started southward to be entirely out of the zone of danger  they had instructions to erect temporary shelter and construct a protecting boma of thorn bush for the plan of campaign which tarzan had chosen was one which might stretch out over many days or even weeks during which time the warriors would not return to the new camp  two hours after daylight a thin circle of black warriors surrounded the village  at intervals one was perched high in the branches of a tree which could overlook the palisade  presently a manyuema within the village fell pierced by a single arrow  there had been no sound of attacknone of the hideous warcries or vainglorious waving of menacing spears that ordinarily marks the attack of savagesjust a silent messenger of death from out of the silent forest  the arabs and their followers were thrown into a fine rage at this unprecedented occurrence  they ran for the gates to wreak dire vengeance upon the foolhardy perpetrator of the outrage but they suddenly realized that they did not know which way to turn to find the foe  as they stood debating with many angry shouts and much gesticulating one of the arabs sank silently to the ground in their very midsta thin arrow protruding from his heart  tarzan had placed the finest marksmen of the tribe in the surrounding trees with directions never to reveal themselves while the enemy was faced in their direction  as a black released his messenger of death he would slink behind the sheltering stem of the tree he had selected nor would he again aim until a watchful eye told him that none was looking toward his tree  three times the arabs started across the clearing in the direction from which they thought the arrows came but each time another arrow would come from behind to take its toll from among their number  then they would turn and charge in a new direction  finally they set out upon a determined search of the forest but the blacks melted before them so that they saw no sign of an enemy  but above them lurked a grim figure in the dense foliage of the mighty treesit was tarzan of the apes hovering over them as if he had been the shadow of death  presently a manyuema forged ahead of his companions there was none to see from what direction death came and so it came quickly and a moment later those behind stumbled over the dead body of their comradethe inevitable arrow piercing the still heart  it does not take a great deal of this manner of warfare to get upon the nerves of white men and so it is little to be wondered at that the manyuema were soon panicstricken  did one forge ahead an arrow found his heart did one lag behind he never again was seen alive did one stumble to one side even for a bare moment from the sight of his fellows he did not returnand always when they came upon the bodies of their dead they found those terrible arrows driven with the accuracy of superhuman power straight through the victims heart  but worse than all else was the hideous fact that not once during the morning had they seen or heard the slightest sign of an enemy other than the pitiless arrows  when finally they returned to the village it was no better  every now and then at varying intervals that were maddening in the terrible suspense they caused a man would plunge forward dead  the blacks besought their masters to leave this terrible place but the arabs feared to take up the march through the grim and hostile forest beset by this new and terrible enemy while laden with the great store of ivory they had found within the village but worse yet they hated to leave the ivory behind  finally the entire expedition took refuge within the thatched hutshere at least they would be free from the arrows  tarzan from the tree above the village had marked the hut into which the chief arabs had gone and balancing himself upon an overhanging limb he drove his heavy spear with all the force of his giant muscles through the thatched roof  a howl of pain told him that it had found a mark with this parting salute to convince them that there was no safety for them anywhere within the country tarzan returned to the forest collected his warriors and withdrew a mile to the south to rest and eat  he kept sentries in several trees that commanded a view of the trail toward the village but there was no pursuit  an inspection of his force showed not a single casualtynot even a minor wound while rough estimates of the enemies loss convinced the blacks that no fewer than twenty had fallen before their arrows  they were wild with elation and were for finishing the day in one glorious rush upon the village during which they would slaughter the last of their foemen  they were even picturing the various tortures they would inflict and gloating over the suffering of the manyuema for whom they entertained a peculiar hatred when tarzan put his foot down flatly upon the plan  you are crazy he cried  i have shown you the only way to fight these people  already you have killed twenty of them without the loss of a single warrior whereas yesterday following your own tactics which you would now renew you lost at least a dozen and killed not a single arab or manyuema  you will fight just as i tell you to fight or i shall leave you and go back to my own country  they were frightened when he threatened this and promised to obey him scrupulously if he would but promise not to desert them  very well he said  we shall return to the elephant boma for the night  i have a plan to give the arabs a little taste of what they may expect if they remain in our country but i shall need no help  come if they suffer no more for the balance of the day they will feel reassured and the relapse into fear will be even more nerveracking than as though we continued to frighten them all afternoon  so they marched back to their camp of the previous night and lighting great fires ate and recounted the adventures of the day until long after dark  tarzan slept until midnight then he arose and crept into the cimmerian blackness of the forest  an hour later he came to the edge of the clearing before the village  there was a campfire burning within the palisade  the apeman crept across the clearing until he stood before the barred gates  through the interstices he saw a lone sentry sitting before the fire  quietly tarzan went to the tree at the end of the village street  he climbed softly to his place and fitted an arrow to his bow  for several minutes he tried to sight fairly upon the sentry but the waving branches and flickering firelight convinced him that the danger of a miss was too greathe must touch the heart full in the center to bring the quiet and sudden death his plan required  he had brought besides his bow arrows and rope the gun he had taken the previous day from the other sentry he had killed  caching all these in a convenient crotch of the tree he dropped lightly to the ground within the palisade armed only with his long knife  the sentrys back was toward him  like a cat tarzan crept upon the dozing man  he was within two paces of him nowanother instant and the knife would slide silently into the fellows heart  tarzan crouched for a spring for that is ever the quickest and surest attack of the jungle beastwhen the man warned by some subtle sense sprang to his feet and faced the apeman     chapter 17  the white chief of the waziri   when the eyes of the black manyuema savage fell upon the strange apparition that confronted him with menacing knife they went wide in horror  he forgot the gun within his hands he even forgot to cry outhis one thought was to escape this fearsomelooking white savage this giant of a man upon whose massive rolling muscles and mighty chest the flickering firelight played  but before he could turn tarzan was upon him and then the sentry thought to scream for aid but it was too late  a great hand was upon his windpipe and he was being borne to the earth  he battled furiously but futilelywith the grim tenacity of a bulldog those awful fingers were clinging to his throat  swiftly and surely life was being choked from him  his eyes bulged his tongue protruded his face turned to a ghastly purplish huethere was a convulsive tremor of the stiffening muscles and the manyuema sentry lay quite still  the apeman threw the body across one of his broad shoulders and gathering up the fellows gun trotted silently up the sleeping village street toward the tree that gave him such easy ingress to the palisaded village  he bore the dead sentry into the midst of the leafy maze above  first he stripped the body of cartridge belt and such ornaments as he craved wedging it into a convenient crotch while his nimble fingers ran over it in search of the loot he could not plainly see in the dark when he had finished he took the gun that had belonged to the man and walked far out upon a limb from the end of which he could obtain a better view of the huts  drawing a careful bead on the beehive structure in which he knew the chief arabs to be he pulled the trigger  almost instantly there was an answering groan  tarzan smiled  he had made another lucky hit  following the shot there was a moments silence in the camp and then manyuema and arab came pouring from the huts like a swarm of angry hornets but if the truth were known they were even more frightened than they were angry  the strain of the preceding day had wrought upon the fears of both black and white and now this single shot in the night conjured all manner of terrible conjectures in their terrified minds  when they discovered that their sentry had disappeared their fears were in no way allayed and as though to bolster their courage by warlike actions they began to fire rapidly at the barred gates of the village although no enemy was in sight  tarzan took advantage of the deafening roar of this fusillade to fire into the mob beneath him  no one heard his shot above the din of rattling musketry in the street but some who were standing close saw one of their number crumple suddenly to the earth  when they leaned over him he was dead  they were panicstricken and it took all the brutal authority of the arabs to keep the manyuema from rushing helterskelter into the jungleanywhere to escape from this terrible village  after a time they commenced to quiet down and as no further mysterious deaths occurred among them they took heart again  but it was a shortlived respite for just as they had concluded that they would not be disturbed again tarzan gave voice to a weird moan and as the raiders looked up in the direction from which the sound seemed to come the apeman who stood swinging the dead body of the sentry gently to and fro suddenly shot the corpse far out above their heads  with howls of alarm the throng broke in all directions to escape this new and terrible creature who seemed to be springing upon them  to their feardistorted imaginations the body of the sentry falling with widesprawled arms and legs assumed the likeness of a great beast of prey  in their anxiety to escape many of the blacks scaled the palisade while others tore down the bars from the gates and rushed madly across the clearing toward the jungle  for a time no one turned back toward the thing that had frightened them but tarzan knew that they would in a moment and when they discovered that it was but the dead body of their sentry while they would doubtless be still further terrified he had a rather definite idea as to what they would do and so he faded silently away toward the south taking the moonlit upper terrace back toward the camp of the waziri  presently one of the arabs turned and saw that the thing that had leaped from the tree upon them lay still and quiet where it had fallen in the center of the village street  cautiously he crept back toward it until he saw that it was but a man  a moment later he was beside the figure and in another had recognized it as the corpse of the manyuema who had stood on guard at the village gate  his companions rapidly gathered around at his call and after a moments excited conversation they did precisely what tarzan had reasoned they would  raising their guns to their shoulders they poured volley after volley into the tree from which the corpse had been thrownhad tarzan remained there he would have been riddled by a hundred bullets  when the arabs and manyuema discovered that the only marks of violence upon the body of their dead comrade were giant finger prints upon his swollen throat they were again thrown into deeper apprehension and despair  that they were not even safe within a palisaded village at night came as a distinct shock to them  that an enemy could enter into the midst of their camp and kill their sentry with bare hands seemed outside the bounds of reason and so the superstitious manyuema commenced to attribute their ill luck to supernatural causes nor were the arabs able to offer any better explanation  with at least fifty of their number flying through the black jungle and without the slightest knowledge of when their uncanny foemen might resume the coldblooded slaughter they had commenced it was a desperate band of cutthroats that waited sleeplessly for the dawn only on the promise of the arabs that they would leave the village at daybreak and hasten onward toward their own land would the remaining manyuema consent to stay at the village a moment longer  not even fear of their cruel masters was sufficient to overcome this new terror  and so it was that when tarzan and his warriors returned to the attack the next morning they found the raiders prepared to march out of the village  the manyuema were laden with stolen ivory  as tarzan saw it he grinned for he knew that they would not carry it far  then he saw something which caused him anxietya number of the manyuema were lighting torches in the remnant of the campfire  they were about to fire the village  tarzan was perched in a tall tree some hundred yards from the palisade making a trumpet of his hands he called loudly in the arab tongue do not fire the huts or we shall kill you all  do not fire the huts or we shall kill you all  a dozen times he repeated it  the manyuema hesitated then one of them flung his torch into the campfire  the others were about to do the same when an arab sprung upon them with a stick beating them toward the huts  tarzan could see that he was commanding them to fire the little thatched dwellings  then he stood erect upon the swaying branch a hundred feet above the ground and raising one of the arab guns to his shoulder took careful aim and fired  with the report the arab who was urging on his men to burn the village fell in his tracks and the manyuema threw away their torches and fled from the village  the last tarzan saw of them they were racing toward the jungle while their former masters knelt upon the ground and fired at them  but however angry the arabs might have been at the insubordination of their slaves they were at least convinced that it would be the better part of wisdom to forego the pleasure of firing the village that had given them two such nasty receptions  in their hearts however they swore to return again with such force as would enable them to sweep the entire country for miles around until no vestige of human life remained  they had looked in vain for the owner of the voice which had frightened off the men who had been detailed to put the torch to the huts but not even the keenest eye among them had been able to locate him  they had seen the puff of smoke from the tree following the shot that brought down the arab but though a volley had immediately been loosed into its foliage there had been no indication that it had been effective  tarzan was too intelligent to be caught in any such trap and so the report of his shot had scarcely died away before the apeman was on the ground and racing for another tree a hundred yards away  here he again found a suitable perch from which he could watch the preparations of the raiders  it occurred to him that he might have considerable more fun with them so again he called to them through his improvised trumpet  leave the ivory he cried  leave the ivory  dead men have no use for ivory  some of the manyuema started to lay down their loads but this was altogether too much for the avaricious arabs  with loud shouts and curses they aimed their guns full upon the bearers threatening instant death to any who might lay down his load  they could give up firing the village but the thought of abandoning this enormous fortune in ivory was quite beyond their conceptionbetter death than that  and so they marched out of the village of the waziri and on the shoulders of their slaves was the ivory ransom of a score of kings toward the north they marched back toward their savage settlement in the wild and unknown country which lies back from the kongo in the uttermost depths of the great forest and on either side of them traveled an invisible and relentless foe  under tarzans guidance the black waziri warriors stationed themselves along the trail on either side in the densest underbrush  they stood at far intervals and as the column passed a single arrow or a heavy spear well aimed would pierce a manyuema or an arab  then the waziri would melt into the distance and run ahead to take his stand farther on  they did not strike unless success were sure and the danger of detection almost nothing and so the arrows and the spears were few and far between but so persistent and inevitable that the slowmoving column of heavyladen raiders was in a constant state of panicpanic at the uncertainty of who the next would be to fall and when  it was with the greatest difficulty that the arabs prevented their men a dozen times from throwing away their burdens and fleeing like frightened rabbits up the trail toward the north  and so the day wore ona frightful nightmare of a day for the raidersa day of weary but wellrepaid work for the waziri  at night the arabs constructed a rude boma in a little clearing by a river and went into camp  at intervals during the night a rifle would bark close above their heads and one of the dozen sentries which they now had posted would tumble to the ground  such a condition was insupportable for they saw that by means of these hideous tactics they would be completely wiped out one by one without inflicting a single death upon their enemy but yet with the persistent avariciousness of the white man the arabs clung to their loot and when morning came forced the demoralized manyuema to take up their burdens of death and stagger on into the jungle  for three days the withering column kept up its frightful march  each hour was marked by its deadly arrow or cruel spear  the nights were made hideous by the barking of the invisible gun that made sentry duty equivalent to a death sentence  on the morning of the fourth day the arabs were compelled to shoot two of their blacks before they could compel the balance to take up the hated ivory and as they did so a voice rang out clear and strong from the jungle  today you die oh manyuema unless you lay down the ivory  fall upon your cruel masters and kill them  you have guns why do you not use them  kill the arabs and we will not harm you  we will take you back to our village and feed you and lead you out of our country in safety and in peace  lay down the ivory and fall upon your masterswe will help you  else you die  as the voice died down the raiders stood as though turned to stone the arabs eyed their manyuema slaves the slaves looked first at one of their fellows and then at anotherthey were but waiting for some one to take the initiative  there were some thirty arabs left and about one hundred and fifty blacks  all were armedeven those who were acting as porters had their rifles slung across their backs  the arabs drew together  the sheik ordered the manyuema to take up the march and as he spoke he cocked his rifle and raised it  but at the same instant one of the blacks threw down his load and snatching his rifle from his back fired pointblank at the group of arabs  in an instant the camp was a cursing howling mass of demons fighting with guns and knives and pistols  the arabs stood together and defended their lives valiantly but with the rain of lead that poured upon them from their own slaves and the shower of arrows and spears which now leaped from the surrounding jungle aimed solely at them there was little question from the first what the outcome would be  in ten minutes from the time the first porter had thrown down his load the last of the arabs lay dead  when the firing had ceased tarzan spoke again to the manyuema  take up our ivory and return it to our village from whence you stole it  we shall not harm you  for a moment the manyuema hesitated  they had no stomach to retrace that difficult three days trail  they talked together in low whispers and one turned toward the jungle calling aloud to the voice that had spoken to them from out of the foliage  how do we know that when you have us in your village you will not kill us all he asked  you do not know replied tarzan other than that we have promised not to harm you if you will return our ivory to us  but this you do know that it lies within our power to kill you all if you do not return as we direct and are we not more likely to do so if you anger us than if you do as we bid  who are you that speaks the tongue of our arab masters cried the manyuema spokesman  let us see you and then we shall give you our answer  tarzan stepped out of the jungle a dozen paces from them  look he said  when they saw that he was white they were filled with awe for never had they seen a white savage before and at his great muscles and giant frame they were struck with wonder and admiration  you may trust me said tarzan  so long as you do as i tell you and harm none of my people we shall do you no hurt  will you take up our ivory and return in peace to our village or shall we follow along your trail toward the north as we have followed for the past three days  the recollection of the horrid days that had just passed was the thing that finally decided the manyuema and so after a short conference they took up their burdens and set off to retrace their steps toward the village of the waziri  at the end of the third day they marched into the village gate and were greeted by the survivors of the recent massacre to whom tarzan had sent a messenger in their temporary camp to the south on the day that the raiders had quitted the village telling them that they might return in safety  it took all the mastery and persuasion that tarzan possessed to prevent the waziri falling on the manyuema tooth and nail and tearing them to pieces but when he had explained that he had given his word that they would not be molested if they carried the ivory back to the spot from which they had stolen it and had further impressed upon his people that they owed their entire victory to him they finally acceded to his demands and allowed the cannibals to rest in peace within their palisade  that night the village warriors held a big palaver to celebrate their victories and to choose a new chief  since old waziris death tarzan had been directing the warriors in battle and the temporary command had been tacitly conceded to him  there had been no time to choose a new chief from among their own number and in fact so remarkably successful had they been under the apemans generalship that they had had no wish to delegate the supreme authority to another for fear that what they already had gained might be lost  they had so recently seen the results of running counter to this savage white mans advice in the disastrous charge ordered by waziri in which he himself had died that it had not been difficult for them to accept tarzans authority as final  the principal warriors sat in a circle about a small fire to discuss the relative merits of whomever might be suggested as old waziris successor  it was busuli who spoke first  since waziri is dead leaving no son there is but one among us whom we know from experience is fitted to make us a good king  there is only one who has proved that he can successfully lead us against the guns of the white man and bring us easy victory without the loss of a single life  there is only one and that is the white man who has led us for the past few days and busuli sprang to his feet and with uplifted spear and halfbent crouching body commenced to dance slowly about tarzan chanting in time to his steps waziri king of the waziri waziri killer of arabs waziri king of the waziri  one by one the other warriors signified their acceptance of tarzan as their king by joining in the solemn dance  the women came and squatted about the rim of the circle beating upon tomtoms clapping their hands in time to the steps of the dancers and joining in the chant of the warriors  in the center of the circle sat tarzan of the apeswaziri king of the waziri for like his predecessor he was to take the name of his tribe as his own  faster and faster grew the pace of the dancers louder and louder their wild and savage shouts  the women rose and fell in unison shrieking now at the tops of their voices  the spears were brandishing fiercely and as the dancers stooped down and beat their shields upon the hardtramped earth of the village street the whole sight was as terribly primeval and savage as though it were being staged in the dim dawn of humanity countless ages in the past  as the excitement waxed the apeman sprang to his feet and joined in the wild ceremony  in the center of the circle of glittering black bodies he leaped and roared and shook his heavy spear in the same mad abandon that enthralled his fellow savages  the last remnant of his civilization was forgottenhe was a primitive man to the fullest now reveling in the freedom of the fierce wild life he loved gloating in his kingship among these wild blacks  ah if olga de coude had but seen him thencould she have recognized the welldressed quiet young man whose wellbred face and irreproachable manners had so captivated her but a few short months ago  and jane porter  would she have still loved this savage warrior chieftain dancing naked among his naked savage subjects  and darnot could darnot have believed that this was the same man he had introduced into half a dozen of the most select clubs of paris  what would his fellow peers in the house of lords have said had one pointed to this dancing giant with his barbaric headdress and his metal ornaments and said there my lords is john clayton lord greystoke  and so tarzan of the apes came into a real kingship among menslowly but surely was he following the evolution of his ancestors for had he not started at the very bottom     chapter 18  the lottery of death   jane porter had been the first of those in the lifeboat to awaken the morning after the wreck of the lady alice  the other members of the party were asleep upon the thwarts or huddled in cramped positions in the bottom of the boat  when the girl realized that they had become separated from the other boats she was filled with alarm  the sense of utter loneliness and helplessness which the vast expanse of deserted ocean aroused in her was so depressing that from the first contemplation of the future held not the slightest ray of promise for her  she was confident that they were lostlost beyond possibility of succor  presently clayton awoke  it was several minutes before he could gather his senses sufficiently to realize where he was or recall the disaster of the previous night  finally his bewildered eyes fell upon the girl  jane he cried  thank god that we are together  look said the girl dully indicating the horizon with an apathetic gesture  we are all alone  clayton scanned the water in every direction  where can they be he cried  they cannot have gone down for there has been no sea and they were afloat after the yacht sanki saw them all  he awoke the other members of the party and explained their plight  it is just as well that the boats are scattered sir said one of the sailors  they are all provisioned so that they do not need each other on that score and should a storm blow up they could be of no service to one another even if they were together but scattered about the ocean there is a much better chance that one at least will be picked up and then a search will be at once started for the others were we together there would be but one chance of rescue where now there may be four  they saw the wisdom of his philosophy and were cheered by it but their joy was shortlived for when it was decided that they should row steadily toward the east and the continent it was discovered that the sailors who had been at the only two oars with which the boat had been provided had fallen asleep at their work and allowed both to slip into the sea nor were they in sight anywhere upon the water  during the angry words and recriminations which followed the sailors nearly came to blows but clayton succeeded in quieting them though a moment later monsieur thuran almost precipitated another row by making a nasty remark about the stupidity of all englishmen and especially english sailors  come come mates spoke up one of the men tompkins who had taken no part in the altercation shootin off our bloomin mugs wont get us nothin  as spider ere said afore well all bloody well be picked up anyway sez e so wots the use o squabblin  lets eat sez i  thats not a bad idea said monsieur thuran and then turning to the third sailor wilson he said  pass one of those tins aft my good man  fetch it yerself retorted wilson sullenly  i aint atakin no orders from nofurrineryou aint captain o this ship yet  the result was that clayton himself had to get the tin and then another angry altercation ensued when one of the sailors accused clayton and monsieur thuran of conspiring to control the provisions so that they could have the lions share  some one should take command of this boat spoke up jane porter thoroughly disgusted with the disgraceful wrangling that had marked the very opening of a forced companionship that might last for many days it is terrible enough to be alone in a frail boat on the atlantic without having the added misery and danger of constant bickering and brawling among the members of our party  you men should elect a leader and then abide by his decisions in all matters  there is greater need for strict discipline here than there is upon a wellordered ship  she had hoped before she voiced her sentiments that it would not be necessary for her to enter into the transaction at all for she believed that clayton was amply able to cope with every emergency but she had to admit that so far at least he had shown no greater promise of successfully handling the situation than any of the others though he had at least refrained from adding in any way to the unpleasantness even going so far as to give up the tin to the sailors when they objected to its being opened by him  the girls words temporarily quieted the men and finally it was decided that the two kegs of water and the four tins of food should be divided into two parts onehalf going forward to the three sailors to do with as they saw best and the balance aft to the three passengers  thus was the little company divided into two camps and when the provisions had been apportioned each immediately set to work to open and distribute food and water  the sailors were the first to get one of the tins of food open and their curses of rage and disappointment caused clayton to ask what the trouble might be  trouble shrieked spider  trouble  its worse than troubleits death  thistin is full of coal oil  hastily now clayton and monsieur thuran tore open one of theirs only to learn the hideous truth that it also contained not food but coal oil  one after another the four tins on board were opened  and as the contents of each became known howls of anger announced the grim truththere was not an ounce of food upon the boat  well thank gawd it wasnt the water cried thompkins  its easier to get along without food than it is without water  we can eat our shoes if worse comes to worst but we couldnt drink em  as he spoke wilson had been boring a hole in one of the water kegs and as spider held a tin cup he tilted the keg to pour a draft of the precious fluid  a thin stream of blackish dry particles filtered slowly through the tiny aperture into the bottom of the cup  with a groan wilson dropped the keg and sat staring at the dry stuff in the cup speechless with horror  the kegs are filled with gunpowder said spider in a low tone turning to those aft  and so it proved when the last had been opened  coal oil and gunpowder cried monsieur thuran  sapristi  what a diet for shipwrecked mariners  with the full knowledge that there was neither food nor water on board the pangs of hunger and thirst became immediately aggravated and so on the first day of their tragic adventure real suffering commenced in grim earnest and the full horrors of shipwreck were upon them  as the days passed conditions became horrible  aching eyes scanned the horizon day and night until the weak and weary watchers would sink exhausted to the bottom of the boat and there wrest in dreamdisturbed slumber a moments respite from the horrors of the waking reality  the sailors goaded by the remorseless pangs of hunger had eaten their leather belts their shoes the sweatbands from their caps although both clayton and monsieur thuran had done their best to convince them that these would only add to the suffering they were enduring  weak and hopeless the entire party lay beneath the pitiless tropic sun with parched lips and swollen tongues waiting for the death they were beginning to crave  the intense suffering of the first few days had become deadened for the three passengers who had eaten nothing but the agony of the sailors was pitiful as their weak and impoverished stomachs attempted to cope with the bits of leather with which they had filled them  tompkins was the first to succumb  just a week from the day the lady alice went down the sailor died horribly in frightful convulsions  for hours his contorted and hideous features lay grinning back at those in the stern of the little boat until jane porter could endure the sight no longer  can you not drop his body overboard william she asked  clayton rose and staggered toward the corpse  the two remaining sailors eyed him with a strange baleful light in their sunken orbs futilely the englishman tried to lift the corpse over the side of the boat but his strength was not equal to the task  lend me a hand here please he said to wilson who lay nearest him  wot do you want to throw im over for questioned the sailor in a querulous voice  weve got to before were too weak to do it replied clayton  hed be awful by tomorrow after a day under that broiling sun  better leave well enough alone grumbled wilson  we may need him before tomorrow  slowly the meaning of the mans words percolated into claytons understanding  at last he realized the fellows reason for objecting to the disposal of the dead man  god whispered clayton in a horrified tone  you dont mean  wy not growled wilson  aint we gotta live  hes dead he added jerking his thumb in the direction of the corpse  he wont care  come here thuran said clayton turning toward the russian  well have something worse than death aboard us if we dont get rid of this body before dark  wilson staggered up menacingly to prevent the contemplated act but when his comrade spider took sides with clayton and monsieur thuran he gave up and sat eying the corpse hungrily as the three men by combining their efforts succeeded in rolling it overboard  all the balance of the day wilson sat glaring at clayton in his eyes the gleam of insanity  toward evening as the sun was sinking into the sea he commenced to chuckle and mumble to himself but his eyes never left clayton  after it became quite dark clayton could still feel those terrible eyes upon him  he dared not sleep and yet so exhausted was he that it was a constant fight to retain consciousness  after what seemed an eternity of suffering his head dropped upon a thwart and he slept how long he was unconscious he did not knowhe was awakened by a shuffling noise quite close to him  the moon had risen and as he opened his startled eyes he saw wilson creeping stealthily toward him his mouth open and his swollen tongue hanging out  the slight noise had awakened jane porter at the same time and as she saw the hideous tableau she gave a shrill cry of alarm and at the same instant the sailor lurched forward and fell upon clayton  like a wild beast his teeth sought the throat of his intended prey but clayton weak though he was still found sufficient strength to hold the maniacs mouth from him  at jane porters scream monsieur thuran and spider awoke  on seeing the cause of her alarm both men crawled to claytons rescue and between the three of them were able to subdue wilson and hurl him to the bottom of the boat  for a few minutes he lay there chattering and laughing and then with an awful scream and before any of his companions could prevent he staggered to his feet and leaped overboard  the reaction from the terrific strain of excitement left the weak survivors trembling and prostrated  spider broke down and wept jane porter prayed clayton swore softly to himself monsieur thuran sat with his head in his hands thinking  the result of his cogitation developed the following morning in a proposition he made to spider and clayton  gentlemen said monsieur thuran you see the fate that awaits us all unless we are picked up within a day or two  that there is little hope of that is evidenced by the fact that during all the days we have drifted we have seen no sail nor the faintest smudge of smoke upon the horizon  there might be a chance if we had food but without food there is none  there remains for us then but one of two alternatives and we must choose at once  either we must all die together within a few days or one must be sacrificed that the others may live  do you quite clearly grasp my meaning  jane porter who had overheard was horrified  if the proposition had come from the poor ignorant sailor she might possibly have not been so surprised but that it should come from one who posed as a man of culture and refinement from a gentleman she could scarcely credit  it is better that we die together then said clayton  that is for the majority to decide replied monsieur thuran  as only one of us three will be the object of sacrifice we shall decide miss porter is not interested since she will be in no danger  how shall we know who is to be first asked spider  it may be fairly fixed by lot replied monsieur thuran  i have a number of franc pieces in my pocket  we can choose a certain date from among themthe one to draw this date first from beneath a piece of cloth will be the first  i shall have nothing to do with any such diabolical plan muttered clayton even yet land may be sighted or a ship appearin time  you will do as the majority decide or you will be the first without the formality of drawing lots said monsieur thuran threateningly come let us vote on the plan i for one am in favor of it  how about you spider and i replied the sailor  it is the will of the majority announced monsieur thuran and now let us lose no time in drawing lots  it is as fair for one as for another  that three may live one of us must die perhaps a few hours sooner than otherwise  then he began his preparation for the lottery of death while jane porter sat wideeyed and horrified at thought of the thing that she was about to witness  monsieur thuran spread his coat upon the bottom of the boat and then from a handful of money he selected six franc pieces  the other two men bent close above him as he inspected them finally he handed them all to clayton  look at them carefully he said  the oldest date is eighteenseventyfive and there is only one of that year  clayton and the sailor inspected each coin  to them there seemed not the slightest difference that could be detected other than the dates they were quite satisfied  had they known that monsieur thurans past experience as a card sharp had trained his sense of touch to so fine a point that he could almost differentiate between cards by the mere feel of them they would scarcely have felt that the plan was so entirely fair  the 1875 piece was a hair thinner than the other coins but neither clayton nor spider could have detected it without the aid of a micrometer  in what order shall we draw asked monsieur thuran knowing from past experience that the majority of men always prefer last chance in a lottery where the single prize is some distasteful thingthere is always the chance and the hope that another will draw it first monsieur thuran for reasons of his own preferred to draw first if the drawing should happen to require a second adventure beneath the coat  and so when spider elected to draw last he graciously offered to take the first chance himself  his hand was under the coat for but a moment yet those quick deft fingers had felt of each coin and found and discarded the fatal piece  when he brought forth his hand it contained an 1888 franc piece  then clayton drew  jane porter leaned forward with a tense and horrified expression on her face as the hand of the man she was to marry groped about beneath the coat presently he withdrew it a franc piece lying in the palm for an instant he dared not look but monsieur thuran who had leaned nearer to see the date exclaimed that he was safe  jane porter sank weak and trembling against the side of the boat  she felt sick and dizzy  and now if spider should not draw the 1875 piece she must endure the whole horrid thing again  the sailor already had his hand beneath the coat  great beads of sweat were standing upon his brow  he trembled as though with a fit of ague aloud he cursed himself for having taken the last draw for now his chances for escape were but three to one whereas monsieur thurans had been five to one and claytons four to one  the russian was very patient and did not hurry the man for he knew that he himself was quite safe whether the 1875 piece came out this time or not  when the sailor withdrew his hand and looked at the piece of money within he dropped fainting to the bottom of the boat  both clayton and monsieur thuran hastened weakly to examine the coin which had rolled from the mans hand and lay beside him  it was not dated 1875  the reaction from the state of fear he had been in had overcome spider quite as effectually as though he had drawn the fated piece  but now the whole proceeding must be gone through again  once more the russian drew forth a harmless coin  jane porter closed her eyes as clayton reached beneath the coat  spider bent wideeyed toward the hand that was to decide his fate for whatever luck was claytons on this last draw the opposite would be spiders  then william cecil clayton lord greystoke removed his hand from beneath the coat and with a coin tight pressed within his palm where none might see it he looked at jane porter  he did not dare open his hand  quick hissed spider  my gawd lets see it  clayton opened his fingers  spider was the first to see the date and ere any knew what his intention was he raised himself to his feet and lunged over the side of the boat to disappear forever into the green depths beneaththe coin had not been the 1875 piece  the strain had exhausted those who remained to such an extent that they lay half unconscious for the balance of the day nor was the subject referred to again for several days  horrible days of increasing weakness and hopelessness  at length monsieur thuran crawled to where clayton lay  we must draw once more before we are too weak even to eat he whispered  clayton was in such a state that he was scarcely master of his own will  jane porter had not spoken for three days  he knew that she was dying  horrible as the thought was he hoped that the sacrifice of either thuran or himself might be the means of giving her renewed strength and so he immediately agreed to the russians proposal  they drew under the same plan as before but there could be but one resultclayton drew the 1875 piece  when shall it be he asked thuran  the russian had already drawn a pocketknife from his trousers and was weakly attempting to open it  now he muttered and his greedy eyes gloated upon the englishman  cant you wait until dark asked clayton  miss porter must not see this thing done  we were to have been married you know  a look of disappointment came over monsieur thurans face  very well he replied hesitatingly  it will not be long until night  i have waited for many daysi can wait a few hours longer  thank you my friend murmured clayton  now i shall go to her side and remain with her until it is time  i would like to have an hour or two with her before i die  when clayton reached the girls side she was unconscioushe knew that she was dying and he was glad that she should not have to see or know the awful tragedy that was shortly to be enacted  he took her hand and raised it to his cracked and swollen lips  for a long time he lay caressing the emaciated clawlike thing that had once been the beautiful shapely white hand of the young baltimore belle  it was quite dark before he knew it but he was recalled to himself by a voice out of the night  it was the russian calling him to his doom  i am coming monsieur thuran he hastened to reply  thrice he attempted to turn himself upon his hands and knees that he might crawl back to his death but in the few hours that he had lain there he had become too weak to return to thurans side  you will have to come to me monsieur he called weakly  i have not sufficient strength to gain my hands and knees  sapristi muttered monsieur thuran  you are attempting to cheat me out of my winnings  clayton heard the man shuffling about in the bottom of the boat finally there was a despairing groan  i cannot crawl he heard the russian wail  it is too late  you have tricked me you dirty english dog  i have not tricked you monsieur replied clayton  i have done my best to rise but i shall try again and if you will try possibly each of us can crawl halfway and then you shall have your winnings  again clayton exerted his remaining strength to the utmost and he heard thuran apparently doing the same  nearly an hour later the englishman succeeded in raising himself to his hands and knees but at the first forward movement he pitched upon his face  a moment later he heard an exclamation of relief from monsieur thuran  i am coming whispered the russian  again clayton essayed to stagger on to meet his fate but once more he pitched headlong to the boats bottom nor try as he would could he again rise  his last effort caused him to roll over on his back and there he lay looking up at the stars while behind him coming ever nearer and nearer he could hear the laborious shuffling and the stertorous breathing of the russian  it seemed that he must have lain thus an hour waiting for the thing to crawl out of the dark and end his misery  it was quite close now but there were longer and longer pauses between its efforts to advance and each forward movement seemed to the waiting englishman to be almost imperceptible  finally he knew that thuran was quite close beside him  he heard a cackling laugh something touched his face and he lost consciousness     chapter 19  the city of gold   the very night that tarzan of the apes became chief of the waziri the woman he loved lay dying in a tiny boat two hundred miles west of him upon the atlantic  as he danced among his naked fellow savages the firelight gleaming against his great rolling muscles the personification of physical perfection and strength the woman who loved him lay thin and emaciated in the last coma that precedes death by thirst and starvation  the week following the induction of tarzan into the kingship of the waziri was occupied in escorting the manyuema of the arab raiders to the northern boundary of waziri in accordance with the promise which tarzan had made them  before he left them he exacted a pledge from them that they would not lead any expeditions against the waziri in the future nor was it a difficult promise to obtain  they had had sufficient experience with the fighting tactics of the new waziri chief not to have the slightest desire to accompany another predatory force within the boundaries of his domain  almost immediately upon his return to the village tarzan commenced making preparations for leading an expedition in search of the ruined city of gold which old waziri had described to him  he selected fifty of the sturdiest warriors of his tribe choosing only men who seemed anxious to accompany him on the arduous march and share the dangers of a new and hostile country  the fabulous wealth of the fabled city had been almost constantly in his mind since waziri had recounted the strange adventures of the former expedition which had stumbled upon the vast ruins by chance the lure of adventure may have been quite as powerful a factor in urging tarzan of the apes to undertake the journey as the lure of gold but the lure of gold was there too for he had learned among civilized men something of the miracles that may be wrought by the possessor of the magic yellow metal  what he would do with a golden fortune in the heart of savage africa it had not occurred to him to considerit would be enough to possess the power to work wonders even though he never had an opportunity to employ it  so one glorious tropical morning waziri chief of the waziri set out at the head of fifty cleanlimbed ebon warriors in quest of adventure and of riches  they followed the course which old waziri had described to tarzan  for days they marchedup one river across a low divide down another river up a third until at the end of the twentyfifth day they camped upon a mountainside from the summit of which they hoped to catch their first view of the marvelous city of treasure  early the next morning they were climbing the almost perpendicular crags which formed the last but greatest natural barrier between them and their destination  it was nearly noon before tarzan who headed the thin line of climbing warriors scrambled over the top of the last cliff and stood upon the little flat tableland of the mountaintop  on either hand towered mighty peaks thousands of feet higher than the pass through which they were entering the forbidden valley  behind him stretched the wooded valley across which they had marched for many days and at the opposite side the low range which marked the boundary of their own country  but before him was the view that centered his attention  here lay a desolate valleya shallow narrow valley dotted with stunted trees and covered with many great bowlders  and on the far side of the valley lay what appeared to be a mighty city its great walls its lofty spires its turrets minarets and domes showing red and yellow in the sunlight  tarzan was yet too far away to note the marks of ruinto him it appeared a wonderful city of magnificent beauty and in imagination he peopled its broad avenues and its huge temples with a throng of happy active people  for an hour the little expedition rested upon the mountaintop and then tarzan led them down into the valley below  there was no trail but the way was less arduous than the ascent of the opposite face of the mountain had been  once in the valley their progress was rapid so that it was still light when they halted before the towering walls of the ancient city  the outer wall was fifty feet in height where it had not fallen into ruin but nowhere as far as they could see had more than ten or twenty feet of the upper courses fallen away  it was still a formidable defense  on several occasions tarzan had thought that he discerned things moving behind the ruined portions of the wall near to them as though creatures were watching them from behind the bulwarks of the ancient pile  and often he felt the sensation of unseen eyes upon him but not once could he be sure that it was more than imagination  that night they camped outside the city  once at midnight they were awakened by a shrill scream from beyond the great wall  it was very high at first descending gradually until it ended in a series of dismal moans  it had a strange effect upon the blacks almost paralyzing them with terror while it lasted and it was an hour before the camp settled down to sleep once more  in the morning the effects of it were still visible in the fearful sidelong glances that the waziri continually cast at the massive and forbidding structure which loomed above them  it required considerable encouragement and urging on tarzans part to prevent the blacks from abandoning the venture on the spot and hastening back across the valley toward the cliffs they had scaled the day before  but at length by dint of commands and threats that he would enter the city alone they agreed to accompany him  for fifteen minutes they marched along the face of the wall before they discovered a means of ingress  then they came to a narrow cleft about twenty inches wide  within a flight of concrete steps worn hollow by centuries of use rose before them to disappear at a sharp turning of the passage a few yards ahead  into this narrow alley tarzan made his way turning his giant shoulders sideways that they might enter at all  behind him trailed his black warriors  at the turn in the cleft the stairs ended and the path was level but it wound and twisted in a serpentine fashion until suddenly at a sharp angle it debouched upon a narrow court across which loomed an inner wall equally as high as the outer  this inner wall was set with little round towers alternating along its entire summit with pointed monoliths  in places these had fallen and the wall was ruined but it was in a much better state of preservation than the outer wall  another narrow passage led through this wall and at its end tarzan and his warriors found themselves in a broad avenue on the opposite side of which crumbling edifices of hewn granite loomed dark and forbidding upon the crumbling debris along the face of the buildings trees had grown and vines wound in and out of the hollow staring windows but the building directly opposite them seemed less overgrown than the others and in a much better state of preservation  it was a massive pile surmounted by an enormous dome  at either side of its great entrance stood rows of tall pillars each capped by a huge grotesque bird carved from the solid rock of the monoliths  as the apeman and his companions stood gazing in varying degrees of wonderment at this ancient city in the midst of savage africa several of them became aware of movement within the structure at which they were looking  dim shadowy shapes appeared to be moving about in the semidarkness of the interior  there was nothing tangible that the eye could grasponly an uncanny suggestion of life where it seemed that there should be no life for living things seemed out of place in this weird dead city of the longdead past  tarzan recalled something that he had read in the library at paris of a lost race of white men that native legend described as living in the heart of africa  he wondered if he were not looking upon the ruins of the civilization that this strange people had wrought amid the savage surroundings of their strange and savage home  could it be possible that even now a remnant of that lost race inhabited the ruined grandeur that had once been their progenitor  again he became conscious of a stealthy movement within the great temple before him  come he said to his waziri  let us have a look at what lies behind those ruined walls  his men were loath to follow him but when they saw that he was bravely entering the frowning portal they trailed a few paces behind in a huddled group that seemed the personification of nervous terror  a single shriek such as they had heard the night before would have been sufficient to have sent them all racing madly for the narrow cleft that led through the great walls to the outer world  as tarzan entered the building he was distinctly aware of many eyes upon him  there was a rustling in the shadows of a nearby corridor and he could have sworn that he saw a human hand withdrawn from an embrasure that opened above him into the domelike rotunda in which he found himself  the floor of the chamber was of concrete the walls of smooth granite upon which strange figures of men and beasts were carved  in places tablets of yellow metal had been set in the solid masonry of the walls  when he approached closer to one of these tablets he saw that it was of gold and bore many hieroglyphics  beyond this first chamber there were others and back of them the building branched out into enormous wings  tarzan passed through several of these chambers finding many evidences of the fabulous wealth of the original builders  in one room were seven pillars of solid gold and in another the floor itself was of the precious metal  and all the while that he explored his blacks huddled close together at his back and strange shapes hovered upon either hand and before them and behind yet never close enough that any might say that they were not alone  the strain however was telling upon the nerves of the waziri  they begged tarzan to return to the sunlight  they said that no good could come of such an expedition for the ruins were haunted by the spirits of the dead who had once inhabited them  they are watching us o king whispered busuli  they are waiting until they have led us into the innermost recesses of their stronghold and then they will fall upon us and tear us to pieces with their teeth that is the way with spirits  my mothers uncle who is a great witch doctor has told me all about it many times  tarzan laughed  run back into the sunlight my children he said i will join you when i have searched this old ruin from top to bottom and found the gold or found that there is none  at least we may take the tablets from the walls though the pillars are too heavy for us to handle but there should be great storerooms filled with goldgold that we can carry away upon our backs with ease  run on now out into the fresh air where you may breathe easier  some of the warriors started to obey their chief with alacrity but busuli and several others hesitated to leave himhesitated between love and loyalty for their king and superstitious fear of the unknown and then quite unexpectedly that occurred which decided the question without the necessity for further discussion  out of the silence of the ruined temple there rang close to their ears the same hideous shriek they had heard the previous night and with horrified cries the black warriors turned and fled through the empty halls of the ageold edifice  behind them stood tarzan of the apes where they had left him a grim smile upon his lipswaiting for the enemy he fully expected was about to pounce upon him  but again silence reigned except for the faint suggestion of the sound of naked feet moving stealthily in nearby places  then tarzan wheeled and passed on into the depths of the temple  from room to room he went until he came to one at which a rude barred door still stood and as he put his shoulder against it to push it in again the shriek of warning rang out almost beside him  it was evident that he was being warned to refrain from desecrating this particular room or could it be that within lay the secret to the treasure stores  at any rate the very fact that the strange invisible guardians of this weird place had some reason for wishing him not to enter this particular chamber was sufficient to treble tarzans desire to do so and though the shrieking was repeated continuously he kept his shoulder to the door until it gave before his giant strength to swing open upon creaking wooden hinges  within all was black as the tomb  there was no window to let in the faintest ray of light and as the corridor upon which it opened was itself in semidarkness even the open door shed no relieving rays within  feeling before him upon the floor with the butt of his spear tarzan entered the stygian gloom  suddenly the door behind him closed and at the same time hands clutched him from every direction out of the darkness  the apeman fought with all the savage fury of selfpreservation backed by the herculean strength that was his  but though he felt his blows land and his teeth sink into soft flesh there seemed always two new hands to take the place of those that he fought off  at last they dragged him down and slowly very slowly they overcame him by the mere weight of their numbers  and then they bound himhis hands behind his back and his feet trussed up to meet them  he had heard no sound except the heavy breathing of his antagonists and the noise of the battle  he knew not what manner of creatures had captured him but that they were human seemed evident from the fact that they had bound him  presently they lifted him from the floor and half dragging half pushing him they brought him out of the black chamber through another doorway into an inner courtyard of the temple  here he saw his captors  there must have been a hundred of themshort stocky men with great beards that covered their faces and fell upon their hairy breasts  the thick matted hair upon their heads grew low over their receding brows and hung about their shoulders and their backs  their crooked legs were short and heavy their arms long and muscular  about their loins they wore the skins of leopards and lions and great necklaces of the claws of these same animals depended upon their breasts  massive circlets of virgin gold adorned their arms and legs  for weapons they carried heavy knotted bludgeons and in the belts that confined their single garments each had a long wickedlooking knife  but the feature of them that made the most startling impression upon their prisoner was their white skinsneither in color nor feature was there a trace of the negroid about them  yet with their receding foreheads wicked little closeset eyes and yellow fangs they were far from prepossessing in appearance  during the fight within the dark chamber and while they had been dragging tarzan to the inner court no word had been spoken but now several of them exchanged grunting monosyllabic conversation in a language unfamiliar to the apeman and presently they left him lying upon the concrete floor while they trooped off on their short legs into another part of the temple beyond the court  as tarzan lay there upon his back he saw that the temple entirely surrounded the little inclosure and that on all sides its lofty walls rose high above him  at the top a little patch of blue sky was visible and in one direction through an embrasure he could see foliage but whether it was beyond or within the temple he did not know  about the court from the ground to the top of the temple were series of open galleries and now and then the captive caught glimpses of bright eyes gleaming from beneath masses of tumbling hair peering down upon him from above  the apeman gently tested the strength of the bonds that held him and while he could not be sure it seemed that they were of insufficient strength to withstand the strain of his mighty muscles when the time came to make a break for freedom but he did not dare to put them to the crucial test until darkness had fallen or he felt that no spying eyes were upon him  he had lain within the court for several hours before the first rays of sunlight penetrated the vertical shaft almost simultaneously he heard the pattering of bare feet in the corridors about him and a moment later saw the galleries above fill with crafty faces as a score or more entered the courtyard  for a moment every eye was bent upon the noonday sun and then in unison the people in the galleries and those in the court below took up the refrain of a low weird chant  presently those about tarzan began to dance to the cadence of their solemn song  they circled him slowly resembling in their manner of dancing a number of clumsy shuffling bears but as yet they did not look at him keeping their little eyes fixed upon the sun  for ten minutes or more they kept up their monotonous chant and steps and then suddenly and in perfect unison they turned toward their victim with upraised bludgeons and emitting fearful howls the while they contorted their features into the most diabolical expressions they rushed upon him  at the same instant a female figure dashed into the midst of the bloodthirsty horde and with a bludgeon similar to their own except that it was wrought from gold beat back the advancing men     chapter 20  la   for a moment tarzan thought that by some strange freak of fate a miracle had saved him but when he realized the ease with which the girl had singlehanded beaten off twenty gorillalike males and an instant later as he saw them again take up their dance about him while she addressed them in a singsong monotone which bore every evidence of rote he came to the conclusion that it was all but a part of the ceremony of which he was the central figure  after a moment or two the girl drew a knife from her girdle and leaning over tarzan cut the bonds from his legs  then as the men stopped their dance and approached she motioned to him to rise placing the rope that had been about his legs around his neck she led him across the courtyard the men following in twos  through winding corridors she led farther and farther into the remoter precincts of the temple until they came to a great chamber in the center of which stood an altar  then it was that tarzan translated the strange ceremony that had preceded his introduction into this holy of holies  he had fallen into the hands of descendants of the ancient sun worshippers  his seeming rescue by a votaress of the high priestess of the sun had been but a part of the mimicry of their heathen ceremonythe sun looking down upon him through the opening at the top of the court had claimed him as his own and the priestess had come from the inner temple to save him from the polluting hands of worldlingsto save him as a human offering to their flaming deity  and had he needed further assurance as to the correctness of his theory he had only to cast his eyes upon the brownishred stains that caked the stone altar and covered the floor in its immediate vicinity or to the human skulls which grinned from countless niches in the towering walls  the priestess led the victim to the altar steps  again the galleries above filled with watchers while from an arched doorway at the east end of the chamber a procession of females filed slowly into the room they wore like the men only skins of wild animals caught about their waists with rawhide belts or chains of gold but the black masses of their hair were incrusted with golden headgear composed of many circular and oval pieces of gold ingeniously held together to form a metal cap from which depended at each side of the head long strings of oval pieces falling to the waist  the females were more symmetrically proportioned than the males their features were much more perfect the shapes of their heads and their large soft black eyes denoting far greater intelligence and humanity than was possessed by their lords and masters  each priestess bore two golden cups and as they formed in line along one side of the altar the men formed opposite them advancing and taking each a cup from the female opposite  then the chant began once more and presently from a dark passageway beyond the altar another female emerged from the cavernous depths beneath the chamber  the high priestess thought tarzan  she was a young woman with a rather intelligent and shapely face  her ornaments were similar to those worn by her votaries but much more elaborate many being set with diamonds  her bare arms and legs were almost concealed by the massive bejeweled ornaments which covered them while her single leopard skin was supported by a closefitting girdle of golden rings set in strange designs with innumerable small diamonds  in the girdle she carried a long jeweled knife and in her hand a slender wand in lieu of a bludgeon  as she advanced to the opposite side of the altar she halted and the chanting ceased  the priests and priestesses knelt before her while with wand extended above them she recited a long and tiresome prayer her voice was soft and musicaltarzan could scarce realize that its possessor in a moment more would be transformed by the fanatical ecstasy of religious zeal into a wildeyed and bloodthirsty executioner who with dripping knife would be the first to drink her victims red warm blood from the little golden cup that stood upon the altar  as she finished her prayer she let her eyes rest for the first time upon tarzan  with every indication of considerable curiosity she examined him from head to foot  then she addressed him and when she had finished stood waiting as though she expected a reply  i do not understand your language said tarzan  possibly we may speak together in another tongue but she could not understand him though he tried french english arab waziri and as a last resort the mongrel tongue of the west coast  she shook her head and it seemed that there was a note of weariness in her voice as she motioned to the priests to continue with the rites these now circled in a repetition of their idiotic dance which was terminated finally at a command from the priestess who had stood throughout still looking intently upon tarzan  at her signal the priests rushed upon the apeman and lifting him bodily laid him upon his back across the altar his head hanging over one edge his legs over the opposite  then they and the priestesses formed in two lines with their little golden cups in readiness to capture a share of the victims lifeblood after the sacrificial knife had accomplished its work  in the line of priests an altercation arose as to who should have first place  a burly brute with all the refined intelligence of a gorilla stamped upon his bestial face was attempting to push a smaller man to second place but the smaller one appealed to the high priestess who in a cold peremptory voice sent the larger to the extreme end of the line  tarzan could hear him growling and rumbling as he went slowly to the inferior station  then the priestess standing above him began reciting what tarzan took to be an invocation the while she slowly raised her thin sharp knife aloft  it seemed ages to the apeman before her arm ceased its upward progress and the knife halted high above his unprotected breast  then it started downward slowly at first but as the incantation increased in rapidity with greater speed  at the end of the line tarzan could still hear the grumbling of the disgruntled priest  the mans voice rose louder and louder  a priestess near him spoke in sharp tones of rebuke  the knife was quite near to tarzans breast now but it halted for an instant as the high priestess raised her eyes to shoot her swift displeasure at the instigator of this sacrilegious interruption  there was a sudden commotion in the direction of the disputants and tarzan rolled his head in their direction in time to see the burly brute of a priest leap upon the woman opposite him dashing out her brains with a single blow of his heavy cudgel  then that happened which tarzan had witnessed a hundred times before among the wild denizens of his own savage jungle  he had seen the thing fall upon kerchak and tublat and terkoz upon a dozen of the other mighty bull apes of his tribe and upon tantor the elephant there was scarce any of the males of the forest that did not at times fall prey to it  the priest went mad and with his heavy bludgeon ran amuck among his fellows  his screams of rage were frightful as he dashed hither and thither dealing terrific blows with his giant weapon or sinking his yellow fangs into the flesh of some luckless victim  and during it the priestess stood with poised knife above tarzan her eyes fixed in horror upon the maniacal thing that was dealing out death and destruction to her votaries  presently the room was emptied except for the dead and dying on the floor the victim upon the altar the high priestess and the madman as the cunning eyes of the latter fell upon the woman they lighted with a new and sudden lust  slowly he crept toward her and now he spoke but this time there fell upon tarzans surprised ears a language he could understand the last one that he would ever have thought of employing in attempting to converse with human beingsthe low guttural barking of the tribe of great anthropoidshis own mother tongue  and the woman answered the man in the same language  he was threateningshe attempting to reason with him for it was quite evident that she saw that he was past her authority  the brute was quite close nowcreeping with clawlike hands extended toward her around the end of the altar  tarzan strained at the bonds which held his arms pinioned behind him  the woman did not seeshe had forgotten her prey in the horror of the danger that threatened herself  as the brute leaped past tarzan to clutch his victim the apeman gave one superhuman wrench at the thongs that held him  the effort sent him rolling from the altar to the stone floor on the opposite side from that on which the priestess stood but as he sprang to his feet the thongs dropped from his freed arms and at the same time he realized that he was alone in the inner templethe high priestess and the mad priest had disappeared  and then a muffled scream came from the cavernous mouth of the dark hole beyond the sacrificial altar through which the priestess had entered the temple  without even a thought for his own safety or the possibility for escape which this rapid series of fortuitous circumstances had thrust upon him tarzan of the apes answered the call of the woman in danger  with a little bound he was at the gaping entrance to the subterranean chamber and a moment later was running down a flight of ageold concrete steps that led he knew not where  the faint light that filtered in from above showed him a large lowceiled vault from which several doorways led off into inky darkness but there was no need to thread an unknown way for there before him lay the objects of his searchthe mad brute had the girl upon the floor and gorillalike fingers were clutching frantically at her throat as she struggled to escape the fury of the awful thing upon her  as tarzans heavy hand fell upon his shoulder the priest dropped his victim and turned upon her wouldbe rescuer  with foamflecked lips and bared fangs the mad sunworshiper battled with the tenfold power of the maniac  in the blood lust of his fury the creature had undergone a sudden reversion to type which left him a wild beast forgetful of the dagger that projected from his beltthinking only of natures weapons with which his brute prototype had battled  but if he could use his teeth and hands to advantage he found one even better versed in the school of savage warfare to which he had reverted for tarzan of the apes closed with him and they fell to the floor tearing and rending at one another like two bull apes while the primitive priestess stood flattened against the wall watching with wide fearfascinated eyes the growling snapping beasts at her feet  at last she saw the stranger close one mighty hand upon the throat of his antagonist and as he forced the brutemans head far back rain blow after blow upon the upturned face  a moment later he threw the still thing from him and arising shook himself like a lion  he placed a foot upon the carcass before him and raised his head to give the victory cry of his kind but as his eyes fell upon the opening above him leading into the temple of human sacrifice he thought better of his intended act  the girl who had been half paralyzed by fear as the two men fought had just commenced to give thought to her probable fate now that though released from the clutches of a madman she had fallen into the hands of one whom but a moment before she had been upon the point of killing  she looked about for some means of escape  the black mouth of a diverging corridor was near at hand but as she turned to dart into it the apemans eyes fell upon her and with a quick leap he was at her side and a restraining hand was laid upon her arm  wait said tarzan of the apes in the language of the tribe of kerchak  the girl looked at him in astonishment  who are you she whispered who speaks the language of the first man  i am tarzan of the apes he answered in the vernacular of the anthropoids  what do you want of me she continued  for what purpose did you save me from tha  i could not see a woman murdered  it was a half question that answered her  but what do you intend to do with me now she continued  nothing he replied but you can do something for meyou can lead me out of this place to freedom  he made the suggestion without the slightest thought that she would accede  he felt quite sure that the sacrifice would go on from the point where it had been interrupted if the high priestess had her way though he was equally positive that they would find tarzan of the apes unbound and with a long dagger in his hand a much less tractable victim than tarzan disarmed and bound  the girl stood looking at him for a long moment before she spoke  you are a very wonderful man she said  you are such a man as i have seen in my daydreams ever since i was a little girl  you are such a man as i imagine the forbears of my people must have beenthe great race of people who built this mighty city in the heart of a savage world that they might wrest from the bowels of the earth the fabulous wealth for which they had sacrificed their fardistant civilization  i cannot understand why you came to my rescue in the first place and now i cannot understand why having me within your power you do not wish to be revenged upon me for having sentenced you to deathfor having almost put you to death with my own hand  i presume replied the apeman that you but followed the teachings of your religion  i cannot blame you for that no matter what i may think of your creed  but who are youwhat people have i fallen among  i am la high priestess of the temple of the sun in the city of opar we are descendants of a people who came to this savage world more than ten thousand years ago in search of gold  their cities stretched from a great sea under the rising sun to a great sea into which the sun descends at night to cool his flaming brow  they were very rich and very powerful but they lived only a few months of the year in their magnificent palaces here the rest of the time they spent in their native land far far to the north  many ships went back and forth between this new world and the old during the rainy season there were but few of the inhabitants remained here only those who superintended the working of the mines by the black slaves and the merchants who had to stay to supply their wants and the soldiers who guarded the cities and the mines  it was at one of these times that the great calamity occurred  when the time came for the teeming thousands to return none came  for weeks the people waited  then they sent out a great galley to learn why no one came from the mother country but though they sailed about for many months they were unable to find any trace of the mighty land that had for countless ages borne their ancient civilizationit had sunk into the sea  from that day dated the downfall of my people  disheartened and unhappy they soon became a prey to the black hordes of the north and the black hordes of the south  one by one the cities were deserted or overcome  the last remnant was finally forced to take shelter within this mighty mountain fortress  slowly we have dwindled in power in civilization in intellect in numbers until now we are no more than a small tribe of savage apes  in fact the apes live with us and have for many ages  we call them the first menwe speak their language quite as much as we do our own only in the rituals of the temple do we make any attempt to retain our mother tongue  in time it will be forgotten and we will speak only the language of the apes in time we will no longer banish those of our people who mate with apes and so in time we shall descend to the very beasts from which ages ago our progenitors may have sprung  but why are you more human than the others asked the man  for some reason the women have not reverted to savagery so rapidly as the men  it may be because only the lower types of men remained here at the time of the great catastrophe while the temples were filled with the noblest daughters of the race  my strain has remained clearer than the rest because for countless ages my foremothers were high priestessesthe sacred office descends from mother to daughter  our husbands are chosen for us from the noblest in the land  the most perfect man mentally and physically is selected to be the husband of the high priestess  from what i saw of the gentlemen above said tarzan with a grin there should be little trouble in choosing from among them  the girl looked at him quizzically for a moment  do not be sacrilegious she said  they are very holy menthey are priests  then there are others who are better to look upon he asked  the others are all more ugly than the priests she replied  tarzan shuddered at her fate for even in the dim light of the vault he was impressed by her beauty  but how about myself he asked suddenly  are you going to lead me to liberty  you have been chosen by the flaming god as his own she answered solemnly  not even i have the power to save youshould they find you again  but i do not intend that they shall find you  you risked your life to save mine  i may do no less for you  it will be no easy matterit may require days but in the end i think that i can lead you beyond the walls  come they will look here for me presently and if they find us together we shall both be lostthey would kill me did they think that i had proved false to my god  you must not take the risk then he said quickly  i will return to the temple and if i can fight my way to freedom there will be no suspicion thrown upon you  but she would not have it so and finally persuaded him to follow her saying that they had already remained in the vault too long to prevent suspicion from falling upon her even if they returned to the temple  i will hide you and then return alone she said telling them that i was long unconscious after you killed tha and that i do not know whither you escaped  and so she led him through winding corridors of gloom until finally they came to a small chamber into which a little light filtered through a stone grating in the ceiling  this is the chamber of the dead she said  none will think of searching here for youthey would not dare  i will return after it is dark  by that time i may have found a plan to effect your escape  she was gone and tarzan of the apes was left alone in the chamber of the dead beneath the longdead city of opar     chapter 21  the castaways   clayton dreamed that he was drinking his fill of water pure delightful drafts of fresh water  with a start he gained consciousness to find himself wet through by torrents of rain that were falling upon his body and his upturned face  a heavy tropical shower was beating down upon them  he opened his mouth and drank  presently he was so revived and strengthened that he was enabled to raise himself upon his hands  across his legs lay monsieur thuran  a few feet aft jane porter was huddled in a pitiful little heap in the bottom of the boatshe was quite still  clayton knew that she was dead  after infinite labor he released himself from thurans pinioning body and with renewed strength crawled toward the girl  he raised her head from the rough boards of the boats bottom  there might be life in that poor starved frame even yet  he could not quite abandon all hope and so he seized a watersoaked rag and squeezed the precious drops between the swollen lips of the hideous thing that had but a few short days before glowed with the resplendent life of happy youth and glorious beauty  for some time there was no sign of returning animation but at last his efforts were rewarded by a slight tremor of the halfclosed lids  he chafed the thin hands and forced a few more drops of water into the parched throat  the girl opened her eyes looking up at him for a long time before she could recall her surroundings  water she whispered  are we saved  it is raining he explained  we may at least drink  already it has revived us both  monsieur thuran she asked  he did not kill you  is he dead  i do not know replied clayton  if he lives and this rain revives him  but he stopped there remembering too late that he must not add further to the horrors which the girl already had endured  but she guessed what he would have said  where is he she asked  clayton nodded his head toward the prostrate form of the russian  for a time neither spoke  i will see if i can revive him said clayton at length  no she whispered extending a detaining hand toward him  do not do thathe will kill you when the water has given him strength  if he is dying let him die  do not leave me alone in this boat with that beast  clayton hesitated  his honor demanded that he attempt to revive thuran and there was the possibility too that the russian was beyond human aid  it was not dishonorable to hope so  as he sat fighting out his battle he presently raised his eyes from the body of the man and as they passed above the gunwale of the boat he staggered weakly to his feet with a little cry of joy  land jane he almost shouted through his cracked lips  thank god land  the girl looked too and there not a hundred yards away she saw a yellow beach and beyond the luxurious foliage of a tropical jungle  now you may revive him said jane porter for she too had been haunted with the pangs of conscience which had resulted from her decision to prevent clayton from offering succor to their companion  it required the better part of half an hour before the russian evinced sufficient symptoms of returning consciousness to open his eyes and it was some time later before they could bring him to a realization of their good fortune  by this time the boat was scraping gently upon the sandy bottom  between the refreshing water that he had drunk and the stimulus of renewed hope clayton found strength to stagger through the shallow water to the shore with a line made fast to the boats bow  this he fastened to a small tree which grew at the top of a low bank for the tide was at flood and he feared that the boat might carry them all out to sea again with the ebb since it was quite likely that it would be beyond his strength to get jane porter to the shore for several hours next he managed to stagger and crawl toward the nearby jungle where he had seen evidences of profusion of tropical fruit  his former experience in the jungle of tarzan of the apes had taught him which of the many growing things were edible and after nearly an hour of absence he returned to the beach with a little armful of food  the rain had ceased and the hot sun was beating down so mercilessly upon her that jane porter insisted on making an immediate attempt to gain the land  still further invigorated by the food clayton had brought the three were able to reach the half shade of the small tree to which their boat was moored  here thoroughly exhausted they threw themselves down to rest sleeping until dark  for a month they lived upon the beach in comparative safety  as their strength returned the two men constructed a rude shelter in the branches of a tree high enough from the ground to insure safety from the larger beasts of prey  by day they gathered fruits and trapped small rodents at night they lay cowering within their frail shelter while savage denizens of the jungle made hideous the hours of darkness  they slept upon litters of jungle grasses and for covering at night jane porter had only an old ulster that belonged to clayton the same garment that he had worn upon that memorable trip to the wisconsin woods  clayton had erected a frail partition of boughs to divide their arboreal shelter into two roomsone for the girl and the other for monsieur thuran and himself  from the first the russian had exhibited every trait of his true characterselfishness boorishness arrogance cowardice and lust twice had he and clayton come to blows because of thurans attitude toward the girl  clayton dared not leave her alone with him for an instant  the existence of the englishman and his fiancee was one continual nightmare of horror and yet they lived on in hope of ultimate rescue  jane porters thoughts often reverted to her other experience on this savage shore  ah if the invincible forest god of that dead past were but with them now  no longer would there be aught to fear from prowling beasts or from the bestial russian  she could not well refrain from comparing the scant protection afforded her by clayton with what she might have expected had tarzan of the apes been for a single instant confronted by the sinister and menacing attitude of monsieur thuran  once when clayton had gone to the little stream for water and thuran had spoken coarsely to her she voiced her thoughts  it is well for you monsieur thuran she said that the poor monsieur tarzan who was lost from the ship that brought you and miss strong to cape town is not here now  you knew the pig asked thuran with a sneer  i knew the man she replied  the only real man i think that i have ever known  there was something in her tone of voice that led the russian to attribute to her a deeper feeling for his enemy than friendship and he grasped at the suggestion to be further revenged upon the man whom he supposed dead by besmirching his memory to the girl  he was worse than a pig he cried  he was a poltroon and a coward to save himself from the righteous wrath of the husband of a woman he had wronged he perjured his soul in an attempt to place the blame entirely upon her  not succeeding in this he ran away from france to escape meeting the husband upon the field of honor  that is why he was on board the ship that bore miss strong and myself to cape town  i know whereof i speak for the woman in the case is my sister something more i know that i have never told anotheryour brave monsieur tarzan leaped overboard in an agony of fear because i recognized him and insisted that he make reparation to me the following morningwe could have fought with knives in my stateroom  jane porter laughed  you do not for a moment imagine that one who has known both monsieur tarzan and you could ever believe such an impossible tale  then why did he travel under an assumed name asked monsieur thuran  i do not believe you she cried but nevertheless the seed of suspicion was sown for she knew that hazel strong had known her forest god only as john caldwell of london  a scant five miles north of their rude shelter all unknown to them and practically as remote as though separated by thousands of miles of impenetrable jungle lay the snug little cabin of tarzan of the apes while farther up the coast a few miles beyond the cabin in crude but wellbuilt shelters lived a little party of eighteen soulsthe occupants of the three boats from the lady alice from which claytons boat had become separated  over a smooth sea they had rowed to the mainland in less than three days  none of the horrors of shipwreck had been theirs and though depressed by sorrow and suffering from the shock of the catastrophe and the unaccustomed hardships of their new existence there was none much the worse for the experience  all were buoyed by the hope that the fourth boat had been picked up and that a thorough search of the coast would be quickly made  as all the firearms and ammunition on the yacht had been placed in lord tenningtons boat the party was well equipped for defense and for hunting the larger game for food  professor archimedes q porter was their only immediate anxiety  fully assured in his own mind that his daughter had been picked up by a passing steamer he gave over the last vestige of apprehension concerning her welfare and devoted his giant intellect solely to the consideration of those momentous and abstruse scientific problems which he considered the only proper food for thought in one of his erudition his mind appeared blank to the influence of all extraneous matters  never said the exhausted mr samuel t philander to lord tennington never has professor porter been more difficulteri might say impossible  why only this morning after i had been forced to relinquish my surveillance for a brief half hour he was entirely missing upon my return  and bless me sir where do you imagine i discovered him  a half mile out in the ocean sir in one of the lifeboats rowing away for dear life  i do not know how he attained even that magnificent distance from shore for he had but a single oar with which he was blissfully rowing about in circles  when one of the sailors had taken me out to him in another boat the professor became quite indignant at my suggestion that we return at once to land  why mr philander he said i am surprised that you sir a man of letters yourself should have the temerity so to interrupt the progress of science  i had about deduced from certain astronomic phenomena i have had under minute observation during the past several tropic nights an entirely new nebular hypothesis which will unquestionably startle the scientific world  i wish to consult a very excellent monograph on laplaces hypothesis which i understand is in a certain private collection in new york city  your interference mr philander will result in an irreparable delay for i was just rowing over to obtain this pamphlet  and it was with the greatest difficulty that i persuaded him to return to shore without resorting to force concluded mr philander  miss strong and her mother were very brave under the strain of almost constant apprehension of the attacks of savage beasts  nor were they quite able to accept so readily as the others the theory that jane clayton and monsieur thuran had been picked up safely  jane porters esmeralda was in a constant state of tears at the cruel fate which had separated her from her po lile honey  lord tenningtons greathearted good nature never deserted him for a moment  he was still the jovial host seeking always for the comfort and pleasure of his guests  with the men of his yacht he remained the just but firm commanderthere was never any more question in the jungle than there had been on board the lady alice as to who was the final authority in all questions of importance and in all emergencies requiring cool and intelligent leadership  could this wellorganized and comparatively secure party of castaways have seen the ragged fearhaunted trio a few miles south of them they would scarcely have recognized in them the formerly immaculate members of the little company that had laughed and played upon the lady alice clayton and monsieur thuran were almost naked so torn had their clothes been by the thorn bushes and tangled vegetation of the matted jungle through which they had been compelled to force their way in search of their ever more difficult food supply  jane porter had of course not been subjected to these strenuous expeditions but her apparel was nevertheless in a sad state of disrepair  clayton for lack of any better occupation had carefully saved the skin of every animal they had killed  by stretching them upon the stems of trees and diligently scraping them he had managed to save them in a fair condition and now that his clothes were threatening to cover his nakedness no longer he commenced to fashion a rude garment of them using a sharp thorn for a needle and bits of tough grass and animal tendons in lieu of thread  the result when completed was a sleeveless garment which fell nearly to his knees  as it was made up of numerous small pelts of different species of rodents it presented a rather strange and wonderful appearance which together with the vile stench which permeated it rendered it anything other than a desirable addition to a wardrobe but the time came when for the sake of decency he was compelled to don it and even the misery of their condition could not prevent jane porter from laughing heartily at sight of him  later thuran also found it necessary to construct a similar primitive garment so that with their bare legs and heavily bearded faces they looked not unlike reincarnations of two prehistoric progenitors of the human race  thuran acted like one  nearly two months of this existence had passed when the first great calamity befell them  it was prefaced by an adventure which came near terminating abruptly the sufferings of two of themterminating them in the grim and horrible manner of the jungle forever  thuran down with an attack of jungle fever lay in the shelter among the branches of their tree of refuge  clayton had been into the jungle a few hundred yards in search of food  as he returned jane porter walked to meet him  behind the man cunning and crafty crept an old and mangy lion  for three days his ancient thews and sinews had proved insufficient for the task of providing his cavernous belly with meat for months he had eaten less and less frequently and farther and farther had he roamed from his accustomed haunts in search of easier prey  at last he had found natures weakest and most defenseless creaturein a moment more numa would dine  clayton all unconscious of the lurking death behind him strode out into the open toward jane  he had reached her side a hundred feet from the tangled edge of jungle when past his shoulder the girl saw the tawny head and the wicked yellow eyes as the grasses parted and the huge beast nose to ground stepped softly into view  so frozen with horror was she that she could utter no sound but the fixed and terrified gaze of her fearwidened eyes spoke as plainly to clayton as words  a quick glance behind him revealed the hopelessness of their situation  the lion was scarce thirty paces from them and they were equally as far from the shelter  the man was armed with a stout stickas efficacious against a hungry lion he realized as a toy popgun charged with a tethered cork  numa ravenous with hunger had long since learned the futility of roaring and moaning as he searched for prey but now that it was as surely his as though already he had felt the soft flesh beneath his still mighty paw he opened his huge jaws and gave vent to his longpent rage in a series of deafening roars that made the air tremble  run jane cried clayton  quick  run for the shelter but her paralyzed muscles refused to respond and she stood mute and rigid staring with ghastly countenance at the living death creeping toward them  thuran at the sound of that awful roar had come to the opening of the shelter and as he saw the tableau below him he hopped up and down shrieking to them in russian  run  run he cried  run or i shall be left all alone in this horrible place and then he broke down and commenced to weep  for a moment this new voice distracted the attention of the lion who halted to cast an inquiring glance in the direction of the tree  clayton could endure the strain no longer  turning his back upon the beast he buried his head in his arms and waited  the girl looked at him in horror  why did he not do something  if he must die why not die like a manbravely beating at that terrible face with his puny stick no matter how futile it might be  would tarzan of the apes have done thus  would he not at least have gone down to his death fighting heroically to the last  now the lion was crouching for the spring that would end their young lives beneath cruel rending yellow fangs  jane porter sank to her knees in prayer closing her eyes to shut out the last hideous instant thuran weak from fever fainted  seconds dragged into minutes long minutes into an eternity and yet the beast did not spring  clayton was almost unconscious from the prolonged agony of frighthis knees trembleda moment more and he would collapse  jane porter could endure it no longer  she opened her eyes  could she be dreaming  william she whispered look  clayton mastered himself sufficiently to raise his head and turn toward the lion  an ejaculation of surprise burst from his lips  at their very feet the beast lay crumpled in death  a heavy war spear protruded from the tawny hide  it had entered the great back above the right shoulder and passing entirely through the body had pierced the savage heart  jane porter had risen to her feet as clayton turned back to her she staggered in weakness  he put out his arms to save her from falling and then drew her close to himpressing her head against his shoulder he stooped to kiss her in thanksgiving  gently the girl pushed him away  please do not do that william she said  i have lived a thousand years in the past brief moments  i have learned in the face of death how to live  i do not wish to hurt you more than is necessary but i can no longer bear to live out the impossible position i have attempted because of a false sense of loyalty to an impulsive promise i made you  the last few seconds of my life have taught me that it would be hideous to attempt further to deceive myself and you or to entertain for an instant longer the possibility of ever becoming your wife should we regain civilization  why jane he cried what do you mean  what has our providential rescue to do with altering your feelings toward me  you are but unstrungtomorrow you will be yourself again  i am more nearly myself this minute than i have been for over a year she replied  the thing that has just happened has again forced to my memory the fact that the bravest man that ever lived honored me with his love  until it was too late i did not realize that i returned it and so i sent him away  he is dead now and i shall never marry  i certainly could not wed another less brave than he without harboring constantly a feeling of contempt for the relative cowardice of my husband  do you understand me  yes he answered with bowed head his face mantling with the flush of shame  and it was the next day that the great calamity befell     chapter 22  the treasure vaults of opar   it was quite dark before la the high priestess returned to the chamber of the dead with food and drink for tarzan  she bore no light feeling with her hands along the crumbling walls until she gained the chamber  through the stone grating above a tropic moon served dimly to illuminate the interior  tarzan crouching in the shadows at the far side of the room as the first sound of approaching footsteps reached him came forth to meet the girl as he recognized that it was she  they are furious were her first words  never before has a human sacrifice escaped the altar  already fifty have gone forth to track you down  they have searched the templeall save this single room  why do they fear to come here he asked  it is the chamber of the dead  here the dead return to worship  see this ancient altar  it is here that the dead sacrifice the livingif they find a victim here  that is the reason our people shun this chamber  were one to enter he knows that the waiting dead would seize him for their sacrifice  but you he asked  i am high priestessi alone am safe from the dead  it is i who at rare intervals bring them a human sacrifice from the world above  i alone may enter here in safety  why have they not seized me he asked humoring her grotesque belief  she looked at him quizzically for a moment  then she replied  it is the duty of a high priestess to instruct to interpretaccording to the creed that others wiser than herself have laid down but there is nothing in the creed which says that she must believe  the more one knows of ones religion the less one believesno one living knows more of mine than i  then your only fear in aiding me to escape is that your fellow mortals may discover your duplicity  that is allthe dead are dead they cannot harmor help  we must therefore depend entirely upon ourselves and the sooner we act the better it will be  i had difficulty in eluding their vigilance but now in bringing you this morsel of food  to attempt to repeat the thing daily would be the height of folly  come let us see how far we may go toward liberty before i must return  she led him back to the chamber beneath the altar room  here she turned into one of the several corridors leading from it  in the darkness tarzan could not see which one  for ten minutes they groped slowly along a winding passage until at length they came to a closed door  here he heard her fumbling with a key and presently came the sound of a metal bolt grating against metal  the door swung in on scraping hinges and they entered  you will be safe here until tomorrow night she said  then she went out and closing the door locked it behind her  where tarzan stood it was dark as erebus  not even his trained eyes could penetrate the utter blackness  cautiously he moved forward until his outstretched hand touched a wall then very slowly he traveled around the four walls of the chamber  apparently it was about twenty feet square  the floor was of concrete the walls of the dry masonry that marked the method of construction above ground  small pieces of granite of various sizes were ingeniously laid together without mortar to construct these ancient foundations  the first time around the walls tarzan thought he detected a strange phenomenon for a room with no windows but a single door  again he crept carefully around close to the wall  no he could not be mistaken  he paused before the center of the wall opposite the door for a moment he stood quite motionless then he moved a few feet to one side  again he returned only to move a few feet to the other side  once more he made the entire circuit of the room feeling carefully every foot of the walls  finally he stopped again before the particular section that had aroused his curiosity  there was no doubt of it  a distinct draft of fresh air was blowing into the chamber through the intersection of the masonry at that particular pointand nowhere else  tarzan tested several pieces of the granite which made up the wall at this spot and finally was rewarded by finding one which lifted out readily  it was about ten inches wide with a face some three by six inches showing within the chamber  one by one the apeman lifted out similarly shaped stones  the wall at this point was constructed entirely it seemed of these almost perfect slabs  in a short time he had removed some dozen when he reached in to test the next layer of masonry  to his surprise he felt nothing behind the masonry he had removed as far as his long arm could reach  it was a matter of but a few minutes to remove enough of the wall to permit his body to pass through the aperture  directly ahead of him he thought he discerned a faint glowscarcely more than a less impenetrable darkness  cautiously he moved forward on hands and knees until at about fifteen feet or the average thickness of the foundation walls the floor ended abruptly in a sudden drop  as far out as he could reach he felt nothing nor could he find the bottom of the black abyss that yawned before him though clinging to the edge of the floor he lowered his body into the darkness to its full length  finally it occurred to him to look up and there above him he saw through a round opening a tiny circular patch of starry sky  feeling up along the sides of the shaft as far as he could reach the apeman discovered that so much of the wall as he could feel converged toward the center of the shaft as it rose  this fact precluded possibility of escape in that direction  as he sat speculating on the nature and uses of this strange passage and its terminal shaft the moon topped the opening above letting a flood of soft silvery light into the shadowy place  instantly the nature of the shaft became apparent to tarzan for far below him he saw the shimmering surface of water  he had come upon an ancient wellbut what was the purpose of the connection between the well and the dungeon in which he had been hidden  as the moon crossed the opening of the shaft its light flooded the whole interior and then tarzan saw directly across from him another opening in the opposite wall  he wondered if this might not be the mouth of a passage leading to possible escape  it would be worth investigating at least and this he determined to do  quickly returning to the wall he had demolished to explore what lay beyond it he carried the stones into the passageway and replaced them from that side  the deep deposit of dust which he had noticed upon the blocks as he had first removed them from the wall had convinced him that even if the present occupants of the ancient pile had knowledge of this hidden passage they had made no use of it for perhaps generations  the wall replaced tarzan turned to the shaft which was some fifteen feet wide at this point  to leap across the intervening space was a small matter to the apeman and a moment later he was proceeding along a narrow tunnel moving cautiously for fear of being precipitated into another shaft such as he had just crossed  he had advanced some hundred feet when he came to a flight of steps leading downward into stygian gloom  some twenty feet below the level floor of the tunnel recommenced and shortly afterward his progress was stopped by a heavy wooden door which was secured by massive wooden bars upon the side of tarzans approach  this fact suggested to the apeman that he might surely be in a passageway leading to the outer world for the bolts barring progress from the opposite side tended to substantiate this hypothesis unless it were merely a prison to which it led  along the tops of the bars were deep layers of dusta further indication that the passage had lain long unused  as he pushed the massive obstacle aside its great hinges shrieked out in weird protest against this unaccustomed disturbance  for a moment tarzan paused to listen for any responsive note which might indicate that the unusual night noise had alarmed the inmates of the temple but as he heard nothing he advanced beyond the doorway  carefully feeling about he found himself within a large chamber along the walls of which and down the length of the floor were piled many tiers of metal ingots of an odd though uniform shape  to his groping hands they felt not unlike doubleheaded bootjacks  the ingots were quite heavy and but for the enormous number of them he would have been positive that they were gold but the thought of the fabulous wealth these thousands of pounds of metal would have represented were they in reality gold almost convinced him that they must be of some baser metal  at the far end of the chamber he discovered another barred door and again the bars upon the inside renewed the hope that he was traversing an ancient and forgotten passageway to liberty  beyond the door the passage ran straight as a war spear and it soon became evident to the apeman that it had already led him beyond the outer walls of the temple  if he but knew the direction it was leading him  if toward the west then he must also be beyond the citys outer walls  with increasing hopes he forged ahead as rapidly as he dared until at the end of half an hour he came to another flight of steps leading upward  at the bottom this flight was of concrete but as he ascended his naked feet felt a sudden change in the substance they were treading  the steps of concrete had given place to steps of granite feeling with his hands the apeman discovered that these latter were evidently hewed from rock for there was no crack to indicate a joint  for a hundred feet the steps wound spirally up until at a sudden turning tarzan came into a narrow cleft between two rocky walls  above him shone the starry sky and before him a steep incline replaced the steps that had terminated at its foot  up this pathway tarzan hastened and at its upper end came out upon the rough top of a huge granite bowlder  a mile away lay the ruined city of opar its domes and turrets bathed in the soft light of the equatorial moon  tarzan dropped his eyes to the ingot he had brought away with him  for a moment he examined it by the moons bright rays then he raised his head to look out upon the ancient piles of crumbling grandeur in the distance  opar he mused opar the enchanted city of a dead and forgotten past  the city of the beauties and the beasts  city of horrors and death butcity of fabulous riches the ingot was of virgin gold  the bowlder on which tarzan found himself lay well out in the plain between the city and the distant cliffs he and his black warriors had scaled the morning previous  to descend its rough and precipitous face was a task of infinite labor and considerable peril even to the apeman but at last he felt the soft soil of the valley beneath his feet and without a backward glance at opar he turned his face toward the guardian cliffs and at a rapid trot set off across the valley  the sun was just rising as he gained the summit of the flat mountain at the valleys western boundary  far beneath him he saw smoke arising above the treetops of the forest at the base of the foothills  man he murmured  and there were fifty who went forth to track me down  can it be they  swiftly he descended the face of the cliff and dropping into a narrow ravine which led down to the far forest he hastened onward in the direction of the smoke  striking the forests edge about a quarter of a mile from the point at which the slender column arose into the still air he took to the trees  cautiously he approached until there suddenly burst upon his view a rude boma in the center of which squatted about their tiny fires sat his fifty black waziri  he called to them in their own tongue  arise my children and greet thy king  with exclamations of surprise and fear the warriors leaped to their feet scarcely knowing whether to flee or not  then tarzan dropped lightly from an overhanging branch into their midst  when they realized that it was indeed their chief in the flesh and no materialized spirit they went mad with joy  we were cowards oh waziri cried busuli  we ran away and left you to your fate but when our panic was over we swore to return and save you or at least take revenge upon your murderers  we were but now preparing to scale the heights once more and cross the desolate valley to the terrible city  have you seen fifty frightful men pass down from the cliffs into this forest my children asked tarzan  yes waziri replied busuli  they passed us late yesterday as we were about to turn back after you  they had no woodcraft  we heard them coming for a mile before we saw them and as we had other business in hand we withdrew into the forest and let them pass  they were waddling rapidly along upon short legs and now and then one would go upon all fours like bolgani the gorilla  they were indeed fifty frightful men waziri  when tarzan had related his adventures and told them of the yellow metal he had found not one demurred when he outlined a plan to return by night and bring away what they could carry of the vast treasure and so it was that as dusk fell across the desolate valley of opar fifty ebon warriors trailed at a smart trot over the dry and dusty ground toward the giant bowlder that loomed before the city  if it had seemed a difficult task to descend the face of the bowlder tarzan soon found that it would be next to impossible to get his fifty warriors to the summit  finally the feat was accomplished by dint of herculean efforts upon the part of the apeman  ten spears were fastened end to end and with one end of this remarkable chain attached to his waist tarzan at last succeeded in reaching the summit  once there he drew up one of his blacks and in this way the entire party was finally landed in safety upon the bowlders top  immediately tarzan led them to the treasure chamber where to each was allotted a load of two ingots for each about eighty pounds  by midnight the entire party stood once more at the foot of the bowlder but with their heavy loads it was midforenoon ere they reached the summit of the cliffs  from there on the homeward journey was slow as these proud fighting men were unaccustomed to the duties of porters  but they bore their burdens uncomplainingly and at the end of thirty days entered their own country  here instead of continuing on toward the northwest and their village tarzan guided them almost directly west until on the morning of the thirtythird day he bade them break camp and return to their own village leaving the gold where they had stacked it the previous night  and you waziri they asked  i shall remain here for a few days my children he replied  now hasten back to thy wives and children  when they had gone tarzan gathered up two of the ingots and springing into a tree ran lightly above the tangled and impenetrable mass of undergrowth for a couple of hundred yards to emerge suddenly upon a circular clearing about which the giants of the jungle forest towered like a guardian host  in the center of this natural amphitheater was a little flattopped mound of hard earth  hundreds of times before had tarzan been to this secluded spot which was so densely surrounded by thorn bushes and tangled vines and creepers of huge girth that not even sheeta the leopard could worm his sinuous way within nor tantor with his giant strength force the barriers which protected the council chamber of the great apes from all but the harmless denizens of the savage jungle  fifty trips tarzan made before he had deposited all the ingots within the precincts of the amphitheater  then from the hollow of an ancient lightningblasted tree he produced the very spade with which he had uncovered the chest of professor archimedes q porter which he had once apelike buried in this selfsame spot  with this he dug a long trench into which he laid the fortune that his blacks had carried from the forgotten treasure vaults of the city of opar  that night he slept within the amphitheater and early the next morning set out to revisit his cabin before returning to his waziri  finding things as he had left them he went forth into the jungle to hunt intending to bring his prey to the cabin where he might feast in comfort spending the night upon a comfortable couch  for five miles toward the south he roamed toward the banks of a fairsized river that flowed into the sea about six miles from his cabin  he had gone inland about half a mile when there came suddenly to his trained nostrils the one scent that sets the whole savage jungle aquivertarzan smelled man  the wind was blowing off the ocean so tarzan knew that the authors of the scent were west of him  mixed with the man scent was the scent of numa  man and lion  i had better hasten thought the apeman for he had recognized the scent of whites  numa may be ahunting  when he came through the trees to the edge of the jungle he saw a woman kneeling in prayer and before her stood a wild primitivelooking white man his face buried in his arms  behind the man a mangy lion was advancing slowly toward this easy prey  the mans face was averted the womans bowed in prayer  he could not see the features of either  already numa was about to spring  there was not a second to spare tarzan could not even unsling his bow and fit an arrow in time to send one of his deadly poisoned shafts into the yellow hide  he was too far away to reach the beast in time with his knife  there was but a single hopea lone alternative  and with the quickness of thought the apeman acted  a brawny arm flew backfor the briefest fraction of an instant a huge spear poised above the giants shoulderand then the mighty arm shot out and swift death tore through the intervening leaves to bury itself in the heart of the leaping lion  without a sound he rolled over at the very feet of his intended victimsdead  for a moment neither the man nor the woman moved  then the latter opened her eyes to look with wonder upon the dead beast behind her companion  as that beautiful head went up tarzan of the apes gave a gasp of incredulous astonishment  was he mad  it could not be the woman he loved  but indeed it was none other  and the woman rose and the man took her in his arms to kiss her and of a sudden the apeman saw red through a bloody mist of murder and the old scar upon his forehead burned scarlet against his brown hide  there was a terrible expression upon his savage face as he fitted a poisoned shaft to his bow  an ugly light gleamed in those gray eyes as he sighted full at the back of the unsuspecting man beneath him  for an instant he glanced along the polished shaft drawing the bowstring far back that the arrow might pierce through the heart for which it was aimed  but he did not release the fatal messenger  slowly the point of the arrow drooped the scar upon the brown forehead faded the bowstring relaxed and tarzan of the apes with bowed head turned sadly into the jungle toward the village of the waziri     chapter 23  the fifty frightful men   for several long minutes jane porter and william cecil clayton stood silently looking at the dead body of the beast whose prey they had so narrowly escaped becoming  the girl was the first to speak again after her outbreak of impulsive avowal  who could it have been she whispered  god knows was the mans only reply  if it is a friend why does he not show himself continued jane wouldnt it be well to call out to him and at least thank him  mechanically clayton did her bidding but there was no response  jane porter shuddered  the mysterious jungle she murmured  the terrible jungle  it renders even the manifestations of friendship terrifying  we had best return to the shelter said clayton  you will be at least a little safer there  i am no protection whatever he added bitterly  do not say that william she hastened to urge acutely sorry for the wound her words had caused  you have done the best you could  you have been noble and selfsacrificing and brave  it is no fault of yours that you are not a superman  there is only one other man i have ever known who could have done more than you  my words were ill chosen in the excitement of the reactioni did not wish to wound you  all that i wish is that we may both understand once and for all that i can never marry youthat such a marriage would be wicked  i think i understand he replied  let us not speak of it againat least until we are back in civilization  the next day thuran was worse  almost constantly he was in a state of delirium  they could do nothing to relieve him nor was clayton overanxious to attempt anything  on the girls account he feared the russianin the bottom  of his heart he hoped the man would die  the thought that something might befall him that would leave her entirely at the mercy of this beast caused him greater anxiety than the probability that almost certain death awaited her should she be left entirely alone upon the outskirts of the cruel forest  the englishman had extracted the heavy spear from the body of the lion so that when he went into the forest to hunt that morning he had a feeling of much greater security than at any time since they had been cast upon the savage shore  the result was that he penetrated farther from the shelter than ever before  to escape as far as possible from the mad ravings of the feverstricken russian jane porter had descended from the shelter to the foot of the treeshe dared not venture farther  here beside the crude ladder clayton had constructed for her she sat looking out to sea in the always surviving hope that a vessel might be sighted  her back was toward the jungle and so she did not see the grasses part or the savage face that peered from between  little bloodshot closeset eyes scanned her intently roving from time to time about the open beach for indications of the presence of others than herself presently another head appeared and then another and another  the man in the shelter commenced to rave again and the heads disappeared as silently and as suddenly as they had come  but soon they were thrust forth once more as the girl gave no sign of perturbation at the continued wailing of the man above  one by one grotesque forms emerged from the jungle to creep stealthily upon the unsuspecting woman  a faint rustling of the grasses attracted her attention  she turned and at the sight that confronted her staggered to her feet with a little shriek of fear  then they closed upon her with a rush  lifting her bodily in his long gorillalike arms one of the creatures turned and bore her into the jungle  a filthy paw covered her mouth to stifle her screams  added to the weeks of torture she had already undergone the shock was more than she could withstand  shattered nerves collapsed and she lost consciousness when she regained her senses she found herself in the thick of the primeval forest  it was night  a huge fire burned brightly in the little clearing in which she lay  about it squatted fifty frightful men  their heads and faces were covered with matted hair  their long arms rested upon the bent knees of their short crooked legs  they were gnawing like beasts upon unclean food  a pot boiled upon the edge of the fire and out of it one of the creatures would occasionally drag a hunk of meat with a sharpened stick  when they discovered that their captive had regained consciousness a piece of this repulsive stew was tossed to her from the foul hand of a nearby feaster  it rolled close to her side but she only closed her eyes as a qualm of nausea surged through her  for many days they traveled through the dense forest  the girl footsore and exhausted was half dragged half pushed through the long hot tedious days  occasionally when she would stumble and fall she was cuffed and kicked by the nearest of the frightful men  long before they reached their journeys end her shoes had been discardedthe soles entirely gone  her clothes were torn to mere shreds and tatters and through the pitiful rags her once white and tender skin showed raw and bleeding from contact with the thousand pitiless thorns and brambles through which she had been dragged  the last two days of the journey found her in such utter exhaustion that no amount of kicking and abuse could force her to her poor bleeding feet  outraged nature had reached the limit of endurance and the girl was physically powerless to raise herself even to her knees  as the beasts surrounded her chattering threateningly the while they goaded her with their cudgels and beat and kicked her with their fists and feet she lay with closed eyes praying for the merciful death that she knew alone could give her surcease from suffering but it did not come and presently the fifty frightful men realized that their victim was no longer able to walk and so they picked her up and carried her the balance of the journey  late one afternoon she saw the ruined walls of a mighty city looming before them but so weak and sick was she that it inspired not the faintest shadow of interest  wherever they were bearing her there could be but one end to her captivity among these fierce half brutes  at last they passed through two great walls and came to the ruined city within  into a crumbling pile they bore her and here she was surrounded by hundreds more of the same creatures that had brought her but among them were females who looked less horrible  at sight of them the first faint hope that she had entertained came to mitigate her misery  but it was shortlived for the women offered her no sympathy though on the other hand neither did they abuse her  after she had been inspected to the entire satisfaction of the inmates of the building she was borne to a dark chamber in the vaults beneath and here upon the bare floor she was left with a metal bowl of water and another of food  for a week she saw only some of the women whose duty it was to bring her food and water  slowly her strength was returningsoon she would be in fit condition to offer as a sacrifice to the flaming god fortunate indeed it was that she could not know the fate for which she was destined  as tarzan of the apes moved slowly through the jungle after casting the spear that saved clayton and jane porter from the fangs of numa his mind was filled with all the sorrow that belongs to a freshly opened heart wound  he was glad that he had stayed his hand in time to prevent the consummation of the thing that in the first mad wave of jealous wrath he had contemplated  only the fraction of a second had stood between clayton and death at the hands of the apeman  in the short moment that had elapsed after he had recognized the girl and her companion and the relaxing of the taut muscles that held the poisoned shaft directed at the englishmans heart tarzan had been swayed by the swift and savage impulses of brute life  he had seen the woman he cravedhis womanhis matein the arms of another  there had been but one course open to him according to the fierce jungle code that guided him in this other existence but just before it had become too late the softer sentiments of his inherent chivalry had risen above the flaming fires of his passion and saved him  a thousand times he gave thanks that they had triumphed before his fingers had released that polished arrow  as he contemplated his return to the waziri the idea became repugnant he did not wish to see a human being again  at least he would range alone through the jungle for a time until the sharp edge of his sorrow had become blunted  like his fellow beasts he preferred to suffer in silence and alone  that night he slept again in the amphitheater of the apes and for several days he hunted from there returning at night  on the afternoon of the third day he returned early  he had lain stretched upon the soft grass of the circular clearing for but a few moments when he heard far to the south a familiar sound  it was the passing through the jungle of a band of great apeshe could not mistake that  for several minutes he lay listening  they were coming in the direction of the amphitheater  tarzan arose lazily and stretched himself  his keen ears followed every movement of the advancing tribe  they were upwind and presently he caught their scent though he had not needed this added evidence to assure him that he was right  as they came closer to the amphitheater tarzan of the apes melted into the branches upon the other side of the arena  there he waited to inspect the newcomers  nor had he long to wait  presently a fierce hairy face appeared among the lower branches opposite him  the cruel little eyes took in the clearing at a glance then there was a chattered report returned to those behind  tarzan could hear the words  the scout was telling the other members of the tribe that the coast was clear and that they might enter the amphitheater in safety  first the leader dropped lightly upon the soft carpet of the grassy floor and then one by one nearly a hundred anthropoids followed him there were the huge adults and several young  a few nursing babes clung close to the shaggy necks of their savage mothers  tarzan recognized many members of the tribe  it was the same into which he had come as a tiny babe  many of the adults had been little apes during his boyhood  he had frolicked and played about this very jungle with them during their brief childhood  he wondered if they would remember himthe memory of some apes is not overlong and two years may be an eternity to them  from the talk which he overheard he learned that they had come to choose a new kingtheir late chief had fallen a hundred feet beneath a broken limb to an untimely end  tarzan walked to the end of an overhanging limb in plain view of them the quick eyes of a female caught sight of him first  with a barking guttural she called the attention of the others  several huge bulls stood erect to get a better view of the intruder  with bared fangs and bristling necks they advanced slowly toward him with deepthroated ominous growls  karnath i am tarzan of the apes said the apeman in the vernacular of the tribe  you remember me  together we teased numa when we were still little apes throwing sticks and nuts at him from the safety of high branches  the brute he had addressed stopped with a look of halfcomprehending dull wonderment upon his savage face  and magor continued tarzan addressing another do you not recall your former kinghe who slew the mighty kerchak  look at me  am i not the same tarzanmighty hunterinvincible fighterthat you all knew for many seasons  the apes all crowded forward now but more in curiosity than threatening  they muttered among themselves for a few moments  what do you want among us now asked karnath  only peace answered the apeman  again the apes conferred  at length karnath spoke again  come in peace then tarzan of the apes he said  and so tarzan of the apes dropped lightly to the turf into the midst of the fierce and hideous hordehe had completed the cycle of evolution and had returned to be once again a brute among brutes  there were no greetings such as would have taken place among men after a separation of two years  the majority of the apes went on about the little activities that the advent of the apeman had interrupted paying no further attention to him than as though he had not been gone from the tribe at all  one or two young bulls who had not been old enough to remember him sidled up on all fours to sniff at him and one bared his fangs and growled threateninglyhe wished to put tarzan immediately into his proper place  had tarzan backed off growling the young bull would quite probably have been satisfied but always after tarzans station among his fellow apes would have been beneath that of the bull which had made him step aside  but tarzan of the apes did not back off  instead he swung his giant palm with all the force of his mighty muscles and catching the young bull alongside the head sent him sprawling across the turf  the ape was up and at him again in a second and this time they closed with tearing fingers and rending fangsor at least that had been the intention of the young bull but scarcely had they gone down growling and snapping than the apemans fingers found the throat of his antagonist  presently the young bull ceased to struggle and lay quite still  then tarzan released his hold and arosehe did not wish to kill only to teach the young ape and others who might be watching that tarzan of the apes was still master  the lesson served its purposethe young apes kept out of his way as young apes should when their betters were about and the old bulls made no attempt to encroach upon his prerogatives  for several days the sheapes with young remained suspicious of him and when he ventured too near rushed upon him with wide mouths and hideous roars  then tarzan discreetly skipped out of harms way for that also is a custom among the apesonly mad bulls will attack a mother  but after a while even they became accustomed to him  he hunted with them as in days gone by and when they found that his superior reason guided him to the best food sources and that his cunning rope ensnared toothsome game that they seldom if ever tasted they came again to look up to him as they had in the past after he had become their king  and so it was that before they left the amphitheater to return to their wanderings they had once more chosen him as their leader  the apeman felt quite contented with his new lot  he was not happythat he never could be again but he was at least as far from everything that might remind him of his past misery as he could be long since he had given up every intention of returning to civilization and now he had decided to see no more his black friends of the waziri  he had foresworn humanity forever  he had started life an apeas an ape he would die  he could not however erase from his memory the fact that the woman he loved was within a short journey of the stampingground of his tribe nor could he banish the haunting fear that she might be constantly in danger  that she was illy protected he had seen in the brief instant that had witnessed claytons inefficiency  the more tarzan thought of it the more keenly his conscience pricked him  finally he came to loathe himself for permitting his own selfish sorrow and jealousy to stand between jane porter and safety  as the days passed the thing preyed more and more upon his mind and he had about determined to return to the coast and place himself on guard over jane porter and clayton when news reached him that altered all his plans and sent him dashing madly toward the east in reckless disregard of accident and death  before tarzan had returned to the tribe a certain young bull not being able to secure a mate from among his own people had according to custom fared forth through the wild jungle like some knighterrant of old to win a fair lady from some neighboring community  he had but just returned with his bride and was narrating his adventures quickly before he should forget them  among other things he told of seeing a great tribe of strangelooking apes  they were all hairyfaced bulls but one he said and that one was a she lighter in color even than this stranger and he chucked a thumb at tarzan  the apeman was all attention in an instant  he asked questions as rapidly as the slowwitted anthropoid could answer them  were the bulls short with crooked legs  they were  did they wear the skins of numa and sheeta about their loins and carry sticks and knives  they did  and were there many yellow rings about their arms and legs  yes  and the she onewas she small and slender and very white  yes  did she seem to be one of the tribe or was she a prisoner  they dragged her alongsometimes by an armsometimes by the long hair that grew upon her head and always they kicked and beat her  oh but it was great fun to watch them  god muttered tarzan  where were they when you saw them and which way were they going continued the apeman  they were beside the second water back there and he pointed to the south  when they passed me they were going toward the morning upward along the edge of the water  when was this asked tarzan  half a moon since  without another word the apeman sprang into the trees and fled like a disembodied spirit eastward in the direction of the forgotten city of opar     chapter 24  how tarzan came again to opar   when clayton returned to the shelter and found jane porter was missing he became frantic with fear and grief  he found monsieur thuran quite rational the fever having left him with the surprising suddenness which is one of its peculiarities  the russian weak and exhausted still lay upon his bed of grasses within the shelter  when clayton asked him about the girl he seemed surprised to know that she was not there  i have heard nothing unusual he said  but then i have been unconscious much of the time  had it not been for the mans very evident weakness clayton should have suspected him of having sinister knowledge of the girls whereabouts but he could see that thuran lacked sufficient vitality even to descend unaided from the shelter  he could not in his present physical condition have harmed the girl nor could he have climbed the rude ladder back to the shelter  until dark the englishman searched the nearby jungle for a trace of the missing one or a sign of the trail of her abductor  but though the spoor left by the fifty frightful men unversed in woodcraft as they were would have been as plain to the densest denizen of the jungle as a city street to the englishman yet he crossed and recrossed it twenty times without observing the slightest indication that many men had passed that way but a few short hours since  as he searched clayton continued to call the girls name aloud but the only result of this was to attract numa the lion  fortunately the man saw the shadowy form worming its way toward him in time to climb into the branches of a tree before the beast was close enough to reach him  this put an end to his search for the balance of the afternoon as the lion paced back and forth beneath him until dark  even after the beast had left clayton dared not descend into the awful blackness beneath him and so he spent a terrifying and hideous night in the tree  the next morning he returned to the beach relinquishing the last hope of succoring jane porter  during the week that followed monsieur thuran rapidly regained his strength lying in the shelter while clayton hunted food for both  the men never spoke except as necessity demanded  clayton now occupied the section of the shelter which had been reserved for jane porter and only saw the russian when he took food or water to him or performed the other kindly offices which common humanity required  when thuran was again able to descend in search of food clayton was stricken with fever  for days he lay tossing in delirium and suffering but not once did the russian come near him  food the englishman could not have eaten but his craving for water amounted practically to torture  between the recurrent attacks of delirium weak though he was he managed to reach the brook once a day and fill a tiny can that had been among the few appointments of the lifeboat  thuran watched him on these occasions with an expression of malignant pleasurehe seemed really to enjoy the suffering of the man who despite the just contempt in which he held him had ministered to him to the best of his ability while he lay suffering the same agonies  at last clayton became so weak that he was no longer able to descend from the shelter  for a day he suffered for water without appealing to the russian but finally unable to endure it longer he asked thuran to fetch him a drink  the russian came to the entrance to claytons room a dish of water in his hand  a nasty grin contorted his features  here is water he said  but first let me remind you that you maligned me before the girlthat you kept her to yourself and would not share her with me  clayton interrupted him  stop he cried  stop  what manner of cur are you that you traduce the character of a good woman whom we believe dead  god  i was a fool ever to let you liveyou are not fit to live even in this vile land  here is your water said the russian  all you will get and he raised the basin to his lips and drank what was left he threw out upon the ground below  then he turned and left the sick man  clayton rolled over and burying his face in his arms gave up the battle  the next day thuran determined to set out toward the north along the coast for he knew that eventually he must come to the habitations of civilized menat least he could be no worse off than he was here and furthermore the ravings of the dying englishman were getting on his nerves  so he stole claytons spear and set off upon his journey  he would have killed the sick man before he left had it not occurred to him that it would really have been a kindness to do so  that same day he came to a little cabin by the beach and his heart filled with renewed hope as he saw this evidence of the proximity of civilization for he thought it but the outpost of a nearby settlement had he known to whom it belonged and that its owner was at that very moment but a few miles inland nikolas rokoff would have fled the place as he would a pestilence  but he did not know and so he remained for a few days to enjoy the security and comparative comforts of the cabin then he took up his northward journey once more  in lord tenningtons camp preparations were going forward to build permanent quarters and then to send out an expedition of a few men to the north in search of relief  as the days had passed without bringing the longedfor succor hope that jane porter clayton and monsieur thuran had been rescued began to die  no one spoke of the matter longer to professor porter and he was so immersed in his scientific dreaming that he was not aware of the elapse of time  occasionally he would remark that within a few days they should certainly see a steamer drop anchor off their shore and that then they should all be reunited happily  sometimes he spoke of it as a train and wondered if it were being delayed by snowstorms  if i didnt know the dear old fellow so well by now tennington remarked to miss strong i should be quite certain that he wasernot quite right dont you know if it were not so pathetic it would be ridiculous said the girl sadly  i who have known him all my life know how he worships jane but to others it must seem that he is perfectly callous to her fate  it is only that he is so absolutely impractical that he cannot conceive of so real a thing as death unless nearly certain proof of it is thrust upon him  youd never guess what he was about yesterday continued tennington i was coming in alone from a little hunt when i met him walking rapidly along the game trail that i was following back to camp  his hands were clasped beneath the tails of his long black coat and his top hat was set firmly down upon his head as with eyes bent upon the ground he hastened on probably to some sudden death had i not intercepted him  why where in the world are you bound professor i asked him  i am going into town lord tennington he said as seriously as possible to complain to the postmaster about the rural free delivery service we are suffering from here  why sir i havent had a piece of mail in weeks  there should be several letters for me from jane  the matter must be reported to washington at once  and would you believe it miss strong continued tennington i had the very deuce of a job to convince the old fellow that there was not only no rural free delivery but no town and that he was not even on the same continent as washington nor in the same hemisphere  when he did realize he commenced to worry about his daughteri think it is the first time that he really has appreciated our position here or the fact that miss porter may not have been rescued  i hate to think about it said the girl and yet i can think of nothing else than the absent members of our party  let us hope for the best replied tennington  you yourself have set us each a splendid example of bravery for in a way your loss has been the greatest  yes she replied i could have loved jane porter no more had she been my own sister  tennington did not show the surprise he felt  that was not at all what he meant  he had been much with this fair daughter of maryland since the wreck of the lady alice and it had recently come to him that he had grown much more fond of her than would prove good for the peace of his mind for he recalled almost constantly now the confidence which monsieur thuran had imparted to him that he and miss strong were engaged  he wondered if after all thuran had been quite accurate in his statement  he had never seen the slightest indication on the girls part of more than ordinary friendship  and then in monsieur thurans loss if they are lost you would suffer a severe bereavement he ventured  she looked up at him quickly  monsieur thuran had become a very dear friend she said  i liked him very much though i have known him but a short time  then you were not engaged to marry him he blurted out  heavens no she cried  i did not care for him at all in that way  there was something that lord tennington wanted to say to hazel stronghe wanted very badly to say it and to say it at once but somehow the words stuck in his throat  he started lamely a couple of times cleared his throat became red in the face and finally ended by remarking that he hoped the cabins would be finished before the rainy season commenced  but though he did not know it he had conveyed to the girl the very message he intended and it left her happyhappier than she had ever before been in all her life  just then further conversation was interrupted by the sight of a strange and terriblelooking figure which emerged from the jungle just south of the camp  tennington and the girl saw it at the same time the englishman reached for his revolver but when the halfnaked bearded creature called his name aloud and came running toward them he dropped his hand and advanced to meet it  none would have recognized in the filthy emaciated creature covered by a single garment of small skins the immaculate monsieur thuran the party had last seen upon the deck of the lady alice  before the other members of the little community were apprised of his presence tennington and miss strong questioned him regarding the other occupants of the missing boat  they are all dead replied thuran  the three sailors died before we made land  miss porter was carried off into the jungle by some wild animal while i was lying delirious with fever  clayton died of the same fever but a few days since  and to think that all this time we have been separated by but a few milesscarcely a days march  it is terrible   how long jane porter lay in the darkness of the vault beneath the temple in the ancient city of opar she did not know  for a time she was delirious with fever but after this passed she commenced slowly to regain her strength  every day the woman who brought her food beckoned to her to arise but for many days the girl could only shake her head to indicate that she was too weak  but eventually she was able to gain her feet and then to stagger a few steps by supporting herself with one hand upon the wall  her captors now watched her with increasing interest  the day was approaching and the victim was gaining in strength  presently the day came and a young woman whom jane porter had not seen before came with several others to her dungeon  here some sort of ceremony was performedthat it was of a religious nature the girl was sure and so she took new heart and rejoiced that she had fallen among people upon whom the refining and softening influences of religion evidently had fallen  they would treat her humanelyof that she was now quite sure  and so when they led her from her dungeon through long dark corridors and up a flight of concrete steps to a brilliant courtyard she went willingly even gladlyfor was she not among the servants of god  it might be of course that their interpretation of the supreme being differed from her own but that they owned a god was sufficient evidence to her that they were kind and good  but when she saw a stone altar in the center of the courtyard and darkbrown stains upon it and the nearby concrete of the floor she began to wonder and to doubt  and as they stooped and bound her ankles and secured her wrists behind her her doubts were turned to fear  a moment later as she was lifted and placed supine across the altars top hope left her entirely and she trembled in an agony of fright  during the grotesque dance of the votaries which followed she lay frozen in horror nor did she require the sight of the thin blade in the hands of the high priestess as it rose slowly above her to enlighten her further as to her doom  as the hand began its descent jane porter closed her eyes and sent up a silent prayer to the maker she was so soon to facethen she succumbed to the strain upon her tired nerves and swooned   day and night tarzan of the apes raced through the primeval forest toward the ruined city in which he was positive the woman he loved lay either a prisoner or dead  in a day and a night he covered the same distance that the fifty frightful men had taken the better part of a week to traverse for tarzan of the apes traveled along the middle terrace high above the tangled obstacles that impede progress upon the ground  the story the young bull ape had told made it clear to him that the girl captive had been jane porter for there was not another small white she in all the jungle  the bulls he had recognized from the apes crude description as the grotesque parodies upon humanity who inhabit the ruins of opar  and the girls fate he could picture as plainly as though he were an eyewitness to it  when they would lay her across that trim altar he could not guess but that her dear frail body would eventually find its way there he was confident  but finally after what seemed long ages to the impatient apeman he topped the barrier cliffs that hemmed the desolate valley and below him lay the grim and awful ruins of the now hideous city of opar  at a rapid trot he started across the dry and dusty bowlderstrewn ground toward the goal of his desires  would he be in time to rescue  he hoped against hope  at least he could be revenged and in his wrath it seemed to him that he was equal to the task of wiping out the entire population of that terrible city it was nearly noon when he reached the great bowlder at the top of which terminated the secret passage to the pits beneath the city  like a cat he scaled the precipitous sides of the frowning granite kopje  a moment later he was running through the darkness of the long straight tunnel that led to the treasure vault  through this he passed then on and on until at last he came to the welllike shaft upon the opposite side of which lay the dungeon with the false wall  as he paused a moment upon the brink of the well a faint sound came to him through the opening above  his quick ears caught and translated itit was the dance of death that preceded a sacrifice and the singsong ritual of the high priestess  he could even recognize the womans voice  could it be that the ceremony marked the very thing he had so hastened to prevent  a wave of horror swept over him  was he after all to be just a moment too late  like a frightened deer he leaped across the narrow chasm to the continuation of the passage beyond  at the false wall he tore like one possessed to demolish the barrier that confronted himwith giant muscles he forced the opening thrusting his head and shoulders through the first small hole he made and carrying the balance of the wall with him to clatter resoundingly upon the cement floor of the dungeon  with a single leap he cleared the length of the chamber and threw himself against the ancient door  but here he stopped  the mighty bars upon the other side were proof even against such muscles as his it needed but a moments effort to convince him of the futility of endeavoring to force that impregnable barrier  there was but one other way and that led back through the long tunnels to the bowlder a mile beyond the citys walls and then back across the open as he had come to the city first with his waziri  he realized that to retrace his steps and enter the city from above ground would mean that he would be too late to save the girl if it were indeed she who lay upon the sacrificial altar above him  but there seemed no other way and so he turned and ran swiftly back into the passageway beyond the broken wall  at the well he heard again the monotonous voice of the high priestess and as he glanced aloft the opening twenty feet above seemed so near that he was tempted to leap for it in a mad endeavor to reach the inner courtyard that lay so near  if he could but get one end of his grass rope caught upon some projection at the top of that tantalizing aperture  in the instants pause and thought an idea occurred to him  he would attempt it turning back to the tumbled wall he seized one of the large flat slabs that had composed it  hastily making one end of his rope fast to the piece of granite he returned to the shaft and coiling the balance of the rope on the floor beside him the apeman took the heavy slab in both hands and swinging it several times to get the distance and the direction fixed he let the weight fly up at a slight angle so that instead of falling straight back into the shaft again it grazed the far edge tumbling over into the court beyond  tarzan dragged for a moment upon the slack end of the rope until he felt that the stone was lodged with fair security at the shafts top then he swung out over the black depths beneath  the moment his full weight came upon the rope he felt it slip from above  he waited there in awful suspense as it dropped in little jerks inch by inch  the stone was being dragged up the outside of the masonry surrounding the top of the shaftwould it catch at the very edge or would his weight drag it over to fall upon him as he hurtled into the unknown depths below     chapter 25  through the forest primeval   for a brief sickening moment tarzan felt the slipping of the rope to which he clung and heard the scraping of the block of stone against the masonry above  then of a sudden the rope was stillthe stone had caught at the very edge  gingerly the apeman clambered up the frail rope  in a moment his head was above the edge of the shaft  the court was empty  the inhabitants of opar were viewing the sacrifice  tarzan could hear the voice of la from the nearby sacrificial court  the dance had ceased it must be almost time for the knife to fall but even as he thought these things he was running rapidly toward the sound of the high priestess voice  fate guided him to the very doorway of the great roofless chamber between him and the altar was the long row of priests and priestesses awaiting with their golden cups the spilling of the warm blood of their victim  las hand was descending slowly toward the bosom of the frail quiet figure that lay stretched upon the hard stone  tarzan gave a gasp that was almost a sob as he recognized the features of the girl he loved  and then the scar upon his forehead turned to a flaming band of scarlet a red mist floated before his eyes and with the awful roar of the bull ape gone mad he sprang like a huge lion into the midst of the votaries  seizing a cudgel from the nearest priest he laid about him like a veritable demon as he forged his rapid way toward the altar  the hand of la had paused at the first noise of interruption  when she saw who the author of it was she went white  she had never been able to fathom the secret of the strange white mans escape from the dungeon in which she had locked him  she had not intended that he should ever leave opar for she had looked upon his giant frame and handsome face with the eyes of a woman and not those of a priestess  in her clever mind she had concocted a story of wonderful revelation from the lips of the flaming god himself in which she had been ordered to receive this white stranger as a messenger from him to his people on earth  that would satisfy the people of opar she knew  the man would be satisfied she felt quite sure to remain and be her husband rather than to return to the sacrificial altar  but when she had gone to explain her plan to him he had disappeared though the door had been tightly locked as she had left it  and now he had returnedmaterialized from thin airand was killing her priests as though they had been sheep  for the moment she forgot her victim and before she could gather her wits together again the huge white man was standing before her the woman who had lain upon the altar in his arms  one side la he cried  you saved me once and so i would not harm you but do not interfere or attempt to follow or i shall have to kill you also  as he spoke he stepped past her toward the entrance to the subterranean vaults  who is she asked the high priestess pointing at the unconscious woman  she is mine said tarzan of the apes  for a moment the girl of opar stood wideeyed and staring  then a look of hopeless misery suffused her eyestears welled into them and with a little cry she sank to the cold floor just as a swarm of frightful men dashed past her to leap upon the apeman  but tarzan of the apes was not there when they reached out to seize him  with a light bound he had disappeared into the passage leading to the pits below and when his pursuers came more cautiously after they found the chamber empty they but laughed and jabbered to one another for they knew that there was no exit from the pits other than the one through which he had entered  if he came out at all he must come this way and they would wait and watch for him above  and so tarzan of the apes carrying the unconscious jane porter came through the pits of opar beneath the temple of the flaming god without pursuit  but when the men of opar had talked further about the matter they recalled to mind that this very man had escaped once before into the pits and though they had watched the entrance he had not come forth and yet today he had come upon them from the outside  they would again send fifty men out into the valley to find and capture this desecrater of their temple  after tarzan reached the shaft beyond the broken wall he felt so positive of the successful issue of his flight that he stopped to replace the tumbled stones for he was not anxious that any of the inmates should discover this forgotten passage and through it come upon the treasure chamber  it was in his mind to return again to opar and bear away a still greater fortune than he had already buried in the amphitheater of the apes  on through the passageways he trotted past the first door and through the treasure vault past the second door and into the long straight tunnel that led to the lofty hidden exit beyond the city  jane porter was still unconscious  at the crest of the great bowlder he halted to cast a backward glance toward the city  coming across the plain he saw a band of the hideous men of opar  for a moment he hesitated  should he descend and make a race for the distant cliffs or should he hide here until night  and then a glance at the girls white face determined him  he could not keep her here and permit her enemies to get between them and liberty for aught he knew they might have been followed through the tunnels and to have foes before and behind would result in almost certain capture since he could not fight his way through the enemy burdened as he was with the unconscious girl  to descend the steep face of the bowlder with jane porter was no easy task but by binding her across his shoulders with the grass rope he succeeded in reaching the ground in safety before the oparians arrived at the great rock  as the descent had been made upon the side away from the city the searching party saw nothing of it nor did they dream that their prey was so close before them  by keeping the kopje between them and their pursuers tarzan of the apes managed to cover nearly a mile before the men of opar rounded the granite sentinel and saw the fugitive before them  with loud cries of savage delight they broke into a mad run thinking doubtless that they would soon overhaul the burdened runner but they both underestimated the powers of the apeman and overestimated the possibilities of their own short crooked legs  by maintaining an easy trot tarzan kept the distance between them always the same  occasionally he would glance at the face so near his own  had it not been for the faint beating of the heart pressed so close against his own he would not have known that she was alive so white and drawn was the poor tired face  and thus they came to the flattopped mountain and the barrier cliffs during the last mile tarzan had let himself out running like a deer that he might have ample time to descend the face of the cliffs before the oparians could reach the summit and hurl rocks down upon them  and so it was that he was half a mile down the mountainside ere the fierce little men came panting to the edge  with cries of rage and disappointment they ranged along the cliff top shaking their cudgels and dancing up and down in a perfect passion of anger  but this time they did not pursue beyond the boundary of their own country  whether it was because they recalled the futility of their former long and irksome search or after witnessing the ease with which the apeman swung along before them and the last burst of speed they realized the utter hopelessness of further pursuit it is difficult to say but as tarzan reached the woods that began at the base of the foothills which skirted the barrier cliffs they turned their faces once more toward opar  just within the forests edge where he could yet watch the cliff tops tarzan laid his burden upon the grass and going to the nearby rivulet brought water with which he bathed her face and hands but even this did not revive her and greatly worried he gathered the girl into his strong arms once more and hurried on toward the west  late in the afternoon jane porter regained consciousness  she did not open her eyes at onceshe was trying to recall the scenes that she had last witnessed  ah she remembered now  the altar the terrible priestess the descending knife  she gave a little shudder for she thought that either this was death or that the knife had buried itself in her heart and she was experiencing the brief delirium preceding death  and when finally she mustered courage to open her eyes the sight that met them confirmed her fears for she saw that she was being borne through a leafy paradise in the arms of her dead love  if this be death she murmured thank god that i am dead  you spoke jane cried tarzan  you are regaining consciousness  yes tarzan of the apes she replied and for the first time in months a smile of peace and happiness lighted her face  thank god cried the apeman coming to the ground in a little grassy clearing beside the stream  i was in time after all  in time  what do you mean she questioned  in time to save you from death upon the altar dear he replied  do you not remember save me from death she asked in a puzzled tone are we not both dead my tarzan  he had placed her upon the grass by now her back resting against the stem of a huge tree  at her question he stepped back where he could the better see her face  dead he repeated and then he laughed  you are not jane and if you will return to the city of opar and ask them who dwell there they will tell you that i was not dead a few short hours ago  no dear we are both very much alive  but both hazel and monsieur thuran told me that you had fallen into the ocean many miles from land she urged as though trying to convince him that he must indeed be dead  they said that there was no question but that it must have been you and less that you could have survived or been picked up  how can i convince you that i am no spirit he asked with a laugh it was i whom the delightful monsieur thuran pushed overboard but i did not drowni will tell you all about it after a whileand here i am very much the same wild man you first knew jane porter  the girl rose slowly to her feet and came toward him  i cannot even yet believe it she murmured  it cannot be that such happiness can be true after all the hideous things that i have passed through these awful months since the lady alice went down  she came close to him and laid a hand soft and trembling upon his arm  it must be that i am dreaming and that i shall awaken in a moment to see that awful knife descending toward my heartkiss me dear just once before i lose my dream forever  tarzan of the apes needed no second invitation  he took the girl he loved in his strong arms and kissed her not once but a hundred times until she lay there panting for breath yet when he stopped she put her arms about his neck and drew his lips down to hers once more  am i alive and a reality or am i but a dream he asked  if you are not alive my man she answered i pray that i may die thus before i awaken to the terrible realities of my last waking moments  for a while both were silentgazing into each others eyes as though each still questioned the reality of the wonderful happiness that had come to them  the past with all its hideous disappointments and horrors was forgottenthe future did not belong to them but the presentah it was theirs none could take it from them  it was the girl who first broke the sweet silence  where are we going dear she asked  what are we going to do  where would you like best to go he asked  what would you like best to do  to go where you go my man to do whatever seems best to you she answered  but clayton he asked  for a moment he had forgotten that there existed upon the earth other than they two  we have forgotten your husband  i am not married tarzan of the apes she cried  nor am i longer promised in marriage  the day before those awful creatures captured me i spoke to mr clayton of my love for you and he understood then that i could not keep the wicked promise that i had made  it was after we had been miraculously saved from an attacking lion  she paused suddenly and looked up at him a questioning light in her eyes tarzan of the apes she cried it was you who did that thing  it could have been no other  he dropped his eyes for he was ashamed  how could you have gone away and left me she cried reproachfully  dont jane he pleaded  please dont  you cannot know how i have suffered since for the cruelty of that act or how i suffered then first in jealous rage and then in bitter resentment against the fate that i had not deserved  i went back to the apes after that jane intending never again to see a human being  he told her then of his life since he had returned to the jungleof how he had dropped like a plummet from a civilized parisian to a savage waziri warrior and from there back to the brute that he had been raised  she asked him many questions and at last fearfully of the things that monsieur thuran had told herof the woman in paris  he narrated every detail of his civilized life to her omitting nothing for he felt no shame since his heart always had been true to her  when he had finished he sat looking at her as though waiting for her judgment and his sentence  i knew that he was not speaking the truth she said  oh what a horrible creature he is  you are not angry with me then he asked  and her reply though apparently most irrelevant was truly feminine  is olga de coude very beautiful she asked  and tarzan laughed and kissed her again  not onetenth so beautiful as you dear he said  she gave a contented little sigh and let her head rest against his shoulder  he knew that he was forgiven  that night tarzan built a snug little bower high among the swaying branches of a giant tree and there the tired girl slept while in a crotch beneath her the apeman curled ready even in sleep to protect her  it took them many days to make the long journey to the coast  where the way was easy they walked hand in hand beneath the arching boughs of the mighty forest as might in a fargone past have walked their primeval forbears  when the underbrush was tangled he took her in his great arms and bore her lightly through the trees and the days were all too short for they were very happy  had it not been for their anxiety to reach and succor clayton they would have drawn out the sweet pleasure of that wonderful journey indefinitely  on the last day before they reached the coast tarzan caught the scent of men ahead of themthe scent of black men  he told the girl and cautioned her to maintain silence  there are few friends in the jungle he remarked dryly  in half an hour they came stealthily upon a small party of black warriors filing toward the west  as tarzan saw them he gave a cry of delightit was a band of his own waziri  busuli was there and others who had accompanied him to opar  at sight of him they danced and cried out in exuberant joy  for weeks they had been searching for him they told him  the blacks exhibited considerable wonderment at the presence of the white girl with him and when they found that she was to be his woman they vied with one another to do her honor  with the happy waziri laughing and dancing about them they came to the rude shelter by the shore  there was no sign of life and no response to their calls  tarzan clambered quickly to the interior of the little tree hut only to emerge a moment later with an empty tin  throwing it down to busuli he told him to fetch water and then he beckoned jane porter to come up  together they leaned over the emaciated thing that once had been an english nobleman  tears came to the girls eyes as she saw the poor sunken cheeks and hollow eyes and the lines of suffering upon the once young and handsome face  he still lives said tarzan  we will do all that can be done for him but i fear that we are too late  when busuli had brought the water tarzan forced a few drops between the cracked and swollen lips  he wetted the hot forehead and bathed the pitiful limbs  presently clayton opened his eyes  a faint shadowy smile lighted his countenance as he saw the girl leaning over him  at sight of tarzan the expression changed to one of wonderment  its all right old fellow said the apeman  weve found you in time  everything will be all right now and well have you on your feet again before you know it  the englishman shook his head weakly  its too late he whispered but its just as well  id rather die  where is monsieur thuran asked the girl  he left me after the fever got bad  he is a devil  when i begged for the water that i was too weak to get he drank before me threw the rest out and laughed in my face at the thought of it the man was suddenly animated by a spark of vitality  he raised himself upon one elbow yes he almost shouted i will live  i will live long enough to find and kill that beast  but the brief effort left him weaker than before and he sank back again upon the rotting grasses that with his old ulster had been the bed of jane porter  dont worry about thuran said tarzan of the apes laying a reassuring hand on claytons forehead  he belongs to me and i shall get him in the end never fear  for a long time clayton lay very still  several times tarzan had to put his ear quite close to the sunken chest to catch the faint beating of the wornout heart  toward evening he aroused again for a brief moment  jane he whispered  the girl bent her head closer to catch the faint message  i have wronged youand him he nodded weakly toward the apeman  i loved you soit is a poor excuse to offer for injuring you but i could not bear to think of giving you up  i do not ask your forgiveness  i only wish to do now the thing i should have done over a year ago he fumbled in the pocket of the ulster beneath him for something that he had discovered there while he lay between the paroxysms of fever  presently he found ita crumpled bit of yellow paper  he handed it to the girl and as she took it his arm fell limply across his chest his head dropped back and with a little gasp he stiffened and was still  then tarzan of the apes drew a fold of the ulster across the upturned face  for a moment they remained kneeling there the girls lips moving in silent prayer and as they rose and stood on either side of the now peaceful form tears came to the apemans eyes for through the anguish that his own heart had suffered he had learned compassion for the suffering of others  through her own tears the girl read the message upon the bit of faded yellow paper and as she read her eyes went very wide  twice she read those startling words before she could fully comprehend their meaning   finger prints prove you greystoke  congratulations                                        darnot   she handed the paper to tarzan  and he has known it all this time she said and did not tell you  i knew it first jane replied the man  i did not know that he knew it at all  i must have dropped this message that night in the waiting room  it was there that i received it  and afterward you told us that your mother was a sheape and that you had never known your father she asked incredulously  the title and the estates meant nothing to me without you dear he replied  and if i had taken them away from him i should have been robbing the woman i lovedont you understand jane  it was as though he attempted to excuse a fault  she extended her arms toward him across the body of the dead man and took his hands in hers  and i would have thrown away a love like that she said     chapter 26  the passing of the apeman   the next morning they set out upon the short journey to tarzans cabin four waziri bore the body of the dead englishman  it had been the apemans suggestion that clayton be buried beside the former lord greystoke near the edge of the jungle against the cabin that the older man had built  jane porter was glad that it was to be so and in her heart of hearts she wondered at the marvelous fineness of character of this wondrous man who though raised by brutes and among brutes had the true chivalry and tenderness which only associates with the refinements of the highest civilization  they had proceeded some three miles of the five that had separated them from tarzans own beach when the waziri who were ahead stopped suddenly pointing in amazement at a strange figure approaching them along the beach  it was a man with a shiny silk hat who walked slowly with bent head and hands clasped behind him underneath the tails of his long black coat  at sight of him jane porter uttered a little cry of surprise and joy and ran quickly ahead to meet him  at the sound of her voice the old man looked up and when he saw who it was confronting him he too cried out in relief and happiness  as professor archimedes q porter folded his daughter in his arms tears streamed down his seamed old face and it was several minutes before he could control himself sufficiently to speak  when a moment later he recognized tarzan it was with difficulty that they could convince him that his sorrow had not unbalanced his mind for with the other members of the party he had been so thoroughly convinced that the apeman was dead it was a problem to reconcile the conviction with the very lifelike appearance of janes forest god the old man was deeply touched at the news of claytons death  i cannot understand it he said  monsieur thuran assured us that clayton passed away many days ago  thuran is with you asked tarzan  yes he but recently found us and led us to your cabin  we were camped but a short distance north of it  bless me but he will be delighted to see you both  and surprised commented tarzan  a short time later the strange party came to the clearing in which stood the apemans cabin  it was filled with people coming and going and almost the first whom tarzan saw was darnot  paul he cried  in the name of sanity what are you doing here  or are we all insane  it was quickly explained however as were many other seemingly strange things  darnots ship had been cruising along the coast on patrol duty when at the lieutenants suggestion they had anchored off the little landlocked harbor to have another look at the cabin and the jungle in which many of the officers and men had taken part in exciting adventures two years before  on landing they had found lord tenningtons party and arrangements were being made to take them all on board the following morning and carry them back to civilization  hazel strong and her mother esmeralda and mr samuel t philander were almost overcome by happiness at jane porters safe return  her escape seemed to them little short of miraculous and it was the consensus of opinion that it could have been achieved by no other man than tarzan of the apes  they loaded the uncomfortable apeman with eulogies and attentions until he wished himself back in the amphitheater of the apes  all were interested in his savage waziri and many were the gifts the black men received from these friends of their king but when they learned that he might sail away from them upon the great canoe that lay at anchor a mile off shore they became very sad  as yet the newcomers had seen nothing of lord tennington and monsieur thuran  they had gone out for fresh meat early in the day and had not yet returned  how surprised this man whose name you say is rokoff will be to see you said jane porter to tarzan  his surprise will be shortlived replied the apeman grimly and there was that in his tone that made her look up into his face in alarm  what she read there evidently confirmed her fears for she put her hand upon his arm and pleaded with him to leave the russian to the laws of france  in the heart of the jungle dear she said with no other form of right or justice to appeal to other than your own mighty muscles you would be warranted in executing upon this man the sentence he deserves but with the strong arm of a civilized government at your disposal it would be murder to kill him now  even your friends would have to submit to your arrest or if you resisted it would plunge us all into misery and unhappiness again  i cannot bear to lose you again my tarzan  promise me that you will but turn him over to captain dufranne and let the law take its coursethe beast is not worth risking our happiness for  he saw the wisdom of her appeal and promised  a half hour later rokoff and tennington emerged from the jungle  they were walking side by side  tennington was the first to note the presence of strangers in the camp  he saw the black warriors palavering with the sailors from the cruiser and then he saw a lithe brown giant talking with lieutenant darnot and captain dufranne  who is that i wonder said tennington to rokoff and as the russian raised his eyes and met those of the apeman full upon him he staggered and went white  sapristi he cried and before tennington realized what he intended he had thrown his gun to his shoulder and aiming pointblank at tarzan pulled the trigger  but the englishman was close to himso close that his hand reached the leveled barrel a fraction of a second before the hammer fell upon the cartridge and the bullet that was intended for tarzans heart whirred harmlessly above his head  before the russian could fire again the apeman was upon him and had wrested the firearm from his grasp  captain dufranne lieutenant darnot and a dozen sailors had rushed up at the sound of the shot and now tarzan turned the russian over to them without a word  he had explained the matter to the french commander before rokoff arrived and the officer gave immediate orders to place the russian in irons and confine him on board the cruiser  just before the guard escorted the prisoner into the small boat that was to transport him to his temporary prison tarzan asked permission to search him and to his delight found the stolen papers concealed upon his person  the shot had brought jane porter and the others from the cabin and a moment after the excitement had died down she greeted the surprised lord tennington  tarzan joined them after he had taken the papers from rokoff and as he approached jane porter introduced him to tennington  john clayton lord greystoke my lord she said  the englishman looked his astonishment in spite of his most herculean efforts to appear courteous and it required many repetitions of the strange story of the apeman as told by himself jane porter and lieutenant darnot to convince lord tennington that they were not all quite mad  at sunset they buried william cecil clayton beside the jungle graves of his uncle and his aunt the former lord and lady greystoke  and it was at tarzans request that three volleys were fired over the last resting place of a brave man who met his death bravely  professor porter who in his younger days had been ordained a minister conducted the simple services for the dead  about the grave with bowed heads stood as strange a company of mourners as the sun ever looked down upon  there were french officers and sailors two english lords americans and a score of savage african braves  following the funeral tarzan asked captain dufranne to delay the sailing of the cruiser a couple of days while he went inland a few miles to fetch his belongings and the officer gladly granted the favor  late the next afternoon tarzan and his waziri returned with the first load of belongings and when the party saw the ancient ingots of virgin gold they swarmed upon the apeman with a thousand questions but he was smilingly obdurate to their appealshe declined to give them the slightest clew as to the source of his immense treasure there are a thousand that i left behind he explained for every one that i brought away and when these are spent i may wish to return for more  the next day he returned to camp with the balance of his ingots and when they were stored on board the cruiser captain dufranne said he felt like the commander of an oldtime spanish galleon returning from the treasure cities of the aztecs  i dont know what minute my crew will cut my throat and take over the ship he added  the next morning as they were preparing to embark upon the cruiser tarzan ventured a suggestion to jane porter  wild beasts are supposed to be devoid of sentiment he said but nevertheless i should like to be married in the cabin where i was born beside the graves of my mother and my father and surrounded by the savage jungle that always has been my home  would it be quite regular dear she asked  for if it would i know of no other place in which i should rather be married to my forest god than beneath the shade of his primeval forest  and when they spoke of it to the others they were assured that it would be quite regular and a most splendid termination of a remarkable romance  so the entire party assembled within the little cabin and about the door to witness the second ceremony that professor porter was to solemnize within three days  darnot was to be best man and hazel strong bridesmaid until tennington upset all the arrangements by another of his marvelous ideas  if mrs strong is agreeable he said taking the bridesmaids hand in his hazel and i think it would be ripping to make it a double wedding  the next day they sailed and as the cruiser steamed slowly out to sea a tall man immaculate in white flannel and a graceful girl leaned against her rail to watch the receding shore line upon which danced twenty naked black warriors of the waziri waving their war spears above their savage heads and shouting farewells to their departing king  i should hate to think that i am looking upon the jungle for the last time dear he said were it not that i know that i am going to a new world of happiness with you forever and bending down tarzan of the apes kissed his mate upon her lips
