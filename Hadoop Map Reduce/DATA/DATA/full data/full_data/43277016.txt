fishes lizards and snakes all of which they eat but when they grow up to be big boys and girls they are cruelly cut about with stone knives and frightened with sham bogies all for their good their parents say and i think they would rather go to school if they had their choice and take their chance of being birched and bullied however many boys might think it better fun to begin to learn hunting as soon as they can walk other stories like the sacred milk of koumongoe come from the kaffirs in africa whose dear papas are not so poor as those in australia but have plenty of cattle and milk and good mealies to eat and live in houses like very big beehives and wear clothes of a sort though not very like our own pivi and kabo is a tale from the brown people in the island of new caledonia where

sonstahmasp qamas and almasruhbaksh 3 one day when the king was sitting in his hall of audience his eldest son prince tahmasp came before him and after greeting his father with due respect said o my royal father i am tired of the town if you will give me leave i will take my servants tomorrow and will go into the country and hunt on the hillskirts and when i have taken some game i will come back at eveningprayer time his father consented and sent with him some of his own trusted servants and also hawks and falcons hunting dogs cheetahs and leopards  at the place where the prince intended to hunt he saw a most beautiful deer he ordered that it should not be killed but trapped or captured with a noose the deer looked about for a place where he might escape from the ring of the beaters and spied one unwatched close to the prince himself it bounded high and leaped right over his head got out of the ring and tore like the eastern wind into the waste the prince put spurs to his horse and pursued it and was soon lost to the sight of his followers until the worldlighting sun stood above his head in the zenith he did not take his eyes off the deer suddenly it disappeared behind some rising ground and with all his search he could not find any further trace of it he was now drenched in sweat and he breathed with pain and his horses tongue hung from its mouth with thirst he dismounted and toiled on with bridle on arm praying and casting himself on the mercy of heaven then his horse fell and surrendered its life to god on and on he went across the sandy waste weeping and with burning breast till at length a hill rose into sight he mustered his strength and climbed to the top and there he found a giant tree whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth and whose crest touched the very heaven its branches had put forth a glory of leaves and there were grass and a spring underneath it and flowers of many colours  gladdened by this sight he dragged himself to the waters edge drank his fill and returned thanks for his deliverance from thirst  he looked about him and to his amazement saw close by a royal seat while he was pondering what could have brought this into the merciless desert a man drew near who was dressed like a faqir and had bare head and feet but walked with the free carriage of a person of rank his face was kind and wise and thoughtful and he came on and spoke to the prince  o good youth how did you come here who are you where do you come from  the prince told everything just as it had happened to him and then respectfully added i have made known my own circumstances to you and now i venture to beg you to tell me your own who are you how did you come to make your dwelling in this wilderness  to this the faqir replied o youth it would be best for you to have nothing to do with me and to know nothing of my fortunes for my story is fit neither for telling nor for hearing the prince however pleaded so hard to be told that at last there was nothing to be done but to let him hear  learn and know o young man that i am king janangir 4 of babylon and that once i had army and servants family and treasure untold wealth and belongings the most high god gave me seven sons who grew up well versed in all princely arts my eldest son heard from travellers that in turkistan on the chinese frontier there is a king named quimus the son of timus and that he has an only child a daughter named mihrafruz 5 who under all the azure heaven is unrivalled for beauty princes come from all quarters to ask her hand and on one and all she imposes a condition she says to them i know a riddle and i will marry anyone who answers it and will bestow on him all my possessions but if a suitor cannot answer my question i cut off his head and hang it on the battlements of the citadel the riddle she asks is what did the rose do to the cypress  now when my son heard this tale he fell in love with that unseen girl and he came to me lamenting and bewailing himself nothing that i could say had the slightest effect on him i said oh my son if there must be fruit of this fancy of yours i will lead forth a great army against king quimus if he will give you his daughter freely well and good and if not i will ravage his kingdom and bring her away by force this plan did not please him he said it is not right to lay a kingdom waste and to destroy a palace so that i may attain my desire i will go alone i will answer the riddle and win her in this way at last out of pity for him i let him go he reached the city of king quimus he was asked the riddle and could not give the true answer and his head was cut off and hung upon the battlements then i mourned him in black raiment for forty days  after this another and another of my sons were seized by the same desire and in the end all my seven sons went and all were killed in grief for their death i have abandoned my throne and i abide here in this desert withholding my hand from all state business and wearing myself away in sorrow  prince tahmasp listened to this tale and then the arrow of love for that unseen girl struck his heart also just at this moment of his illfate his people came up and gathered round him like moths round a light they brought him a horse fleet as the breeze of the dawn he set his willing foot in the stirrup of safety and rode off as the days went by the thorn of love rankled in his heart and he became the very example of lovers and grew faint and feeble at last his confidants searched his heart and lifted the veil from the face of his love and then set the matter before his father king samanlalposh your son prince tahmasp loves distractedly the princess mihrafruz daughter of king quimus son of timus then they told the king all about her and her doings a mist of sadness clouded the kings mind and he said to his son if this thing is so i will in the first place send a courier with friendly letters to king quimus and will ask the hand of his daughter for you i will send an abundance of gifts and a string of camels laden with flashing stones and rubies of badakhsham in this way i will bring her and her suite and i will give her to you to be your solace but if king quimus is unwilling to give her to you i will pour a whirlwind of soldiers upon him and i will bring to you in this way that most consequential of girls but the prince said that this plan would not be right and that he would go himself and would answer the riddle then the kings wise men said this is a very weighty matter it would be best to allow the prince to set out accompanied by some persons in whom you have confidence maybe he will repent and come back so king saman ordered all preparations for the journey to be made and then prince tahmasp took his leave and set out accompanied by some of the courtiers and taking with him a string of twohumped and raveneyed camels laden with jewels and gold and costly stuffs  by stage after stage and after many days journeying he arrived at the city of king quimus what did he see a towering citadel whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth and whose battlements touched the blue heaven he saw hanging from its battlements many heads but it had not the least effect upon him that these were heads of men of rank he listened to no advice about laying aside his fancy but rode up to the gate and on into the heart of the city the place was so splendid that the eyes of the ages have never seen its like and there in an open square he found a tent of crimson satin set up and beneath it two jewelled drums with jewelled sticks these drums were put there so that the suitors of the princess might announce their arrival by beating on them after which some one would come and take them to the kings presence the sight of the drums stirred the fire of prince tahmasps love he dismounted and moved towards them but his companions hurried after and begged him first to let them go and announce him to the king and said that then when they had put their possessions in a place of security they would enter into the all important matter of the princess the prince however replied that he was there for one thing only that his first duty was to beat the drums and announce himself as a suitor when he would be taken as such to the king who would then give him proper lodgment so he struck upon the drums and at once summoned an officer who took him to king quimus  when the king saw how very young the prince looked and that he was still drinking of the fountain of wonder he said o youth leave aside this fancy which my daughter has conceived in the pride of her beauty no one can answer er her riddle and she has done to death many men who had had no pleasure in life nor tasted its charms god forbid that your spring also should be ravaged by the autumn winds of martyrdom all his urgency however had no effect in making the prince withdraw at length it was settled between them that three days should be given to pleasant hospitality and that then should follow what had to be said and done then the prince went to his own quarters and was treated as became his station  king quimus now sent for his daughter and for her mother gulrukh 6 and talked to them he said to mibrafruz listen to me you cruel flirt why do you persist in this folly now there has come to ask your hand a prince of the east so handsome that the very sun grows modest before the splendour of his face he is rich and he has brought gold and jewels all for you if you will marry him a better husband you will not find  but all the arguments of father and mother were wasted for her only answer was o my father i have sworn to myself that i will not marry even if a thousand years go by unless someone answers my riddle and that i will give myself to that man only who does answer it  the three days passed then the riddle was asked what did the rose do to the cypress the prince had an eloquent tongue which could split a hair and without hesitation he replied to her with a verse only the omnipotent has knowledge of secrets if any man says i know do not believe him  then a servant fetched in the polluted blueeyed headsman who asked whose sun of life has come near its setting took the prince by the arm placed him upon the cloth of execution and then all merciless and stony hearted cut his head from his body and hung it on the battlements  the news of the death of prince tahmasp plunged his father into despair and stupefaction he mourned for him in black raiment for forty days and then a few days later his second son prince qamas extracted from him leave to go too and he also was put to death one son only now remained the brave eloquent happynatured prince almasruhbakhsh one day when his father sat brooding over his lost children almas came before him and said o father mine the daughter of king quimus has done my two brothers to death i wish to avenge them upon her these words brought his father to tears o light of your father he cried i have no one left but you and now you ask me to let you go to your death  dear father pleaded the prince until i have lowered the pride of that beauty and have set her here before you i cannot settle down or indeed sit down off my feet  in the end he too got leave to go but he went a without a following and alone like his brothers he made the long journey to the city of quimus the son of timus like them he saw the citadel but he saw there the heads of tahmasp and qamas he went about in the city saw the tent and the drums and then went out again to a village not far off here he found out a very old man who had a wife 120 years old or rather more their lives were coming to their end but they had never beheld face of child of their own they were glad when the prince came to their house and they dealt with him as with a son he put all his belongings into their charge and fastened his horse in their outhouse then he asked them not to speak of him to anyone and to keep his affairs secret he exchanged his royal dress for another and next morning just as the sun looked forth from its eastern oratory he went again into the city he turned over in his mind without ceasing how he was to find out the meaning of the riddle and to give them a right answer and who could help him and how to avenge his brothers he wandered about the city but heard nothing of service for there was no one in all that land who understood the riddle of princess mihrafruz  one day he thought he would go to her own palace and see if he could learn anything there so he went out to her gardenhouse it was a very splendid place with a wonderful gateway and walls like alexanders ramparts many gatekeepers were on guard and there was no chance of passing them his heart was full of bitterness but he said to himself all will be well it is here i shall get what i want he went round outside the garden wall hoping to find a gap and he made supplication in the court of supplications and prayed o holder of the hand of the helpless show me my way  while he prayed he bethought himself that he could get into the garden with a stream of inflowing water he looked carefully round fearing to be seen stripped slid into the stream and was carried within the great walls there he hid himself till his loin cloth was dry the garden was a very eden with running water amongst its lawns with flowers and the lament of doves and the jugjug of nightingales it was a place to steal the senses from the brain and he wandered about and saw the house but there seemed to be no one there in the forecourt was a royal seat of polished jasper and in the middle of the platform was a basin of purest water that flashed like a mirror he pleased himself with these sights for a while and then went back to the garden and hid himself from the gardeners and passed the night next morning he put on the appearance of a madman and wandered about till he came to a lawn where several pertfaced girls were amusing themselves on a throne jewelled and overspread with silken stuffs sat a girl the splendour of whose beauty lighted up the place and whose ambergris and attar perfumed the whole air that must be mihrafruz he thought she is indeed lovely just then one of the attendants came to the waters edge to fill a cup and though the prince was in hiding his face was reflected in the water when she saw this image she was frightened and let her cup fall into the stream and thought is it an angel or a peri or a man fear and trembling took hold of her and she screamed as women scream then some of the other girls came and took her to the princess who asked what is the matter pretty one  o princess i went for water and i saw an image and i was afraid so another girl went to the water and saw the same thing and came back with the same story the princess wished to see for herself she rose and paced to the spot with the march of a prancing peacock when she saw the image she said to her nurse find out who is reflected in the water and where he lives her words reached the princes ear he lifted up his head she saw him and beheld beauty such as she had never seen before she lost a hundred hearts to him and signed to her nurse to bring him to her presence the prince let himself be persuaded to go with the nurse but when the princess questioned him as to who he was and how he had got into her garden he behaved like a man out of his mindsometimes smiling sometimes crying and saying i am hungryor words misplaced and random civil mixed with the rude  what a pity said the princess he is mad as she liked him she said he is my madman let no one hurt him she took him to her house and told him not to go away for that she would provide for all his wants the prince thought it would be excellent if here in her very house i could get the answer to her riddle but i must be silent on pain of death  now in the princesss household there was a girl called dilaram 7 she it was who had first seen the image of the prince she came to love him very much and she spent day and night thinking how she could make her affection known to him one day she escaped from the princesss notice and went to the prince and laid her head on his feet and said heaven has bestowed on you beauty and charm tell me your secret who are you and how did you come here i love you very much and if you would like to leave this place i will go with you i have wealth equal to the treasure of the miserly qarun but the prince only made answer like a man distraught and told her nothing he said to himself god forbid that the veil should be taken in vain from my secret that would indeed disgrace me so with streaming eyes and burning breast dilaram arose and went to her house and lamented and fretted  now whenever the princess commanded the princes attendance dilaram of all the girls paid him attention and waited on him best the princess noticed this and said o dilaram you must take my madman into your charge and give him whatever he wants this was the very thing dilaram had prayed for a little later she took the prince into a private place and she made him take an oath of secrecy and she herself took one and swore by heaven i will not tell your secret tell me all about yourself so that i may help you to get what you want the prince now recognised in her words the perfume of true love and he made compact with her o lovely girl i want to know what the rose did to the cypress your mistress cuts off mens heads because of this riddle what is at the bottom of it and why does she do it then dilaram answered if you will promise to marry me and to keep me always amongst those you favour i will tell you all i know and i will keep watch about the riddle  o lovely girl rejoined he if i accomplish my purpose so that i need no longer strive for it i will keep my compact with you when i have this woman in my power and have avenged my brothers i will make you my solace  o wealth of my life and source of my joy responded dilaram i do not know what the rose did to the cypress but so much i know that the person who told mihrafruz about it is a negro whom she hides under her throne he fled here from waq of the caucasusit is there you must make inquiry there is no other way of getting at the truthon hearing these words the prince said to his heart o my heart your task will yet wear away much of your life  he fell into long and far thought and dilaram looked at him and said o my life and my soul do not be sad if you would like this woman killed i will put poison into her cup so that she will never lift her head from her drugged sleep again  o dilaram such a vengeance is not manly i shall not rest till i have gone to waq of the caucasus and have cleared up the matter then they repeated the agreement about their marriage and bade one another goodbye  the prince now went back to the village and told the old man that he was setting out on a long journey and begged him not to be anxious and to keep safe the goods which had been entrusted to him  the prince had not the least knowledge of the way to waq of the caucasus and was cast down by the sense of his helplessness he was walking along by his horses side when there appeared before him an old man of serene countenance dressed in green and carrying a staff who resembled khizr 8 the prince thanked heaven laid the hands of reverence on his breast and salaamed the old man returned the greeting graciously and asked how fare you whither are you bound you look like a traveller  o revered saint i am in this difficulty i do not know the way to waq of the caucasus the old man of good counsel looked at the young prince and said turn back from this dangerous undertaking do not go choose some other task if you had a hundred lives you would not bring one out safe from this journey but his words had no effect on the princes resolve what object have you the old man asked in thus consuming your life  i have an important piece of business to do and only this journey makes it possible i must go i pray you ill gods name tell me the way  when the saint saw that the prince was not to be moved he said learn and know o youth that waq of qaf is in the caucasus and is a dependency of it in it there are jins demons and peris you must go on along this road till it forks into three take neither the right hand nor the left but the middle path follow this for a day and a night then you will come to a column on which is a marble slab inscribed with cufic characters do what is written there beware of disobedience then he gave his good wishes for the journey and his blessing and the prince kissed his feet said goodbye and with thanks to the causer of causes took the road  after a day and a night he saw the column rise in silent beauty to the heavens everything was as the wise old man had said it would be and the prince who was skilled in all tongues read the following cufic inscription o travellers be it known to you that this column has been set up with its tablet to give true directions about these roads if a man would pass his life in ease and pleasantness let him take the righthand path if he take the left he will have some trouble but he will reach his goal without much delay woe to him who chooses the middle path if he had a thousand lives he would not save one it is very hazardous it leads to the caucasus and is an endless road beware of it  the prince read and bared his head and lifted his hands in supplication to him who has no needs and prayed o friend of the traveller i thy servant come to thee for succour my purpose lies in the land of qaf and my road is full of peril lead me by it then he took a handful of earth and cast it on his collar and said o earth be thou my grave and o vest tee thou my windingsheet then he took the middle road and went along it day after day with many a silent prayer till he saw trees rise from the weary waste of sand they grew in a garden and he went up to the gate and found it a slab of beautifully worked marble and that near it there lay sleeping with his head on a stone a negro whose face was so black that it made darkness round him his upper lip arched like an eyebrow curved upwards to his nostrils and his lower hung down like a camels four millstones formed his shield and on a boxtree close by hung his giant sword his loincloth was fashioned of twelve skins of beasts and was bound round his waist by a chain of which each link was as big as an elephants thigh  the prince approached and tied up his horse near the negros head then he let fall the bismillah from his lips entered the garden and walked through it till he came to the private part delighting in the great trees the lovely verdure and the flowery borders in the inner garden there were very many deer these signed to him with eye and foot to go back for that this was enchanted ground but he did not understand them and thought their pretty gestures were a welcome after a while he reached a palace which had a porch more splendid than caesars and was built of gold and silver bricks in its midst was a high seat overlaid with fine carpets and into it opened eight doors each having opposite to it a marble basin  banishing care prince almas walked on through the garden when suddenly a window opened and a girl who was lovely enough to make the moon writhe with jealousy put out her head she lost her heart to the good looks of the prince and sent her nurse to fetch him so that she might learn where he came from and how he had got into her private garden where even lions and wolves did not venture the nurse went and was struck with amazement at the sunlike radiance of his face she salaamed and said o youth welcome the lady of the garden calls you come he went with her and into a palace which was like a house in paradise and saw seated on the royal carpets of the throne a girl whose brilliance shamed the shining sun he salaamed she rose took him by the hand and placed him near her o young man who are you where do you come from how did you get into this garden he told her his story from beginning to end and lady latifa 9 replied this is folly it will make you a vagabond of the earth and lead you to destruction come cease such talk no one can go to the caucasus stay with me and be thankful for here is a throne which you can share with me and in my society you can enjoy my wealth i will do whatever you wish i will bring here king qulmus and his daughter and you can deal with them as you will  o lady latifa he said i have made a compact with heaven not to sit down off my feet till i have been to waq of qaf and have cleared up this matter and have taken mihrafruz from her father as brave men take and have put her in prison when i have done all this i will come back to you in state and with a great following and i will marry you according to the law lady latifa argued and urged her wishes but in vain the prince was not to be moved then she called to the cupbearers for new wine for she thought that when his head was hot with it he might consent to stay the pure clear wine was brought she filled a cup and gave to him he said o most enchanting sweetheart it is the rule for the host to drink first and then the guest so to make him lose his head she drained the cup then filled it again and gave him he drank it off and she took a lute from one of the singers and played upon it with skill which witched away the sense of all who heard but it was all in vain three days passed in such festivities and on the fourth the prince said o joy of my eyes i beg now that you will bid me farewell for my way is long and the fire of your love darts flame into the harvest of my heart by heavens grace i may accomplish my purpose and if so i will come back to you  now she saw that she could not in any way change his resolve she told her nurse to bring a certain casket which contained she said something exhilarating which would help the prince on his journey the box was brought and she divided off a portion of what was within and gave it to the prince to eat then and while he was all unaware she put forth her hand to a stick fashioned like a snake she said some words over it and struck him so sharply on the shoulder that he cried out then he made a pirouette and found that he was a deer  when he knew what had been done to him he thought all the threads of affliction are gathered together i have lost my last chance he tried to escape but the magician sent for her goldsmith who coming overlaid the deerhorns with gold and jewels the kerchief which that day she had had in her hand was then tied round its neck and this freed it from her attentions  the princedeer now bounded into the garden and at once sought some way of escape it found none and it joined the other deer which soon made it their leader now although the prince had been transformed into the form of a deer he kept his mans heart and mind he said to himself thank heaven that the lady latifa has changed me into this shape for at least deer are beautiful he remained for some time living as a deer amongst the rest but at length resolved that an end to such a life must be put ill some way he looked again for some place by which he could get out of the magic garden following round the wall he reached a lower part he remembered the divine names and flung himself over saying whatever happens is by the will of god when he looked about he found that he was in the very same place he had jumped from there was the palace there the garden and the deer eight times he leaped over the wall and eight times found himself where he had started from but after the ninth leap there was a change there was a palace and there was a garden but the deer were gone  presently a girl of such moonlike beauty opened a window that the prince lost to her a hundred hearts she was delighted with the beautiful deer and cried to her nurse catch it if you will i will give you this necklace every pearl of which is worth a kingdom the nurse coveted the pearls but as she was three hundred years old she did not know how she could catch a deer however she went down into the garden and held out some grass but when she went near the creature ran away the girl watched with great excitement from the palace window and called o nurse if you dont catch it i will kill you i am killing myself shouted back the old woman the girl saw that nurse tottering along and went down to help marching with the gait of a prancing peacock when she saw the gilded horns and the kerchief she said it must be accustomed to the hand and be some royal pet the prince had it in mind that this might be another magician who could give him some other shape but still it seemed best to allow himself to be caught so he played about the girl and let her catch him by the neck a leash was brought fruits were given and it was caressed with delight it was taken to the palace and tied at the foot of the lady jamilas raised seat but she ordered a longer cord to be brought so that it might be able to jump up beside her  when the nurse went to fix the cord she saw tears falling from its eyes and that it was dejected and sorrowful o lady jamila this is a wonderful deer it is crying i never saw a deer cry before jamila darted down like a flash of lightning and saw that it was so it rubbed its head on her feet and then shook it so sadly that the girl cried for sympathy she patted it and said why are you sad my heart why do you cry my soul is it because i have caught you i love you better than my own life but spite of her comforting it cried the more then jamila said unless i am mistaken this is the work of my wicked sister latifa who by magic art turns servants of god into beasts of the field at these words the deer uttered sounds and laid its head on her feet then jamila was sure it was a man and said be comforted i will restore you to your own shape she bathed herself and ordered the deer to be bathed put on clean raiment called for a box which stood in an alcove opened it and gave a portion of what was in it to the deer to eat then she slipped her hand under her carpet and produced a stick to which she said something she struck the deer hard it pirouetted and became prince almas  the broidered kerchief and the jewels lay upon the ground the prince prostrated himself in thanks to heaven and jamila and said o delicious person o chinese venus how shall i excuse myself for giving you so much trouble with what words can i thank you then she called for a clotheswallet and chose out a royal dress of honour her attendants dressed him in it and brought him again before the tenderhearted lady she turned to him a hundred hearts took his hand and seated him beside her and said o youth tell me truly who you are and where you come from and how you fell into the power of my sister  even when he was a deer the prince had much admired jamila now he thought her a thousand times more lovely than before he judged that in truth alone was safety and so told her his whole story then she asked o prince almasruhbakhsh do you still wish so much to make this journey to waq of qaf what hope is there in it the road is dangerous even near here and this is not yet the borderland of the caucasus come give it up it is a great risk and to go is not wise it would be a pity for a man like you to fall into the hands of jins and demons stay with me and i will do whatever you wish  o most delicious person he answered you are very generous and the choice of my life lies in truth in your hands but i beg one favour of you if you love me so do i too love you if you really love me do not forbid me to make this journey but help me as far as you can then it may be that i shall succeed and if i return with my purpose fulfilled i will marry you according to the law and take you to my own country and we will spend the rest of our lives together in pleasure and good companionship help me if you can and give me your counsel  o very stuff of my life replied jamila i will give you things that are not in kings treasuries and which will be of the greatest use to you first there are the bow and arrows of his reverence the prophet salih secondly there is the scorpion of solomon on whom be peace which is a sword such as no king has steel and stone are one to it if you bring it down on a rock it will not be injured and it will cleave whatever you strike thirdly there is the dagger which the sage timus himself made this is most useful and the man who wears it would not bend under seven camels loads what you have to do first is to get to the home of the simurgh 10 and to make friends with him if he favours you he will take you to waq of qaf if not you will never get there for seven seas are on the way and they are such seas that if all the kings of the earth and all their wazirs and all their wise men considered for a thousand years they would not be able to cross them  o most delicious person where is the simurghs home how shall i get there  o new fruit of life you must just do what i tell you and you must use your eyes and your brains for if you dont you will find yourself at the place of the negroes who are a bloodthirsty set and god forbid they should lay hands on your precious person  then she took the bow and quiver of arrows the sword and the dagger out of a box and the prince let fall a bismillah and girt them all on then jamila of the houriface produced two saddlebags of rubyred silk one filled with roasted fowl and little cakes and the other with stones of price next she gave him a horse as swift as the breeze of the morning and she said accept all these things from me ride till you come to a rising ground at no great distance from here where there is a spring it is called the place of gifts and you must stay there one night there you will see many wild beastslions tigers leopards apes and so on before you get there you must capture some game on the long road beyond there dwells a lionking alla if other beasts did not fear him they would ravage the whole country and let no one pass the lion is a red transgressor so when he comes rise and do him reverence take a cloth and rub the dust and earth from his face then set the game you have taken before him well cleansed and lay the hands of respect on your breast when he wishes to eat take your knife and cut pieces of the meat and set them before him with a bow in this way you will enfold that lionking in perfect friendship and he will be most useful to you and you will be safe from molestation by the negroes when you go on from the place of gifts be sure you do not take the righthand road take the left for the other leads by the negro castle which is known as the place of clashing swords and where there are forty negro captains each over three thousand or four thousand more their chief is taramtaq 11 further on than this is the home of the simurgh  having stored these things in the princes memory she said you will see everything happen just as i have said then she escorted him a little way they parted and she went home to mourn his absence  prince almas relying on the causer of causes rode on to the place of gifts and dismounted at the platform everything happened just as jamila had foretold when one or two watches of the night had passed he saw that the open ground around him was full of such stately and splendid animals as he had never seen before byandby they made way for a wonderfully big lion which was eighty yards from nose to tailtip and was a magnificent creature the prince advanced and saluted it it proudly drooped its head and forelocks and paced to the platform seventy or eighty others were with it and now encircled it at a little distance it laid its right paw over its left and the prince took the kerchief jamila had given him for the purpose and rubbed the dust and earth from its face then brought forward the game he had prepared and crossing his hands respectfully on his breast stood waiting before it when it wished for food he cut off pieces of the meat and put them in its mouth the serving lions also came near and the prince would have stayed his hand but the kinglion signed to him to feed them too this he did laying the meat on the platform then the kinglion beckoned the prince to come near and said sleep at ease my guards will watch so surrounded by the lionguard he slept till dawn when the king lion said goodbye and gave him a few of his own hairs and said when you are in any difficulty burn one of these and i will be there then it went off into the jungle  prince almas immediately started he rode till he came to the parting of the ways he remembered quite well that the righthand way was short and dangerous but he bethought himself too that whatever was written on his forehead would happen and took the forbidden road byandby he saw a castle and knew from what jamila had told him that it was the place of clashing swords he would have liked to go back by the way ho had come but courage forbade and he said what has been preordained from eternity will happen to me and went on towards the castle he was thinking of tying his horse to a tree which grew near the gate when a negro came out and spied him ha said the wretch to himself this is good taramtaq has not eaten manmeat for a long time and is craving for some i will take this creature to him he took hold of the princes reins and said dismount manchild come to my master he has wanted to eat manmeat this long time back what nonsense are you saying said the prince and other such words when the negro understood that he was being abused he cried come along i will put you into such a state that the birds of the air will weep for you then the prince drew the scorpion of solomon and struck himstruck him on the leathern belt and shore him through so that the sword came out on the other side he stood upright for a little while muttered some words put out his hand to seize the prince then fell in two and surrendered his life  there was water close at hand and the prince made his ablution and then said o my heart a wonderful task lies upon you a second negro came out of the fort and seeing what had been done went back and told his chief others wished to be doubled and went out and of every one the scorpion of solomon made two then taramtaq sent for a giant negro named chilmaq who in the day of battle was worth three hundred and said to him i shall thank you to fetch me that man  chilmaq went out tall as a tower and bearing a shield of eight millstones and as he walked he shouted ho blunderhead by what right do you come to our country and kill our people come make two of me as the prince was despicable in his eyes he tossed aside his club and rushed to grip him with his hands he caught him by the collar tucked him under his arm and set off with him to taramtaq but the prince drew the dagger of timus and thrust it upwards through the giants armpit for its full length this made chilmaq drop him and try to pick up his club but when he stooped the mighty sword shore him through at the waist  when news of his champions death reached taramtaq he put himself at the head of an army of his negroes and led them forth many fell before the magic sword and the prince laboured on in spite of weakness and fatigue till he was almost worn out in a moment of respite from attack he struck his firesteel and burned a hair of the kinglion and he had just succeeded in this when the negroes charged again and all but took him prisoner suddenly from behind the distant veil of the desert appeared an army of lions led by their king what brings these scourges of heaven here cried the negroes they came roaring up and put fresh life into the prince he fought on and when he struck on a belt the wearer fell in two and when on a head he cleft to the waist then the ten thousand mighty lions joined the fray and tore in pieces man and horse  taramtaq was left alone he would have retired into his fort but the prince shouted whither away accursed one are you fleeing before me at these defiant words the chief shouted back welcome man come here and i will soften you to wax beneath my club then he hurled his club at the princes head but it fell harmless because the prince had quickly spurred his horse forward the chief believing he had hit him was looking down for him when all at once he came up behind and cleft him to the waist and sent him straight to hell  the kinglion greatly praised the dashing courage of prince almas they went together into the castle of clashing swords and found it adorned and fitted in princely fashion in it was a daughter of taram taq still a child she sent a message to prince almas saying o king of the world choose this slave to be your handmaid keep her with you where you go there she will go he sent for her and she kissed his feet and received the mussulman faith at his hands he told her he was going a long journey on important business and that when he came back he would take her and her possessions to his own country but that for the present she must stay in the castle then he made over the fort and all that was in it to the care of the lion saying guard them brother let no one lay a hand on them he said goodbye chose a fresh horse from the chiefs stable and once again took the road  after travelling many stages and for many days he reached a plain of marvellous beauty and refreshment it was carpeted with flowersroses tulips and clover it had lovely lawns and amongst them running water this choicest place of earth filled him with wonder there was a tree such as he had never seen before its branches were alike but it bore flowers and fruit of a thousand kinds near it a reservoir had been fashioned of four sorts of stonetouchstone pure stone marble and loadstone in and out of it flowed water like attar the prince felt sure this must be the place of the simurgh he dismounted turned his horse loose to graze ate some of the food jamila had given him drank of the stream and lay down to sleep  he was still dozing when he was aroused by the neighing and pawing of his horse when he could see clearly he made out a mountainlike dragon whose heavy breast crushed the stones beneath it into putty he remembered the thousand names of god and took the bow of salih from its case and three arrows from their quiver he bound the dagger of timus firmly to his waist and hung the scorpion of solomon round his neck then he set an arrow on the string and released it with such force that it went in at the monsters eye right up to the notch the dragon writhed on itself and belched forth an evil vapour and beat the ground with its head till the earth quaked then the prince took a second arrow and shot into its throat it drew in its breath and would have sucked the prince into its maw but when he was within striking distance he drew his sword and having committed himself to god struck a mighty blow which cut the creatures neck down to the gullet the foul vapour of the beast and horror at its strangeness now overcame the prince and he fainted when he came to himself he found that he was drenched in the gore of the dead monster he rose and thanked god for his deliverance  the nest of the simurgh was in the wonderful tree above him and in it were young birds the parents were away searching for food they always told the children before they left them not to put their heads out of the nest but today at the noise of the fight below they looked down and so saw the whole affair by the time the dragon had been killed they were very hungry and set up a clamour for food the prince therefore cut up the dragon and fed them with it bit by bit till they had eaten the whole he then washed himself and lay down to rest and he was still asleep when the simurgh came home as a rule the young birds raised a clamour of welcome when their parents came near but on this day they were so full of dragonmeat that they had no choice they had to go to sleep  as they flew nearer the old birds saw the prince lying under the tree and no sign of life in the nest they thought that the misfortune which for so many earlier years had befallen them had again happened and that their nestlings had disappeared they had never been able to find out the murderer and now suspected the prince he has eaten our children and sleeps after it he must die said the fatherbird and flew back to the hills and clawed up a huge stone which he meant to let fall on the princes head but his mate said let us look into the nest first for to kill an innocent person would condemn us at the day of resurrection they flew nearer and presently the young birds woke and cried mother what have you brought for us and they told the whole story of the fight and of how they were alive only by the favour of the young man under the tree and of his cutting up the dragon and of their eating it the motherbird then remarked truly father you were about to do a strange thing and a terrible sin has been averted from you then the simurgh flew off to a distance with the great stone and dropped it it sank down to the very middle of the earth  coming back the simurgh saw that a little sunshine fell upon the prince through the leaves and it spread its wings and shaded him till he woke when he got up he salaamed to it who returned his greeting with joy and gratitude and caressed him and said o youth tell me true who are you and where are you going and how did you cross that pitiless desert where never yet foot of man had trod the prince told his story from beginning to end and finished by saying now it is my hearts wish that you should help me to get to waq of the caucasus perhaps by your favour i shall accomplish my task and avenge my brothers in reply the simurgh first blessed the deliverer of his children and then went on what you have done no child of man has ever done before you assuredly have a claim on all my help for every year up till now that dragon has come here and has destroyed my nestlings and i have never been able to find who was the murderer and to avenge myself by gods grace you have removed my childrens powerful foe i regard you as a child of my own stay with me i will give you everything you desire and i will establish a city here for you and will furnish it with every requisite i will give you the land of the caucasus and will make its princes subject to you give up the journey to waq it is full of risk and the jins there will certainly kill you but nothing could move the prince and seeing this the bird went on well so be it when you wish to set forth you must go into the plain and take seven head of deer and must make watertight bags of their hides and keep their flesh in seven portions seven seas lie on our wayi will carry you over them but if i have not food and drink we shall fall into the sea and be drowned when i ask for it you must put food and water into my mouth so we shall make the journey safely  the prince did all as he was told then they took flight they crossed the seven seas and at each one the prince fed the simurgh when they alighted on the shore of the last sea it said o my son there lies your road follow it to the city take thee three feathers of mine and if you are in a difficulty burn one and i will be with you in the twinkling of an eye  the prince walked on in solitude till he reached the city he went in and wandered about through all quarters and through bazaars and lanes and squares in the least knowing from whom he could ask information about the riddle of mihrafruz he spent seven days thinking it over in silence from the first day of his coming he had made friends with a young clothmerchant and a great liking had sprung up between them one day he said abruptly to his companion o dear friend i wish you would tell me what the rose did to the cypress and what the sense of the riddle is the merchant started and exclaimed if there were not brotherly affection between us i would cut off your head for asking me this if you meant to kill me retorted the prince you would still have first to tell me what i want to know when the merchant saw that the prince was in deadly earnest he said if you wish to hear the truth of the matter you must wait upon our king there is no other way no one else will tell you i have a wellwisher at the court named farrukhfal 12 and will introduce you to him that would be excellent cried the prince a meeting was arranged between farrukhfal and almas and then the amir took him to the kings presence and introduced him as a stranger and traveller who had come from afar to sit in the shadow of king sinaubar  now the simurgh had given the prince a diamond weighing thirty misqals and he ordered this to the king who at once recognised its value and asked where it had been obtained i your slave once had riches and state and power there are many such stones in my country on my way here i was plundered at the castle of clashing swords and i saved this one thing only hidden in my bathingcloth in return for the diamond king sinaubar showered gifts of much greater value for he remembered that it was the last possession of the prince he showed the utmost kindness and hospitality and gave his wazir orders to instal the prince in the royal guesthouse he took much pleasure in his visitors society they were together every day and spent the time most pleasantly several times the king said ask me for something that i may give it youone day he so pressed to know what would pleasure the prince that the latter said i have only one wish and that i will name to you in private the king at once commanded every one to withdraw and then prince almas said the desire of my life is to know what the rose did to the cypress and what meaning there is in the words the king was astounded in gods name if anyone else had said that to me i should have cut off his head instantly the prince heard this in silence and presently so beguiled the king with pleasant talk that to kill him was impossible  time flew by the king again and again begged the prince to ask some gift of him and always received this same reply i wish for your majestys welfare what more can i desireone night there was a banquet and cupbearers carried round gold and silver cups of sparkling wine and singers with sweetest voices contended for the prize the prince drank from the kings own cup and when his head was hot with wine he took a lute from one of the musicians and placed himself on the carpet border and sang and sang till he witched away the sense of all who listened applause and compliments rang from every side the king filled his cup and called the prince and gave it him and said name your wish it is yours the prince drained off the wine and answered o king of the world learn and know that i have only one aim in life and this is to know what the rose did to the cypress  never yet replied the king has any man come out from that question alive if this is your only wish so be it i will tell you but i will do this on one condition only namely that when you have heard you will submit yourself to death to this the prince agreed and said i set my foot firmly on this compact  the king then gave an order to an attendant a costly carpet overlaid with european velvet was placed near him and a dog was led in by a golden and jewelled chain and set upon the splendid stuffs a band of fair girls came in and stood round it in waiting  then with ill words twelve negroes dragged in a lovely woman fettered on hands and feet and meanly dressed and they set her down on the bare floor she was extraordinarily beautiful and shamed the glorious sun the king ordered a hundred stripes to be laid on her tender body she sighed a long sigh food was called for and tablecloths were spread delicate meats were set before the dog and water given it in a royal cup of chinese crystal when it had eaten its fill its leavings were placed before the lovely woman and she was made to eat of them she wept and her tears were pearls she smiled and her lips shed roses pearls and flowers were gathered up and taken to the treasury  now said the king you have seen these things and your purpose is fulfilled truly said the prince i have seen things which i have not understood what do they mean and what is the story of them tell me and kill me  then said the king the woman you see there in chains is my wife she is called gul the rose and i am sinaubar the cypress one day i was hunting and became very thirsty after great search i discovered a well in a place so secret that neither bird nor beast nor man could find it without labour i was alone i took my turban for a rope and my cap for a bucket there was a good deal of water but when i let down my rope something caught it and i could not in any way draw it back i shouted down into the well o servant of god whoever you are why do you deal unfairly with me i am dying of thirst let go in gods name a cry came up in answer o servant of god we have been in the well a long time in gods name get us out after trying a thousand schemes i drew up two blind women they said they were peris and that their king had blinded them in his anger and had left them in the well alone  now they said if you will get us the cure for our blindness we will devote ourselves to your service and will do whatever you wish  what is the cure for your blindness  not far from this place they said a cow comes up from the great sea to graze a little of her dung would cure us we should be eternally your debtors do not let the cow see you or she will assuredly kill you  with renewed strength and spirit i went to the shore there i watched the cow come up from the sea graze and go back then i came out of my hiding took a little of her dung and conveyed it to the peris they rubbed it on their eyes and by the divine might saw again  they thanked heaven and me and then considered what they could do to show their gratitude to me our periking they said has a daughter whom he keeps under his own eye and thinks the most lovely girl on earth in good sooth she has not her equal now we will get you into her house and you must win her heart and if she has an inclination for another you must drive it out and win her for yourself her mother loves her so dearly that she has no ease but in her presence and she will give her to no one in marriage teach her to love you so that she cannot exist without you but if the matter becomes known to her mother she will have you burned in the fire then you must beg as a last favour that your body may be anointed with oil so that you may burn the more quickly and be spared torture if the periking allows this favour we two will manage to be your anointers and we will put an oil on you such that if you were a thousand years in the fire not a trace of burning would remain  in the end the two peris took me to the girls house i saw her sleeping daintily she was most lovely and i was so amazed at the perfection of her beauty that i stood with senses lost and did not know if she were real or a dream when at last i saw that she was a real girl i returned thanks that i the runner had come to my goal and that i the seeker had found my treasure  when the peri opened her eyes she asked in affright who are you have you come to steal how did you get here be quick save yourself from this whirlpool of destruction for the demons and peris who guard me will wake and seize you  but loves arrow had struck me deep and the girl too looked kindly on me i could not go away for some months i remained hidden in her house we did not dare to let her mother know of our love sometimes the girl was very sad and fearful lest her mother should come to know one day her father said to her sweetheart for some time i have noticed that your beauty is not what it was how is this has sickness touched you tell me that i may seek a cure alas there was now no way of concealing the mingled delight and anguish of our love from secret it became known i was put in prison and the world grew dark to my rose bereft of her lover  the periking ordered me to be burnt and said why have you a man done this perfidious thing in my house his demons and peris collected amberwood and made a pile and would have set me on it when i remembered the word of life which the two peris i had rescued had breathed into my ear and i asked that my body might be rubbed with oil to release me the sooner from torture this was allowed and those two contrived to be the anointers i was put into the fire and it was kept up for seven days and nights by the will of the great king it left no trace upon me at the end of a week the pertking ordered the ashes to be cast upon the dustheap and i was found alive and unharmed  peris who had seen gul consumed by her love for me now interceded with the king and said it is clear that your daughters fortunes are bound up with his for the fire has not hurt him it is best to give him the girl for they love one another he is king of waq of qaf and you will find none better  to this the king agreed and made formal marriage between gul and me you now know the price i paid for this faithless creature o prince remember our compact  i remember said the prince but tell me what brought queen gul to her present pass  one night continued king sinaubari was aroused by feeling guls hands and feet deadly cold against my body i asked her where she had been to get so cold and she said she had had to go out next morning when i went to my stable i saw that two of my horses windfoot and tiger were thin and worn out i reprimanded the groom and beat him he asked where his fault lay and said that every night my wife took one or other of these horses and rode away and came back only just before dawn a flame kindled in my heart and i asked myself where she could go and what she could do i told the groom to be silent and when next gul took a horse from the stable to saddle another quickly and bring it to me that day i did not hunt but stayed at home to follow the matter up i lay down as usual at night and pretended to fall asleep when i seemed safely off gul got up and went to the stable as her custom was that night it was tigers turn she rode off on him and i took windfoot and followed with me went that dog you see a faithful friend who never left me  when i came to the foot of those hills which lie outside the city i saw gul dismount and go towards a house which some negroes have built there over against the door was a high seat and on it lay a giant negro before whom she salaamed he got up and beat her till she was marked with weals but she uttered no complaint i was dumfounded for once when i had struck her with a rose stalk she had complained and fretted for three days then the negro said to her how now ugly one and shaven head why are you so late and why are you not wearing wedding garments she answered him that person did not go to sleep quickly and he stayed at home all day so that i was not able to adorn myself i came as soon as i could in a little while he called her to sit beside him but this was more than i could bear i lost control of myself and rushed upon him he clutched my collar and we grappled in a death struggle suddenly she came behind me caught my feet and threw me while he held me on the ground she drew out my own knife and gave it to him i should have been killed but for that faithful dog which seized his throat and pulled him down and pinned him to the ground then i got up and despatched the wretch there were four other negroes at the place three i killed and the fourth got away and has taken refuge beneath the throne of mihrafruz daughter of king quimus i took gul back to my palace and from that time till now i have treated her as a dog is treated and i have cared for my dog as though it were my wife now you know what the rose did to the cypress and now you must keep compact with me  i shall keep my word said the prince but may a little water be taken to the roof so that i may make my last ablution  to this request the king consented the prince mounted to the roof and getting into a corner struck his firesteel and burned one of the sirurghs feathers in the flame straightway it appeared and by the majesty of its presence made the city quake it took the prince on its back and soared away to the zenith  after a time king sinaubar said that young man is a long time on the roof go and bring him here but there was no sign of the prince upon the roof only far away in the sky the simurgh was seen carrying him off when the king heard of his escape he thanked heaven that his hands were clean of this blood  up and up flew the simurgh till earth looked like an egg resting on an ocean at length it dropped straight down to its own place where the kind prince was welcomed by the young birds and most hospitably entertained he told the whole story of the rose and the cypress and then laden with gifts which the simurgh had gathered from cities far and near he set his face for the castle of clashing swords the kinglion came out to meet him he took the negro chiefs daughterwhose name was also gulin lawful marriage and then marched with her and her possessions and her attendants to the place of gifts here they halted for a night and at dawn said goodbye to the kinglion and set out for jamilas country  when the lady jamila heard that prince almas was near she went out with many a fair handmaid to give him loving reception their meeting was joyful and they went together to the gardenpalace jamila summoned all her notables and in their presence her marriage with the prince was solemnised a few days later she entrusted her affairs to her wazir and made preparation to go with the prince to his own country before she started she restored all the men whom her sister latifa had bewitched to their own forms and received their blessings and set them forward to their homes the wicked latifa herself she left quite alone in her gardenhouse when all was ready they set out with all her servants and slaves all her treasure and goods and journeyed at ease to the city of king quimus  when king quimus heard of the approach of such a great company he sent out his wazir to give the prince honourable meeting and to ask what had procured him the favour of the visit the prince sent back word that he had no thought of war but he wrote learn and know king quimus that i am here to end the crimes of your insolent daughter who has tyrannously done to death many kings and kings sons and has hung their heads on your citadel i am here to give her the answer to her riddle later on he entered the city beat boldly on the drums and was conducted to the presence  the king entreated him to have nothing to do with the riddle for that no man had come out of it alive o king replied the prince it is to answer it that i am here i will not withdraw  mihrafruz was told that one man more had staked his head on her question and that this was one who said he knew the answer at the request of the prince all the officers and notables of the land were summoned to hear his reply to the princess all assembled and the king and his queen gulrakh and the girl and the prince were there  the prince addressed mihrafruz what is the question you ask  what did the rose do to the cypress she rejoined  the prince smiled and turned and addressed the assembly  you who are experienced men and versed in affairs did you ever know or hear and see anything of this matter  no they answered no one has ever known or heard or seen aught about it it is an empty fancy  from whom then did the princess hear of it this empty fancy it is that has done many a servant of god to death  all saw the good sense of his words and showed their approval then he turned to the princess tell us the truth princess who told you of this thing i know it hair by hair and in and out but if i tell you what i know who is there that can say i speak the truth you must produce the person who can confirm my words  her heart sank for she feared that her longkept secret was now to be noised abroad but she said merely explain yourself  i shall explain myself fully when you bring here the negro whom you hide beneath your throne  here the king shouted in wonderment explain yourself young man what negro does my daughter hide beneath her throne  that said the prince you will see if you order to be brought here the negro who will be found beneath the throne of the princess  messengers were forthwith despatched to the garden house and after awhile they returned bringing a negro whom they had discovered in a secret chamber underneath the throne of mihrafruz dressed in a dress of honour and surrounded with luxury the king was overwhelmed with astonishment but the girl had taken heart again she had had time to think that perhaps the prince had heard of the presence of the negro and knew no more so she said haughtily prince you have not answered my riddle  o most amazingly impudent person cried he do you not yet repent  then he turned to the people and told them the whole story of the rose and the cypress of king sinaubar and queen gul when he came to the killing of the negroes he said to the one who stood before them you too were present  that is so all happened as you have told it  there was great rejoicing in the court and all through the country over the solving of the riddle and because now no more kings and princes would be killed king quimus made over his daughter to prince almas but the latter refused to marry her and took her as his captive he then asked that the heads should be removed from the battlements and given decent burial this was done he received from the king everything that belonged to mihrafruz her treasure of gold and silver her costly stuffs and carpets her household plenishing her horses and camels her servants and slaves  then he returned to his camp and sent for dilaram who came bringing her goods and chattels her gold and her jewels when all was ready prince almas set out for home taking with him jamila and dilaram and gul daughter of taramtaq and the wicked mihrafruz and all the belongings of the four packed on horses and camels and in carts without number  as he approached the borders of his fathers country word of his coming went before him and all the city came forth to give him welcome king samanlalposhjessamine wearer of rubieshad so bewept the loss of his sons that he was now blind when the prince had kissed his feet and received his blessing he took from a casket a little collyrium of solomon which the simurgh had given him and which reveals the hidden things of earth and rubbed it on his fathers eyes light came and the king saw his son  mihrafruz was brought before the king and the prince said this is the murderer of your sons do with her as you will the king fancied that the prince might care for the girls beauty and replied you have humbled her do with her as you will  upon this the prince sent for four swift and strong horses and had the negro bound to each one of them then each was driven to one of the four quarters and he tore in pieces like muslin  this frightened mihrafruz horribly for she thought the same thing might be done to herself she cried out to the prince o prince almas what is hardest to get is most valued up till now i have been subject to no man and no man had had my love the many kings and kings sons who have died at my hands have died because it was their fate to die like this in this matter i have not sinned that was their fate from eternity and from the beginning it was predestined that my fate should be bound up with yours  the prince gave ear to the argument from preordainment and as she was

ballcarrier and the bad one   far far in the forest there were two little huts and in each of them lived a man who was a famous hunter his wife and three or four children now the children were forbidden to play more than a short distance from the door as it was known that away on the other side of the wood near the great river there dwelt a witch who had a magic ball that she used as a means of stealing children  her plan was a very simple one and had never yet failed when she wanted a child she just flung her ball in the direction of the childs home and however far off it might be the ball was sure to reach it then as soon as the child saw it the ball would begin rolling slowly back to the witch just keeping a little ahead of the child so that he always thought that he could catch it the next minute but he never did and what was more his parents never saw him again  of course you must not suppose that all the fathers and mothers who had lost children made no attempts to find them but the forest was so large and the witch was so cunning in knowing exactly where they were going to search that it was very easy for her to keep out of the way besides there was always the chance that the children might have been eaten by wolves of which large herds roamed about in winter  one day the old witch happened to want a little boy so she threw her ball in the direction of the hunters huts a child was standing outside shooting at a mark with his bow and arrows but the moment he saw the ball which was made of glass whose blues and greens and whites all frosted over kept changing one into the other he flung down his bow and stooped to pick the ball up but as he did so it began to roll very gently downhill the boy could not let it roll away when it was so close to him so he gave chase the ball seemed always within his grasp yet he could never catch it it went quicker and quicker and the boy grew more and more excited that time he almost touched itno he missed it by a hairs breadth now surely if he gave a spring he could get in front of it he sprang forward tripped and fell and found himself in the witchs house  welcome welcome grandson said she get up and rest yourself for you have had a long walk and i am sure you must be tired so the boy sat down and ate some food which she gave him in a bowl it was quite different from anything he had tasted before and he thought it was delicious when he had eaten up every bit the witch asked him if he had ever fasted  no replied the boy at least i have been obliged to sometimes but never if there was any food to be had  you will have to fast if you want the spirits to make you strong and wise and the sooner you begin the better  very well said the boy what do i do first  lie down on those buffalo skins by the door of the hut answered she and the boy lay down and the squirrels and little bears and the birds came and talked to him  at the end of ten days the old woman came to him with a bowl of the same food that he had eaten before  get up my grandson you have fasted long enough have the good spirits visited you and granted you the strength and wisdom that you desire  some of them have come and have given me a portion of both answered the boy but many have stayed away from me  then said she you must fast ten days more  so the boy lay down again on the buffalo skins and fasted for ten days and at the end of that time he turned his face to the wall and fasted for twenty days longer at length the witch called to him and said  come and eat something my grandson at the sound of her voice the boy got up and ate the food she gave him when he had finished every scrap she spoke as before tell me my grandson have not the good spirits visited you all these many days that you have fasted  not all grandmother answered he there are still some who keep away from me and say that i have not fasted long enough  then you must fast again replied the old woman and go on fasting till you receive the gifts of all the good spirits not one must be missing  the boy said nothing but lay down for the third time on the buffalo skins and fasted for twenty days more and at the end of that time the witch thought he was dead his face was so white and his body so still but when she had fed him out of the bowl he grew stronger and soon was able to sit up  you have fasted a long time said she longer than anyone ever fasted before surely the good spirits must be satisfied now  yes grandmother answered the boy they have all come and have given me their gifts  this pleased the old woman so much that she brought him another basin of food and while he was eating it she talked to him and this is what she said far away on the other side of the great river is the home of the bad one in his house is much gold and what is more precious even than the gold a little bridge which lengthens out when the bad one waves his hand so that there is no river or sea that he cannot cross now i want that bridge and some of the gold for myself and that is the reason that i have stolen so many boys by means of my ball i have tried to teach them how to gain the gifts of the good spirits but none of them would fast long enough and at last i had to send them away to perform simple easy little tasks but you have been strong and faithful and you can do this thing if you listen to what i tell you when you reach the river tie this ball to your foot and it will take you acrossyou cannot manage it in any other way but do not be afraid trust to the ball and you will be quite safe  the boy took the ball and put it in a bag then he made himself a club and a bow and some arrows which would fly further than anyone elses arrows because of the strength the good spirits had given him they had also bestowed on him the power of changing his shape and had increased the quickness of his eyes and ears so that nothing escaped him and in some way or other they made him understand that if he needed more help they would give it to him  when all these things were ready the boy bade farewell to the witch and set out he walked through the forest for several days without seeing anyone but his friends the squirrels and the bears and the birds but though he stopped and spoke to them all he was careful not to let them know where he was going  at last after many days he came to the river and beyond it he noticed a small hut standing on a hill which he guessed to be the home of the bad one but the stream flowed so quickly that he could not see how he was ever to cross it and in order to test how swift the current really was he broke a branch from a tree and threw it in it seemed hardly to touch the water before it was carried away and even his magic sight could not follow it he could not help feeling frightened but he hated giving up anything that he had once undertaken and fastening the ball on his right foot he ventured on the river to his surprise he was able to stand up then a panic seized him and he scrambled up the bank again in a minute or two he plucked up courage to go a little further into the river but again its width frightened him and a second time he turned back however he felt rather ashamed of his cowardice as it was quite clear that his ball could support him and on his third trial he got safely to the other side  once there he replaced the ball in the bag and looked carefully round him the door of the bad ones hut was open and he saw that the ceiling was supported by great wooden beams from which hung the bags of gold and the little bridge he saw too the bad one sitting in the midst of his treasures eating his dinner and drinking something out of a horn it was plain to the boy that he must invent some plan of getting the bad one out of the way or else he would never be able to steal the gold or the bridge  what should he do give horrible shrieks as if he were in pain but the bad one would not care whether he were murdered or not call him by his name but the bad one was very cunning and would suspect some trick he must try something better than that then suddenly an idea came to him and he gave a little jump of joy oh how stupid of me not to think of that before said he and he wished with all his might that the bad one should become very hungryso hungry that he could not wait a moment for fresh food to be brought to him and sure enough at that instant the bad one called out to his servant you did not bring food that would satisfy a sparrow fetch some more at once for i am perfectly starving then without giving the woman time to go to the larder he got up from his chair and rolled staggering from hunger towards the kitchen  directly the door had closed on the bad one the boy ran in pulled down a bag of gold from the beam and tucked it under his left arm next he unhooked the little bridge and put it under his right he did not try to escape as most boys of his age would have done for the wisdom put into his mind by the good spirits taught him that before he could reach the river and make use of the bridge the bad one would have tracked him by his footsteps and been upon him so making himself very small and thin he hid himself behind a pile of buffalo skins in the corner first tearing a slit through one of them so that he could see what was going on  he had hardly settled himself when the servant entered the room and as she did so the last bag of gold on the beam fell to the groundfor they had begun to fall directly the boy had taken the first one she cried to her master that someone had stolen both the bag and the bridge and the bad one rushed in mad with anger and bade her go and seek for footsteps outside that they might find out where the thief had gone in a few minutes she returned saying that he must be in the house as she could not see any footsteps leading to the river and began to move all the furniture in the room without discovering ball carrier  but he must be here somewhere she said to herself examining for the second time the pile of buffalo skins and ballcarrier knowing that he could not possibly escape now hastily wished that the bad one should be unable to eat any more food at present  ah there is a slit in this one cried the servant shaking the skin and here he is and she pulled out ballcarrier looking so lean and small that he would hardly have made a mouthful for a sparrow  was it you who took my gold and bridge asked the bad one  yes answered ballcarrier it was i who took them  the bad one made a sign to the woman who inquired where he had hidden them he lifted his left arm where the gold was and she picked up a knife and scraped his skin so that no gold should be left sticking to it  what have you done with the bridge said she and he lifted his right arm from which she took the bridge while the bad one looked on well pleased be sure that he does not run away chuckled he boil some water and get him ready for cooking while i go and invite my friends the waterdemons to the feast  the woman seized ballcarrier between her finger and thumb and was going to carry him to the kitchen when the boy spoke  i am very lean and small now he said hardly worth the trouble of cooking but if you were to keep me two days and gave me plenty of food i should get big and fat as it is your friends the waterdemons would think you meant to laugh at them when they found that i was the feast  well perhaps you are right answered the bad one i will keep you for two days and he went out to visit the waterdemons  meanwhile the servant whose name was lung woman led him into a little shed and chained him up to a ring in the wall but food was given him every hour and at the end of two days he was as fat and big as a christmas turkey and could hardly move his head from one side to the other  he will do now said the bad one who came constantly to see how he was getting on i shall go and tell the waterdemons that we expect them to dinner tonight put the kettle on the fire but be sure on no account to taste the broth  lungwoman lost no time in obeying her orders she built up the fire which had got very low filled the kettle with water and passing a rope which hung from the ceiling through the handle swung it over the flames then she brought in ballcarrier who seeing all these preparations wished that as long as he was in the kettle the water might not really boil though it would hiss and bubble and also that the spirits would turn the water into fat  the kettle soon began to sing and bubble and ball carrier was lifted in very soon the fat which was to make the sauce rose to the surface and ballcarrier who was bobbing about from one side to the other called out that lungwoman had better taste the broth as he though that some salt should be added to it the servant knew quite well that her master had forbidden her to do any thing of the kind but when once the idea was put into her head she found the smell from the kettle so delicious that she unhooked a long ladle from the wall and plunged it into the kettle  you will spill it all if you stand so far off said the boy why dont you come a little nearer and as she did so he cried to the spirits to give him back his usual size and strength and to make the water scalding hot then he gave the kettle a kick which upset all the boiling water upon her and jumping over her body he seized once more the gold and the bridge picked up his club and bow and arrows and after setting fire to the bad ones hut ran down to the river which he crossed safely by the help of the bridge  the hut which was made of wood was burned to the ground before the bad one came back with a large crowd of waterdemons there was not a sign of anyone or anything so he started for the river where he saw ball carrier sitting quietly on the other side then the bad one knew what had happened and after telling the water demons that there would be no feast after all he called to ballcarrier who was eating an apple  i know your name now he said and as you have ruined me and i am not rich any more will you take me as your servant  yes i will though you have tried to kill me answered ballcarrier throwing the bridge across the water as he spoke but when the bad one was in the midst of the stream the boy wished it to become small and the bad one fell into the water and was drowned and the world was rid of him  us bureau of ethnology     how ballcarrier finished his task   after ballcarrier had managed to drown the bad one so that he could not do any more mischief he forgot the way to his grandmothers house and could not find it again though he searched everywhere during this time he wandered into many strange places and had many adventures and one day he came to a hut where a young girl lived he was tired and hungry and begged her to let him in and rest and he stayed a long while and the girl became his wife one morning he saw two children playing in front of the hut and went out to speak to them but as soon as they saw him they set up cries of horror and ran away they are the children of my sister who has been on a long journey replied his wife and now that she knows you are my husband she wants to kill you  oh well let her try replied ballcarrier it is not the first time people have wished to do that and here i am still you see  be careful said the wife she is very cunning but at this moment the sisterinlaw came up  how do you do brotherinlaw i have heard of you so often that i am very glad to meet you i am told that you are more powerful than any man on earth and as i am powerful too let us try which is the strongest  that will be delightful answered he suppose we begin with a short race and then we will go on to other things  that will suit me very well replied the woman who was a witch and let us agree that the one who wins shall have the right to kill the other  oh certainly said ballcarrier and i dont think we shall find a flatter course than the prairie itselfno one knows how many miles it stretches we will run to the end and back again  this being settled they both made ready for the race and ballcarrier silently begged the good spirits to help him and not to let him fall into the hands of this wicked witch  when the sun touches the trunk of that tree we will start said she as they both stood side by side but with the first step ballcarrier changed himself into a wolf and for a long way kept ahead then gradually he heard her creeping up behind him and soon she was in front so ballcarrier took the shape of a pigeon and flew rapidly past her but in a little while she was in front again and the end of the prairie was in sight a crow can fly faster than a pigeon thought he and as a crow he managed to pass her and held his ground so long that he fancied she was quite beaten the witch began to be afraid of it too and putting out all her strength slipped past him next he put on the shape of a hawk and in this form he reached the bounds of the prairie he and the witch turning homewards at the moment  bird after bird he tried but every time the witch gained on him and took the lead at length the goal was in sight and ballcarrier knew that unless he could get ahead now he would be killed before his own door under the eyes of his wife his eyes had grown dim from fatigue his wings flapped wearily and hardly bore him along while the witch seemed as fresh as ever what bird was there whose flight was swifter than his would not the good spirits tell him ah of course he knew why had he not thought of it at first and spared himself all that fatigue and the next instant a humming bird dressed in green and blue flashed past the woman and entered the house the witch came panting up furious at having lost the race which she felt certain of winning and ballcarrier who had by this time changed back into his own shape struck her on the head and killed her  for a long while ballcarrier was content to stay quietly at home with his wife and children for he was tired of adventures and only did enough hunting to supply the house with food but one day he happened to eat some poisonous berries that he had found in the forest and grew so ill that he felt he was going to die  when i am dead do not bury me in the earth he said but put me over there among that clump of trees so his wife and her three children watched by him as long as he was alive and after he was dead they took him up and laid the body on a platform of stakes which they had prepared in the grove and as they returned weeping to the hut they caught a glimpse of the ball rolling away down the path back to the old grandmother one of the sons sprang forward to stop it for ballcarrier had often told them the tale of how it had helped him to cross the river but it was too quick for him and they had to content themselves with the war club and bow and arrows which were put carefully away  byandby some travellers came past and the chief among them asked leave to marry ballcarriers daughter the mother said she must have a little time to think over it as her daughter was still very young so it was settled that the man should go away for a month with his friends and then come back to see if the girl was willing  now ever since ballcarriers death the family had been very poor and often could not get enough to eat one morning the girl who had had no supper and no breakfast wandered off to look for cranberries and though she was quite near home was astonished at noticing a large hut which certainly had not been there when last she had come that way no one was about so she ventured to peep in and her surprise was increased at seeing heaped up in one corner a quantity of food of all sorts while a little robin redbreast stood perched on a beam looking down upon her  it is my father i am sure she cried and the bird piped in answer  from that day whenever they wanted food they went to the hut and though the robin could not speak he would hop on their shoulders and let them feed him with the food they knew he liked best  when the man came back he found the girl looking so much prettier and fatter than when he had left her that he insisted that they should be married on the spot and the mother who did not know how to get rid of him gave in  the husband spent all his time in hunting and the family had never had so much meat before but the man who had seen for himself how poor they were noticed with amazement that they did not seem to care about it or to be hungry they must get food from somewhere he thought and one morning when he pretended to be going out to hunt he hid in a thicket to watch very soon they all left the house together and walked to the other hut which the girls husband saw for the first time as it was hid in a hollow he followed and noticed that each one went up to the redbreast and shook him by the claw and he then entered boldly and shook the birds claw too the whole party afterwards sat down to dinner after which they all returned to their own hut  the next day the husband declared that he was very ill and could not eat anything but this was only a presence so that he might get what he wanted the family were all much distressed and begged him to tell them what food he fancied  oh i could not eat any food he answered every time and at each answer his voice grew fainter and fainter till they thought he would die from weakness before their eyes  there must be some thing you could take if you would only say what it is implored his wife  no nothing nothing except perhapsbut of course that is impossible  no i am sure it is not replied she you shall have it i promiseonly tell me what it is  i thinkbut i could not ask you to do such a thing leave me alone and let me die quietly  you shall not die cried the girl who was very fond of her husband for he did not beat her as most girls husbands did whatever it is i will manage to get it for you  well then i think if i had thatredbreast nicely roasted i could eat a little bit of his wing  the wife started back in horror at such a request but the man turned his face to the wall and took no notice as he thought it was better to leave her to herself for a little  weeping and wringing her hands the girl went down to her mother the brothers were very angry when they heard the story and declared that if any one were to die it certainly should not be the robin but all that night the man seemed getting weaker and weaker and at last quite early the wife crept out and stealing to the hut killed the bird and brought him home to her husband  just as she was going to cook it her two brothers came in they cried out in horror at the sight and rushing out of the hut declared they would never see her any more and the poor girl with a heavy heart took the body of the redbreast up to her husband  but directly she entered the room the man told her that he felt a great deal better and that he would rather have a piece of bears flesh well boiled than any bird however tender his wife felt very miserable to think that their beloved redbreast had been sacrificed for nothing and begged him to try a little bit  you felt so sure that it would do you good before said she that i cant help thinking it would quite cure you now but the man only flew into a rage and flung the bird out of the window then he got up and went out  now all this while the ball had been rolling rolling rolling to the old grandmothers hut on the other side of the world and directly it rolled into her hut she knew that her grandson must be dead without wasting any time she took a fox skin and tied it round her forehead and fastened another round her waist as witches always do when they leave their own homes when she was ready she said to the ball go back the way you came and lead me to my grandson and the ball started with the old woman following  it was a long journey even for a witch but like other things it ended at last and the old woman stood before the platform of stakes where the body of ballcarrier lay  wake up my grandson it is time to go home the witch said and ballcarrier stepped down oft the platform and brought his club and bow and arrows out of the hut and set out for the other side of the world behind the old woman  when they reached the hut where ballcarrier had fasted so many years ago the old woman spoke for the first time since they had started on their way  my grandson did you ever manage to get that gold from the bad one  yes grandmother i got it  where is it she asked  here in my left armpit answered he  so she picked up a knife and scraped away all the gold which had stuck to his skin and which had been sticking there ever since he first stole it after she had finished she asked again  my grandson did you manage to get that bridge from the bad one  yes grandmother i got that too answered he  where is it she asked and ballcarrier lifted his right arm and pointed to his armpit  here is the bridge grandmother said he  then the witch did something that nobody in the world could have guessed that she would do first she took the gold and said to ballcarrier  my grandson this gold must be hidden in the earth for if people think they can get it when they choose they will become lazy and stupid but if we take it and bury it in different parts of the world they will have to work for it if they want it and then will only find a little at a time and as she spoke she pulled up one of the poles of the hut and ballcarrier saw that underneath was a deep deep hole which seemed to have no bottom down this hole she poured all the gold and when it was out of sight it ran about all over the world where people that dig hard sometimes find it and after that was done she put the pole back again  next she lifted down a spade from a high shelf where it had grown quite rusty and dug a very small hole on the opposite side of the hutvery small but very deep  give me the bridge said she for i am going to bury it here if anyone was to get hold of it and find that they could cross rivers and seas without any trouble they would never discover how to cross them for themselves i am a witch and if i had chosen i could easily have cast my spells over the bad one and have made him deliver them to you the first day you came into my hut but then you would never have fasted and never have planned how to get what you wanted and never have known the good spirits and would have been fat and idle to the end of your days and now go in that hut which you can just see far away live your father and mother who are old people now and need a son to hunt for them you have done what you were set to do and i need you no more  then ballcarrier remembered his parents and went back to them  from bureau of ethnology indian folklore     the bunyip   long long ago far far away on the other side of the world some young men left the camp where they lived to get some food for their wives and children the sun was hot but they liked heat and as they went they ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest or was cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang which always returns to the thrower they did not get on very fast at this rate but presently they reached a flat place that in time of flood was full of water but was now in the height of summer only a set of pools each surrounded with a fringe of plants with bulrushes standing in the inside of all in that country the people are fond of the roots of bulrushes which they think as good as onions and one of the young men said that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back to the camp it did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket and they were just going to wade into the water and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out after all why should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and children let them come and get the roots for themselves but we will fish for eels and anything else we can get  this delighted the rest of the party and they all began to arrange their fishing lines made from the bark of the yellow mimosa and to search for bait for their hooks most of them used worms but one who had put a piece of raw meat for dinner into his skin wallet cut off a little bit and baited his line with it unseen by his companions  for a long time they cast patiently without receiving a single bite the sun had grown low in the sky and it seemed as if they would have to go home emptyhanded not even with a basket of roots to show when the youth who had baited his hook with raw meat suddenly saw his line disappear under the water something a very heavy fish he supposed was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet and for a few minutes it seemed either as if he must let go or be dragged into the pool he cried to his friends to help him and at last trembling with fright at what they were going to see they managed between them to land on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal but something of both with a long broad tail they looked at each other with horror cold shivers running down their spines for though they had never beheld it there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it wasthe cub of the awful bunyip  all of a sudden the silence was broken by a low wail answered by another from the other side of the pool as the mother rose up from her den and came towards them rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes let it go let it go whispered the young men to each other but the captor declared that he had caught it and was going to keep it he had promised his sweetheart he said that he would bring back enough meat for her fathers house to feast on for three days and though they could not eat the little bunyip her brothers and sisters should have it to play with so flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back he threw the little bunyip on to his shoulders and set out for the camp never heeding the poor mothers cries of distress  by this time it was getting near sunset and the plain was in shadow though the tops of the mountains were still quite bright the youths had all ceased to be afraid when they were startled by a low rushing sound behind them and looking round saw that the pool was slowly rising and the spot where they had landed the bunyip was quite covered what could it be they asked one of another there was not a cloud in the sky yet the water had risen higher already than they had ever known it do before for an instant they stood watching as if they were frozen then they turned and ran with all their might the man with the bunyip running faster than all when he reached a high peak overlooking all the plain he stopped to take breath and turned to see if he was safe yet safe why only the tops of the trees remained above that sea of water and these were fast disappearing they must run fast indeed if they were to escape so on they flew scarcely feeling the ground as they went till they flung themselves on the ground before the holes scooped out of the earth where they had all been born the old men were sitting in front the children were playing and the women chattering together when the little bunyip fell into their midst and there was scarcely a child among them who did not know that something terrible was upon them the water the water gasped one of the young men and there it was slowly but steadily mounting the ridge itself parents and children clung together as if by that means they could drive back the advancing flood and the youth who had caused all this terrible catastrophe seized his sweetheart and cried i will climb with you to the top of that tree and there no waters can reach us but as he spoke something cold touched him and quickly he glanced down at his feet then with a shudder he saw that they were feet no longer but birds claws he looked at the girl he was clasping and beheld a great black bird standing at his side he turned to his friends but a flock of great awkward flapping creatures stood in their place he put up his hands to cover his face but they were no more hands only the ends of wings and when he tried to speak a noise such as he had never heard before seemed to come from his throat which had suddenly become narrow and slender already the water had risen to his waist and he found himself sitting easily upon it while its surface reflected back the image of a black swan one of many  never again did the swans become men but they are still different from other swans for in the nighttime those who listen can hear them talk in a language that is certainly not swans language and there are even sounds of laughing and talking unlike any noise made by the swans whom we know  the little bunyip was carried home by its mother and after that the waters sank back to their own channels the side of the pool where she lives is always shunned by everyone as nobody knows when she may suddenly put out her head and draw him into her mighty jaws but people say that underneath the black waters of the pool she has a house filled with beautiful things such as mortals who dwell on the earth have no idea of though how they know i cannot tell you as nobody has ever seen it  from journal of anthropologicalinstitute     father grumbler    once upon a time there lived a man who had nearly as many children as there were sparrows in the garden he had to work very hard all day to get them enough to eat and was often tired and cross and abused everything and everybody so that people called him father grumbler  byandby he grew weary of always working and on sundays he lay a long while in bed instead of going to church then after a time he found it dull to sit so many hours by himself thinking of nothing but how to pay the rent that was owing and as the tavern across the road looked bright and cheerful he walked in one day and sat down with his friends it was just to chase away care he said but when he came out hours and hours after care came out with him  father grumbler entered his house feeling more dismal than when he left it for he knew that he had wasted both his time and his money  i will go and see the holy man in the cave near the well he said to himself and perhaps he can tell me why all the luck is for other people and only misfortunes happen to me and he set out at once for the cave  it was a long way off and the road led over mountains and through valleys but at last he reached the cave where the holy man dwelt and knocked at the door  who is there asked a voice from within  it is i holy man father grumbler you know who has as many children as sparrows in the garden  well and what is it that you want  i want to know why other people have all the luck and only misfortunes happen to me  the holy man did not answer but went into an inner cave from which he came out bearing something in his hand do you see this basket said he it is a magical basket and if you are hungry you have only got to say little basket little basket do your duty and you will eat the best dinner you ever had in your life but when you have had enough be sure you dont forget to cry out that will do for today ohand one thing moreyou need not show it to everybody and declare that i have give it to you do you understand  father grumbler was always accustomed to think of himself as so unlucky that he did not know whether the holy man was not playing a trick upon him but he took the basket without being polite enough to say either thank you or goodmorning and went away however he only waited till he was out of sight of the cave before he stooped down and whispered little basket little basket do your duty  now the basket had a lid so that he could not see what was inside but he heard quite clearly strange noises as if a sort of scuffling was going on then the lid burst open and a quantity of delicious little white rolls came tumbling out one after the other followed by a stream of small fishes all ready cooked what a quantity there were to be sure the whole road was covered with them and the banks on each side were beginning to disappear father grumbler felt quite frightened at the torrent but at last he remembered what the holy man had told him and cried at the top of his voice enough enough that will do for today and the lid of the basket closed with a snap  father grumbler sighed with relief and happiness as he looked around him and sitting down on a heap of stones he ate till he could eat no more trout salmon turbot soles and a hundred other fishes whose names he did not know lay boiled fried and grilled within reach of his hands as the holy man had said he had never eaten such a dinner still when he had done he shook his head and grumbled yes there is plenty to eat of course but it only makes me thirsty and there is not a drop to drink anywhere  yet somehow he could never tell why he looked up and saw the tavern in front of him which he thought was miles and miles and miles away  bring the best wine you have got and two glasses good mother he said as he entered and if you are fond of fish there is enough here to feed the house only there is no need to chatter about it all over the place you understand eh and without waiting for an answer he whispered to the basket little basket little basket do your duty the innkeeper and his wife thought that their customer had gone suddenly mad and watched him closely ready to spring on him if he became violent but both instinctively jumped backwards nearly into the fire as rolls and fishes of every kind came tumbling out of the basket covering the tables and chairs and the floor and even overflowing into the street  be quick be quick and pick them up cried the man and if these are not enough there are plenty more to be had for the asking  the innkeeper and his wife did not need telling twice down they went on their knees and gathered up everything they could lay hands on but busy though they seemed they found time to whisper to each other  if we can only get hold of that basket it will make our fortune  so they began by inviting father grumbler to sit down to the table and brought out the best wine in the cellar hoping it might loosen his tongue but father grumbler was wiser than they gave him credit for and though they tried in all manner of ways to find out who had given him the basket he put them off and kept his secret to himself unluckily though he did not speak he did drink and it was not long before he fell fast asleep then the woman fetched from her kitchen a basket so like the magic one that no one without looking very closely could tell the difference and placed it in father grumblers hand while she hid the other carefully away  it was dinner time when the man awoke and jumping up hastily he set out for home where he found all the children gathered round a basin of thin soup and pushing their wooden bowls forward hoping to have the first spoonful their father burst into the midst of them bearing his basket and crying  dont spoil your appetites children with that stuff do you see this basket well i have only got to say little basket little basket do your duty and you will see what will happen now you shall say it instead of me for a treat  the children wondering and delighted repeated the words but nothing happened again and again they tried but the basket was only a basket with a few scales of fish sticking to the bottom for the innkeepers wife had taken it to market the day before  what is the matter with the thing cried the father at last snatching the basket from them and turning it all over grumbling and swearing while he did so under the eyes of his astonished wife and children who did not know whether to cry or to laugh  it certainly smells of fish he said and then he stopped for a sudden thought had come to him  suppose it is not mine at all supposingah the scoundrels  and without listening to his wife and children who were frightened at his strange conduct and begged him to stay at home he ran across to the tavern and burst open the door  can i do anything for you father grumbler asked the innkeepers wife in her softest voice  i have taken the wrong basketby mistake of course said he here is yours will you give me back my own  why what are you talking about answered she you can see for yourself that there is no basket here  and though father grumbler did look it was quite true that none was to be seen  come take a glass to warm you this cold day said the woman who was anxious to keep him in a good temper and as this was an invitation father grumbler never refused he tossed it off and left the house  he took the road that led to the holy mans cave and made such haste that it was not long before he reached it  who is there said a voice in answer to his knock  it is me it is me holy man you know quite well father grumbler who has as many children as sparrows in the garden  but my good man it was only yesterday that i gave you a handsome present  yes holy man and here it is but something has happened i dont know what and it wont work any more  well put it down i will go and see if i can find anything for you  in a few minutes the holy man returned with a cock under his arm  listen to me he said whenever you want money you only have to say show me what you can do cock and you will see some wonderful things but remember it is not necessary to let all the world into the secret  oh no holy man i am not so foolish as that  nor to tell everybody that i gave it to you went on the holy man i have not got these treasures by the dozen  and without waiting for an answer he shut the door  as before the distance seemed to have wonderfully shortened and in a moment the tavern rose up in front of father grumbler without stopping to think he went straight in and found the innkeepers wife in the kitchen making a cake  where have you come from with that fine red cock in your basket asked she for the bird was so big that the lid would not shut down properly  oh i come from a place where they dont keep these things by the dozen he replied sitting down in front of the table  the woman said no more but set before him a bottle of his favourite wine and soon he began to wish to display his prize  show me what you can do cock cried he and the cock stood up and flapped his wings three times crowing coquerico with a voice like a trumpet and at each crow there fell from his beak golden drops and diamonds as large as peas  this time father grumbler did not invite the innkeepers wife to pick up his treasures but put his own hat under the cocks beak so as to catch everything he let fall and he did not see the husband and wife exchanging glances with each other which said that would be a splendid cock to put with our basket  have another glass of wine suggested the innkeeper when they had finished admiring the beauty of the cock for they pretended not to have seen the gold or the diamonds and father grumbler nothing loth drank one glass after another till his head fell forward on the table and once more he was sound asleep then the woman gently coaxed the cock from the basket and carried it off to her own poultry yard from which she brought one exactly like it and popped it in its place  night was falling when the man awoke and throwing proudly some grains of gold on the table to pay for the wine he had drunk he tucked the cock comfortably into his basket and set out for home  his wife and all the children were waiting for him at the door and as soon as she caught sight of him she broke out  you are a nice man to go wasting your time and your money drinking in that tavern and leaving us to starve arent you ashamed of yourself  you dont know what you are talking of he answered money why i have gold and diamonds now as much as i want do you see that cock well you have only to say to him show me what you can do cock and something splendid will happen  neither wife nor children were inclined to put much faith in him after their last experience however they thought it was worth trying and did as he told them the cock flew round the room like a mad thing and crowed till their heads nearly split with the noise but no gold or diamonds dropped on the brick floornot the tiniest grain of either  father grumbler stared in silence for an instant and then he began to swear so loudly that even his family accustomed as they were to his language wondered at him  at last he grew a little quieter but remained as puzzled as ever  can i have forgotten the words but i know that was what he said and i saw the diamonds with my own eyes then suddenly he seized the cock shut it into the basket and rushed out of the house  his heavy wooden shoes clattered as he ran along the road and he made such haste that the stars were only just beginning to come out when he reached the cave of the holy man  who is that knocking asked a voice from within  it is me it is me holy man you know father  but my good fellow you really should give some one else a chance this is the third time you have beenand at such an hour too  oh yes holy man i know it is very late but you will forgive me it is your cockthere is something the matter it is like the basket look  that my cock that my basket somebody has played you a trick my good man  a trick repeated father grumbler who began to understand what had happened then it must have been those two  i warned you not to show them to anybody said the holy man you deservebut i will give you one more chance and turning he unhooked something from the wall  when you wish to dust your own jacket or those of your friends he said you have only got to say flack flick switch be quick and you will see what happens that is all i have to tell you and smiling to himself the holy man pushed father grumbler out of the cave  ah i understand now muttered the good man as he took the road home but i think i have got you two rascals and he hurried on to the tavern with his basket under his arm and the cock and the switch both inside  good evening friends he said as he entered the inn i am very hungry and should be glad if you would roast this cock for me as soon as possible this cock and no othermind what i say he went on oh and another thing you can light the fire with this basket when you have done that i will show you something i have in my bag and as he spoke he tried to imitate the smile that the holy man had given him  these directions made the innkeepers wife very uneasy however she said nothing and began to roast the cock while her husband did his best to make the man sleepy with wine but all in vain  after dinner which he did not eat without grumbling for the cock was very tough the man struck his hand on the table and said now listen to me go and fetch my cock and my basket at once do you hear  your cock and your basket father grumbler but you have just  my cock and my basket interrupted he and if you are too deaf and too stupid to understand what that means i have got something which may help to teach you and opening the bag he cried flack flick switch be quick  and flack flick like lightening a white switch sprang out of the bag and gave such hearty blows to the innkeeper and his wife and to father grumbler into the bargain that they all jumped as high as feathers when a mattress is shaken  stop stop make it stop and you shall have back your cock and basket cried the man and his wife and father grumbler who had no wish to go on called out between his hops stop then cant you that is enough for today  but the switch paid no attention and dealt out its blows as before and might have been dealing them to this day if the holy man had not heard their cries and come to the rescue into the bag quick said he and the switch obeyed  now go and fetch me the cock and the basket and the woman went without a word and placed them on the table  you have all got what you deserved continued the holy man and i have no pity for any of you i shall take my treasures home and perhaps some day i may find a man who knows how to make the best of the chances that are given to him but that will never be you he added turning to father grumbler  from contes populaires     the story of the yara    down in the south where the sun shines so hotly that everything and everybody sleeps all day and even the great forests seem silent except early in the morning and late in the eveningdown in this country there once lived a young man and a maiden the girl had been born in the town and had scarcely ever left it but the young man was a native of another country and had only come to the city near the great river because he could find no work to do where he was  a few months after his arrival when the days were cooler and the people did not sleep so much as usual a great feast was held a little way out of the town and to this feast everyone flocked from thirty miles and more some walked and some rode some came in beautiful golden coaches but all had on splendid dresses of red or blue while wreaths of flowers rested on their hair  it was the first time that the youth had been present on such an occasion and he stood silently aside watching the graceful dances and the pretty games played by the young people and as he watched he noticed one girl dressed in white with scarlet pomegranates in her hair who seemed to him lovelier than all the rest  when the feast was over and the young man returned home his manner was so strange that it drew the attention of all his friends  through his work next day the youth continued to see the girls face throwing the ball to her companions or threading her way between them as she danced at night sleep fled from him and after tossing for hours on his bed he would get up and plunge into a deep pool that lay a little way in the forest  this state of things went on for some weeks then at last chance favoured him one evening as he was passing near the house where she lived he saw her standing with her back to the wall trying to beat off with her fan the attacks of a savage dog that was leaping at her throat alonzo for such was his name sprang forward and with one blow of his fist stretched the creature dead upon the road he then helped the frightened and halffainting girl into the large cool verandah where her parents were sitting and from that hour he was a welcome guest in the house and it was not long before he was the promised husband of julia  every day when his work was done he used to go up to the house half hidden among flowering plants and brilliant creepers where hummingbirds darted from bush to bush and parrots of all colours red and green and grey shrieked in chorus there he would find the maiden waiting for him and they would spend an hour or two under the stars which looked so large and bright that you felt as if you could almost touch them  what did you do last night after you went home suddenly asked the girl one evening  just the same as i always do answered he it was too hot to sleep so it was no use going to bed and i walked straight of to the forest and bathed in one of those deep dark pools at the edge of the river i have been there constantly for several months but last night a strange thing happened i was taking my last plunge when i heardsometimes from one side and sometimes from anotherthe sound of a voice singing more sweetly than any nightingale though i could not catch any words i left the pool and dressing myself as fast as i could i searched every bush and tree round the water as i fancied that perhaps it was my friend who was playing a trick on me but there was not a creature to be seen and when i reached home i found my friend fast asleep  as julia listened her face grew deadly white and her whole body shivered as if with cold from her childhood she had heard stories of the terrible beings that lived in the forests and were hidden under the banks of the rivers and could only be kept off by powerful charms could the voice which had bewitched alonzo have come from one of these perhaps who knows it might be the voice of the dreaded yara herself who sought young men on the eve of their marriage as her prey  for a moment the girl sat choked with fear as these thoughts rushed through her then she said alonzo will you promise something  what is that asked he  it is something that has to do with our future happiness  oh it is serious then well of course i promise now tell me  i want you to promise she answered lowering her voice to a whisper never to bathe in those pools again  but why not queen of my soul have i not gone there always and nothing has harmed me flower of my heart  no but perhaps something will if you will not promise i shall go mad with fright promise me  why what is the matter you look so pale tell me why you are so frightened  did you not hear the song she asked trembling  suppose i did how could that hurt me it was the loveliest song i ever heard  yes and after the song will come the apparition and after that after that  i dont understand wellafter that  after thatdeath  alonzo stared at her had she really gone mad such talk was very unlike julia but before he could collect his senses the girl spoke again  that is the reason why i implore you never to go there again at any rate till after we are married  and what difference will our marriage make  oh there will be no danger then you can go to bathe as often as you like  but tell me why you are so afraid  because the voice you heardi know you will laugh but it is quite trueit was the voice of the yara  at these words alonzo burst into a shout of laughter but it sounded so harsh and loud that julia shrank away shuddering it seemed as if he could not stop himself and the more he laughed the paler the poor girl became murmuring to herself as she watched him  oh heaven you have seen her you have seen her what shall i do  faint as was her whisper it reached the ears of alonzo who though he still could not speak for laughing shook his head  you may not know it but it is true nobody who has not seen the yara laughs like that and julia flung herself on the ground weeping bitterly  at this sight alonzo became suddenly grave and kneeling by her side gently raised her up  do not cry so my angel he said i will promise anything you please only let me see you smile again  with a great effort julia checked her sobs and rose to her feet  thank you she answered my heart grows lighter as you say that i know you will try to keep your word and to stay away from the forest butthe power of the yara is very strong and the sound of her voice is apt to make men forget everything else in the world oh i have seen it and more than one betrothed maiden lives alone brokenhearted if ever you should return to the pool where you first heard the voice promise me that you will at least take this with you and opening a curiously carved box she took out a seashell shot with many colours and sang a song softly into it the moment you hear the yaras voice said she put this to your ear and you will hear my song instead perhapsi do not know for certainbut perhaps i may be stronger than the yara  it was late that night when alonzo returned home the moon was shining on the distant river which looked cool and inviting and the trees of the forest seemed to stretch out their arms and beckon him near but the young man steadily turned his face in the other direction and went home to bed  the struggle had been hard but alonzo had his reward next day in the joy and relief with which julia greeted him he assured her that having overcome the temptation once the danger was now over but she knowing better than he did the magic of the yaras face and voice did not fail to make him repeat his promise when he went away  for three nights alonzo kept his word not because he believed in the yara for he thought that the tales about her were all nonsense but because he could not bear the tears with which he knew that julia would greet him if he confessed that he had returned to the forest but in spite of this the song rang in his ears and daily grew louder  on the fourth night the attraction of the forest grew so strong that neither the thought of julia nor the promises he had made her could hold him back at eleven oclock he plunged into the cool darkness of the trees and took the path that led straight to the river yet for the first time he found that julias warnings though he had laughed at her at the moment had remained in his memory and he glanced at the bushes with a certain sense of fear which was quite new to him  when he reached the river he paused and looked round for a moment to make sure that the strange feeling of some one watching him was fancy and he was really alone but the moon shone brightly on every tree and nothing was to be seen but his own shadow nothing was to be heard but the sound of the rippling stream  he threw off his clothes and was just about to dive in headlong when somethinghe did not know whatsuddenly caused him to look round at the same instant the moon passed from behind a cloud and its rays fell on a beautiful goldenhaired woman standing half hidden by the ferns  with one bound he caught up his mantle and rushed headlong down the path he had come fearing at each step to feel a hand laid on his shoulder it was not till he had left the last trees behind him and was standing in the open plain that he dared to look round and then he thought a figure in white was still standing there waving her arms to and fro this was enough he ran along the road harder than ever and never paused till he was save in his own room  with the earliest rays of dawn he went back to the forest to see whether he could find any traces of the yara but though he searched every clump of bushes and looked up every tree everything was empty and the only voices he heard were those of parrots which are so ugly that they only drive people away  i think i must be mad he said to himself and have dreamt all that folly and going back to the city he began his daily work but either that was harder than usual or he must be ill for he could not fix his mind upon it and everybody he came across during the day inquired if anything had happened to give him that white frightened look  i must be feverish he said to himself after all it is rather dangerous to take a cold bath when one is feeling so hot yet he knew while he said it that he was counting the hours for night to come that he might return to the forest  in the evening he went as usual to the creepercovered house but he had better have stayed away as his face was so pale and his manner so strange that the poor girl saw that something terrible had occurred alonzo however refused to answer any of her questions and all she could get was a promise to hear everything the next day  on pretence of a violent headache he left julia much earlier than usual and hurried quickly home taking down a pistol he loaded it and put it in his belt and a little before midnight he stole out on the tips of his toes so as to disturb nobody once outside he hastened down the road which led to the forest  he did not stop till he had reached the river pool when holding the pistol in his hand he looked about him at every little noisethe falling of a leaf the rustle of an animal in the bushes the cry of a nightbirdhe sprang up and cocked his pistol in the direction of the sound but though the moon still shone he saw nothing and by and by a kind of dreamy state seemed to steal over him as he leant against a tree  how long he remained in this condition he could not have told but suddenly he awoke with a start on hearing his name uttered softly  who is that he cried standing upright instantly but only an echo answered him then his eyes grew fascinated with the dark waters of the pool close to his feet and he looked at it as if he could never look away  he gazed steadily into the depths for some minutes when he became aware that down in the darkness was a bright spark which got rapidly bigger and brighter again that feeling of awful fear took possession of him and he tried to turn his eyes from the pool but it was no use something stronger than himself compelled him to keep them there  at last the waters parted softly and floating on the surface he saw the beautiful woman whom he had fled from only a few nights before he turned to run but his feet were glued to the spot  she smiled at him and held out her arms but as she did so there came over him the remembrance of julia as he had seen her a few hours earlier and her warnings and fears for the very danger in which he now found himself  meanwhile the figure was always drawing nearer nearer but with a violent effort alonzo shook off his stupor and taking aim at her shoulder he pulled the trigger the report awoke the sleeping echoes and was repeated all through the forest but the figure smiled still and went on advancing again alonzo fired and a second time the bullet whistled through the air and the figure advanced nearer a moment more and she would be at his side  then his pistol being empty he grasped the barrel with both hands and stood ready to use it as a club should the yara approach and closer but now it seemed her turn to feel afraid for she paused an instant while he pressed forward still holding the pistol above his head prepared to strike  in his excitement he had forgotten the river and it was not till the cold water touched his feet that he stood still by instinct the yara saw that he was wavering and suffering herself to sway gently backwards and forwards on the surface of the river she began to sing the song floated through the trees now far and now near no one could tell whence it came the whole air seemed full of it alonzo felt his senses going and his will failing his arms dropped heavily to his side but in falling struck against the sea shell which as he had promised julia he had always carried in his coat  his dimmed mind was just clear enough to remember what she had said and with trembling fingers that were almost powerless to grasp he drew it out as he did so the song grew sweeter and more tender than before but he shut his ears to it and bent his head over the shell out of its depths arose the voice of julia singing to him as she had sung when she gave him the shell and though the notes sounded faint at first they swelled louder and louder till the mist which had gathered about him was blown away  then he raised his head feeling that he had been through strange places where he could never wander any more and he held himself erect and strong and looked about him nothing was to be seen but the shining of the river and the dark shadows of the trees nothing was to be heard but the hum of the insects as they darted through the night  adapted from folklore bresilien     the cunning hare    in a very cold country far across the seas where ice and snow cover the ground for many months in the year there lived a little hare who as his father and mother were both dead was brought up by his grandmother as he was too young and she was too old to work they were very poor and often did not have enough to eat  one day when the little fellow was hungrier than usual he asked his grandmother if he might go down to the river and catch a fish for their breakfast as the thaw had come and the water was flowing freely again she laughed at him for thinking that any fish would let itself be caught by a hare especially such a young one but as she had the rheumatism very badly and could get no food herself she let him go if he does not catch a fish he may find something else she said to herself so she told her grandson where to look for the net and how he was to set it across the river but just as he was starting feeling himself quite a man she called him back  after all i dont know what is the use of your going my boy for even if you should catch a fish i have no fire to cook it with  let me catch my fish and i will soon make you a fire he answered gaily for he was young and knew nothing about the difficulties of firemaking  it took him some time to haul the net through bushes and over fields but at length he reached a pool in the river which he had often heard was swarming with fish and here he set the net as his grandmother had directed him  he was so excited that he hardly slept all night and at the very first streak of dawn he ran as fast as ever he could down to the river his heart beat as quickly as if he had had dogs behind him and he hardly dared to look lest he should be disappointed would there be even one fish and at this thought the pangs of hunger made him feel quite sick with fear but he need not have been afraid in every mesh of the net was a fine fat fish and of course the net itself was so heavy that he could only lift one corner he threw some of the fish back into the water and buried some more in a hole under a stone where he would be sure to find them then he rolled up the net with the rest put it on his back and carried it home the weight of the load caused his back to ache and he was thankful to drop it outside their hut while he rushed in full of joy to tell his grandmother be quick and clean them he said and i will go to those peoples tents on the other side of the water  the old woman stared at him in horror as she listened to his proposal other people had tried to steal fire before and few indeed had come back with their lives but as contrary to all her expectations he had managed to catch such a number of fish she thought that perhaps there was some magic about him which she did not know of and did not try to hinder him  when the fish were all taken out he fetched the net which he had laid out to dry folded it up very small and ran down to the river hoping that he might find a place narrow enough for him to jump over but he soon saw that it was too wide for even the best jumper in the world for a few moments he stood there wondering what was to be done then there darted into his head some words of a spell which he had once heard a wizard use while drinking from the river he repeated them as well as he could remember and waited to see what would happen in five minutes such a grunting and a puffing was heard and columns of water rose into the air though he could not tell what had made them then round the bend of the stream came fifteen huge whales which he ordered to place themselves heads to tails like stepping stones so that he could jump from one to the other till he landed on the opposite shore directly he got there he told the whales that he did not need them any more and sat down in the sand to rest  unluckily some children who were playing about caught sight of him and one of them stealing softly up behind him laid tight hold of his ears the hare who had been watching the whales as they sailed down the river gave a violent start and struggled to get away but the boy held on tight and ran back home as fast as he could go  throw it in the pot said the old woman as soon as he had told his story put it in that basket and as soon as the water boils in the pot we will hang it over the fire  better kill it first said the old man and the hare listened horribly frightened but still looking secretly to see if there was no hole through which he could escape if he had a chance of doing so yes there was one right in the top of the tent so shaking himself as if with fright he let the end of his net unroll itself a little  i wish that a spark of fire would fall on my net whispered he and the next minute a great log fell forward into the midst of the tent causing every one to spring backwards the sparks were scattered in every direction and one fell on the net making a little blaze in an instant the hare had leaped through the hole and was racing towards the river with men women and children after him there was no time to call back the whales so holding the net tight in his mouth he wished himself across the river then he jumped high into the air and landed safe on the other side and after turning round to be sure that there was no chance of anyone pursuing him trotted happily home to his grandmother  didnt i tell you i would bring you fire said he holding up his net which was now burning briskly  but how did you cross the water inquired the old woman  oh i just jumped said he and his grandmother asked him no more questions for she saw that he was wiser than she  indian folk tales bureau of ethnology    the turtle and his bride    there was once a turtle who lived among a great many people of different kinds in a large camp near a big river which was born right up amongst the snows and flowed straight away south till it reached a sea where the water was always hot  there were many other turtles in the camp and this turtle was kind and pleasant to them all but he did not care for any of them very much and felt rather lonely  at last he built himself a hut and filled it with skins for seats and made it as comfortable as any hut for miles round and when it was quite finished he looked about among the young women to see which of them he should ask to be his wife  it took him some time to make up his mind for no turtle likes being hurried but at length he found one girl who seemed prettier and more industrious than the rest and one day he entered her home and said will you marry me  the young woman was so surprised at this question that she dropped the beaded slipper she was making and stared at the turtle she felt inclined to laughthe idea was so absurd but she was kindhearted and polite so she looked as grave as she could and answered  but how are you going to provide for a family why when the camp moves you will not even be able to keep up with the rest  i can keep up with the best of them replied the turtle tossing his head but though he was very much offended he did not let the girl see it and begged and prayed her so hard to marry him that at last she consented very unwillingly  you will have to wait till the spring though she said i must make a great many slippers and dresses for myself as i shall not have much time afterwards  this did not please the turtle but he knew it was no use talking so all he answered was  i shall go to war and take some captives and i shall be away several months and when i return i shall expect you to be ready to marry me  so he went back to his hut and at once set about his preparations the first thing he did was to call all his relations together and ask them if they would come with him and make war on the people of a neighbouring village the turtles who were tired of doing nothing agreed at once and next day the whole tribe left the camp the girl was standing at the door of her hut as they passed and laughed out loudthey moved so slowly her lover who was marching at the head grew very angry at this and cried out  in four days from now you will be weeping instead of laughing because there will be hundreds of miles between you and me  in four days replied the girlwho only promised to marry him in order to get rid of himin four days you will hardly be out of sight  oh i did not mean four days but four years answered the turtle hastily whatever happens i shall be back by then  the army marched on till one day when they felt as if they must have got half round the earth though they were scarcely four miles from the camp they found a large tree lying across their path they looked at it with dismay and the oldest among them put their heads together to see what was to be done  cant we manage to get past by the top asked one  why it would take us years exclaimed another just look at all those tall green branches spreading in every direction if once we got entangled in them we should never get out again  well then let us go round by the bottom said a third  how are we to do that when the roots have made a deep hole and above that is a high bank replied a fourth no the only way i can think of is to burn a large hole in the trunk and this they did but the trunk was very thick and would not burn through  it is no use we must give it up they agreed at last after all nobody need ever know we have been away such a long while that we might easily have had all sorts of adventures and so the whole company turned homewards again  they took even longer to go back than they had to come for they were tired and footsore with their journey when they drew near the camp they plucked up their courage and began to sing a warsong at this the villagers came flocking to see what spoils the turtles had won but as they approached each turtle seized some one by the wrist exclaiming you are our spoils you are our prisoners  now that i have got you i will keep you said the leader who had happened to seize his betrothed  everybody was naturally very angry at this behaviour and the girl most of all and in her secret heart she determined to have her revenge but just at present the turtles were too strong so the prisoners had to put on their smartest slippers and their brightest clothes and dance a war dance while the turtles sang they danced so long that it seemed as if they would never stop till the turtle who was leading the singing suddenly broke into a loud chant  whoever comes here will die will die  at this all the dancers grew so frightened that they burst through the ring of their captors and ran back to the village the turtles followingvery slowly on the way the chief turtle met a man who said to him  that woman who was to have been your wife has married another man  is that true said the turtle then i must see him  but as soon as the villager was out of sight the turtle stopped and taking a bundle containing fringes and ornaments from his back he hung them about him so that they rattled as he walked when he was quite close to the hut where the woman lived he cried out  here i am to claim the woman who promised to be my wife  oh here is the turtle whispered the husband hurriedly what is to be done now  leave that to me i will manage him replied the wife and at that moment the turtle came in and seized her by the wrist come with me he said sternly  you broke your promise answered she you said you would be back soon and it is more than a year since you went how was i to know that you were alive  at her words the husband took courage and spoke hastily  yes you promised you would go to war and bring back some prisoners and you have not done it  i did go and made many prisoners retorted the turtle angrily drawing out his knife look here if she wont be my wife she shant be yours i will cut her in two and you shall have one half and i the other  but half a woman is no use to me answered the man if you want her so much you had better take her and the turtle followed by his relations carried her off to his own hut  now the woman saw she would gain nothing by being sulky so she pretended to be very glad to have got rid of her husband but all the while she was trying to invent a plan to deliver herself from the turtle at length she remembered that one of her friends had a large iron pot and when the turtle had gone to his room to put away his fringes she ran over to her neighbours and brought it back then she filled it with water and hung it over the fire to boil it was just beginning to bubble and hiss when the turtle entered  what are you doing there asked he for he was always afraid of things that he did not understand  just warming some water she answered do you know how to swim  yes of course i do what a question but what does it matter to you said the turtle more suspicious than ever  oh i only thought that after your long journey you might like to wash the roads are so muddy after the winters rains i could rub your shell for you till it was bright and shining again  well i am rather muddy if one is fighting you know one cannot stop to pick ones way i should certainly be more comfortable if my back was washed  the woman did not wait for him to change his mind she caught him up by his shell and popped him straight into the pot where he sank to the bottom and died instantly  the other turtles who were standing at the door saw their leader disappear and felt it was their duty as soldiers to follow him and springing into the pot died too all but one young turtle who frightened at not seeing any of his friends come out again went as fast as he could to a clump of bushes and from there made his way to the river his only thought was to get away as far as possible from that dreadful hut so he let the river carry him where it was going itself and at last one day he found himself in the warm sea where if he is not dead you may meet him still  bureau of ethnology     how geirald the coward was punished    once upon a time there lived a poor knight who had a great many children and found it very hard to get enough for them to eat one day he sent his eldest son rosald a brave and honest youth to the neighbouring town to do some business and here rosald met a young man named geirald with whom he made friends  now geirald was the son of a rich man who was proud of the boy and had all his life allowed him to do whatever he fancied and luckily for the father he was prudent and sensible and did not waste money as many other rich young men might have done for some time he had set his heart on travelling into foreign countries and after he had been talking for a little while to rosald he asked if his new friend would be his companion on his journey  there is nothing i should like better answered rosald shaking his head sorrowfully but my father is very poor and he could never give me the money  oh if that is your only difficulty it is all right cried geirald my father has more money than he knows what to do with and he will give me as much as i want for both of us only there is one thing you must promise me rosald that supposing we have any adventures you will let the honour and glory of them fall to me  yes of course that is only fair answered rosald who never cared about putting himself forward but i cannot go without telling my parents i am sure they will think me lucky to get such a chance  as soon as the business was finished rosald hastened home his parents were delighted to hear of his good fortune and his father gave him his own sword which was growing rusty for want of use while his mother saw that his leather jerkin was in order  be sure you keep the promise you made to geirald said she as she bade him goodbye and come what may see that you never betray him  full of joy rosald rode off and the next day he and geirald started off to seek adventures to their disappointment their own land was so well governed that nothing out of the common was very likely to happen but directly they crossed the border into another kingdom all seemed lawlessness and confusion  they had not gone very far when riding across a mountain they caught a glimpse of several armed men hiding amongst some trees in their path and remembered suddenly some talk they had heard of a band of twelve robbers who lay in wait for rich travellers the robbers were more like savage beasts than men and lived somewhere at the top of the mountain in caves and holes in the ground they were all called hankur and were distinguished one from another by the name of a colourblue grey red and so on except their chief who was known as hankur the tall all this and more rushed into the minds of the two young men as they saw the flash of their swords in the moonlight  it is impossible to fight themthey are twelve to two whispered geirald stopping his horse in the path we had much better ride back and take the lower road it would be stupid to throw away our lives like this  oh we cant turn back answered rosald we should be ashamed to look anyone in the face again and besides it is a grand opportunity to show what we are made of let us tie up our horses here and climb up the rocks so that we can roll stones down on them  well we might try that and then we shall always have our horses said geirald so they went up the rocks silently and carefully  the robbers were lying all ready expecting every moment to see their victims coming round the corner a few yards away when a shower of huge stones fell on their heads killing half the band the others sprang up the rock but as they reached the top the sword of rosald swung round and one man after another rolled down into the valley at last the chief managed to spring up and grasping rosald by the waist flung away his sword and the two fought desperately their bodies swaying always nearer the edge it seemed as if rosald being the smaller of the two must fall over when with his left hand he drew the robbers sword out of its sheath and plunged it into his heart then he took from the dead man a beautiful ring set with a large stone and put it on his own finger  the fame of this wonderful deed soon spread through the country and people would often stop geiralds horse and ask leave to see the robbers ring which was said to have been stolen from the father of the reigning king and geirald showed them the ring with pride and listened to their words of praise and no one would ever have guessed anyone else had destroyed the robbers  in a few days they left the kingdom and rode on to another where they thought they would stop through the remainder of the winter for geirald liked to be comfortable and did not care about travelling through ice and snow but the king would only grant them leave to stop on condition that before the winter was ended they should give him some fresh proof of the courage of which he had heard so much rosalds heart was glad at the kings message and as for geirald he felt that as long as rosald was there all would go well so they both bowed low and replied that it was the kings place to command and theirs to obey  well then said his majesty this is what i want you to do in the northeast part of my kingdom there dwells a giant who has an iron staff twenty yards long and he is so quick in using it that even fifty knights have no chance against him the bravest and strongest young men of my court have fallen under the blows of that staff but as you overcame the twelve robbers so easily i feel that i have reason to hope that you may be able to conquer the giant in three days from this you will set out  we will be ready your majesty answered rosald but geirald remained silent  how can we possibly fight against a giant that has killed fifty knights cried geirald when they were outside the castle the king only wants to get rid of us he wont think about us for the next three daysthat is one comfortso we shall have plenty of time to cross the borders of the kingdom and be out of reach  we maynt be able to kill the giant but we certainly cant run away till we have tried answered rosald besides think how glorious it will be if we do manage to kill him i know what sort of weapon i shall use come with me now and i will see about it and taking his friend by the arm he led him into a shop where he bought a huge lump of solid iron so big that they could hardly lift it between them however they just managed to carry it to a blacksmiths where rosald directed that it should be beaten into a thick club with a sharp spike at one end when this was done to his liking he took it home under his arm  very early on the third morning the two young men started on their journey and on the fourth day they reached the giants cave before he was out of bed hearing the sound of footsteps the giant got up and went to the entrance to see who was coming and rosald expecting something of the sort struck him such a blow on the forehead that he fell to the ground then before he could rise to his feet again rosald drew out his sword and cut off his head  it was not so difficult after all you see he said turning to geirald and placing the giants head in a leathern wallet which was slung over his back they began their journey to the castle  as they drew near the gates rosald took the head from the wallet and handed it to geirald whom he followed into the kings presence  the giant will trouble you no more said geirald holding out the head and the king fell on his neck and kissed him and cried joyfully that he was the bravest knight in all the world and that a feast should be made for him and rosald and that the great deed should be proclaimed throughout the kingdom and geiralds heart swelled with pride and he almost forgot that it was rosald and not he who had slain the giant  byandby a whisper went round that a beautiful lady who lived in the castle would be present at the feast with twentyfour lovely maidens her attendants the lady was the queen of her own country but as her father and mother had died when she was a little girl she had been left in the care of this king who was her uncle  she was now old enough to govern her own kingdom but her subjects did not like being ruled by a woman and said that she must find a husband to help her in managing her affairs prince after prince had offered himself but the young queen would have nothing to say to any of them and at last told her ministers that if she was to have a husband at all she must choose him for herself as she would certainly not marry any of those whom they had selected for her the ministers replied that in that case she had better manage her kingdom alone and the queen who knew nothing about business got things into such a confusion that at last she threw them up altogether and went off to her uncle  now when she heard how the two young men had slain the giant her heart was filled with admiration of their courage and she declared that if a feast was held she would certainly be present at it  and so she was and when the feast was over she asked the king her guardian if he would allow the two heroes who had killed the robbers and slain the giant to fight a tourney the next day with one of her pages the king gladly gave his consent and ordered the lists to be made ready never doubting that two great champions would be eager for such a chance of adding to their fame little did he guess that geirald had done all he could to persuade rosald to steal secretly out of the castle during the night for said he i dont believe they are pages at all but wellproved knights and how can we so young and untried stand up against them  the honour will be all the higher if we gain the day answered rosald but geirald would listen to nothing and only declared that he did not care about honour and would rather be alive than have every honour in the world heaped upon him go he would and as rosald had sworn to give him his company he must come with him  rosald was much grieved when he heard these words but he knew that it was useless attempting to persuade geirald and turned his thoughts to forming some plan to prevent this disgraceful flight suddenly his face brightened let us change clothes he said and i will do the fighting while you shall get the glory nobody will ever know and to this geirald readily consented  whether geirald was right or not in thinking that the socalled page was really a wellproved knight it is certain that rosalds task was a very hard one three times they came together with a crash which made their horses reel once rosald knocked the helmet off his foe and received in return such a blow that he staggered in his saddle shouts went up from the lookerson as first one and then the other seemed gaining the victory but at length rosald planted his spear in the armour which covered his adversarys breast and bore him steadily backward unhorsed unhorsed cried the people and rosald then himself dismounted and helped his adversary to rise  in the confusion that followed it was easy for rosald to slip away and return geirald his proper clothes and in these torn and dusty with the fight geirald answered the kings summons to come before him  you have done what i expected you to do said he and now choose your reward  grant me sire the hand of the queen your niece replied the young man bowing low and i will defend her kingdom against all her enemies  she could choose no better husband said the king and if she consents i do and he turned towards the queen who had not been present during the fight but had just slipped into a seat by his right hand now the queens eyes were very sharp and it seemed to her that the man who stood before her tall and handsome though he might be was different in many slight ways and in one in particular from the man who had fought the tourney how there could be any trickery she could not understand and why the real victor should be willing to give up his prize to another was still stranger but something in her heart warned her to be careful she answered you may be satisfied uncle but i am not one more proof i must have let the two young men now fight against each other the man i marry must be the man who killed the robbers and the giant and overcame my page geiralds face grew pale as he heard these words he knew there was no escape from him now though he did not doubt for one moment that rosald would keep his compact loyally to the last but how would it be possible that even rosald should deceive the watchful eyes of the king and his court and still more those of the young queen whom he felt uneasily had suspected him from the first  the tourney was fought and in spite of geiralds fears rosald managed to hang back to make attacks which were never meant to succeed and to allow strokes which he could easily have parried to attain their end at length after a great show of resistance he fell heavily to the ground and as he fell he knew that it was not alone the glory that was his rightfully which he gave up but the hand of the queen that was more precious still  but geirald did not even wait to see if he was wounded he went straight to the wall where the royal banner waved and claimed the reward which was now his  the crowd of watchers turned towards the queen expecting to see her stoop and give some token to the victor instead to the surprise of everyone she merely smiled gracefully and said that before she bestowed her hand one more test must be imposed but this should be the last the final tourney should be fought geirald and rosald should meet singly two knights of the kings court and he who could unhorse his foe should be master of herself and of her kingdom the combat was fixed to take place at ten oclock the following day  all night long geirald walked about his room not daring to face the fight that lay in front of him and trying with all his might to discover some means of escaping it all night long he moved restlessly from door to window and when the trumpets sounded and the combatants rode into the field he alone was missing the king sent messengers to see what had become of him and he was found trembling with fear hiding under his bed after that there was no need of any further proof the combat was declared unnecessary and the queen pronounced herself quite satisfied and ready to accept rosald as her husband  you forgot one thing she said when they were alone i recognized my fathers ring which hankur the tall had stolen on the finger of your right hand and i knew that it was you and not geirald who had slain the robber band i was the page who fought you and again i saw the ring on your finger though it was absent from his when he stood before me to claim the prize that was why i ordered the combat between you though your faith to your word prevented my plan being successful and i had to try another the man who keeps his promise at all costs to himself is the man i can trust both for myself and for my people  so they were married and returned to their own kingdom which they ruled well and happily and many years after a poor beggar knocked at the palace gates and asked for money for the sake of days gone byand this was geirald  from neuislandischem volksmarcher     habogi    once upon a time there lived two peasants who had three daughters and as generally happens the youngest was the most beautiful and the best tempered and when her sisters wanted to go out she was always ready to stay at home and do their work  years passed quickly with the whole family and one day the parents suddenly perceived that all three girls were grown up and that very soon they would be thinking of marriage  have you decided what your husbands name is to be said the father laughingly to his eldest daughter one evening when they were all sitting at the door of their cottage you know that is a very important point  yes i will never wed any man who is not called sigmund answered she  well it is lucky for you that there are a great many sigmunds in this part of the world replied her father so that you can take your choice and what do you say he added turning to the second  oh i think that there is no name so beautiful as sigurd cried she  then you wont be an old maid either answered he there are seven sigurds in the next village alone and you helga  helga who was still the prettiest of the three looked up she also had her favourite name but just as she was going to say it she seemed to hear a voice whisper marry no one who is not called habogi  the girl had never heard of such a name and did not like it so she determined to pay no attention but as she opened her mouth to tell her father that her husband must be called njal she found herself answering instead if i do marry it will be to no one except habogi  who is habogi asked her father and sisters we never heard of such a person  all i can tell you is that he will be my husband if ever i have one returned helga and that was all she would say  before very long the young men who lived in the neighbouring villages or on the sides of the mountains had heard of this talk of the three girls and sigmunds and sigurds in scores came to visit the little cottage there were other young men too who bore different names though not one of them was called habogi and these thought that they might perhaps gain the heart of the youngest but though there was more than one njal amongst them helgas eyes seemed always turned another way  at length the two elder sisters made their choice from out of the sigurds and the sigmunds and it was decided that both weddings should take place at the same time invitations were sent out to the friends and relations and when on the morning of the great day they were all assembled a rough coarse old peasant left the crowd and came up to the brides father  my name is habogi and helga must be my wife was all he said and though helga stood pale and trembling with surprise she did not try to run away  i cannot talk of such things just now answered the father who could not bear the thought of giving his favourite daughter to this horrible old man and hoped by putting it off that something might happen but the sisters who had always been rather jealous of helga were secretly pleased that their bridegrooms should outshine hers  when the feast was over habogi led up a beautiful horse from a field where he had left it to graze and bade helga jump up on its splendid saddle all embroidered in scarlet and gold you shall come back again said he but now you must see the house that you are to live in and though helga was very unwilling to go something inside her forced her to obey  the old man settled her comfortably then sprang up in front of her as easily as if he had been a boy and shaking the reins they were soon out of sight  after some miles they rode through a meadow with grass so green that helgas eyes felt quite dazzled and feeding on the grass were a quantity of large fat sheep with the curliest and whitest wool in the world  what lovely sheep whose are they cried helga  your habogis answered he all that you see belongs to him but the finest sheep in the whole herd which has little golden bells hanging between its horns you shall have for yourself  this pleased helga very much for she had never had anything of her own and she smiled quite happily as she thanked habogi for his present  they soon left the sheep behind them and entered a large field with a river running through it where a number of beautiful grey cows were standing by a gate waiting for a milkmaid to come and milk them  oh what lovely cows cried helga again i am sure their milk must be sweeter than any other cows how i should like to have some i wonder to whom they belong  to your habogi replied he and some day you shall have as much milk as you like but we cannot stop now do you see that big grey one with the silver bells between her horns that is to be yours and you can have her milked every morning the moment you wake  and helgas eyes shone and though she did not say anything she thought that she would learn to milk the cow herself  a mile further on they came to a wide common with short springy turf where horses of all colours with skins of satin were kicking up their heels in play the sight of them so delighted helga that she nearly sprang from her saddle with a shriek of joy  whose are they oh whose are they she asked how happy any man must be who is the master of such lovely creatures  they are your habogis replied he and the one which you think the most beautiful of all you shall have for yourself and learn to ride him  at this helga quite forgot the sheep and the cow  a horse of my own said she oh stop one moment and let me see which i will choose the white one no the chestnut no i think after all i like the coalblack one best with the little white star on his forehead oh do stop just for a minute  but habogi would not stop or listen when you are married you will have plenty of time to choose one was all he answered and they rode on two or three miles further  at length habogi drew rein before a small house very ugly and meanlooking and that seemed on the point of tumbling to pieces  this is my house and is to be yours said habogi as he jumped down and held out his arms to lift helga from the horse the girls heart sank a little as she thought that the man who possessed such wonderful sheep and cows and horses might have built himself a prettier place to live in but she did not say so and taking her arm he led her up the steps  but when she got inside she stood quite bewildered at the beauty of all around her none of her friends owned such things not even the miller who was the richest man she knew there were carpets everywhere thick and soft and of deep rich colours and the cushions were of silk and made you sleepy even to look at them and curious little figures in china were scattered about helga felt as if it would take her all her life to see everything properly and it only seemed a second since she had entered the house when habogi came up to her  i must begin the preparations for our wedding at once he said but my fosterbrother will take you home as i promised in three days he will bring you back here with your parents and sisters and any guests you may invite in your company by that time the feast will be ready  helga had so much to think about that the ride home appeared very short her father and mother were delighted to see her as they did not feel sure that so ugly and crosslooking a man as habogi might not have played her some cruel trick and after they had given her some supper they begged her to tell them all she had done but helga only told them that they should see for themselves on the third day when they would come to her wedding  it was very early in the morning when the party set out and helgas two sisters grew green with envy as they passed the flocks of sheep and cows and horses and heard that the best of each was given to helga herself but when they caught sight of the poor little house which was to be her home their hearts grew light again  i should be ashamed of living in such a place whispered each to the other and the eldest sister spoke of the carved stone over her doorway and the second boasted of the number of rooms she had but the moment they went inside they were struck dumb with rage at the splendour of everything and their faces grew white and cold with fury when they saw the dress which habogi had prepared for his bridea dress that glittered like sunbeams dancing upon ice  she shall not look so much finer than us they cried passionately to each other as soon as they were alone and when night came they stole out of their rooms and taking out the weddingdress they laid it in the ashpit and heaped ashes upon it but habogi who knew a little magic and had guessed what they would do changed the ashes into roses and cast a spell over the sisters so that they could not leave the spot for a whole day and every one who passed by mocked at them  the next morning when they all awoke the ugly tumbledown house had disappeared and in its place stood a splendid palace the guests eyes sought in vain for the bridegroom but could only see a handsome young man with a coat of blue velvet and silver and a gold crown upon his head  who is that they asked helga  that is my habogi said she  from neuislandischem volksmarcher    how the little brother set free his big brothers    in a small hut right in the middle of the forest lived a man his wife three sons and a daughter for some reason all the animals seemed to have left that part of the country and food grew very scarce so one morning after a night of snow when the tracks of beasts might be easily seen the three boys started off to hunt  they kept together for some time till they reached a place where the path they had been following split into two and one of the brothers called his dog and went to the left while the others took the trail to the right these had not gone far when their dogs scented a bear and drove him out from the thicket the bear ran across a clearing and the elder brother managed to place an arrow right in his head  they both took up the bear and carried it towards home meeting the third at the spot where they had parted from him when they reached home they threw the bear down on the floor of the hut saying  father here is a bear which we killed now we can have some dinner  but the father who was in a bad temper only said  when i was a young man we used to get two bears in one day  the sons were rather disappointed at hearing this and though there was plenty of meat to last for two or three days they started off early in the morning down the same trail that they had followed before as they drew near the fork a bear suddenly ran out from behind a tree and took the path on the right the two elder boys and their dogs pursued him and soon the second son who was also a good shot killed him instantly with an arrow at the fork of the trail on their way home they met the youngest who had taken the lefthand road and had shot a bear for himself but when they threw the two bears triumphantly on the floor of the hut their father hardly looked at them and only said  when i was a young man i used to get three bears in one day  the next day they were luckier than before and brought back three bears on which their father told them that he had always killed four however that did not prevent him from skinning the bears and cooking them in a way of his own which he thought very good and they all ate an excellent supper  now these bears were the servants of the great bear chief who lived in a high mountain a long way off and every time a bear was killed his shadow returned to the house of the bear chief with the marks of his wounds plainly to bee seen by the rest  the chief was furious at the number of bears the hunters had killed and determined that he would find some way of destroying them so he called another of his servants and said to him  go to the thicket near the fork where the boys killed your brothers and directly they or the dogs see you return here as fast as ever you can the mountain will open to let you in and the hunters will follow you then i shall have them in my power and be able to revenge myself  the servant bowed low and started at once for the fork where he hid himself in the bushes  byandby the boys came in sight but this time there were only two of them as the youngest had stayed at home the air was warm and damp and the snow soft and slushy and the elder brothers bowstring hung loose while the bow of the younger caught in a tree and snapped in half at that moment the dogs began to bark loudly and the bear rushed out of the thicket and set off in the direction of the mountain without thinking that they had nothing to defend themselves with should the bear turn and attack them the boys gave chase the bear who knew quite well that he could not be shot sometimes slackened his pace and let the dogs get quite close and in this way the elder son reached the mountain without observing it while his brother who had hurt his foot was still far behind  as he ran up the mountain opened to admit the bear and the boy who was close on his heels rushed in after him and did not know where he was till he saw bears sitting on every side of him holding a council the animal he had been chasing sank panting in their midst and the boy very much frightened stood still letting his bow fall to the ground  why are you trying to kill all my servants asked the chief look round and see their shades with arrows sticking in them it was i who told the bear today how he was to lure you into my power i shall take care that you shall not hurt my people any more because you will become a bear yourself  at this moment the second brother came upfor the mountain had been left open on purpose to tempt him alsoand cried out breathlessly dont you see that the bear is lying close to you why dont you shoot him and without waiting for a reply pressed forward to drive his arrow into the heart of the bear but the elder one caught his raised arm and whispered be quiet cant you tell where you are then the boy looked up and saw the angry bears about him on the one side were the servants of the chief and on the other the servants of the chiefs sister who was sorry for the two youths and begged that their lives might be spared the chief answered that he would not kill them but only cast a spell over them by which their heads and bodies should remain as they were but their arms and legs should change into those of a bear so that they would go on all fours for the rest of their lives and stooping over a spring of water he dipped a handful of moss in it and rubbed it over the arms and legs of the boys in an instant the transformation took place and two creatures neither beast nor human stood before the chief  now the bear chief of course knew that the boys father would seek for his sons when they did not return home so he sent another of his servants to the hidingplace at the fork of the trail to see what would happen he had not waited long when the father came in sight stooping as he went to look for his sons tracks in the snow when he saw the marks of snowshoes along the path on the right he was filled with joy not knowing that the servant had made some fresh tracks on purpose to mislead him and he hastened forward so fast that he fell headlong into a pit where the bear was sitting before he could pick himself up the bear had quietly broken his neck and hiding the body under the snow sat down to see if anyone else would pass that way  meanwhile the mother at home was wondering what had become of her two sons and as the hours went on and their father never returned she made up her mind to go and look for him the youngest boy begged her to let him undertake the search but she would not hear of it and told him he must stay at home and take care of his sister so slipping on her snowshoes she started on her way  as no fresh snow had fallen the trail was quite easy to find and she walked straight on till it led her up to the pit where the bear was waiting for her he grasped her as she fell and broke her neck after which he laid her in the snow beside her husband and went back to tell the bear chief  hour after hour dragged heavily by in the forest hut and at last the brother and sister felt quite sure that in some way or other all the rest of the family had perished day after day the boy climbed to the top of a tall tree near the house and sat there till he was almost frozen looking on all sides through the forest openings hoping that he might see someone coming along very soon all the food in the house was eaten and he knew he would have to go out and hunt for more besides he wished to seek for his parents  the little girl did not like being left alone in the hut and cried bitterly but her brother told her that there was no use sitting down quietly to starve and that whether he found any game or not he would certainly be back before the following night then he cut himself some arrows each from a different tree and winged with the feathers of four different birds he then made himself a bow very light and strong and got down his snowshoes all this took some time and he could not start that day but early next morning he called his little dog redmouth whom he kept in a box and set out  after he had followed the trail for a great distance he grew very tired and sat upon the branch of a tree to rest but redmouth barked so furiously that the boy thought that perhaps his parents might have been killed under its branches and stepping back shot one of his arrows at the root of the tree whereupon a noise like thunder shook it from top to bottom fire broke out and in a few minutes a little heap of ashes lay in the place where it had stood  not knowing quite what to make of it all the boy continued on the trail and went down the righthand fork till he came to the clump of bushes where the bears used to hide  now as was plain by his being able to change the shape of the two brothers the bear chief knew a good deal of magic and he was quite aware that the little boy was following the trail and he sent a very small but clever bear servant to wait for him in the bushes and to try to tempt him into the mountain but somehow his spells could not have worked properly that day as the bear chief did not know that redmouth had gone with his master or he would have been more careful for the moment the dog ran round the bushes barking loudly the little bear servant rushed out in a fright and set out for the mountains as fast as he could  the dog followed the bear and the boy followed the dog until the mountain the house of the great bear chief came in sight but along the road the snow was so wet and heavy that the boy could hardly get along and then the thong of his snowshoes broke and he had to stop and mend it so that the bear and the dog got so far ahead that he could scarcely hear the barking when the strap was firm again the boy spoke to his snowshoes and said  now you must go as fast as you can or if not i shall lose the dog as well as the bear and the snowshoes sang in answer that they would run like the wind  as he came along the bear chiefs sister was looking out of the window and took pity on this little brother as she had on the two elder ones and waited to see what the boy would do when he found that the bear servant and the dog had already entered the mountain  the little brother was certainly very much puzzled at not seeing anything of either of the animals which had vanished suddenly out of his sight he paused for an instant to think what he should do next and while he did so he fancied he heard redmouths voice on the opposite side of the mountain with great difficulty he scrambled over steep rocks and forced a path through tangled thickets but when he reached the other side the sound appeared to start from the place from which he had come then he had to go all the way back again and at the very top where he stopped to rest the barking was directly beneath him and he knew in an instant where he was and what had happened  let my dog out at once bear chief cried he if you do not i shall destroy your palace but the bear chief only laughed and said nothing the boy was very angry at his silence and aiming one of his arrows at the bottom of the mountain shot straight through it  as the arrow touched the ground a rumbling was heard and with a roar a fire broke out which seemed to split the whole mountain into pieces the bear chief and all his servants were burnt up in the flames but his sister and all that belonged to her were spared because she had tried to save the two elder boys from punishment  as soon as the fire had burnt itself out the little hunter entered what was left of the mountain and the first thing he saw was his two brothershalf bear half boy  oh help us help us cried they standing on their hind legs as they spoke and stretching out their forepaws to him  but how am i to help you asked the little brother almost weeping i can kill people and destroy trees and mountains but i have no power over men and the two elder brothers came up and put their paws on his shoulders and they all three wept together  the heart of the bear chiefs sister was moved when she saw their misery and she came gently up behind and whispered  little boy gather some moss from the spring over there and let your brothers smell it  with a bound all three were at the spring and as the youngest plucked a handful of wet moss the two others sniffed at it with all their might then the bearskin fell away from them and they stood upright once more  how can we thank you how can we thank you they stammered hardly able to speak and fell at her feet in gratitude but the bears sister only smiled and bade them go home and look after the little girl who had no one else to protect her  and this the boys did and took such good care of their sister that as she was very small she soon forgot that she had ever had a father and mother  from the bureau of ethnology us     the sacred milk of koumongoe    far way in a very hot country there once lived a man and woman who had two children a son named koane and a daughter called thakane  early in the morning and late in the evenings the parents worked hard in the fields resting when the sun was high under the shade of some tree while they were absent the little girl kept house alone for her brother always got up before the dawn when the air was fresh and cool and drove out the cattle to the sweetest patches of grass he could find  one day when koane had slept later than usual his father and mother went to their work before him and there was only thakane to be seen busy making the bread for supper  thakane he said i am thirsty give me a drink from the tree koumongoe which has the best milk in the world  oh koane cried his sister you know that we are forbidden to touch that tree what would father say when he came home for he would be sure to know  nonsense replied koane there is so much milk in koumongoe that he will never miss a little if you wont give it to me i shant take the cattle out they will just have to stay all day in the hut and you know that they will starve and he turned from her in a rage and sat down in the corner  after a while thakane said to him it is getting hot had you better drive out the cattle now  but koane only answered sulkily i told you i am not going to drive them out at all if i have to do without milk they shall do without grass  thakane did not know what to do she was afraid to disobey her parents who would most likely beat her yet the beasts would be sure to suffer if they were kept in and she would perhaps be beaten for that too so at last she took an axe and a tiny earthen bowl she cut a very small hole in the side of koumongoe and out gushed enough milk to fill the bowl  here is the milk you wanted said she going up to koane who was still sulking in his corner  what is the use of that grumbled koane why there is not enough to drown a fly go and get me three times as much  trembling with fright thakane returned to the tree and struck it a sharp blow with the axe in an instant there poured forth such a stream of milk that it ran like a river into the hut  koane koane cried she come and help me to plug up the hole there will be no milk left for our father and mother but koane could not stop it any more than thakane and soon the milk was flowing through the hut downhill towards their parents in the fields below  the man saw a white stream a long way off and guessed what had happened  wife wife he called loudly to the woman who was working at a little distance do you see koumongoe running fast down the hill that is some mischief of the childrens i am sure i must go home and find out what is the matter and they both threw down their hoes and hurried to the side of koumongoe  kneeling on the grass the man and his wife made a cup of their hands and drank the milk from it and no sooner had they done this than koumongoe flowed back again up the hill and entered the hut  thakane said the parents severely when they reached home panting from the heat of the sun what have you been doing why did koumongoe come to us in the fields instead of staying in the garden  it was koanes fault answered thakane he would not take the cattle to feed until he drank some of the milk from koumongoe so as i did not know what else to do i gave it to him  the father listened to thakanes words but made no answer instead he went outside and brought in two sheepskins which he stained red and sent for a blacksmith to forge some iron rings the rings were then passed over thakanes arms and legs and neck and the skins fastened on her before and behind when all was ready the man sent for his servants and said  i am going to get rid of thakane  get rid of your only daughter they answered in surprise but why  because she has eaten what she ought not to have eaten she has touched the sacred tree which belongs to her mother and me alone and turning his back he called to thakane to follow him and they went down the road which led to the dwelling of an ogre  they were passing along some fields where the corn was ripening when a rabbit suddenly sprang out at their feet and standing on its hind legs it sang  why do you give to the ogre your child so fair so fair  you had better ask her replied the man she is old enough to give you an answer  then in her turn thakane sang  i gave koumongoe to koane koumongoe to the keeper of beasts for without koumongoe they could not go to the meadows without koumongoe they would starve in the hut that was why i gave him the koumongoe of my father  and when the rabbit heard that he cried wretched man it is you whom the ogre should eat and not your beautiful daughter  but the father paid no heed to what the rabbit said and only walked on the faster bidding thakane to keep close behind him byandby they met with a troop of great deer called elands and they stopped when they saw thakane and sang  why do you give to the ogre your child so fair so fair  you had better ask her replied the man she is old enough to give you an answer  then in her turn thakane sang  i gave koumongoe to koane koumongoe to the keeper of beasts for without koumongoe they could not go to the meadows without koumongoe they would starve in the hut that was why i gave him the koumongoe of my father  and the elands all cried wretched man it is you whom the ogre should eat and not your beautiful daughter  by this time it was nearly dark and the father said they could travel no further that night and must go to sleep where they were thakane was thankful indeed when she heard this for she was very tired and found the two skins fastened round her almost too heavy to carry so in spite of her dread of the ogre she slept till dawn when her father woke her and told her roughly that he was ready to continue their journey  crossing the plain the girl and her father passed a herd of gazelles feeding they lifted their heads wondering who was out so early and when they caught sight of thakane they sang  why do you give to the ogre your child so fair so fair  you had better ask her replied the man she is old enough to answer for herself  then in her turn thakane sang  i gave koumongoe to koane koumongoe to the keeper of beasts for without koumongoe they could not go to the meadows without koumongoe they would starve in the hut that was why i gave him the koumongoe of my father  and the gazelles all cried wretched man it is you whom the ogre should eat and not your beautiful daughter  at last they arrived at the village where the ogre lived and they went straight to his hut he was nowhere to be seen but in his place was his son masilo who was not an ogre at all but a very polite young man he ordered his servants to bring a pile of skins for thakane to sit on but told her father he must sit on the ground then catching sight of the girls face which she had kept down he was struck by its beauty and put the same question that the rabbit and the elands and the gazelles had done  thakane answered him as before and he instantly commanded that she should be taken to the hut of his mother and placed under her care while the man should be led to his father directly the ogre saw him he bade the servant throw him into the great pot which always stood ready on the fire and in five minutes he was done to a turn after that the servant returned to masilo and related all that had happened  now masilo had fallen in loved with thakane the moment he saw her at first he did not know what to make of this strange feeling for all his life he had hated women and had refused several brides whom his parents had chosen for him however they were so anxious that he should marry that they willingly accepted thakane as their daughterinlaw though she did bring any marriage portion with her  after some time a baby was born to her and thakane thought it was the most beautiful baby that ever was seen but when her motherinlaw saw it was a girl she wrung her hands and wept saying  o miserable mother miserable child alas for you why were you not a boy  thakane in great surprise asked the meaning of her distress and the old woman told her that it was the custom in that country that all the girls who were born should be given to the ogre to eat  then thakane clasped the baby tightly in her arms and cried  but it is not the customer in my country there when children die they are buried in the earth no one shall take my baby from me  that night when everyone in the hut was asleep thakane rose and carrying her baby on her back went down to a place where the river spread itself out into a large lake with tall willows all round the bank here hidden from everyone she sat down on a stone and began to think what she should do to save her child  suddenly she heard a rustling among the willows and an old woman appeared before her  what are you crying for my dear said she  and thakane answered i was crying for my babyi cannot hide her for ever and if the ogre sees her he will eat her and i would rather she was drowned than that  what you say is true replied the old woman give me your child and let me take care of it and if you will fix a day to meet me here i will bring the baby  then thakane dried her eyes and gladly accepted the old womans offer when she got home she told her husband she had thrown it in the river and as he had watched her go in that direction he never thought of doubting what she said  on the appointed day thakane slipped out when everybody was busy and ran down the path that led to the lake as soon as she got there she crouched down among the willows and sang softly  bring to me dilah dilah the rejected one dilah whom her father masilo cast out  and in a moment the old woman appeared holding the baby in her arms dilah had become so big and strong that thakanes heart was filled with joy and gratitude and she stayed as long as she dared playing with her baby at last she felt she must return to the village lest she should be missed and the child was handed back to the old woman who vanished with her into the lake  children grow up very quickly when they live under water and in less time than anyone could suppose dilah had changed from a baby to a woman her mother came to visit her whenever she was able and one day when they were sitting talking together they were spied out by a man who had come to cut willows to weave into baskets he was so surprised to see how like the face of the girl was to masilo that he left his work and returned to the village  masilo he said as he entered the hut i have just beheld your wife near the river with a girl who must be your daughter she is so like you we have been deceived for we all thought she was dead  when he heard this masilo tried to look shocked because his wife had broken the law but in his heart he was very glad  but what shall we do now asked he  make sure for yourself that i am speaking the truth by hiding among the bushes the first time thakane says she is going to bathe in the river and waiting till the girl appears  for some days thakane stayed quietly at home and her husband began to think that the man had been mistaken but at last she said to her husband i am going to bathe in the river  well you can go answered he but he ran down quickly by another path and got there first and hid himself in the bushes an instant later thakane arrived and standing on the bank she sang  bring to me dilah dilah the rejected one dilah whom her father masilo cast out  then the old woman came out of the water holding the girl now tall and slender by the hand and as masilo looked he saw that she was indeed his daughter and he wept for joy that she was not lying dead in the bottom of the lake the old woman however seemed uneasy and said to thakane i feel as if someone was watching us i will not leave the girl today but will take her back with me and sinking beneath the surface she drew the girl after her after they had gone thakane returned to the village which masilo had managed to reach before her  all the rest of the day he sat in a corner weeping and his mother who came in asked why are you weeping so bitterly my son  my head aches he answered it aches very badly and his mother passed on and left him alone  in the evening he said to his wife i have seen my daughter in the place where you told me you had drowned her instead she lives at the bottom of the lake and has now grown into a young woman  i dont know what you are talking about replied thakane i buried my child under the sand on the beach  then masilo implored her to give the child back to him but she would not listen and only answered if i were to give her back you would only obey the laws of your country and take her to your father the ogre and she would be eaten  but masilo promised that he would never let his father see her and that now she was a woman no one would try to hurt her so thakanes heart melted and she went down to the lake to consult the old woman  what am i to do she asked when after clapping her hands the old woman appeared before her yesterday masilo beheld dilah and ever since he has entreated me to give him back his daughter  if i let her go he must pay me a thousand head of cattle in exchange replied the old woman and thakane carried her answer back to masilo  why i would gladly give her two thousand cried he for she has saved my daughter and he bade messengers hasten to all the neighbouring villages and tell his people to send him at once all the cattle he possessed when they were all assembled he chose a thousand of the finest bulls and cows and drove them down to the river followed by a great crowd wondering what would happen  then thakane stepped forward in front of the cattle and sang  bring to me dilah dilah the rejected one dilah whom her father masilo cast out  and dilah came from the waters holding out her hands to masilo and thakane and in her place the cattle sank into the lake and were driven by the old woman to the great city filled with people which lies at the bottom  contes populaires des bassoutos     the wicked wolverine    one day a wolverine was out walking on the hillside when on turning a corner he suddenly saw a large rock  was that you i heard walking about just now he asked for wolverines are cautious animals and always like to know the reasons of things  no certainly not answered the rock i dont know how to walk  but i saw you walking continued the wolverine  i am afraid that you were not taught to speak the truth retorted the rock  you need not speak like that for i have seen you walking replied the wolverine though i am quite sure that you could never catch me and he ran a little distance and then stopped to see if the rock was pursuing him but to his vexation the rock was still in the same place then the wolverine went up close and struck the rock a blow with his paw saying well will you catch me now  i cant walk but i can roll answered the rock  and the wolverine laughed and said oh that will do just as well and began to run down the side of the mountain  at first he went quite slowly just to give the rock a chance he thought to himself but soon he quickened his pace for he found that the rock was almost at his heels but the faster the wolverine ran the faster the rock rolled and byandby the little creature began to get very tired and was sorry he had not left the rock to itself thinking that if he could manage to put on a spurt he would reach the forest of great trees at the bottom of the mountain where the rock could not come he gathered up all his strength and instead of running he leaped over sticks and stones but whatever he did the rock was always close behind him at length he grew so weary that he could not even see where he was going and catching his foot in a branch he tripped and fell the rock stopped at once but there came a shriek from the wolverine  get off get off cant you see that you are on my legs  why did you not leave me alone asked the rock i did not want to movei hate moving but you would have it and i certainly shant move now till i am forced to  i will call my brothers answered the wolverine there are many of them in the forest and you will soon see that they are stronger than you and he called and called and called till wolves and foxes and all sorts of other creatures all came running to see what was the matter  how did you get under that rock asked they making a ring round him but they had to repeat their question several times before the wolverine would answer for he like many other persons found it hard to confess that he had brought his troubles on himself  well i was dull and wanted someone to play with me he said at last in sulky voice and i challenged the rock to catch me of course i thought i could run the fastest but i tripped and it rolled on me it was just an accident  it serves you right for being so silly said they but they pushed and hauled at the rock for a long time without making it move an inch  you are no good at all cried the wolverine crossly for it was suffering great pain and if you cannot get me free i shall see what my friends the lightning and thunder can do and he called loudly to the lightning to come and help him as quickly as possible  in a few minutes a dark cloud came rolling up the sky giving out such terrific claps of thunder that the wolves and the foxes and all the other creatures ran helterskelter in all directions but frightened though they were they did not forget to beg the lightning to take off the wolverines coat and to free his legs but to be careful not to hurt him so the lightning disappeared into the cloud for a moment to gather up fresh strength and then came rushing down right upon the rock which it sent flying in all directions and took the wolverines coat so neatly that though it was torn into tiny shreds the wolverine himself was quite unharmed  that was rather clumsy of you said he standing up naked in his flesh surely you could have split the rock without tearing my coat to bits and he stooped down to pick up the pieces it took him a long time for there were a great many of them but at last he had them all in his hand  ill go to my sister the frog he thought to himself and she will sew them together for me and he set off at once for the swamp in which his sister lived  will you sew my coat together i had an unlucky accident and it is quite impossible to wear he said when he found her  with pleasure she answered for she had always been taught to be polite and getting her needle and thread she began to fit the pieces but though she was very goodnatured she was not very clever and she got some of the bits wrong when the wolverine who was very particular about his clothes came to put it on he grew very angry  what a useless creature you are cried he do you expect me to go about in such a coat as that why it bulges all down the back as if i had a hump and it is so tight across the chest that i expect it to burst every time i breathe i knew you were stupid but i did not think you were as stupid as that and giving the poor frog a blow on her head which knocked her straight into the water he walked off in a rage to his younger sister the mouse  i tore my coat this morning he began when he had found her sitting at the door of her house eating an apple it was all in little bits and i took it to our sister the frog to ask her to sew it for me but just look at the way she has done it you will have to take it to pieces and fit them together properly and i hope i shall not have to complain again for as the wolverine was older than the mouse he was accustomed to speak to her in this manner however the mouse was used to it and only answered i think you had better stay here till it is done and if there is any alteration needed i can make it so the wolverine sat down on a heap of dry ferns and picking up the apple he finished it without even asking the mouses leave  at last the coat was ready and the wolverine put it on  yes it fits very well said he and you have sewn it very neatly when i pass this way again i will bring you a handful of corn as a reward and he ran off as smart as ever leaving the mouse quite grateful behind him  he wandered about for many days till he reached a place where food was very scarce and for a whole week he went without any he was growing desperate when he suddenly came upon a bear that was lying asleep ah here is food at last thought he but how was he to kill the bear who was so much bigger than himself it was no use to try force he must invent some cunning plan which would get her into his power at last after thinking hard he decided upon something and going up to the bear he exclaimed is that you my sister  the bear turned round and saw the wolverine and murmuring to herself so low that nobody could hear i never heard before that i had a brother got up and ran quickly to a tree up which she climbed now the wolverine was very angry when he saw his dinner vanishing in front of him especially as he could not climb trees like the bear so he followed and stood at the foot of the tree shrieking as loud as he could come down sister our father has sent me to look for you you were lost when you were a little girl and went out picking berries and it was only the other day that we heard from a beaver where you were at these words the bear came a little way down the tree and the wolverine seeing this went on  are you not fond of berries i am and i know a place where they grow so thick the ground is quite hidden why look for yourself that hillside is quite red with them  i cant see so far answered the bear now climbing down altogether you must have wonderfully good eyes i wish i had but my sight is very short  so was mine till my father smashed a pailful of cranberries and rubbed my eyes with them replied the wolverine but if you like to go and gather some of the berries i will do just as he did and you will soon be able to see as far as me  it took the bear a long while to gather the berries for she was slow about everything and besides it made her back ache to stoop but at last she returned with a sackful and put them down beside the wolverine that is splendid sister cried the wolverine now lie flat on the ground with your head on this stone while i smash them  the bear who was very tired was only too glad to do as she was bid and stretched herself comfortably on the grass  i am ready now said the wolverine after a bit just at first you will find that the berries make your eyes smart but you must be careful not to move or the juice will run out and then it will have to be done all over again  so the bear promised to lie very still but the moment the cranberries touched her eyes she sprang up with a roar  oh you mustnt mind a little pain said the wolverine it will soon be over and then you will see all sorts of things you have never dreamt of the bear sank down with a groan and as her eyes were full of cranberry juice which completely blinded her the wolverine took up a sharp knife and stabbed her to the heart  then he took off the skin and stealing some fire from a tent which his sharp eyes had perceived hidden behind a rock he set about roasting the bear bit by bit he thought the meat was the best he ever had tasted and when dinner was done he made up his mind to try that same trick again if ever he was hungry  and very likely he did  adapted from bureau of ethnology     the husband of the rats daughter    once upon a time there lived in japan a rat and his wife who came of an old and noble race and had one daughter the loveliest girl in all the rat world her parents were very proud of her and spared no pains to teach her all she ought to know there was not another young lady in the whole town who was as clever as she was in gnawing through the hardest wood or who could drop from such a height on to a bed or run away so fast if anyone was heard coming great attention too was paid to her personal appearance and her skin shone like satin while her teeth were as white as pearls and beautifully pointed  of course with all these advantages her parents expected her to make a brilliant marriage and as she grew up they began to look round for a suitable husband  but here a difficulty arose the father was a rat from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail outside as well as in and desired that his daughter should wed among her own people she had no lack of lovers but her fathers secret hopes rested on a fine young rat with moustaches which almost swept the ground whose family was still nobler and more ancient than his own unluckily the mother had other views for her precious child she was one of those people who always despise their own family and surroundings and take pleasure in thinking that they themselves are made of finer material than the rest of the world her daughter should never marry a mere rat she declared holding her head high with her beauty and talents she had a right to look for someone a little better than that  so she talked as mothers will to anyone that would listen to her what the girl thought about the matter nobody knew or caredit was not the fashion in the rat world  many were the quarrels which the old rat and his wife had upon the subject and sometimes they bore on their faces certain marks which looked as if they had not kept to words only  reach up to the stars is my motto cried the lady one day when she was in a greater passion than usual my daughters beauty places her higher than anything upon earth she cried and i am certainly not going to accept a soninlaw who is beneath her  better offer her in marriage to the sun answered her husband impatiently as far as i know there is nothing greater than he  well i was thinking of it replied the wife and as you are of the same mind we will pay him a visit tomorrow  so the next morning the two rats having spent hours in making themselves smart set out to see the sun leading their daughter between them  the journey took some time but at length they came to the golden palace where the sun lived  noble king began the mother behold our daughter she is so beautiful that she is above everything in the whole world naturally we wish for a soninlaw who on his side is greater than all therefore we have come to you  i feel very much flattered replied the sun who was so busy that he had not the least wish to marry anybody you do me great honour by your proposal only in one point you are mistaken and it would be wrong of me to take advantage of your ignorance there is something greater than i am and that is the cloud look and as he spoke a cloud spread itself over the suns face blotting out his rays  oh well we will speak to the cloud said the mother and turning to the cloud she repeated her proposal  indeed i am unworthy of anything so charming answered the cloud but you make a mistake again in what you say there is one thing that is even more powerful than i and that is the wind ah here he comes you can see for yourself  and she did see for catching up the cloud as he passed he threw it on the other side of the sky then tumbling father mother and daughter down to the earth again he paused for a moment beside them his foot on an old wall  when she had recovered her breath the mother began her little speech once more  the wall is the proper husband for your daughter answered the wind whose home consisted of a cave which he only visited when he was not rushing about elsewhere you can see for yourself that he is greater than i for he has power to stop me in my flight and the mother who did not trouble to conceal her wishes turned at once to the wall  then something happened which was quite unexpected by everyone  i wont marry that ugly old wall which is as old as my grandfather sobbed the girl who had not uttered one word all this time i would have married the sun or the cloud or the wind because it was my duty although i love the handsome young rat and him only but that horrid old walli would sooner die  and the wall rather hurt in his feelings declared that he had no claim to be the husband of so beautiful a girl  it is quite true he said that i can stop the wind who can part the clouds who can cover the sun but there is someone who can do more than all these and that is the rat it is the rat who passes through me and can reduce me to powder simply with his teeth if therefore you want a soninlaw who is greater than the whole world seek him among the rats  ah what did i tell you cried the father and his wife though for the moment angry at being beaten soon thought that a rat soninlaw was what she had always desired  so all three returned happily home and the wedding was celebrated three days after  contes populaires    the mermaid and the boy    long long ago there lived a king who ruled over a country by the sea when he had been married about a year some of his subjects inhabiting a distant group of islands revolted against his laws and it became needful for him to leave his wife and go in person to settle their disputes the queen feared that some ill would come of it and implored him to stay at home but he told her that nobody could do his work for him and the next morning the sails were spread and the king started on his voyage  the vessel had not gone very far when she ran upon a rock and stuck so fast in a cleft that the strength of the whole crew could not get her off again to make matters worse the wind was rising too and it was quite plain that in a few hours the ship would be dashed to pieces and everybody would be drowned when suddenly the form of a mermaid was seen dancing on the waves which threatened every moment to overwhelm them  there is only one way to free yourselves she said to the king bobbing up and down in the water as she spoke and that is to give me your solemn word that you will deliver to me the first child that is born to you  the king hesitated at this proposal he hoped that some day he might have children in his home and the thought that he must yield up the heir to his crown was very bitter to him but just then a huge wave broke with great force on the ships side and his men fell on their knees and entreated him to save them  so he promised and this time a wave lifted the vessel clean off the rocks and she was in the open sea once more  the affairs of the islands took longer to settle than the king had expected and some months passed away before he returned to his palace in his absence a son had been born to him and so great was his joy that he quite forgot the mermaid and the price he had paid for the safety of his ship but as the years went on and the baby grew into a fine big boy the remembrance of it came back and one day he told the queen the whole story from that moment the happiness of both their lives was ruined every night they went to bed wondering if they should find his room empty in the morning and every day they kept him by their sides expecting him to be snatched away before their very eyes  at last the king felt that this state of things could not continue and he said to his wife  after all the most foolish thing in the world one can do is to keep the boy here in exactly the place in which the mermaid will seek him let us give him food and send him on his travels and perhaps if the mermaid ever blocs come to seek him she may be content with some other child and the queen agreed that his plan seemed the wisest  so the boy was called and his father told him the story of the voyage as he had told his mother before him the prince listened eagerly and was delighted to think that he was to go away all by himself to see the world and was not in the least frightened for though he was now sixteen he had scarcely been allowed to walk alone beyond the palace gardens he began busily to make his preparations and took off his smart velvet coat putting on instead one of green cloth while he refused a beautiful bag which the queen offered him to hold his food and slung a leather knapsack over his shoulders instead just as he had seen other travellers do then he bade farewell to his parents and went his way  all through the day he walked watching with interest the strange birds and animals that darted across his path in the forest or peeped at him from behind a bush but as evening drew on he became tired and looked about as he walked for some place where he could sleep at length he reached a soft mossy bank under a tree and was just about to stretch himself out on it when a fearful roar made him start and tremble all over in another moment something passed swiftly through the air and a lion stood before him  what are you doing here asked the lion his eyes glaring fiercely at the boy  i am flying from the mermaid the prince answered in a quaking voice  give me some food then said the lion it is past my supper time and i am very hungry  the boy was so thankful that the lion did not want to eat him that he gladly picked up his knapsack which lay on the ground and held out some bread and a flask of wine  i feel better now said the lion when he had done so now i shall go to sleep on this nice soft moss and if you like you can lie down beside me so the boy and the lion slept soundly side by side till the sun rose  i must be off now remarked the lion shaking the boy as he spoke but cut off the tip of my ear and keep it carefully and if you are in any danger just wish yourself a lion and you will become one on the spot one good turn deserves another you know  the prince thanked him for his kindness and did as he was bid and the two then bade each other farewell  i wonder how it feels to be a lion thought the boy after he had gone a little way and he took out the tip of the ear from the breast of his jacket and wished with all his might in an instant his head had swollen to several times its usual size and his neck seemed very hot and heavy and somehow his hands became paws and his skin grew hairy and yellow but what pleased him most was his long tail with a tuft at the end which he lashed and switched proudly i like being a lion very much he said to himself and trotted gaily along the road  after a while however he got tired of walking in this unaccustomed wayit made his back ache and his front paws felt sore so he wished himself a boy again and in the twinkling of an eye his tail disappeared and his head shrank and the long thick mane became short and curly then he looked out for a sleeping place and found some dry ferns which he gathered and heaped up  but before he had time to close his eyes there was a great noise in the trees near by as if a big heavy body was crashing through them the boy rose and turned his head and saw a huge black bear coming towards him  what are you doing here cried the bear  i am running away from the mermaid answered the boy but the bear took no interest in the mermaid and only said i am hungry give me something to eat  the knapsack was lying on the ground among the fern but the prince picked it up and unfastening the strap took out his second flask of wine and another loaf of bread we will have supper together he remarked politely but the bear who had never been taught manners made no reply and ate as fast as he could when he had quite finished he got up and stretched himself  you have got a comfortablelooking bed there he observed i really think that bad sleeper as i am i might have a good night on it i can manage to squeeze you in he added you dont take up a great deal of room the boy was rather indignant at the bears cool way of talking but as he was too tired to gather more fern they lay down side by side and never stirred till sunrise next morning  i must go now said the bear pulling the sleepy prince on to his feet but first you shall cut off the tip of my ear and when you are in any danger just wish yourself a bear and you will become one one good turn deserves another you know and the boy did as he was bid and he and the bear bade each other farewell  i wonder how it feels to be a bear thought he to himself when he had walked a little way and he took out the tip from the breast of his coat and wished hard that he might become a bear the next moment his body stretched out and thick black fur covered him all over as before his hands were changed into paws but when he tried to switch his tail he found to his disgust that it would not go any distance why it is hardly worth calling a tail said he for the rest of the day he remained a bear and continued his journey but as evening came on the bearskin which had been so useful when plunging through brambles in the forest felt rather heavy and he wished himself a boy again he was too much exhausted to take the trouble of cutting any fern or seeking for moss but just threw himself down under a tree when exactly above his head he heard a great buzzing as a bumblebee alighted on a honeysuckle branch what are you doing here asked the bee in a cross voice at your age you ought to be safe at home  i am running away from the mermaid replied the boy but the bee like the lion and the bear was one of those people who never listen to the answers to their questions and only said i am hungry give me something to eat  the boy took his last loaf and flask out of his knapsack and laid them on the ground and they had supper together well now i am going to sleep observed the bee when the last crumb was gone but as you are not very big i can make room for you beside me and he curled up his wings and tucked in his legs and he and the prince both slept soundly till morning then the bee got up and carefully brushed every scrap of dust off his velvet coat and buzzed loudly in the boys ear to waken him  take a single hair from one of my wings said he and if you are in danger just wish yourself a bee and you will become one one good turn deserves another so farewell and thank you for your supper and the bee departed after the boy had pulled out the hair and wrapped it carefully in a leaf  it must feel quite different to be a bee from what it does to be a lion or bear thought the boy to himself when he had walked for an hour or two i dare say i should get on a great deal faster so he pulled out his hair and wished himself a bee  in a moment the strangest thing happened to him all his limbs seemed to draw together and his body to become very short and round his head grew quite tiny and instead of his white skin he was covered with the richest softest velvet better than all he had two lovely gauze wings which carried him the whole day without getting tired  late in the afternoon the boy fancied he saw a vast heap of stones a long way off and he flew straight towards it but when he reached the gates he saw that it was really a great town so he wished himself back in his own shape and entered the city  he found the palace doors wide open and went boldly into a sort of hall which was full of people and where men and maids were gossiping together he joined their talk and soon learned from them that the king had only one daughter who had such a hatred to men that she would never suffer one to enter her presence her father was in despair and had had pictures painted of the handsomest princes of all the courts in the world in the hope that she might fall in love with one of them but it was no use the princess would not even allow the pictures to be brought into her room  it is late remarked one of the women at last i must go to my mistress and turning to one of the lackeys she bade him find a bed for the youth  it is not necessary answered the prince this bench is good enough for me i am used to nothing better and when the hall was empty he lay down for a few minutes but as soon as everything was quiet in the palace he took out the hair and wished himself a bee and in this shape he flew upstairs past the guards and through the keyhole into the princesss chamber then he turned himself into a man again  at this dreadful sight the princess who was broad awake began to scream loudly a man a man cried she but when the guards rushed in there was only a bumblebee buzzing about the room they looked under the bed and behind the curtains and into the cupboards then came to the conclusion that the princess had had a bad dream and bowed themselves out the door had scarcely closed on them than the bee disappeared and a handsome youth stood in his place  i knew a man was hidden somewhere cried the princess and screamed more loudly than before her shrieks brought back the guards but though they looked in all kinds of impossible places no man was to be seen and so they told the princess  he was here a moment agoi saw him with my own eyes and the guards dared not contradict her though they shook their heads and whispered to each other that the princess had gone mad on this subject and saw a man in every table and chair and they made up their minds thatlet her scream as loudly as she mightthey would take no notice  now the princess saw clearly what they were thinking and that in future her guards would give her no help and would perhaps besides tell some stories about her to the king who would shut her up in a lonely tower and prevent her walking in the gardens among her birds and flowers so when for the third time she beheld the prince standing before her she did not scream but sat up in bed gazing at him in silent terror  do not be afraid he said i shall not hurt you and he began to praise her gardens of which he had heard the servants speak and the birds and flowers which she loved till the princesss anger softened and she answered him with gentle words indeed they soon became so friendly that she vowed she would marry no one else and confided to him that in three days her father would be off to the wars leaving his sword in her room if any man could find it and bring it to him he would receive her hand as a reward at this point a cock crew and the youth jumped up hastily saying of course i shall ride with the king to the war and if i do not return take your violin every evening to the seashore and play on it so that the very seakobolds who live at the bottom of the ocean may hear it and come to you  just as the princess had foretold in three days the king set out for the war with a large following and among them was the young prince who had presented himself at court as a young noble in search of adventures they had left the city many miles behind them when the king suddenly discovered that he had forgotten his sword and though all his attendants instantly offered theirs he declared that he could fight with none but his own  the first man who brings it to me from my daughters room cried he shall not only have her to wife but after my death shall reign in my stead  at this the red knight the young prince and several more turned their horses to ride as fast as the wind back to the palace but suddenly a better plan entered the princes head and letting the others pass him he took his precious parcel from his breast and wished himself a lion then on he bounded uttering such dreadful roars that the horses were frightened and grew unmanageable and he easily outstripped them and soon reached the gates of the palace here he hastily changed himself into a bee and flew straight into the princesss room where he became a man again she showed him where the sword hung concealed behind a curtain and he took it down saying as he did so be sure not to forget what you have promised to do  the princess made no reply but smiled sweetly and slipping a golden ring from her finger she broke it in two and held half out silently to the prince while the other half she put in her own pocket he kissed it and ran down the stairs bearing the sword with him some way off he met the red knight and the rest and the red knight at first tried to take the sword from him by force but as the youth proved too strong for him he gave it up and resolved to wait for a better opportunity  this soon came for the day was hot and the prince was thirsty perceiving a little stream that ran into the sea he turned aside and unbuckling the sword flung himself on the ground for a long drink unluckily the mermaid happened at that moment to be floating on the water not very far off and knew he was the boy who had been given her before he was born so she floated gently in to where he was lying she seized him by the arm and the waves closed over them both hardly had they disappeared when the red knight stole cautiously up and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the kings sword on the bank he wondered what had become of the youth who an hour before had guarded his treasure so fiercely but after all that was no affair of his so fastening the sword to his belt he carried it to the king  the war was soon over and the king returned to his people who welcomed him with shouts of joy but when the princess from her window saw that her betrothed was not among the attendants riding behind her father her heart sank for she knew that some evil must have befallen him and she feared the red knight she had long ago learned how clever and how wicked he was and something whispered to her that it was he who would gain the credit of having carried back the sword and would claim her as his bride though he had never even entered her chamber and she could do nothing for although the king loved her he never let her stand in the way of his plans  the poor princess was only too right and everything came to pass exactly as she had foreseen it the king told her that the red knight had won her fairly and that the wedding would take place next day and there would be a great feast after it  in those days feasts were much longer and more splendid than they are now and it was growing dark when the princess tired out with all she had gone through stole up to her own room for a little quiet but the moon was shining so brightly over the sea that it seemed to draw her towards it and taking her violin under her arm she crept down to the shore  listen listen said the mermaid to the prince who was lying stretched on a bed of seaweeds at the bottom of the sea listen that is your old love playing for mermaids know everything that happens upon earth  i hear nothing answered the youth who did not look happy take me up higher where the sounds can reach me  so the mermaid took him on her shoulders and bore him up midway to the surface can you hear now she asked  no answered the prince i hear nothing but the water rushing i must go higher still  then the mermaid carried him to the very top you must surely be able to hear now said she  nothing but the water repeated the youth so she took him right to the land  at any rate you can hear now she said again  the water is still rushing in my ears answered he but wait a little that will soon pass off and as he spoke he put his hand into his breast and seizing the hair wished himself a bee and flew straight into the pocket of the princess the mermaid looked in vain for him and coated all night upon the sea but he never came back and never more did he gladden her eyes but the princess felt that something strange was about her though she knew not what and returned quickly to the palace where the young man at once resumed his own shape oh what joy filled her heart at the sight of him but there was no time to be lost and she led him right into the hall where the king and his nobles were still sitting at the feast here is a man who boasts that he can do wonderful tricks said she better even than the red knights that cannot be true of course but it might be well to give this impostor a lesson he pretends for instance that he can turn himself into a lion but that i do not believe i know that you have studied the art of magic she went on turning to the red knight so suppose you just show him how it is done and bring shame upon him  now the red knight had never opened a book of magic in his life but he was accustomed to think that he could do everything better than other people without any teaching at all so he turned and twisted himself about and bellowed and made faces but he did not become a lion for all that  well perhaps it is very difficult to change into a lion make yourself a bear said the princess but the red knight found it no easier to become a bear than a lion  try a bee suggested she i have always read that anyone who can do magic at all can do that and the old knight buzzed and hummed but he remained a man and not a bee  now it is your turn said the princess to the youth let us see if you can change yourself into a lion and in a moment such a fierce creature stood before them that all the guests rushed out of the hall treading each other underfoot in their fright the lion sprang at the red knight and would have torn him in pieces had not the princess held him back and bidden him to change himself into a man again and in a second a man took the place of the lion  now become a bear said she and a bear advanced panting and stretching out his arms to the red knight who shrank behind the princess  by this time some of the guests had regained their courage and returned as far as the door thinking that if it was safe for the princess perhaps it was safe for them the king who was braver than they and felt it needful to set them a good example besides had never left his seat and when at a new command of the princess the bear once more turned into a man he was silent from astonishment and a suspicion of the truth began to dawn on him was it he who fetched the sword asked the king  yes it was answered the princess and she told him the whole story and how she had broken her gold ring and given him half of it and the prince took out his half of the ring and the princess took out hers and they fitted exactly next day the red knight was hanged as he richly deserved and there was a new marriage feast for the prince and princess  lapplandische mahrchen     pivi and kabo    when birds were men and men were birds pivi and kabo lived in an island far away called new claledonia pivi was a cheery little bird that chirps at sunset kabo was an ugly black fowl that croaks in the darkness one day pivi and kabo thought that they would make slings and practice slinging as the people of the island still do so they went to a banyan tree and stripped the bark to make strings for their slings and next they repaired to the river bank to find stones kabo stood on the bank of the river and pivi went into the water the game was for kabo to sling at pivi and for pivi to dodge the stones if he could for some time he dodged them cleverly but at last a stone from kabos sling hit poor pivi on the leg and broke it down went pivi into the stream and floated along it till he floated into a big hollow bamboo which a woman used for washing her sweet potatoes  what is that in my bamboo said the woman and she blew in at one end and blew little pivi out at the other like a pea from a peashooter  oh cried the woman what a state you are in what have you been doing  it was kabo who broke my leg at the slinging game said pivi  well i am sorry for you said the woman will you come with me and do what i tell you  i will said pivi for the woman was very kind and pretty she took pivi into a shed where she kept her fruit laid him on a bed of mats and made him as comfortable as she could and attended to his broken leg without cutting off the flesh round the bone as these people usually do  you will be still wont you pivi she said if you hear a little noise you will pretend to be dead it is the black ant who will come and creep from your feet up to your head say nothing and keep quiet wont you pivi  certainly kind lady said pivi i will lie as still as can be  next will come the big red antyou know him  yes i know him with his feet like a grasshoppers  he will walk over your body up to your head then you must shake all your body do you understand pivi  yes dear lady i shall do just as you say  very good said the woman going out and shutting the door  pivi lay still under his coverings then a tiny noise was heard and the black ant began to march over pivi who lay quite still then came the big red ant skipping along his body and then pivi shook himself all over he jumped up quite well again he ran to the river he looked into the water and saw that he was changed from a bird into a fine young man  oh lady he cried look at me now i am changed into a man and so handsome  will you obey me again said the woman  always whatever you command i will do it said pivi politely  then climb up that cocoanut tree with your legs only not using your hands said the woman  now the natives can run up cocoanut trees like squirrels some using only one hand the girls can do that but few can climb without using their hands at all  at the top of the tree you will find two cocoanuts you must not throw them down but carry them in your hands and you must descend as you went up using your legs only  i shall try at least said pivi and up he went but it was very difficult and down he came  here are your cocoanuts he said presenting them to the woman  now pivi put them in the shed where you lay and when the sun sets to cool himself in the sea and rise again not so hot in the dawn you must go and take the nuts  all day pivi played about in the river as the natives do throwing fruit and silvery showers of water at each other when the sun set he went into the hut but as he drew near he heard sweet voices talking and laughing within  what is that people chattering in the hut perhaps they have taken my cocoanuts said pivi to himself  in he went and there he found two pretty laughing teasing girls he hunted for his cocoanuts but none were there  down he ran to the river oh lady my nuts have been stolen he cried  come with me pivi and there will be nuts for you said the woman  they went back to the hut where the girls were laughing and playing  nuts for you said the woman there are two wives for you pivi take them to your house  oh good lady cried pivi how kind you are  so they were married and very happy when in came cross old kabo  is this pivi said he yes it isno it isnt it is not the same pivibut there is a kind of likeness tell me are you pivi  oh yes said pivi but i am much better looking and there are my two wives are they not beautiful  you are mocking me pivi your wives how where did you get them you with wives  then pivi told kabo about the kind woman and all the wonderful things that had happened to him  well well said kabo but i want to be handsome too and to have pretty young wives  but how can we manage that asked pivi  oh we shall do all the same things over againplay at slinging and this time you shall break my leg pivi  with all the pleasure in life said pivi who was always ready to oblige  so they went slinging and pivi broke kabos leg and kabo fell into the river and floated into the bamboo and the woman blew him out just as before then she picked up kabo and put him in the shed and told him what to do when the black ant came and what to do when the red ant came but he didnt  when the black ant came he shook himself and behold he had a twisted leg and a hump back and was as black as the ant  then he ran to the woman  look what a figure i am he said but she only told him to climb the tree as she had told pivi  but kabo climbed with both hands and feet and he threw down the nuts instead of carrying them down and he put them in the hut and when he went back for them there he found two horrid old black hags wrangling and scolding and scratching so back he went to pivi with his two beautiful wives and pivi was very sorry but what could he do nothing but sit and cry  so one day kabo came and asked pivi to sail in his canoe to a place where he knew of a great big shellfish enough to feed on for a week pivi went and deep in the clear water they saw a monstrous shellfish like an oyster as big as a rock with the shell wide open  we shall catch it and dry it and kipper it said pivi and give a dinner to all our friends  i shall dive for it and break it off the rock said kabo and then you must help me to drag it up into the canoe  there the shellfish lay and gaped but kabo though he dived in kept well out of the way of the beast  up he came puffing and blowing oh pivi he cried i cannot move it jump in and try yourself  pivi dived with his spear and the shellfish opened its shell wider yet and sucked and pivi disappeared into its mouth and the shell shut up with a snap  kabo laughed like a fiend and then went home  where is pivi asked the two pretty girls kabo pretended to cry and told how pivi had been swallowed  but dry your tears my darlings said kabo i will be your husband and my wives shall be your slaves everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds  no no cried the girls we love pivi we do not love anyone else we shall stay at home and weep for pivi  wretched idiots cried kabo pivi was a scoundrel who broke my leg and knocked me into the river  then a little cough was heard at the door and kabo trembled for he knew it was the cough of pivi  ah dear pivi cried kabo rushing to the door what joy i was trying to console your dear wives  pivi said not one word he waved his hand and five and twenty of his friends came trooping down the hill they cut up kabo into little pieces pivi turned round and there was the good woman of the river  pivi she said how did you get out of the living tomb into which kabo sent you  i had my spear with me said pivi it was quite dry inside the shell and i worked away at the fish with my spear till he saw reason to open his shell and out i came then the good woman laughed and pivi and his two wives lived happy ever afterwards  moncelon bulletin de la societe danthropologie series iii vol ix pp 613365     the elf maiden    once upon a time two young men living in a small village fell in love with the same girl during the winter it was all night except for an hour or so about noon when the darkness seemed a little less dark and then they used to see which of them could tempt her out for a sleigh ride with the northern lights flashing above them or which could persuade her to come to a dance in some neighbouring barn but when the spring began and the light grew longer the hearts of the villagers leapt at the sight of the sun and a day was fixed for the boats to be brought out and the great nets to be spread in the bays of some islands that lay a few miles to the north everybody went on this expedition and the two young men and the girl went with them  they all sailed merrily across the sea chattering like a flock of magpies or singing their favourite songs and when they reached the shore what an unpacking there was for this was a noted fishing ground and here they would live in little wooden huts till autumn and bad weather came round again  the maiden and the two young men happened to share the same hut with some friends and fished daily from the same boat and as time went on one of the youths remarked that the girl took less notice of him than she did of his companion at first he tried to think that he was dreaming and for a long while he kept his eyes shut very tight to what he did not want to see but in spite of his efforts the truth managed to wriggle through and then the young man gave up trying to deceive himself and set about finding some way to get the better of his rival  the plan that he hit upon could not be carried out for some months but the longer the young man thought of it the more pleased he was with it so he made no sign of his feelings and waited patiently till the moment came this was the very day that they were all going to leave the islands and sail back to the mainland for the winter in the bustle and hurry of departure the cunning fisherman contrived that their boat should be the last to put off and when everything was ready and the sails about to be set he suddenly called out  oh dear what shall i do i have left my best knife behind in the hut run like a good fellow and get it for me while i raise the anchor and loosen the tiller  not thinking any harm the youth jumped back on shore and made his way up the steep hank at the door of the hut he stopped and looked back then started and gazed in horror the head of the boat stood out to sea and he was left alone on the island  yes there was no doubt of ithe was quite alone and he had nothing to help him except the knife which his comrade had purposely dropped on the ledge of the window for some minutes he was too stunned by the treachery of his friend to think about anything at all but after a while he shook himself awake and determined that he would manage to keep alive somehow if it were only to revenge himself  so he put the knife in his pocket and went off to a part of the island which was not so bare as the rest and had a small grove of trees from one of these he cut himself a bow which he strung with a piece of cord that had been left lying about the huts  when this was ready the young man ran down to the shore and shot one or two seabirds which he plucked and cooked for supper  in this way the months slipped by and christmas came round again the evening before the youth went down to the rocks and into the copse collecting all the drift wood the sea had washed up or the gale had blown down and he piled it up in a great stack outside the door so that he might not have to fetch any all the next day as soon as his task was done he paused and looked out towards the mainland thinking of christmas eve last year and the merry dance they had had the night was still and cold and by the help of the northern lights he could almost sea across to the opposite coast when suddenly he noticed a boat which seemed steering straight for the island at first he could hardly stand for joy the chance of speaking to another man was so delightful but as the boat drew near there was something he could not tell what that was different from the boats which he had been used to all his life and when it touched the shore he saw that the people that filled it were beings of another world than ours then he hastily stepped behind the wood stack and waited for what might happen next  the strange folk one by one jumped on to the rocks each bearing a load of something that they wanted among the women he remarked two young girls more beautiful and better dressed than any of the rest carrying between them two great baskets full of provisions the young man peeped out cautiously to see what all this crowd could be doing inside the tiny hut but in a moment he drew back again as the girls returned and looked about as if they wanted to find out what sort of a place the island was  their sharp eyes soon discovered the form of a man crouching behind the bundles of sticks and at first they felt a little frightened and started as if they would run away but the youth remained so still that they took courage and laughed gaily to each other what a strange creature let us try what he is made of said one and she stooped down and gave him a pinch  now the young man had a pin sticking in the sleeve of his jacket and the moment the girls hand touched him she pricked it so sharply that the blood came the girl screamed so loudly that the people all ran out of their huts to see what was the matter but directly they caught sight of the man they turned and fled in the other direction and picking up the goods they had brought with them scampered as fast as they could down to the shore in an instant boat people and goods had vanished completely  in their hurry they had however forgotten two things a bundle of keys which lay on the table and the girl whom the pin had pricked and who now stood pale and helpless beside the wood stack  you will have to make me your wife she said at last for you have drawn my blood and i belong to you  why not i am quite willing answered he but how do you suppose we can manage to live till summer comes round again  do not be anxious about that said the girl if you will only marry me all will be well i am very rich and all my family are rich also  then the young man gave her his promise to make her his wife and the girl fulfilled her part of the bargain and food was plentiful on the island all through the long winter months though he never knew how it got there and byandby it was spring once more and time for the fisherfolk to sail from the mainland  where are we to go now asked the girl one day when the sun seemed brighter and the wind softer than usual  i do not care where i go answered the young man what do you think  the girl replied that she would like to go somewhere right at the other end of the island and build a house far away from the huts of the fishingfolk and he consented and that very day they set off in search of a sheltered spot on the banks of a stream so that it would be easy to get water  in a tiny bay on the opposite side of the island they found the very thing which seemed to have been made on purpose for them and as they were tired with their long walk they laid themselves down on a bank of moss among some birches and prepared to have a good nights rest so as to be fresh for work next day but before she went to sleep the girl turned to her husband and said if in your dreams you fancy that you hear strange noises be sure you do not stir or get up to see what it is  oh it is not likely we shall hear any noises in such a quiet place answered he and fell sound asleep  suddenly he was awakened by a great clatter about his ears as if all the workmen in the world were sawing and hammering and building close to him he was just going to spring up and go to see what it meant when he luckily remembered his wifes words and lay still but the time till morning seemed very long and with the first ray of sun they both rose and pushed aside the branches of the birch trees there in the very place they had chosen stood a beautiful housedoors and windows and everything all complete  now you must fix on a spot for your cowstalls said the girl when they had breakfasted off wild cherries and take care it is the proper size neither too large nor too small and the husband did as he was bid though he wondered what use a cowhouse could be as they had no cows to put in it but as he was a little afraid of his wife who knew so much more than he he asked no questions  this night also he was awakened by the same sounds as before and in the morning they found near the stream the most beautiful cowhouse that ever was seen with stalls and milkpails and stools all complete indeed everything that a cowhouse could possibly want except the cows then the girl bade him measure out the ground for a storehouse and this she said might be as large as he pleased and when the storehouse was ready she proposed that they should set off to pay her parents a visit  the old people welcomed them heartily and summoned their neighbours for many miles round to a great feast in their honour in fact for several weeks there was no work done on the farm at all and at length the young man and his wife grew tired of so much play and declared that they must return to their own home but before they started on the journey the wife whispered to her husband take care to jump over the threshold as quick as you can or it will be the worse for you  the young man listened to her words and sprang over the threshold like an arrow from a bow and it was well he did for no sooner was he on the other side than his fatherinlaw threw a great hammer at him which would have broken both his legs if it had only touched them  when they had gone some distance on the road home the girl turned to her husband and said till you step inside the house be sure you do not look back whatever you may hear or see  and the husband promised and for a while all was still and he thought no more about the matter till he noticed at last that the nearer he drew to the house the louder grew the noise of the trampling of feet behind him as he laid his hand upon the door he thought he was safe and turned to look there sure enough was a vast herd of cattle which had been sent after him by his fatherinlaw when he found that his daughter had been cleverer than he half of the herd were already through the fence and cropping the grass on the banks of the stream but half still remained outside and faded into nothing even as he watched them  however enough cattle were left to make the young man rich and he and his wife lived happily together except that every now and then the girl vanished from his sight and never told him where she had been for a long time he kept silence about it but one day when he had been complaining of her absence she said to him dear husband i am bound to go even against my will and there is only one way to stop me drive a nail into the threshold and then i can never pass in or out  and so he did  lapplandische mahrchen     how some wild animals became tame ones    once upon a time there lived a miller who was so rich that when he was going to be married he asked to the feast not only his own friends but also the wild animals who dwelt in the hills and woods round about the chief of the bears the wolves the foxes the horses the cows the goats the sheep and the reindeer all received invitations and as they were not accustomed to weddings they were greatly pleased and flattered and sent back messages in the politest language that they would certainly be there  the first to start on the morning of the weddingday was the bear who always liked to be punctual and besides he had a long way to go and his hair being so thick and rough needed a good brushing before it was fit to be seen at a party however he took care to awaken very early and set off down the road with a light heart before he had walked very far he met a boy who came whistling along hitting at the tops of the flowers with a stick  where are you going said he looking at the bear in surprise for he was an old acquaintance and not generally so smart  oh just to the millers marriage answered the bear carelessly of course i would much rather stay at home but the miller was so anxious i should be there that i really could not refuse  dont go dont go cried the boy if you do you will never come back you have got the most beautiful skin in the worldjust the kind that everyone is wanting and they will be sure to kill you and strip you of it  i had not thought of that said the bear whose face turned white only nobody could see it if you are certain that they would be so wickedbut perhaps you are jealous because nobody has invited you  oh nonsense replied the boy angrily do as you see it is your skin and not mine i dont care what becomes of it and he walked quickly on with his head in the air  the bear waited until he was out of sight and then followed him slowly for he felt in his heart that the boys advice was good though he was too proud to say so  the boy soon grew tired of walking along the road and turned off into the woods where there were bushes he could jump and streams he could wade but he had not gone far before he met the wolf  where are you going asked he for it was not the first time he had seen him  oh just to the millers marriage answered the wolf as the bear had done before him it is rather tiresome of courseweddings are always so stupid but still one must be goodnatured  dont go said the boy again your skin is so thick and warm and winter is not far off now they will kill you and strip it from you  the wolfs jaw dropped in astonishment and terror do you really think that would happen he gasped  yes to be sure i do answered the boy but it is your affair not mine so goodmorning and on he went the wolf stood still for a few minutes for he was trembling all over and then crept quietly back to his cave  next the boy met the fox whose lovely coat of silvery grey was shining in the sun  you look very fine said the boy stopping to admire him are you going to the millers wedding too  yes answered the fox it is a long journey to take for such a thing as that but you know what the millers friends are likeso dull and heavy it is only kind to go and amuse them a little  you poor fellow said the boy pityingly take my advice and stay at home if you once enter the millers gate his dogs will tear you in pieces  ah well such things have occurred i know replied the fox gravely and without saying any more he trotted off the way he had come  his tail had scarcely disappeared when a great noise of crashing branches was heard and up bounded the horse his black skin glistening like satin  goodmorning he called to the boy as he galloped past i cant wait to talk to you now i have promised the miller to be present at his weddingfeast and they wont sit down till i come  stop stop cried the boy after him and there was something in his voice that made the horse pull up what is the matter asked he  you dont know what you are doing said the boy if once you go there you will never gallop through these woods any more you are stronger than many men but they will catch you and put ropes round you and you will have to work and to serve them all the days of your life  the horse threw back his head at these words and laughed scornfully  yes i am stronger than many men answered he and all the ropes in the world would not hold me let them bind me as fast as they will i can always break loose and return to the forest and freedom  and with this proud speech he gave a whisk of his long tail and galloped away faster than before  but when he reached the millers house everything happened as the boy had said while he was looking at the guests and thinking how much handsomer and stronger he was than any of them a rope was suddenly flung over his head and he was thrown down and a bit thrust between his teeth then in spite of his struggles he was dragged to a stable and shut up for several days without any food till his spirit was broken and his coat had lost its gloss after that he was harnessed to a plough and had plenty of time to remember all he had lost through not listening to the counsel of the boy  when the horse had turned a deaf ear to his words the boy wandered idly along sometimes gathering wild strawberries from a bank and sometimes plucking wild cherries from a tree till he reached a clearing in the middle of the forest crossing this open space was a beautiful milkwhite cow with a wreath of flowers round her neck  goodmorning she said pleasantly as she came up to the place where the boy was standing  goodmorning he returned where are you going in such a hurry  to the millers wedding i am rather late already for the wreath took such a long time to make so i cant stop  dont go said the boy earnestly when once they have tasted your milk they will never let you leave them and you will have to serve them all the days of your life  oh nonsense what do you know about it answered the cow who always thought she was wiser than other people why i can run twice as fast as any of them i should like to see anybody try to keep me against my will and without even a polite bow she went on her way feeling very much offended  but everything turned out just as the boy had said the company had all heard of the fame of the cows milk and persuaded her to give them some and then her doom was sealed a crowd gathered round her and held her horns so that she could not use them and like the horse she was shut in the stable and only let out in the mornings when a long rope was tied round her head and she was fastened to a stake in a grassy meadow  and so it happened to the goat and to the sheep  last of all came the reindeer looking as he always did as if some serious business was on hand  where are you going asked the boy who by this time was tired of wild cherries and was thinking of his dinner  i am invited to the wedding answered the reindeer and the miller has begged me on no account to fail him  o fool cried the boy have you no sense at all dont you know that when you get there they will hold you fast for neither beast nor bird is as strong or as swift as you  that is exactly why i am quite safe replied the reindeer i am so strong that no one can bind me and so swift that not even an arrow can catch me so goodbye for the present you will soon see me back  but none of the animals that went to the millers wedding ever came back and because they were selfwilled and conceited and would not listen to good advice they and their children have been the servants of men to this very day  lapplandische mahrchen     fortune and the woodcutter    several hundreds of years ago there lived in a forest a woodcutter and his wife and children he was very poor having only his axe to depend upon and two mules to carry the wood he cut to the neighbouring town but he worked hard and was always out of bed by five oclock summer and winter  this went on for twenty years and though his sons were now grown up and went with their father to the forest everything seemed to go against them and they remained as poor as ever in the end the woodcutter lost heart and said to himself  what is the good of working like this if i never am a penny the richer at the end i shall go to the forest no more and perhaps if i take to my bed and do not run after fortune one day she may come to me  so the next morning he did not get up and when six oclock struck his wife who had been cleaning the house went to see what was the matter  are you ill she asked wonderingly surprised at not finding him dressed the cock has crowed ever so often it is high time for you to get up  why should i get up asked the man without moving  why to go to the forest of course  yes and when i have toiled all day i hardly earn enough to give us one meal  but what can we do my poor husband said she it is just a trick of fortunes who would never smile upon us  well i have had my fill of fortunes tricks cried he if she wants me she can find me here but i have done with the wood for ever  my dear husband grief has driven you mad do you think fortune will come to anybody who does not go after her dress yourself and saddle the mules and begin your work do you know that there is not a morsel of bread in the house  i dont care if there isnt and i am not going to the forest it is no use your talking nothing will make me change my mind  the distracted wife begged and implored in vain her husband persisted in staying in bed and at last in despair she left him and went back to her work  an hour or two later a man from the nearest village knocked at her door and when she opened it he said to her goodmorning mother i have got a job to do and i want to know if your husband will lend me your mules as i see he is not using them and can lend me a hand himself  he is upstairs you had better ask him answered the woman and the man went up and repeated his request  i am sorry neighbour but i have sworn not to leave my bed and nothing will make me break my vow  well then will you lend me your two mules i will pay you something for them  certainly neighbour take them and welcome  so the man left the house and leading the mules from the stable placed two sacks on their back and drove them to a field where he had found a hidden treasure he filled the sacks with the money though he knew perfectly well that it belonged to the sultan and was driving them quietly home again when he saw two soldiers coming along the road now the man was aware that if he was caught he would be condemned to death so he fled back into the forest the mules left to themselves took the path that led to their masters stable  the woodcutters wife was looking out of the window when the mules drew up before the door so heavily laden that they almost sank under their burdens she lost no time in calling her husband who was still lying in bed  quick quick get up as fast as you can our two mules have returned with sacks on their backs so heavily laden with something or other that the poor beasts can hardly stand up  wife i have told you a dozen times already that i am not going to get up why cant you leave me in peace  as she found she could get no help from her husband the woman took a large knife and cut the cords which bound the sacks on to the animals backs they fell at once to the ground and out poured a rain of gold pieces till the little courtyard shone like the sun  a treasure gasped the woman as soon as she could speak from surprise a treasure and she ran off to tell her husband  get up get up she cried you were quite right not to go to the forest and to await fortune in your bed she has come at last our mules have returned home laden with all the gold in the world and it is now lying in the court no one in the whole country can be as rich as we are  in an instant the woodcutter was on his feet and running to the court where he paused dazzled by the glitter of the coins which lay around him  you see my dear wife that i was right he said at last fortune is so capricious you can never count on her run after her and she is sure to fly from you stay still and she is sure to come  traditions populaires de lasie mineure     the enchanted head    once upon a time an old woman lived in a small cottage near the sea with her two daughters they were very poor and the girls seldom left the house as they worked all day long making veils for the ladies to wear over their faces and every morning when the veils were finished the other took them over the bridge and sold them in the city then she bought the food that they needed for the day and returned home to do her share of veilmaking  one morning the old woman rose even earlier than usual and set off for the city with her wares she was just crossing the bridge when suddenly she knocked up against a human head which she had never seen there before the woman started back in horror but what was her surprise when the head spoke exactly as if it had a body joined on to it  take me with you good mother it said imploringly take me with you back to your house  at the sound of these words the poor woman nearly went mad with terror have that horrible thing always at home never never and she turned and ran back as fast as she could not knowing that the head was jumping dancing and rolling after her but when she reached her own door it bounded in before her and stopped in front of the fire begging and praying to be allowed to stay  all that day there was no food in the house for the veils had not been sold and they had no money to buy anything with so they all sat silent at their work inwardly cursing the head which was the cause of their misfortunes  when evening came and there was no sign of supper the head spoke for the first time that day  good mother does no one ever eat here during all the hours i have spent in your house not a creature has touched anything  no answered the old woman we are not eating anything  and why not good mother  because we have no money to buy any food  is it your custom never to eat  no for every morning i go into the city to sell my veils and with the few shillings i get for them i buy all we want today i did not cross the bridge so of course i had nothing for food  then i am the cause of your having gone hungry all day asked the head  yes you are answered the old woman  well then i will give you money and plenty of it if you will only do as i tell you in an hour as the clock strikes twelve you must be on the bridge at the place where you met me when you get there call out ahmed three times as loud as you can then a negro will appear and you must say to him the head your master desires you to open the trunk and to give me the green purse which you will find in it  very well my lord said the old woman i will set off at once for the bridge and wrapping her veil round her she went out  midnight was striking as she reached the spot where she had met the head so many hours before  ahmed ahmed ahmed cried she and immediately a huge negro as tall as a giant stood on the bridge before her  what do you want asked he  the head your master desires you to open the trunk and to give me the green purse which you will find in it  i will be back in a moment good mother said he and three minutes later he placed a purse full of sequins in the old womans hand  no one can imagine the joy of the whole family at the sight of all this wealth the tiny tumbledown cottage was rebuilt the girls had new dresses and their mother ceased selling veils it was such a new thing to them to have money to spend that they were not as careful as they might have been and byandby there was not a single coin left in the purse when this happened their hearts sank within them and their faces fell  have you spent your fortune asked the head from its corner when it saw how sad they looked well then go at midnight good mother to the bridge and call out mahomet three times as loud as you can a negro will appear in answer and you must tell him to open the trunk and to give you the red purse which he will find there  the old woman did not need twice telling but set off at once for the bridge  mahomet mahomet mahomet cried she with all her might and in an instant a negro still larger than the last stood before her  what do you want asked he  the head your master bids you open the trunk and to give me the red purse which you will find in it  very well good mother i will do so answered the negro and the moment after he had vanished he reappeared with the purse in his hand  this time the money seemed so endless that the old woman built herself a new house and filled it with the most beautiful things that were to be found in the shops her daughters were always wrapped in veils that looked as if they were woven out of sunbeams and their dresses shone with precious stones the neighbours wondered where all this sudden wealth had sprung from but nobody knew about the head  good mother said the head one day this morning you are to go to the city and ask the sultan to give me his daughter for my bride  do what asked the old woman in amazement how can i tell the sultan that a head without a body wishes to become his soninlaw they will think that i am mad and i shall be hooted from the palace and stoned by the children  do as i bid you replied the head it is my will  the old woman was afraid to say anything more and putting on her richest clothes started for the palace the sultan granted her an audience at once and in a trembling voice she made her request  are you mad old woman said the sultan staring at her  the wooer is powerful o sultan and nothing is impossible to him  is that true  it is o sultan i swear it answered she  then let him show his power by doing three things and i will give him my daughter  command o gracious prince said she  do you see that hill in front of the palace asked the sultan  i see it answered she  well in forty days the man who has sent you must make that hill vanish and plant a beautiful garden in its place that is the first thing now go and tell him what i say  so the old woman returned and told the head the sultans first condition  it is well he replied and said no more about it  for thirtynine days the head remained in its favourite corner the old woman thought that the task set before was beyond his powers and that no more would be heard about the sultans daughter but on the thirtyninth evening after her visit to the palace the head suddenly spoke  good mother he said you must go tonight to the bridge and when you are there cry ali ali ali as loud as you can a negro will appear before you and you will tell him that he is to level the hill and to make in its place the most beautiful garden that ever was seen  i will go at once answered she  it did not take her long to reach the bridge which led to the city and she took up her position on the spot where she had first seen the head and called loudly ali ali ali in an instant a negro appeared before her of such a huge size that the old woman was half frightened but his voice was mild and gentle as he said what is it that you want  your master bids you level the hill that stands in front of the sultans palace and in its place to make the most beautiful garden in the world  tell my master he shall be obeyed replied ali it shall be done this moment and the old woman went home and gave alis message to the head  meanwhile the sultan was in his palace waiting till the fortieth day should dawn and wondering that not one spadeful of earth should have been dug out of the hill  if that old woman has been playing me a trick thought he i will hang her and i will put up a gallows tomorrow on the hill itself  but when tomorrow came there was no hill and when the sultan opened his eyes he could not imagine why the room was so much lighter than usual and what was the reason of the sweet smell of flowers that filled the air  can there be a fire he said to himself the sun never came in at this window before i must get up and see so he rose and looked out and underneath him flowers from every part of the world were blooming and creepers of every colour hung in chains from tree to tree  then he remembered certainly that old womans son is a clever magician cried he i never met anyone as clever as that what shall i give him to do next let me think ah i know and he sent for the old woman who by the orders of the head was waiting below  your son has carried out my wishes very nicely he said the garden is larger and better than that of any other king but when i walk across it i shall need some place to rest on the other side in forty days he must build me a palace in which every room shall be filled with different furniture from a different country and each more magnificent than any room that ever was seen and having said this he turned round and went away  oh he will never be able to do that thought she it is much more difficult than the hill and she walked home slowly with her head bent  well what am i to do next asked the head cheerfully and the old woman told her story  dear me is that all why it is childs play answered the head and troubled no more about the palace for thirtynine days then he told the old woman to go to the bridge and call for hassan  what do you want old woman asked hassan when he appeared for he was not as polite as the others had been  your master commands you to build the most magnificent palace that ever was seen replied she and you are to place it on the borders of the new garden  he shall be obeyed answered hassan and when the sultan woke he saw in the distance a palace built of soft blue marble resting on slender pillars of pure gold  that old womans son is certainly allpowerful cried he what shall i bid him do now and after thinking some time he sent for the old woman who was expecting the summons  the garden is wonderful and the palace the finest in the world said he so fine that my servants would cut but a sorry figure in it let your son fill it with forty slaves whose beauty shall be unequalled all exactly like each other and of the same height  this time the king thought he had invented something totally impossible and was quite pleased with himself for his cleverness  thirtynine days passed and at midnight on the night of the last the old woman was standing on the bridge  bekir bekir bekir cried she and a negro appeared and inquired what she wanted  the head your master bids you find forty slaves of unequalled beauty and of the same height and place them in the sultans palace on the other side of the garden  and when on the morning of the fortieth day the sultan went to the blue palace and was received by the forty slaves he nearly lost his wits from surprise  i will assuredly give my daughter to the old womans son thought he if i were to search all the world through i could never find a more powerful soninlaw  and when the old woman entered his presence he informed her that he was ready to fulfil his promise and she was to bid her son appear at the palace without delay  this command did not at all please the old woman though of course she made no objections to the sultan  all has gone well so far she grumbled when she told her story to the head but what do you suppose the sultan will say when he sees his daughters husband  never mind what he says put me on a silver dish and carry me to the palace  so it was done though the old womans heart beat as she laid down the dish with the head upon it  at the sight before him the king flew into a violent rage  i will never marry my daughter to such a monster he cried but the princess placed her head gently on his arm  you have given your word my father and you cannot break it said she  but my child it is impossible for you to marry such a being exclaimed the sultan  yes i will marry him he had a beautiful head and i love him already  so the marriage was celebrated and great feasts were held in the palace though the people wept tears to think of the sad fate of their beloved princess but when the merrymaking was done and the young couple were alone the head suddenly disappeared or rather a body was added to it and one of the handsomest young men that ever was seen stood before the princess  a wicked fairy enchanted me at my birth he said and for the rest of the world i must always be a head only but for you and you only i am a man like other men  and that is all i care about said the princess  traditions populaires de toutes les nations asie mineure     the sister of the sun    a long time ago there lived a young prince whose favourite playfellow was the son of the gardener who lived in the grounds of the palace the king would have preferred his choosing a friend from the pages who were brought up at court but the prince would have nothing to say to them and as he was a spoilt child and allowed his way in all things and the gardeners boy was quiet and wellbehaved he was suffered to be in the palace morning noon and night  the game the children loved the best was a match at archery for the king had given them two bows exactly alike and they would spend whole days in trying to see which could shoot the highest this is always very dangerous and it was a great wonder they did not put their eyes out but somehow or other they managed to escape  one morning when the prince had done his lessons he ran out to call his friend and they both hurried off to the lawn which was their usual playground they took their bows out of the little hut where their toys were kept and began to see which could shoot the highest at last they happened to let fly their arrows both together and when they fell to earth again the tail feather of a golden hen was found sticking in one now the question began to arise whose was the lucky arrow for they were both alike and look as closely as you would you could see no difference between them the prince declared that the arrow was his and the gardeners boy was quite sure it was hisand on this occasion he was perfectly right but as they could not decide the matter they went straight to the king  when the king had heard the story he decided that the feather belonged to his son but the other boy would not listen to this and claimed the feather for himself at length the kings patience gave way and he said angrily  very well if you are so sure that the feather is yours yours it shall be only you will have to seek till you find a golden hen with a feather missing from her tail and if you fail to find her your head will be the forfeit  the boy had need of all his courage to listen silently to the kings words he had no idea where the golden hen might be or even if he discovered that how he was to get to her but there was nothing for it but to do the kings bidding and he felt that the sooner he left the palace the better so he went home and put some food into a bag and then set forth hoping that some accident might show him which path to take  after walking for several hours he met a fox who seemed inclined to be friendly and the boy was so glad to have anyone to talk to that he sat down and entered into conversation  where are you going asked the fox  i have got to find a golden hen who has lost a feather out of her tail answered the boy but i dont know where she lives or how i shall catch her  oh i can show you the way said the fox who was really very goodnatured far towards the east in that direction lives a beautiful maiden who is called the sister of the sun she has three golden hens in her house perhaps the feather belongs to one of them  the boy was delighted at this news and they walked on all day together the fox in front and the boy behind when evening came they lay down to sleep and put the knapsack under their heads for a pillow  suddenly about midnight the fox gave a low whine and drew nearer to his bedfellow cousin he whispered very low there is someone coming who will take the knapsack away from me look over there and the boy peeping through the bushes saw a man  oh i dont think he will rob us said the boy and when the man drew near he told them his story which so much interested the stranger that he asked leave to travel with them as he might be of some use so when the sun rose they set out again the fox in front as before the man and boy following  after some hours they reached the castle of the sister of the sun who kept the golden hens among her treasures they halted before the gate and took counsel as to which of them should go in and see the lady herself  i think it would be best for me to enter and steal the hens said the fox but this did not please the boy at all  no it is my business so it is right that i should go answered he  you will find it a very difficult matter to get hold of the hens replied the fox  oh nothing is likely to happen to me returned the boy  well go then said the fox but be careful not to make any mistake steal only the hen which has the feather missing from her tail and leave the others alone  the man listened but did not interfere and the boy entered the court of the palace  he soon spied the three hens strutting proudly about though they were really anxiously wondering if there were not some grains lying on the ground that they might be glad to eat and as the last one passed by him he saw she had one feather missing from her tail  at this sight the youth darted forward and seized the hen by the neck so that she could not struggle then tucking her comfortably under his arm he made straight for the gate unluckily just as he was about to go through it he looked back and caught a glimpse of wonderful splendours from an open door of the palace after all there is no hurry he said to himself i may as well see something now i am here and turned back forgetting all about the hen which escaped from under his arm and ran to join her sisters  he was so much fascinated by the sight of all the beautiful things which peeped through the door that he scarcely noticed that he had lost the prize he had won and he did not remember there was such a thing as a hen in the world when he beheld the sister of the sun sleeping on a bed before him  for some time he stood staring then he came to himself with a start and feeling that he had no business there softly stole away and was fortunate enough to recapture the hen which he took with him to the gate on the threshold he stopped again why should i not look at the sister of the sun he thought to himself she is asleep and will never know and he turned back for the second time and entered the chamber while the hen wriggled herself free as before when he had gazed his fill he went out into the courtyard and picked up his hen who was seeking for corn  as he drew near the gate he paused why did i not give her a kiss he said to himself i shall never kiss any woman so beautiful and he wrung his hands with regret so that the hen fell to the ground and ran away  but i can do it still he cried with delight and he rushed back to the chamber and kissed the sleeping maiden on the forehead but alas when he came out again he found that the hen had grown so shy that she would not let him come near her and worse than that her sisters began to cluck so loud that the sister of the sun was awakened by the noise she jumped up in haste from her bed and going to the door she said to the boy  you shall never never have my hen till you bring me back my sister who was carried off by a giant to his castle which is a long way off  slowly and sadly the youth left the palace and told his story to his friends who were waiting outside the gate how he had actually held the hen three times in his arms and had lost her  i knew that we should not get off so easily said the fox shaking his head but there is no more time to waste let us set off at once in search of the sister luckily i know the way  they walked on for many days till at length the fox who as usual was going first stopped suddenly  the giants castle is not far now he said but when we reach it you two must remain outside while i go and fetch the princess directly i bring her out you must both catch hold of her tight and get away as fast as you can while i return to the castle and talk to the giantsfor there are many of themso that they may not notice the escape of the princess  a few minutes later they arrived at the castle and the fox who had often been there before slipped in without difficulty there were several giants both young and old in the hall and they were all dancing round the princess as soon as they saw the fox they cried out come and dance too old fox it is a long time since we have seen you  so the fox stood up and did his steps with the best of them but after a while he stopped and said  i know a charming new dance that i should like to show you but it can only be done by two people if the princess will honour me for a few minutes you will soon see how it is done  ah that is delightful we want something new answered they and placed the princess between the outstretched arms of the fox in one instant he had knocked over the great stand of lights that lighted the hall and in the darkness had borne the princess to the gate his comrades seized hold of her as they had been bidden and the fox was back again in the hall before anyone had missed him he found the giants busy trying to kindle a fire and get some light but after a bit someone cried out  where is the princess  here in my arms replied the fox dont be afraid she is quite safe and he waited until he thought that his comrades had gained a good start and put at least five or six mountains between themselves and the giants then he sprang through the door calling as he went the maiden is here take her if you can  at these words the giants understood that their prize had escaped and they ran after the fox as fast as their great legs could carry them thinking that they should soon come up with the fox who they supposed had the princess on his back the fox on his side was far too clever to choose the same path that his friends had taken but would in and out of the forest till at last even he was tired out and fell fast asleep under a tree indeed he was so exhausted with his days work that he never heard the approach of the giants and their hands were already stretched out to seize his tail when his eyes opened and with a tremendous bound he was once more beyond their reach all the rest of the night the fox ran and ran but when bright red spread over the east he stopped and waited till the giants were close upon him then he turned and said quietly look there is the sister of the sun  the giants raised their eyes all at once and were instantly turned into pillars of stone the fox then made each pillar a low bow and set off to join his friends  he knew a great many short cuts across the hills so it was not long before he came up with them and all four travelled night and day till they reached the castle of the sister of the sun what joy and feasting there was throughout the palace at the sight of the princess whom they had mourned as dead and they could not make enough of the boy who had gone through such dangers in order to rescue her the golden hen was given to him at once and more than that the sister of the sun told him that in a little time when he was a few years older she would herself pay a visit to his home and become his wife the boy could hardly believe his ears when he heard what was in store for him for his was the most beautiful princess in all the world and however thick the darkness might be it fled away at once from the light of a star on her forehead  so the boy set forth on his journey home with his friends for company his heart full of gladness when he thought of the promise of the princess but one by one his comrades dropped off at the places where they had first met him and he was quite alone when he reached his native town and the gates of the palace with the golden hen under his arm he presented himself before the king and told his adventures and how he was going to have for a wife a princess so wonderful and unlike all other princesses that the star on her forehead could turn night into day the king listened silently and when the boy had done he said quietly if i find that your story is not true i will have you thrown into a cask of pitch  it is trueevery word of it answered the boy and went on to tell that the day and even the hour were fixed when his bride was to come and seek him  but as the time drew near and nothing was heard of the princess the youth became anxious and uneasy especially when it came to his ears that the great cask was being filled with pitch and that sticks were laid underneath to make a fire to boil it with all day long the boy stood at the window looking over the sea by which the princess must travel but there were no signs of her not even the tiniest white sail and as he stood soldiers came and laid hands on him and led him up to the cask where a big fire was blazing and the horrid black pitch boiling and bubbling over the sides he looked and shuddered but there was no escape so he shut his eyes to avoid seeing  the word was given for him to mount the steps which led to the top of the cask when suddenly some men were seen running with all their might crying as they went that a large ship with its sails spread was making straight for the city no one knew what the ship was or whence it came but the king declared that he would not have the boy burned before its arrival there would always be time enough for that  at length the vessel was safe in port and a whisper went through the watching crowd that on board was the sister of the sun who had come to marry the young peasant as she had promised in a few moments more she had landed and desired to be shown the way to the cottage which her bridegroom had so often described to her and whither he had been led back by the kings order at the first sign of the ship  dont you know me asked the sister of the sun bending over him where he lay almost driven out of his senses with terror  no no i dont know you answered the youth without raising his eyes  kiss me said the sister of the sun and the youth obeyed her but still without looking up  dont you know me now asked she  no i dont know youi dont know you he replied with the manner of a man whom fear had driven mad  at this the sister of the sun grew rather frightened and beginning at the beginning she told him the story of his meeting with her and how she had come a long way in order to marry him and just as she had finished in walked the king to see if what the boy had said was really true but hardly had he opened the door of the cottage when he was almost blinded by the light that filled it and he remembered what he had been told about the star on the forehead of the princess he staggered back as if he had been struck then a curious feeling took hold of him which he had never felt before and falling on his knees before the sister of the sun he implored her to give up all thought of the peasant boy and to share his throne but she laughed and said she had a finer throne of her own if she wanted to sit on it and that she was free to please herself and would have no husband but the boy whom she would never have seen except for the king himself  i shall marry him tomorrow ended she and ordered the preparations to be set on foot at once  when the next day came however the bridegrooms father informed the princess that by the law of the land the marriage must take place in the presence of the king but he hoped his majesty would not long delay his arrival an hour or two passed and everyone was waiting and watching when at last the sound of trumpets was heard and a grand procession was seen marching up the street a chair covered with velvet had been made ready for the king and he took his seat upon it and looking round upon the assembled company he said  i have no wish to forbid this marriage but before i can allow it to be celebrated the bridegroom must prove himself worthy of such a bride by fulfilling three tasks and the first is that in a single day he must cut down every tree in an entire forest  the youth stood aghast as the kings words he had never cut down a tree in his life and had not the least idea how to begin and as for a whole forest but the princess saw what was passing in his mind and whispered to him  dont be afraid in my ship you will find an axe which you must carry off to the forest when you have cut down one tree with it just say so let the forest fall and in an instant all the trees will be on the ground but pick up three chips of the tree you felled and put them in your pocket  and the young man did exactly as he was bid and soon returned with the three chips safe in his coat  the following morning the princess declared that she had been thinking about the matter and that as she was not a subject of the king she saw no reason why she should be bound by his laws and she meant to be married that very day but the bridegrooms father told her that it was all very well for her to talk like that but it was quite different for his son who would pay with his head for any disobedience to the kings commands however in consideration of what the youth had done the day before he hoped his majestys heart might be softened especially as he had sent a message that they might expect him at once with this the bridal pair had to be content and be as patient as they could till the kings arrival  he did not keep them long but they saw by his face that nothing good awaited them  the marriage cannot take place he said shortly till the youth has joined to their roots all the trees he cut down yesterday  this sounded much more difficult than what he had done before and he turned in despair to the sister of the sun  it is all right she whispered encouragingly take this water and sprinkle it on one of the fallen trees and say to it so let all the trees of the forest stand upright and in a moment they will be erect again  and the young man did what he was told and left the forest looking exactly as it had done before  now surely thought the princess there was no longer any need to put off the wedding and she gave orders that all should be ready for the following day but again the old man interfered and declared that without the kings permission no marriage could take place for the third time his majesty was sent for and for the third time he proclaimed that he could not give his consent until the bridegroom should have slain a serpent which dwelt in a broad river that flowed at the back of the castle everyone knew stories of this terrible serpent though no one had actually seen it but from time to time a child strayed from home and never came back and then mothers would forbid the other children to go near the river which had juicy fruits and lovely flowers growing along its banks  so no wonder the youth trembled and turned pale when he heard what lay before him  you will succeed in this also whispered the sister of the sun pressing his hand for in my ship is a magic sword which will cut through everything go down to the river and unfasten a boat which lies moored there and throw the chips into the water when the serpent rears up its body you will cut off its three heads with one blow of your sword then take the tip of each tongue and go with it tomorrow morning into the kings kitchen if the king himself should enter just say to him here are three gifts i offer you in return for the services you demanded of me and throw the tips of the serpents tongues at him and hasten to the ship as fast as your legs will carry you but be sure you take great care never to look behind you  the young man did exactly what the princess had told him the three chips which he flung into the river became a boat and as he steered across the stream the serpent put up its head and hissed loudly the youth had his sword ready and in another second the three heads were bobbing on the water guiding his boat till he was beside them he stooped down and snipped off the ends of the tongues and then rowed back to the other bank next morning he carried them into the royal kitchen and when the king entered as was his custom to see what he was going to have for dinner the bridegroom flung them in his face saying here is a gift for you in return for the services you asked of me and opening the kitchen door he fled to the ship unluckily he missed the way and in his excitement ran backwards and forwards without knowing whither he was going at last in despair he looked round and saw to his amazement that both the city and palace had vanished completely then he turned his eyes in the other direction and far far away he caught sight of the ship with her sails spread and a fair wind behind her  this dreadful spectacle seemed to take away his senses and all day long he wandered about without knowing where he was going till in the evening he noticed some smoke from a little hut of turf near by he went straight up to it and cried o mother let me come in for pitys sake the old woman who lived in the hut beckoned to him to enter and hardly was he inside when he cried again o mother can you tell me anything of the sister of the sun  but the woman only shook her head no i know nothing of her said she  the young man turned to leave the hut but the old woman stopped him and giving him a letter begged him to carry it to her next eldest sister saying if you should get tired on the way take out the letter and rustle the paper  this advice surprised the young man a good deal as he did not see how it could help him but he did not answer and went down the road without knowing where he was going at length he grew so tired he could walk no more then he remembered what the old woman had said after he had rustled the leaves only once all fatigue disappeared and he strode over the grass till he came to another little turf hut  let me in i pray you dear mother cried he and the door opened in front of him your sister has sent you this letter he said and added quickly o mother can you tell me anything of the sister of the sun  no i know nothing of her answered she but as he turned hopelessly away she stopped him  if you happen to pass my eldest sisters house will you give her this letter said she and if you should get tired on the road just take it out of your pocket and rustle the paper  so the young man put the letter in his pocket and walked all day over the hills till he reached a little turf hut exactly like the other two  let me in i pray you dear mother cried he and as he entered he added here is a letter from your sister andcan you tell me anything of the sister of the sun  yes i can answered the old woman she lives in the castle on the banka her father lost a battle only a few days ago because you had stolen his sword from him and the sister of the sun herself is almost dead of grief but when you see her stick a pin into the palm of her hand and suck the drops of blood that flow then she will grow calmer and will know you again only beware for before you reach the castle on the banka fearful things will happen  he thanked the old woman with tears of gladness for the good news she had given him and continued his journey but he had not gone very far when at a turn of the road he met with two brothers who were quarrelling over a piece of cloth  my good men what are you fighting about said he that cloth does not look worth much  oh it is ragged enough answered they but it was left us by our father and if any man wraps it round him no one can see him and we each want it for our own  let me put it round me for a moment said the youth and then i will tell you whose it ought to be  the brothers were pleased with this idea and gave him the stuff but the moment he had thrown it over his shoulder he disappeared as completely as if he had never been there at all  meanwhile the young man walked briskly along till he came up with two other men who were disputing over a tablecloth  what is the matter asked he stopping in front of them  if this cloth is spread on a table answered they the table is instantly covered with the most delicious food and we each want to have it  let me try the tablecloth said the youth and i will tell you whose it ought to be  the two men were quite pleased with this idea and handed him the cloth he then hastily threw the first piece of stuff round his shoulders and vanished from sight leaving the two men grieving over their own folly  the young man had not walked far before he saw two more men standing by the roadside both grasping the same stout staff and sometimes one seemed on the point of getting it and sometimes the other  what are you quarrelling about you could cut a dozen sticks from the wood each just as good as that said the young man and as he spoke the fighters both stopped and looked at him  ah you may think so said one but a blow from one end of this stick will kill a man while a touch from the other end will bring him back to life you wont easily find another stick like that  no that is true answered the young man let me just look at it and i will tell you whose it ought to be  the men were pleased with the idea and handed him the staff  it is very curious certainly said he but which end is it that restores people to life after all anyone can be killed by a blow from a stick if it is only hard enough but when he was shown the end he threw the stuff over his shoulders and vanished  at last he saw another set of men who were struggling for the possession of a pair of shoes  why cant you leave that pair of old shoes alone said he why you could not walk a yard in them  yes they are old enough answered they but whoever puts them on and wishes himself at a particular place gets there without going  that sounds very clever said the youth let me try them and then i shall be able to tell you whose they ought to be  the idea pleased the men and they handed him the shoes but the moment they were on his feet he cried  i wish to be in the castle on the banka and before he knew it he was there and found the sister of the sun dying of grief he knelt down by her side and pulling a pin he stuck it into the palm of her hand so that a drop of blood gushed out this he sucked as he had been told to do by the old woman and immediately the princess came to herself and flung her arms round his neck then she told him all her story and what had happened since the ship had sailed away without him but the worst misfortune of all she added was a battle which my father lost because you had vanished with his magic sword and out of his whole army hardly one man was left  show me the battlefield said he and she took him to a wild heath where the dead were lying as they fell waiting for burial one by one he touched them with the end of his staff till at length they all stood before him throughout the kingdom there was nothing but joy and this time the wedding was really celebrated and the bridal pair lived happily in the castle on the banka till they died  lapplandische mahrchen     the prince and the three fates    once upon a time a little boy was born to a king who ruled over a great country through which ran a wide river the king was nearly beside himself with joy for he had always longed for a son to inherit his crown and he sent messages to beg all the most powerful fairies to come and see this wonderful baby in an hour or two so many were gathered round the cradle that the child seemed in danger of being smothered but the king who was watching the fairies eagerly was disturbed to see them looking grave is there anything the matter he asked anxiously  the fairies looked at him and all shook their heads at once  he is a beautiful boy and it is a great pity but what is to happen will happen said they it is written in the books of fate that he must die either by a crocodile or a serpent or by a dog if we could save him we would but that is beyond our power  and so saying they vanished  for a time the king stood where he was horrorstricken at what he had heard but being of a hopeful nature he began at once to invent plans to save the prince from the dreadful doom that awaited him he instantly sent for his master builder and bade him construct a strong castle on the top of a mountain which should be fitted with the most precious things from the kings own palace and every kind of toy a child could wish to play with and besides he gave the strictest orders that a guard should walk round the castle night and day  for four or five years the baby lived in the castle alone with his nurses taking his airings on the broad terraces which were surrounded by walls with a moat beneath them and only a drawbridge to connect them with the outer world  one day when the prince was old enough to run quite fast by himself he looked from the terrace across the moat and saw a little soft fluffy ball of a dog jumping and playing on the other side now of course all dogs had been kept from him for fear that the fairies prophecy should come true and he had never even beheld one before so he turned to the page who was walking behind him and said  what is that funny little thing which is running so fast over there  that is a dog prince answered the page  well bring me one like it and we will see which can run the faster and he watched the dog till it had disappeared round the corner  the page was much puzzled to know what to do he had strict orders to refuse the prince nothing yet he remembered the prophecy and felt that this was a serious matter at last he thought he had better tell the king the whole story and let him decide the question  oh get him a dog if he wants one said the king he will only cry his heart out if he does not have it so a puppy was found exactly like the other they might have been twins and perhaps they were  years went by and the boy and the dog played together till the boy grew tall and strong the time came at last when he sent a message to his father saying  why do you keep me shut up here doing nothing i know all about the prophecy that was made at my birth but i would far rather be killed at once than live an idle useless life here so give me arms and let me go i pray you me and my dog too  and again the king listened to his wishes and he and his dog were carried in a ship to the other side of the river which was so broad here it might almost have been the sea a black horse was waiting for him tied to a tree and he mounted and rode away wherever his fancy took him the dog always at his heels never was any prince so happy as he and he rode and rode till at length he came to a kings palace  the king who lived in it did not care about looking after his country and seeing that his people lived cheerful and contented lives he spent his whole time in making riddles and inventing plans which he had much better have let alone at the period when the young prince reached the kingdom he had just completed a wonderful house for his only child a daughter it had seventy windows each seventy feet from the ground and he had sent the royal herald round the borders of the neighbouring kingdoms to proclaim that whoever could climb up the walls to the window of the princess should win her for his wife  the fame of the princesss beauty had spread far and wide and there was no lack of princes who wished to try their fortune very funny the palace must have looked each morning with the dabs of different colour on the white marble as the princes were climbing up the walls but though some managed to get further than others nobody was anywhere near the top  they had already been spending several days in this manner when the young prince arrived and as he was pleasant to look upon and civil to talk to they welcomed him to the house which had been given to them and saw that his bath was properly perfumed after his long journey where do you come from they said at last and whose son are you  but the young prince had reasons for keeping his own secret and he answered  my father was master of the horse to the king of my country and after my mother died he married another wife at first all went well but as soon as she had babies of her own she hated me and i fled lest she should do me harm  the hearts of the other young men were touched as soon as they heard this story and they did everything they could think of to make him forget his past sorrows  what are you doing here said the youth one day  we spend our whole time climbing up the walls of the palace trying to reach the windows of the princess answered the young men but as yet no one has reached within ten feet of them  oh let me try too cried the prince but tomorrow i will wait and see what you do before i begin  so the next day he stood where he could watch the young men go up and he noted the places on the wall that seemed most difficult and made up his mind that when his turn came he would go up some other way  day after day he was to be seen watching the wooers till one morning he felt that he knew the plan of the walls by heart and took his place by the side of the others thanks to what he had learned from the failure of the rest he managed to grasp one little rough projection after another till at last to the envy of his friends he stood on the sill of the princesss window looking up from below they saw a white hand stretched forth to draw him in  then one of the young men ran straight to the kings palace and said the wall has been climbed and the prize is won  by whom cried the king starting up from his throne which of the princes may i claim as my soninlaw  the youth who succeeded in climbing to the princesss window is not a prince at all answered the young man he is the son of the master of the horse to the great king who dwells across the river and he fled from his own country to escape from the hatred of his stepmother  at this news the king was very angry for it had never entered his head that anyone but a prince would seek to woo his daughter  let him go back to the land whence he came he shouted in wrath does he expect me to give my daughter to an exile and he began to smash the drinking vessels in his fury indeed he quite frightened the young man who ran hastily home to his friends and told the youth what the king had said  now the princess who was leaning from her window heard his words and bade the messenger go back to the king her father and tell him that she had sworn a vow never to eat or drink again if the youth was taken from her the king was more angry than ever when he received this message and ordered his guards to go at once to the palace and put the successful wooer to death but the princess threw herself between him and his murderers  lay a finger on him and i shall be dead before sunset said she and as they saw that she meant it they left the palace and carried the tale to her father  by this time the kings anger was dying away and he began to consider what his people would think of him if he broke the promise he had publicly given so he ordered the princess to be brought before him and the young man also and when they entered the throne room he was so pleased with the noble air of the victor that his wrath quite melted away and he ran to him and embraced him  tell me who you are he asked when he had recovered himself a little for i will never believe that you have not royal blood in your veins  but the prince still had his reasons for being silent and only told the same story however the king had taken such a fancy to the youth that he said no more and the marriage took place the following day and great herds of cattle and a large estate were given to the young couple  after a little while the prince said to his wife my life is in the hands of three creaturesa crocodile a serpent and a dog  ah how rash you are cried the princess throwing her arms round his neck if you know that how can you have that horrid beast about you i will give orders to have him killed at once  but the prince would not listen to her  kill my dear little dog who had been my playfellow since he was a puppy exclaimed he oh never would i allow that and all that the princess could get from him was that he would always wear a sword and have somebody with him when he left the palace  when the prince and princess had been married a few months the prince heard that his stepmother was dead and his father was old and ill and longing to have his eldest son by his side again the young man could not remain deaf to such a message and he took a tender farewell of his wife and set out on his journey home it was a long way and he was forced to rest often on the road and so it happened that one night when he was sleeping in a city on the banks of the great river a huge crocodile came silently up and made its way along a passage to the princes room fortunately one of his guards woke up as it was trying to steal past them and shut the crocodile up in a large hall where a giant watched over it never leaving the spot except during the night when the crocodile slept and this went on for more than a month  now when the prince found that he was not likely to leave his fathers kingdom again he sent for his wife and bade the messenger tell her that he would await her coming in the town on the banks of the great river this was the reason why he delayed his journey so long and narrowly escaped being eaten by the crocodile during the weeks that followed the prince amused himself as best he could though he counted the minutes to the arrival of the princess and when she did come he at once prepared to start for the court that very night however while he was asleep the princess noticed something strange in one of the corners of the room it was a dark patch and seemed as she looked to grow longer and longer and to be moving slowly towards the cushions on which the prince was lying she shrank in terror but slight as was the noise the thing heard it and raised its head to listen then she saw it was the long flat head of a serpent and the recollection of the prophecy rushed into her mind without waking her husband she glided out of bed and taking up a heavy bowl of milk which stood on a table laid it on the floor in the path of the serpentfor she knew that no serpent in the world can resist milk she held her breath as the snake drew near and watched it throw up its head again as if it was smelling something nice while its forky tongue darted out greedily at length its eyes fell upon the milk and in an instant it was lapping it so fast that it was a wonder the creature did not choke for it never took its head from the bowl as long as a drop was left in it after that it dropped on the ground and slept heavily this was what the princess had been waiting for and catching up her husbands sword she severed the snakes head from its body  the morning after this adventure the prince and princess set out for the kings palace but found when they reached it that he was already dead they gave him a magnificent burial and then the prince had to examine the new laws which had been made in his absence and do a great deal of business besides till he grew quite ill from fatigue and was obliged to go away to one of his palaces on the banks of the river in order to rest here he soon got better and began to hunt and to shoot wild duck with his bow and wherever he went his dog now grown very old went with him  one morning the prince and his dog were out as usual and in chasing their game they drew near the bank of the river the prince was running at full speed after his dog when he almost fell over something that looked like a log of wood which was lying in his path to his surprise a voice spoke to him and he saw that the thing which he had taken for a branch was really a crocodile  you cannot escape from me it was saying when he had gathered his senses again i am your fate and wherever you go and whatever you do you will always find me before you there is only one means of shaking off my power if you can dig a pit in the dry sand which will remain full of water my spell will be broken if not death will come to you speedily i give you this one chance now go  the young man walked sadly away and when he reached the palace he shut himself into his room and for the rest of the day refused to see anyone not even his wife at sunset however as no sound could be heard through the door the princess grew quite frightened and made such a noise that the prince was forced to draw back the bolt and let her come in how pale you look she cried has anything hurt you tell me i pray you what is the matter for perhaps i can help  so the prince told her the whole story and of the impossible task given him by the crocodile  how can a sand hole remain full of water asked he of course it will all run through the crocodile called it a chance but he might as well have dragged me into the river at once he said truly that i cannot escape him  oh if that is all cried the princess i can set you free myself for my fairy godmother taught me to know the use of plants and in the desert not far from here there grows a little fourleaved herb which will keep the water in the pit for a whole year i will go in search of it at dawn and you can begin to dig the hole as soon as you like  to comfort her husband the princess had spoken lightly and gaily but she knew very well she had no light task before her still she was full of courage and energy and determined that one way or another her husband should be saved  it was still starlight when she left the palace on a snowwhite donkey and rode away from the river straight to the west for some time she could see nothing before her but a flat waste of sand which became hotter and hotter as the sun rose higher and higher then a dreadful thirst seized her and the donkey but there was no stream to quench it and if there had been she would hardly have had time to stop for she still had far to go and must be back before evening or else the crocodile might declare that the prince had not fulfilled his conditions so she spoke cheering words to her donkey who brayed in reply and the two pushed steadily on  oh how glad they both were when they caught sight of a tall rock in the distance they forgot that they were thirsty and that the sun was hot and the ground seemed to fly under their feet till the donkey stopped of its own accord in the cool shadow but though the donkey might rest the princess could not for the plant as she knew grew on the very top of the rock and a wide chasm ran round the foot of it luckily she had brought a rope with her and making a noose at one end she flung it across with all her might the first time it slid back slowly into the ditch and she had to draw it up and throw it again but at length the noose caught on something the princess could not see what and had to trust her whole weight to this little bridge which might snap and let her fall deep down among the rocks and in that case her death was as certain as that of the prince  but nothing so dreadful happened the princess got safely to the other side and then became the worst part of her task as fast as she put her foot on a ledge of the rock the stone broke away from under her and left her in the same place as before meanwhile the hours were passing and it was nearly noon  the heart of the poor princess was filled with despair but she would not give up the struggle she looked round till she saw a small stone above her which seemed rather stronger than the rest and by only poising her foot lightly on those that lay between she managed by a great effort to reach it in this way with torn and bleeding hands she gained the top but here such a violent wind was blowing that she was almost blinded with dust and was obliged to throw herself on the ground and feel about after the precious herb  for a few terrible moments she thought that the rock was bare and that her journey had been to no purpose feel where she would there was nothing but grit and stones when suddenly her fingers touched something soft in a crevice it was a plant that was clear but was it the right one see she could not for the wind was blowing more fiercely than ever so she lay where she was and counted the leaves one two threeyes yes there were four and plucking a leaf she held it safe in her hand while she turned almost stunned by the wind to go down the rock  when once she was safely over the side all became still in a moment and she slid down the rock so fast that it was only a wonder that she did not land in the chasm however by good luck she stopped quite close to her rope bridge and was soon across it the donkey brayed joyfully at the sight of her and set off home at his best speed never seeming to know that the earth under his feet was nearly as hot as the sun above him  on the bank of the great river he halted and the princess rushed up to where the prince was standing by the pit he had digged in the dry sand with a huge water pot beside it a little way off the crocodile lay blinking in the sun with his sharp teeth and whityyellow jaws wide open  at a signal from the princess the prince poured the water in the hole and the moment it reached the brim the princess flung in the fourleaved plant would the charm work or would the water trickle away slowly through the sand and the prince fall a victim to that horrible monster for half an hour they stood with their eyes rooted to the spot but the hole remained as full as at the beginning with the little green leaf floating on the top then the prince turned with a shout of triumph and the crocodile sulkily plunged into the river  the prince had escape for ever the second of his three fates  he stood there looking after the crocodile and rejoicing that he was free when he was startled by a wild duck which flew past them seeking shelter among the rushes that bordered the edge of the stream in another instant his dog dashed by in hot pursuit and knocked heavily against his masters legs the prince staggered lost his balance and fell backwards into the river where the mud and the rushes caught him and held him fast he shrieked for help to his wife who came running and luckily brought her rope with her the poor old dog was drowned but the prince was pulled to shore my wife he said has been stronger than my fate  adapted from les contes populaires de legypte ancienne     the fox and the lapp    once upon a time a fox lay peeping out of his hole watching the road that ran by at a little distance and hoping to see something that might amuse him for he was feeling very dull and rather cross for a long while he watched in vain everything seemed asleep and not even a bird stirred overhead the fox grew crosser than ever and he was just turning away in disgust from his place when he heard the sound of feet coming over the snow he crouched eagerly down at the edge of the road and said to himself i wonder what would happen if i were to pretend to be dead this is a man driving a reindeer sledge i know the tinkling of the harness and at any rate i shall have an adventure and that is always something  so he stretched himself out by the side of the road carefully choosing a spot where the driver could not help seeing him yet where the reindeer would not tread on him and all fell out just as he had expected the sledgedriver pulled up sharply as his eyes lighted on the beautiful animal lying stiffly beside him and jumping out he threw the fox into the bottom of the sledge where the goods he was carrying were bound tightly together by ropes the fox did not move a muscle though his bones were sore from the fall and the driver got back to his seat again and drove on merrily  but before they had gone very far the fox who was near the edge contrived to slip over and when the laplander saw him stretched out on the snow he pulled up his reindeer and put the fox into one of the other sledges that was fastened behind for it was marketday at the nearest town and the man had much to sell  they drove on a little further when some noise in the forest made the man turn his head just in time to see the fox fall with a heavy thump on to the frozen snow that beast is bewitched he said to himself and then he threw the fox into the last sledge of all which had a cargo of fishes this was exactly what the cunning creature wanted and he wriggled gently to the front and bit the cord which tied the sledge to the one before it so that it remained standing in the middle of the road  now there were so many sledges that the lapp did not notice for a long while that one was missing indeed he would have entered the town without knowing if snow had not suddenly begun to fall then he got down to secure more firmly the cloths that kept his goods dry and going to the end of the long row discovered that the sledge containing the fish and the fox was missing he quickly unharnessed one of his reindeer and rode back along the way he had come to find the sledge standing safe in the middle of the road but as the fox had bitten off the cord close to the noose there was no means of moving it away  the fox meanwhile was enjoying himself mightily as soon as he had loosened the sledge he had taken his favourite fish from among the piles neatly arranged for sale and had trotted off to the forest with it in his mouth byandby he met a bear who stopped and said where did you find that fish mr fox  oh not far off answered he i just stuck my tail in the stream close by the place where the elves dwell and the fish hung on to it of itself  dear me snarled the bear who was hungry and not in a good temper if the fish hung on to your tail i suppose he will hang on to mine  yes certainly grandfather replied the fox if you have patience to suffer what i suffered  of course i can replied the bear what nonsense you talk show me the way  so the fox led him to the bank of a stream which being in a warm place had only lightly frozen in places and was at this moment glittering in the spring sunshine  the elves bathe here he said and if you put in your tail the fish will catch hold of it but it is no use being in a hurry or you will spoil everything  then he trotted off but only went out of sight of the bear who stood still on the bank with his tail deep in the water soon the sun set and it grew very cold and the ice formed rapidly and the bears tail was fixed as tight as if a vice had held it and when the fox saw that everything had happened just as he had planned it he called out loudly  be quick good people and come with your bows and spears a bear has been fishing in your brook  and in a moment the whole place was full of little creatures each one with a tiny bow and a spear hardly big enough for a baby but both arrows and spears could sting as the bear knew very well and in his fright he gave such a tug to his tail that it broke short off and he rolled away into the forest as fast as his legs could carry him at this sight the fox held his sides for laughing and then scampered away in another direction byandby he came to a fir tree and crept into a hole under the root after that he did something very strange  taking one of his hind feet between his two front paws he said softly  what would you do my foot if someone was to betray me  i would run so quickly that he should not catch you  what would you do mine ear if someone was to betray me  i would listen so hard that i should hear all his plans  what would you do my nose if someone was to betray me  i would smell so sharply that i should know from afar that he was coming  what would you do my tail if someone was to betray me  i would steer you so straight a course that you would soon be beyond his reach let us be off i feel as if danger was near  but the fox was comfortable where he was and did not hurry himself to take his tails advice and before very long he found he was too late for the bear had come round by another path and guessing where his enemy was began to scratch at the roots of the tree the fox made himself as small as he could but a scrap of his tail peeped out and the bear seized it and held it tight then the fox dug his claws into the ground but he was not strong enough to pull against the bear and slowly he was dragged forth and his body flung over the bears neck in this manner they set out down the road the foxs tail being always in the bears mouth  after they had gone some way they passed a treestump on which a bright coloured woodpecker was tapping  ah those were better times when i used to paint all the birds such gay colours sighed the fox  what are you saying old fellow asked the bear  i oh i was saying nothing answered the fox drearily just carry me to your cave and eat me up as quick as you can  the bear was silent and thought of his supper and the two continued their journey till they reached another tree with a woodpecker tapping on it  ah those were better times when i used to paint all the birds such gay colours said the fox again to himself  couldnt you paint me too asked the bear suddenly  but the fox shook his head for he was always acting even if no one was there to see him do it  you bear pain so badly he replied in a thoughtful voice and you are impatient besides and could never put up with all that is necessary why you would first have to dig a pit and then twist ropes of willow and drive in posts and fill the hole with pitch and last of all set it on fire oh no you would never be able to do all that  it does not matter a straw how hard the work is answered the bear eagerly i will do it every bit and as he spoke he began tearing up the earth so fast that soon a deep pit was ready deep enough to hold him  that is all right said the fox at last i see i was mistaken in you now sit here and i will bind you so the bear sat down on the edge of the pit and the fox sprang on his back which he crossed with the willow ropes and then set fire to the pitch it burnt up in an instant and caught the bands of willow and the bears rough hair but he did not stir for he thought that the fox was rubbing the bright colours into his skin and that he would soon be as beautiful as a whole meadow of flowers but when the fire grew hotter still he moved uneasily from one foot to the other saying imploringly it is getting rather warm old man but all the answer he got was i thought you would never be able to suffer pain like those little birds  the bear did not like being told that he was not as brave as a bird so he set his teeth and resolved to endure anything sooner than speak again but by this time the last willow band had burned through and with a push the fox sent his victim tumbling into the grass and ran off to hide himself in the forest after a while he stole cautiously and found as he expected nothing left but a few charred bones these he picked up and put in a bag which he slung over his back  byandby he met a lapp driving his team of reindeer along the road and as he drew near the fox rattled the bones gaily  that sounds like silver or gold thought the man to himself and he said politely to the fox  goodday friend what have you got in your bag that makes such a strange sound  all the wealth my father left me answered the fox do you feel inclined to bargain  well i dont mind replied the lapp who was a prudent man and did not wish the fox to think him too eager but show me first what money you have got  ah but i cant do that answered the fox my bag is sealed up but if you will give me those three reindeer you shall take it as it is with all its contents  the lapp did not quite like it but the fox spoke with such an air that his doubts melted away he nodded and stretched out his hand the fox put the bag into it and unharnassed the reindeer he had chosen  oh i forgot he exclaimed turning round as he was about to drive them in the opposite direction you must be sure not to open the bag until you have gone at least five miles right on the other side of those hills out there if you do you will find that all the gold and silver has changed into a parcel of charred bones then he whipped up his reindeer and was soon out of sight  for some time the lapp was satisfied with hearing the bones rattle and thinking to himself what a good bargain he had made and of all the things he would buy with the money but after a bit this amusement ceased to content him and besides what was the use of planning when you did not know for certain how rich you were perhaps there might be a great deal of silver and only a little gold in the bag or a great deal of gold and only a little silver who could tell he would not of course take the money out to count it for that might bring him bad luck but there could be no harm in just one peep so he slowly broke the seal and untied the strings and behold a heap of burnt bones lay before him in a minute he knew he had been tricked and flinging the bag to the ground in a rage he ran after the fox as fast as his snowshoes would carry him  now the fox had guessed exactly what would happen and was on the look out directly he saw the little speck coming towards him he wished that the mans snowshoes might break and that very instant the lapps shoes snapped in two the lapp did now know that this was the foxs work but he had to stop and fetch one of his other reindeer which he mounted and set off again in pursuit of his enemy the fox soon heard him coming and this time he wished that the reindeer might fall and break its leg and so it did and the man felt it was a hopeless chase and that he was no match for the fox  so the fox drove on in peace till he reached the cave where all his stores were kept and then he began to wonder whom he could get to help him kill his reindeer for though he could steal reindeer he was too small to kill them after all it will be quite easy thought he and he bade a squirrel who was watching him on a tree close by take a message to all the robber beasts of the forest and in less than half an hour a great crashing of branches was heard and bears wolves snakes mice frogs and other creatures came pressing up to the cave  when they heard why they had been summoned they declared themselves ready each one to do his part the bear took his crossbow from his neck and shot the reindeer in the chin and from that day to this every reindeer has a mark in that same spot which is always known as the bears arrow the wolf shot him in the thigh and the sign of his arrow still remains and so with the mouse and the viper and all the rest even the frog and at the last the reindeer all died and the fox did nothing but looked on  i really must go down to the brook and wash myself said he though he was perfectly clean and he went under the bank and hid himself behind a stone from there he set up the most frightful shrieks so that the animals fled away in all directions only the mouse and the ermine remained where they were for they thought that they were much too small to be noticed  the fox continued his shrieks till he felt sure that the animals must have got to a safe distance then he crawled out of his hidingplace and went to the bodies of the reindeer which he now had all to himself he gathered a bundle of sticks for a fire and was just preparing to cook a steak when his enemy the lapp came up panting with haste and excitement  what are you doing there cried he why did you palm off those bones on me and why when you had got the reindeer did you kill them  dear brother answered the fox with a sob do not blame me for this misfortune it is my comrades who have slain them in spite of my prayers  the man made no reply for the white fur of the ermine who was crouching with the mouse behind some stones had just caught his eye he hastily seized the iron hook which hung over the fire and flung it at the little creature but the ermine was too quick for him and the hook only touched the top of its tail and that has remained black to this day as for the mouse the lapp threw a halfburnt stick after him and though it was not enough to hurt him his beautiful white skin was smeared all over with it and all the washing in the world would not make him clean again and the man would have been wiser if he had let the ermine and the mouse alone for when he turned round again he found he was alone  directly the fox noticed that his enemys attention had wandered from himself he watched his chance and stole softly away till he had reached a clump of thick bushes when he ran as fast as he could till he reached a river where a man was mending his boat  oh i wish i wish i had a boat to mend too he cried sitting up on his hindlegs and looking into the mans face  stop your silly chatter answered the man crossly or i will give you a bath in the river  oh i wish i do wish i had a boat to mend cried the fox again as if he had not heard and the man grew angry and seized him by the tail and threw him far out in the stream close to the edge of an island which was just what the fox wanted he easily scrambled up and sitting on the top he called hasten hasten o fishes and carry me to the other side and the fishes left the stones where they had been sleeping and the pools where they had been feeding and hurried to see who could get to the island first  i have won shouted the pike jump on my back dear fox and you will find yourself in a trice on the opposite shore  no thank you answered the fox your back is much too weak for me i should break it  try mine said the eel who had wriggled to the front  no thank you replied the fox again i should slip over your head and be drowned  you wont slip on my back said the perch coming forward  no but you are really too rough returned the fox  well you can have no fault to find with me put in the trout  good gracious are you here exclaimed the fox but im afraid to trust myself to you either  at this moment a fine salmon swam slowly up  ah yes you are the person i want said the fox but come near so that i may get on your back without wetting my feet  so the salmon swam close under the island and when he was touching it the fox seized him in his claws and drew him out of the water and put him on a spit while he kindled a fire to cook him by when everything was ready and the water in the pot was getting hot he popped him in and waited till he thought the salmon was nearly boiled but as he stooped down the water gave a sudden fizzle and splashed into the foxs eyes blinding him he started backwards with a cry of pain and sat still for some minutes rocking himself to and fro when he was a little better he rose and walked down a road till he met a grouse who stopped and asked what was the matter  have you a pair of eyes anywhere about you asked the fox politely  no i am afraid i havent answered the grouse and passed on  a little while after the fox heard the buzzing of an early bee whom a gleam of sun had tempted out  do you happen to have an extra pair of eyes anywhere asked the fox  i am sorry to say i have only those i am using replied the bee and the fox went on till he nearly fell over an asp who was gliding across the road  i should be so glad if you would tell me where i could get a pair of eyes said the fox i suppose you dont happen to have any you could lend me  well if you only want them for a short time perhaps i could manage answered the asp but i cant do without them for long  oh it is only for a very short time that i need them said the fox i have a pair of my own just behind that hill and when i find them i will bring yours back to you perhaps you will keep these till them so he took the eyes out of his own head and popped them into the head of the asp and put the asps eyes in their place as he was running off he cried over his shoulder as long as the world lasts the asps eyes will go down in the heads of foxes from generation to generation  and so it has been and if you look at the eyes of an asp you will see that they are all burnt and though thousands and thousands of years have gone by since the fox was going about playing tricks upon everybody he met the asp still bears the traces of the day when the sly creature cooked the salmon  lapplandische mahrchen     kisa the cat    once upon a time there lived a queen who had a beautiful cat the colour of smoke with chinablue eyes which she was very fond of the cat was constantly with her and ran after her wherever she went and even sat up proudly by her side when she drove out in her fine glass coach  oh pussy said the queen one day you are happier than i am for you have a dear kitten just like yourself and i have nobody to play with but you  dont cry answered the cat laying her paw on her mistresss arm crying never does any good i will see what can be done  the cat was as good as her word as soon as she returned from her drive she trotted off to the forest to consult a fairy who dwelt there and very soon after the queen had a little girl who seemed made out of snow and sunbeams the queen was delighted and soon the baby began to take notice of the kitten as she jumped about the room and would not go to sleep at all unless the kitten lay curled up beside her  two or three months went by and though the baby was still a baby the kitten was fast becoming a cat and one evening when as usual the nurse came to look for her to put her in the babys cot she was nowhere to be found what a hunt there was for that kitten to be sure the servants each anxious to find her as the queen was certain to reward the lucky man searched in the most impossible places boxes were opened that would hardly have held the kittens paw books were taken from bookshelves lest the kitten should have got behind them drawers were pulled out for perhaps the kitten might have got shut in but it was all no use the kitten had plainly run away and nobody could tell if it would ever choose to come back  years passed away and one day when the princess was playing ball in the garden she happened to throw her ball farther than usual and it fell into a clump of rosebushes the princess of course ran after it at once and she was stooping down to feel if it was hidden in the long grass when she heard a voice calling her ingibjorg ingibjorg it said have you forgotten me i am kisa your sister  but i never had a sister answered ingibjorg very much puzzled for she knew nothing of what had taken place so long ago  dont you remember how i always slept in your cot beside you and how you cried till i came but girls have no memories at all why i could find my way straight up to that cot this moment if i was once inside the palace  why did you go away then asked the princess but before kisa could answer ingibjorgs attendants arrived breathless on the scene and were so horrified at the sight of a strange cat that kisa plunged into the bushes and went back to the forest  the princess was very much vexed with her ladiesinwaiting for frightening away her old playfellow and told the queen who came to her room every evening to bid her goodnight  yes it is quite true what kisa said answered the queen i should have liked to see her again perhaps some day she will return and then you must bring her to me  next morning it was very hot and the princess declared that she must go and play in the forest where it was always cool under the big shady trees as usual her attendants let her do anything she pleased and sitting down on a mossy bank where a little stream tinkled by soon fell sound asleep the princess saw with delight that they would pay no heed to her and wandered on and on expecting every moment to see some fairies dancing round a ring or some little brown elves peeping at her from behind a tree but alas she met none of these instead a horrible giant came out of his cave and ordered her to follow him the princess felt much afraid as he was so big and ugly and began to be sorry that she had not stayed within reach of help but as there was no use in disobeying the giant she walked meekly behind  they went a long way and ingibjorg grew very tired and at length began to cry  i dont like girls who make horrid noises said the giant turning round but if you want to cry i will give you something to cry for and drawing an axe from his belt he cut off both her feet which he picked up and put in his pocket then he went away  poor ingibjorg lay on the grass in terrible pain and wondering if she should stay there till she died as no one would know where to look for her how long it was since she had set out in the morning she could not tellit seemed years to her of course but the sun was still high in the heavens when she heard the sound of wheels and then with a great effort for her throat was parched with fright and pain she gave a shout  i am coming was the answer and in another moment a cart made its way through the trees driven by kisa who used her tail as a whip to urge the horse to go faster directly kisa saw ingibjorg lying there she jumped quickly down and lifting the girl carefully in her two front paws laid her upon some soft hay and drove back to her own little hut  in the corner of the room was a pile of cushions and these kisa arranged as a bed ingibjorg who by this time was nearly fainting from all she had gone through drank greedily some milk and then sank back on the cushions while kisa fetched some dried herbs from a cupboard soaked them in warm water and tied them on the bleeding legs the pain vanished at once and ingibjorg looked up and smiled at kisa  you will go to sleep now said the cat and you will not mind if i leave you for a little while i will lock the door and no one can hurt you but before she had finished the princess was asleep then kisa got into the cart which was standing at the door and catching up the reins drove straight to the giants cave  leaving her cart behind some trees kisa crept gently up to the open door and crouching down listened to what the giant was telling his wife who was at supper with him  the first day that i can spare i shall just go back and kill her he said it would never do for people in the forest to know that a mere girl can defy me and he and his wife were so busy calling ingibjorg all sorts of names for her bad behaviour that they never noticed kisa stealing into a dark corner and upsetting a whole bag of salt into the great pot before the fire  dear me how thirsty i am cried the giant byandby  so am i answered the wife i do wish i had not taken that last spoonful of broth i am sure something was wrong with it  if i dont get some water i shall die went on the giant and rushing out of the cave followed by his wife he ran down the path which led to the river  then kisa entered the hut and lost no time in searching every hole till she came upon some grass under which ingibjorgs feet were hidden and putting them in her cart drove back again to her own hut  ingibjorg was thankful to see her for she had lain too frightened to sleep trembling at every noise  oh is it you she cried joyfully as kisa turned the key and the cat came in holding up the two neat little feet in their silver slippers  in two minutes they shall be as tight as they ever were said kisa and taking some strings of the magic grass which the giant had carelessly heaped on them she bound the feet on to the legs above  of course you wont be able to walk for some time you must not expect that she continued but if you are very good perhaps in about a week i may carry you home again  and so she did and when the cat drove the cart up to the palace gate lashing the horse furiously with her tail and the king and queen saw their lost daughter sitting beside her they declared that no reward could be too great for the person who had brought her out of the giants hands  we will talk about that byandby said the cat as she made her best bow and turned her horses head  the princess was very unhappy when kisa left her without even bidding her farewell she would neither eat nor drink nor take any notice of all the beautiful dresses her parents bought for her  she will die unless we can make her laugh one whispered to the other is there anything in the world that we have left untried  nothing except marriage answered the king and he invited all the handsomest young men he could think of to the palace and bade the princess choose a husband from among them  it took her some time to decide which she admired the most but at last she fixed upon a young prince whose eyes were like the pools in the forest and his hair of bright gold the king and the queen were greatly pleased as the young man was the son of a neighbouring king and they gave orders that a splendid feast should be got ready  when the marriage was over kisa suddenly stood before them and ingibjorg rushed forward and clasped her in her arms  i have come to claim my reward said the cat let me sleep for this night at the foot of your bed  is that all asked ingibjorg much disappointed  it is enough answered the cat and when the morning dawned it was no cat that lay upon the bed but a beautiful princess  my mother and i were both enchanted by a spiteful fairy said she we could not free ourselves till we had done some kindly deed that had never been wrought before my mother died without ever finding a chance of doing anything new but i took advantage of the evil act of the giant to make you as whole as ever  then they were all more delighted than before and the princess lived in the court until she too married and went away to govern one of her own  adapted from neuislandischen volksmarchen     the lion and the cat    far away on the other side of the world there lived long ago a lion and his younger brother the wild cat who were so fond of each other that they shared the same hut the lion was much the bigger and stronger of the twoindeed he was much bigger and stronger than any of the beasts that dwelt in the forest and besides he could jump father and run faster than all the rest if strength and swiftness could gain him a dinner he was sure never to be without one but when it came to cunning both the grizzly bear and the serpent could get the better of him and he was forced to call in the help of the wild cat  now the young wild cat had a lovely golden ball so beautiful that you could hardly look at it except through a piece of smoked glass and he kept it hidden in the thick fur muff that went round his neck a very large old animal since dead had given it to him when he was hardly more than a baby and had told him never to part with it for as long as he kept it no harm could ever come near him  in general the wild cat did not need to use his ball for the lion was fond of hunting and could kill all the food that they needed but now and then his life would have been in danger had it not been for the golden ball  one day the two brothers started to hunt at daybreak but as the cat could not run nearly as fast as the lion he had quite a long start at least he thought it was a long one but in a very few bounds and springs the lion reached his side  there is a bear sitting on that tree he whispered softly he is only waiting for us to pass to drop down on my back  ah you are so big that he does not see i am behind you answered the wild cat and touching the ball he just said bear die and the bear tumbled dead out of the tree and rolled over just in front of them  for some time they trotted on without any adventures till just as they were about to cross a strip of long grass on the edge of the forest the lions quick ears detected a faint rustling noise  that is a snake he cried stopping short for he was much more afraid of snakes than of bears  oh it is all right answered the cat snake die and the snake died and the two brothers skinned it they then folded the skin up into a very small parcel and the cat tucked it into his mane for snakes skins can do all sorts of wonderful things if you are lucky enough to have one of them  all this time they had had no dinner for the snakes flesh was not nice and the lion did not like eating bearperhaps because he never felt sure that the bear was really dead and would not jump up alive when his enemy went near him most people are afraid of some thing and bears and serpents were the only creatures that caused the lions heart to tremble so the two brothers set off again and soon reached the side of a hill where some fine deer were grazing  kill one of those deer for your own dinner said the boybrother but catch me another alive i want him  the lion at once sprang towards them with a loud roar but the deer bounded away and they were all three soon lost to sight the cat waited for a long while but finding that the lion did not return went back to the house where they lived  it was quite dark when the lion came home where his brother was sitting curled up in one corner  did you catch the deer for me asked the boybrother springing up  well no replied the manbrother the fact is that i did not get up to them till we had run half way across the world and left the wind far behind us think what a trouble it would have been to drag it here soi just ate them both  the cat said nothing but he did not feel that he loved his big brother he had thought a great deal about that deer and had meant to get on his back to ride him as a horse and go to see all the wonderful places the lion talked to him about when he was in a good temper the more he thought of it the more sulky he grew and in the morning when the lion said that it was time for them to start to hunt the cat told him that he might kill the bear and snake by himself as he had a headache and would rather stay at home the little fellow knew quite well that the lion would not dare to go out without him and his ball for fear of meeting a bear or a snake  the quarrel went on and for many days neither of the brothers spoke to each other and what made them still more cross was that they could get very little to eat and we know that people are often cross when they are hungry at last it occurred to the lion that if he could only steal the magic ball he could kill bears and snakes for himself and then the cat might be as sulky as he liked for anything that it would matter but how was the stealing to be done the cat had the ball hung round his neck day and night and he was such a light sleeper that it was useless to think of taking it while he slept no the only thing was to get him to lend it of his own accord and after some days the lion who was not at all clever hit upon a plan that he thought would do  dear me how dull it is here said the lion one afternoon when the rain was pouring down in such torrents that however sharp your eyes or your nose might be you could not spy a single bird or beast among the bushes dear me how dull how dreadfully dull i am couldnt we have a game of catch with that golden ball of yours  i dont care about playing catch it does not amuse me answered the cat who was as cross as ever for no cat even to this day ever forgets an injury done to him  well then lend me the ball for a little and i will play by myself replied the lion stretching out a paw as he spoke  you cant play in the rain and if you did you would only lose it in the bushes said the cat  oh no i wont i will play in here dont be so illnatured and with a very bad grace the cat untied the string and threw the golden ball into the lions lap and composed himself to sleep again  for a long while the lion tossed it up and down gaily feeling that however sound asleep the boybrother might look he was sure to have one eye open but gradually he began to edge closer to the opening and at last gave such a toss that the ball went up high into the air and he could not see what became of it  oh how stupid of me he cried as the cat sprang up angrily let us go at once and search for it it cant really have fallen very far but though they searched that day and the next and the next after that they never found it because it never came down  after the loss of his ball the cat refused to live with the lion any longer but wandered away to the north always hoping he might meet with his ball again but months passed and years passed and though he travelled over hundreds of miles he never saw any traces of it  at length when he was getting quite old he came to a place unlike any that he had ever seen before where a big river rolled right to the foot of some high mountains the ground all about the river bank was damp and marshy and as no cat likes to wet its feet this one climbed a tree that rose high above the water and thought sadly of his lost ball which would have helped him out of this horrible place suddenly he saw a beautiful ball for all the world like his own dangling from a branch of the tree he was on he longed to get at it but was the branch strong enough to bear his weight it was no use after all he had done getting drowned in the water however it could do no harm if he was to go a little way he could always manage to get back somehow  so he stretched himself at full length upon the branch and wriggled his body cautiously along to his delight it seemed thick and stout another movement and by stretching out his paw he would be able to draw the string towards him when the branch gave a loud crack and the cat made haste to wriggle himself back the way he had come  but when cats make up their minds to do anything they generally do it and this cat began to look about to see if there was really no way of getting at his ball yes there was and it was much surer than the other though rather more difficult above the bough where the ball was hung was another bough much thicker which he knew could not break with his weight and by holding on tight to this with all his four paws he could just manage to touch the ball with his tail he would thus be able to whisk the ball to and fro till byandby the string would become quite loose and it would fall to the ground it might take some time but the lions little brother was patient like most cats  well it all happened just as the cat intended it should and when the ball dropped on the ground the cat ran down the tree like lightning and picking it up tucked it away in the snakes skin round his neck then he began jumping along the shore of the big water from one place to another trying to find a boat or even a log of wood that would take him across but there was nothing only on the other side he saw two girls cooking and though he shouted to them at the top of his voice they were too far off to hear what he said and what was worse the ball suddenly fell out of its snakes skin bag right into the river  now it is not at all an uncommon thing for balls to tumble into rivers but in that case they generally either fall to the bottom and stay there or else bob about on the top of the water close to where they first touched it but this ball instead of doing either of these things went straight across to the other side and there one of the girls saw it when she stooped to dip some water into her pail  oh what a lovely ball cried she and tried to catch it in her pail but the ball always kept bobbing just out of her reach  come and help me she called to her sister and after a long while they had the ball safe inside the pail they were delighted with their new toy and one or the other held it in her hand till bedtime came and then it was a long time before they could make up their minds where it would be safest for the night at last they locked it in a cupboard in one corner of their room and as there was no hole anywhere the ball could not possibly get out after that they went to sleep  in the morning the first thing they both did was to run to the cupboard and unlock it but when the door opened they started back for instead of the ball there stood a handsome young man  ladies he said how can i thank you for what you have done for me long long ago i was enchanted by a wicked fairy and condemned to keep the shape of a ball till i should meet with two maidens who would take me to their own home but where was i to meet them for hundreds of years i have lived in the depths of the forest where nothing but wild beasts ever came and it was only when the lion threw me into the sky that i was able to fall to earth near this river where there is a river sooner or later people will come so hanging myself on a tree i watched and waited for a moment i lost heart when i fell once more into the hands of my old master the wild cat but my hopes rose again as i saw he was making for the river bank opposite where you were standing that was my chance and i took it and now ladies i have only to say that if ever i can do anything to help you go to the top of that high mountain and knock three times at the iron door at the north side and i will come to you  so with a low bow he vanished from before them leaving the maidens weeping at having lost in one moment both the ball and the prince  adapted from north american indian legends     which was the foolishest    in a little village that stood on a wide plain where you could see the sun from the moment he rose to the moment he set there lived two couples side by side the men who worked under the same master were quite good friends but the wives were always quarrelling and the subject they quarrelled most about waswhich of the two had the stupidest husband  unlike most womenwho think that anything that belongs to them must be better than what belongs to anyone elseeach thought her husband the more foolish of the two  you should just see what he does one said to her neighbour he puts on the babys frock upside down and one day i found him trying to feed her with boiling soup and her mouth was scalded for days after then he picks up stones in the road and sows them instead of potatoes and one day he wanted to go into the garden from the top window because he declared it was a shorter way than through the door  that is bad enough of course answered the other but it is really nothing to what i have to endure every day from my husband if when i am busy i ask him to go and feed the poultry he is certain to give them some poisonous stuff instead of their proper food and when i visit the yard next i find them all dead once he even took my best bonnet when i had gone away to my sick mother and when i came back i found he had given it to the hen to lay her eggs in and you know yourself that only last week when i sent him to buy a cask of butter he returned driving a hundred and fifty ducks which someone had induced him to take and not one of them would lay  yes i am afraid he is trying replied the first but let us put them to the proof and see which of them is the most foolish  so about the time that she expected her husband home from work she got out her spinningwheel and sat busily turning it taking care not even to look up from her work when the man came in for some minutes he stood with his mouth open watching her and as she still remained silent he said at last  have you gone mad wife that you sit spinning without anything on the wheel  you may think that there is nothing on it answered she but i can assure you that there is a large skein of wool so fine that nobody can see it which will be woven into a coat for you  dear me he replied what a clever wife i have got if you had not told me i should never have known that there was any wool on the wheel at all but now i really do seem to see something  the woman smiled and was silent and after spinning busily for an hour more she got up from her stoop and began to weave as fast as she could at last she got up and said to her husband i am too tired to finish it tonight so i shall go to bed and tomorrow i shall only have the cutting and stitching to do  so the next morning she got up early and after she had cleaned her house and fed her chickens and put everything in its place again she bent over the kitchen table and the sound of her big scissors might be heard snip snap as far as the garden her husband could not see anything to snip at but then he was so stupid that was not surprising  after the cutting came the sewing the woman patted and pinned and fixed and joined and then turning to the man she said  now it is ready for you to try on and she made him take off his coat and stand up in front of her and once more she patted an pinned and fixed and joined and was very careful in smoothing out every wrinkle  it does not feel very warm observed the man at last when he had borne all this patiently for a long time  that is because it is so fine answered she you do not want it to be as thick as the rough clothes you wear every day  he did but was ashamed to say so and only answered well i am sure it must be beautiful since you say so and i shall be smarter than anyone in the whole village what a splendid coat they will exclaim when they see me but it is not everybody who has a wife as clever as mine  meanwhile the other wife was not idle as soon as her husband entered she looked at him with such a look of terror that the poor man was quite frightened  why do you stare at me so is there anything the matter asked he  oh go to bed at once she cried you must be very ill indeed to look like that  the man was rather surprised at first as he felt particularly well that evening but the moment his wife spoke he became quite certain that he had something dreadful the matter with him and grew quite pale  i dare say it would be the best place for me he answered trembling and he suffered his wife to take him upstairs and to help him off with his clothes  if you sleep well during the might there may be a chance for you said she shaking her head as she tucked him up warmly but if not and of course the poor man never closed an eye till the sun rose  how do you feel this morning asked the woman coming in on tiptoe when her housework was finished  oh bad very bad indeed answered he i have not slept for a moment can you think of nothing to make me better  i will try everything that is possible said the wife who did not in the least wish her husband to die but was determined to show that he was more foolish that the other man i will get some dried herbs and make you a drink but i am very much afraid that it is too late why did you not tell me before  i thought perhaps the pain would go off in a day or two and besides i did not want to make you unhappy answered the man who was by this time quite sure he had been suffering tortures and had borne them like a hero of course if i had had any idea how ill i really was i should have spoken at once  well well i will see what can be done said the wife but talking is not good for you lie still and keep yourself warm  all that day the man lay in bed and whenever his wife entered the room and asked him with a shake of the head how he felt he always replied that he was getting worse at last in the evening she burst into tears and when he inquired what was the matter she sobbed out  oh my poor poor husband are you really dead i must go tomorrow and order your coffin  now when the man heard this a cold shiver ran through his body and all at once he knew that he was as well as he had ever been in his life  oh no no he cried i feel quite recovered indeed i think i shall go out to work  you will do no such thing replied his wife just keep quite quiet for before the sun rises you will be a dead man  the man was very frightened at her words and lay absolutely still while the undertaker came and measured him for his coffin and his wife gave orders to the gravedigger about his grave that evening the coffin was sent home and in the morning at nine oclock the woman put him on a long flannel garment and called to the undertakers men to fasten down the lid and carry him to the grave where all their friends were waiting them just as the body was being placed in the ground the other womans husband came running up dressed as far as anyone could see in no clothes at all everybody burst into shouts of laughter at the sight of him and the men laid down the coffin and laughed too till their sides nearly split the dead man was so astonished at this behaviour that he peeped out of a little window in the side of the coffin and cried out  i should laugh as loudly as any of you if i were not a dead man  when they heard the voice coming from the coffin the other people suddenly stopped laughing and stood as if they had been turned into stone then they rushed with one accord to the coffin and lifted the lid so that the man could step out amongst them  were you really not dead after all asked they and if not why did you let yourself be buried  at this the wives both confessed that they had each wished to prove that her husband was stupider than the other but the villagers declared that they could not decide which was the most foolishthe man who allowed himself to be persuaded that he was wearing fine clothes when he was dressed in nothing or the man who let himself be buried when he was alive and well  so the women quarrelled just as much as they did before and no one ever knew whose husband was the most foolish  adapted from the neuislandische volksmarchen    asmund and signy    long long ago in the days when fairies witches giants and ogres still visited the earth there lived a king who reigned over a great and beautiful country he was married to a wife whom he dearly loved and had two most promising childrena son called asmund and a daughter who was named signy  the king and queen were very anxious to bring their children up well and the young prince and princess were taught everything likely to make them clever and accomplished they lived at home in their fathers palace and he spared no pains to make their lives happy  prince asmund dearly loved all outdoor sports and an openair life and from his earliest childhood he had longed to live entirely in the forest close by after many arguments and entreaties he succeeded in persuading the king to give him two great oak trees for his very own  now said he to his sister i will have the trees hollowed out and then i will make rooms in them and furnish them so that i shall be able to live out in the forest  oh asmund exclaimed signy what a delightful idea do let me come too and live in one of your trees i will bring all my pretty things and ornaments and the trees are so near home we shall be quite safe in them  asmund who was extremely fond of his sister readily consented and they had a very happy time together carrying over all their pet treasures and signys jewels and other ornaments and arranging them in the pretty little rooms inside the trees  unfortunately sadder days were to come a war with another country broke out and the king had to lead his army against their enemy during his absence the queen fell ill and after lingering for some time she died to the great grief of her children they made up their minds to live altogether for a time in their trees and for this purpose they had provisions enough stored up inside to last them a year  now i must tell you in another country a long way off there reigned a king who had an only son named ring prince ring had heard so much about the beauty and goodness of princess signy that he determined to marry her if possible so he begged his father to let him have a ship for the voyage set sail with a favourable wind and after a time landed in the country where signy lived  the prince lost no time in setting out for the royal palace and on his way there he met such a wonderfully lovely woman that he felt he had never seen such beauty in all his life he stopped her and at once asked who she was  i am signy the kings daughter was the reply  then the prince inquired why she was wandering about all by herself and she told him that since her mothers death she was so sad that whilst her father was away she preferred being alone  ring was quite deceived by her and never guessed that she was not princess signy at all but a strong gigantic wicked witch bent on deceiving him under a beautiful shape he confided to her that he had travelled all the way from his own country for her sake having fallen in love with the accounts he had heard of her beauty and he then and there asked her to be his wife  the witch listened to all he said and much pleased ended by accepting his offer but she begged him to return to his ship for a little while as she wished to go some way further into the forest promising to join him later on  prince ring did as she wished and went back to his ship to wait whilst she walked on into the forest till she reached the two oak trees  here she resumed her own gigantic shape tore up the trees by their roots threw one of them over her back and clasped the other to her breast carried them down to the shore and waded out with them to the ship  she took care not to be noticed as she reached the ship and directly she got on board she once more changed to her former lovely appearance and told the prince that her luggage was now all on board and that they need wait for nothing more  the prince gave orders to set sail at once and after a fine voyage landed in his own country where his parents and his only sister received him with the greatest joy and affection  the false signy was also very kindly welcomed a beautiful house was got ready for her and prince ring had the two oaks planted in the garden just in front of her windows so that she might have the pleasure of seeing them constantly he often went to visit the witch whom he believed to be princess signy and one day he asked dont you think we might be married before long  yes said she quite pleased i am quite ready to marry you whenever you like  then replied ring let us decide on this day fortnight and see i have brought you some stuff to make your weddingdress of so saying he gave her a large piece of the most beautiful brocade all woven over with gold threads and embroidered with pearls and other jewels  the prince had hardly left her before the witch resumed her proper shape and tore about the room raging and storming and flinging the beautiful silk on the floor  what was she to do with such things she roared she did not know how to sew or make clothes and she was sure to die of starvation into the bargain if her brother ironhead did not come soon and bring her some raw meat and bones for she really could eat nothing else  as she was raving and roaring in this frantic manner part of the floor suddenly opened and a huge giant rose up carrying a great chest in his arms the witch was enchanted at this sight and eagerly helped her brother to set down and open the chest which was full of the ghastly food she had been longing for the horrid pair set to and greedily devoured it all and when the chest was quite empty the giant put it on his shoulder and disappeared as he had come without leaving any trace of his visit  but his sister did not keep quiet for long and tore and pulled at the rich brocade as if she wanted to destroy it stamping about and shouting angrily  now all this time prince asmund and his sister sat in their trees just outside the window and saw all that was going on  dear signy said asmund do try to get hold of that piece of brocade and make the clothes yourself for really we shall have no rest day or night with such a noise  i will try said signy it wont be an easy matter but its worth while taking some trouble to have a little peace  so she watched for an opportunity and managed to carry off the brocade the first time the witch left her room then she set to work cutting out and sewing as best she could and by the end of six days she had turned it into an elegant robe with a long train and a mantle when it was finished she climbed to the top of her tree and contrived to throw the clothes on to a table through the open window  how delighted the witch was when she found the clothes all finished the next time prince ring came to see her she gave them to him and he paid her many compliments on her skilful work after which he took leave of her in the most friendly manner but he had scarcely left the house when the witch began to rage as furiously as ever and never stopped till her brother ironhead appeared  when asmund saw all these wild doings from his tree he felt he could no longer keep silence he went to prince ring and said do come with me and see the strange things that are happening in the new princesss room  the prince was not a little surprised but he consented to hide himself with asmund behind the panelling of the room from where they could see all that went on through a little slit the witch was raving and roaring as usual and said to her brother  once i am married to the kings son i shall be better off than now i shall take care to have all that pack of courtiers put to death and then i shall send for all my relations to come and live here instead i fancy the giants will enjoy themselves very much with me and my husband  when prince ring heard this he fell into such a rage that he ordered the house to be set on fire and it was burnt to the ground with the witch and her brother in it  asmund then told the prince about the two oak trees and took him to see them the prince was quite astonished at them and at all their contents but still more so at the extreme beauty of signy he fell in love with her at once and entreated her to marry him which after a time she consented to do asmund on his side asked for the hand of prince rings sister which was gladly granted him and the double wedding was celebrated with great rejoicings  after this prince asmund and his bride returned to his country to live with the king his father the two couples often met and lived happily for many many years and that is the end of the story  from islandische mahrchen     rubezahl    over all the vast underworld the mountain gnome rubezahl was lord and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him there were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapours to change dull stones to precious metal or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies for rubezahl loved all pretty things sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions and come out upon the green earth for a while and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing and as gnomes live many hundreds of years he saw strange things for the first time he came up the great hills were covered with thick forests in which wild animals roamed and rubezahl watched the fierce fights between bear and bison or chased the grey wolves or amused himself by rolling great rocks down into the desolate valleys to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills but the next time he ventured above ground what was his surprise to find everything changed the dark woods were hewn down and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounding cosylooking thatched cottages for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows while from the shade of the hedges came the music of the shepherds pipe the strangeness and pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests who without saying by your leave or with your leave had made themselves so very much at home upon is hills nor did he wish to interfere with their doings but left them in quiet possession of their homes as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves he was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called man so taking the form of an old field labourer he entered the service of a farmer under his care all the crops flourished exceedingly but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful and rubezahl soon left him and went to be shepherd to his next neighbour he tended the flock so diligently and knew so well where to lead the sheep to the sweetest pastures and where among the hills to look for any who strayed away that they too prospered under his care and not one was lost or torn by wolves but this new master was a hard man and begrudged him his wellearned wages so he ran away and went to serve the judge here he upheld the law with might and main and was a terror to thieves and evildoers but the judge was a bad man who took bribes and despised the law rubezahl would not be the tool of an unjust man and so he told his master who thereupon ordered him to be thrown in prison of course that did not trouble the gnome at all he simply got out through the keyhole and went away down to his underground palace very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind but as time went on he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him and thought he would take another look at the upper world  so he stole into the valley keeping himself carefully hidden in copse or hedgerow and very soon met with an adventure for peeping through a screen of leaves he saw before him a green lawn where stood a charming maiden fresh as the spring and beautiful to look upon around her upon the grass lay her young companions as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game beyond them flowed a little brook into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock filling the air with its pleasant sound and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide the sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that for the first time he wished himself a mortal and longing for a better view of the gay company he changed himself into a raven and perched upon an oaktree which overhung the brook but he soon found that this was not at all a good plan he could only see with a ravens eyes and feel as a raven feels and a nest of fieldmice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens when he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket and took the form of a handsome young manthat was the best wayand he fell in love with the girl then and there the fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country and she often wandered in the forest with her play fellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits till the midday heat drove the merry band to the shady lawn by the brook to rest or to bathe in the cool waters on this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood this was master rubezahls opportunity stepping out of his hidingplace he stood in the midst of the little lawn weaving his magic spells till slowly all about him changed and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite restingplace they stood lost in amazement and almost fancied that they must be dreaming the red rocks had become white marble and alabaster the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed flowed in silence now in its smooth channel from which a clear fountain leapt to fall again in showers of diamond drops now on this side now on that as the wandering breeze scattered it  daisies and forgetmenots fringed its brink while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable to the right and left of the waterfall opened out a wonderful grotto its walls and arches glittering with manycoloured rockcrystals while in every niche were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them she hesitated a while however scarcely able to believe her eyes and not knowing if she should enter the enchanted spot or fly from it but at length curiosity prevailed and she and her companions explored to their hearts content and tasted and examined everything running hither and thither in high glee and calling merrily to each other  at last when they were quite weary the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would content her but to bathe in the marble pool which certainly did look very inviting and they all went gaily to this new amusement the princess was ready first but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when downdowndown she sank and vanished in its depths before her frightened playmates could seize her by so much as a lock of her floating golden hair  loudly did they weep and wail running about the brink of the pool which looked so shallow and so clear but which had swallowed up their princess before their eyes they even sprang into the water and tried to dive after her but in vain they only floated like corks in the enchanted pool and could not keep under water for a second  they saw at last that there was nothing for it but to carry to the king the sad tidings of his beloved daughters disappearance and what great weeping and lamentation there was in the palace when the dreadful news was told the king tore his robes dashed his golden crown from his head and hid his face in his purple mantle for grief and anguish at the loss of the princess after the first outburst of wailing however he took heart and hurried off to see for himself the scene of this strange adventure thinking as people will in sorrow that there might be some mistake after all but when he reached the spot behold all was changed again the glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished and so had the marble bath the bower of jasmine instead all was a tangle of flowers as it had been of old the king was so much perplexed that he threatened the princesss playfellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not confess something about her disappearance but as they only repeated the same story he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some sprite or goblin and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long  meanwhile the princess was not at all unhappy in the palace of her elfish lover  when the waternymphs who were hiding in readiness had caught her and dragged her out of the sight of her terrified maidens she herself had not had time to be frightened they swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her fathers seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch wrapped in a wonderful robe of satin fastened with a silken girdle while beside her knelt a young man who whispered the sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear the gnome for he it was told her all about himself and his great underground kingdom and presently led her through the many rooms and halls of the palace and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them till she was fairly dazzled at the sight of so much splendour on three sides of the castle lay a lovely garden with masses of gay sweet flowers and velvet lawns all cool and shady which pleased the eye of the princess the fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples and nightingales sang in every bush as the gnome and the princess wandered in the leafy alleys sometimes gazing at the moon sometimes pausing to gather the rarest flowers for her adornment and all the time he was thinking to himself that never during the hundreds of years he had lived had he seen so charming a maiden but the princess felt no such happiness in spite of all the magic delights around her she was sad though she tried to seem content for fear of displeasing the gnome however he soon perceived her melancholy and in a thousand ways strove to dispel the cloud but in vain at last he said to himself men are sociable creatures like bees or ants doubtless this lovely mortal is pining for company who is there i can find for her to talk to  thereupon he hastened into the nearest filed and dug up a dozen or so of different rootscarrots turnips and radishesand laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess who sat pensive in the shade of the rosebower  loveliest daughter of earth said the gnome banish all sorrow no more shall you be lonely in my dwelling in this basket is all you need to make this spot delightful to you take this little manycoloured wand and with a touch give to each root the form you desire to see  with this he left her and the princess without an instants delay opened the basket and touching a turnip cried eagerly brunhilda my dear brunhilda come to me quickly and sure enough there was brunhilda joyfully hugging and kissing her beloved princess and chattering as gaily as in the old days  this sudden appearance was so delightful that the princess could hardly believe her own eyes and was quite beside herself with the joy of having her dear playfellow with her once more hand in hand they wandered about the enchanted garden and gathered the golden apples from the trees and when they were tired of this amusement the princess led her friend through all the wonderful rooms of the palace until at last they came to the one in which were kept all the marvellous dresses and ornaments the gnome had given to his hopedfor bride there they found so much to amuse them that the hours passed like minutes veils girdles and necklaces were tried on and admired the imitation brunhilda knew so well how to behave herself and showed so much taste that nobody would ever have suspected that she was nothing but a turnip after all the gnome who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before she did not forget to touch the rest of the roots with her magic wand and soon had all her maidens about her and even as she had two tiny radishes to spare her favourite cat and her little dog whose name was beni  and now all went cheerfully in the castle the princess gave to each of the maidens her task and never was mistress better served for a whole week she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed they all sang they danced they played from morning to night only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and wan and the mirror in the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom while brunhilda and the rest faded visibly they assured her that all was well with them but nevertheless they continued to waste away and day by day it became harder to them to take part in the games of the princess till at last one fine morning when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows she shuddered and started back at the sight of a group of shrivelled crones with bent backs and trembling limbs who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches and coughed dismally a little nearer to the hearth lay the once frolicsome beni with all four feet stretched stiffly out while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion  the horrified princess fled to the door to escape from the sight of this mournful company and called loudly for the gnome who appeared at once humbly anxious to do her bidding  malicious sprite she cried why do you begrudge me my playmates the greatest delight of my lonely hours isnt this solitary life in such a desert bad enough without your turning the castle into a hospital for the aged give my maidens back their youth and health this very minute or i will never love you  sweetest and fairest of damsels cried the gnome do not be angry everything that is in my power i will dobut do not ask the impossible so long as the sap was fresh in the roots the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired but as the sap dried up they withered away but never trouble yourself about that dearest one a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right and you can speedily call up again every form you wish to see the great green patch in the garden will prove you with a more lively company  so saying the gnome took himself off and the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women and left them the withered roots they really were to be thrown upon the rubbish heap and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow to take possession of the freshly filled basket but to her surprise she could not find it anywhere up and down the garden she searched spying into every corner but not a sign of it was to be found by the trellis of grape vines she met the gnome who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off  you are trying to tease me she cried as soon as she saw him where have you hidden the basket i have been looking for it at least an hour  dear queen of my heart answered he i pray you to forgive my carelessness i promised more than i could perform i have sought all over the land for the roots you desire but they are gathered in and lie drying in musty cellars and the fields are bare and desolate for below in the valley winter reigns only here in your presence spring is held fast and wherever your foot is set the gay flowers bloom have patience for a little and then without fail you shall have your puppets to play with  almost before the gnome had finished the disappointed princess turned away and marched off to her own apartments without deigning to answer him  the gnome however set off above ground as speedily as possible and disguising himself as a farmer bought an ass in the nearest markettown and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip carrot and radish seed with this he sowed a great field and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch and tend it and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seeds thus fostered they grew and flourished marvellously and promised a goodly crop  the princess wandered about the field day by day no other plants or fruits in all her wonderful garden pleased her as much as these roots but still her eyes were full of discontent and best of all she loved to while away the hours in a shady firwood seated upon the bank of a little stream into which she would cast the flowers she had gathered and watch them float away  the gnome tried hard by every means in his power to please the princess and win her love but little did he guess the real reason of his lack of success he imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him but that was a mistake for the truth was that another image already filled her heart the young prince ratibor whose lands joined her fathers had won the heart of the princess and the lovers had been looking forward to the coming of their weddingday when the brides mysterious disappearance took place the sad news drove ratibor distracted and as the days went on and nothing could be heard of the princess he forsook his castle and the society of men and spent his days in the wild forests roaming about and crying her name aloud to the trees and rocks meanwhile the maiden in her gorgeous prison sighed in secret over her grief not wishing to arouse the gnomes suspicions in her own mind she was wondering if by any means she might escape from her captivity and at last she hit upon a plan  by this time spring once more reigned in the valley and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter hand now come to their full size day by day the princess pulled up some of them and made experiments with them conjuring up now this longedfor person and now that just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared but she really had another purpose in view  one day she changed a tiny turnip into a bee and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover  fly dear little bee towards the east said she to my beloved ratibor and softly hum into his ear that i love him only but that i am a captive in the gnomes palace under the mountains do not forget a single word of my greeting and bring me back a message from my beloved  so the bee spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bidden but before he was out of sight a greedy swallow made a snatch at him and to the great grief of the princess her messenger was eaten up then and there  after that by the power of the wonderful wand she summoned a cricket and taught him this greeting  hop little cricket to ratibor and chirp in his ear that i love him only but that i am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains  so the cricket hopped off gaily determined to do his best to deliver his message but alas a longlegged stork who was prancing along the same road caught him in her cruel beak and before he could say a word he had disappeared down her throat  these two unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more  this time she changed the turnip into a magpie  flutter from tree to tree chattering bird said she till you come to ratibor my love tell him that i am a captive and bid him come with horses and men the third day from this to the hill that rises from the thorny valley  the magpie listened hopped awhile from branch to branch and then darted away the princess watching him anxiously as far as she could see  now prince ratibor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief  one day as he sat in the shade of an oak tree dreaming of his lost princess and sometimes crying her name aloud he seemed to hear another voice reply to his and starting up he gazed around him but he could see no one and he had just made up his mind that he must be mistaken when the same voice called again and looking up sharply he saw a magpie which hopped to and fro among the twigs then ratibor heard with surprise that the bird was indeed calling him by name  poor chatterpie said he who taught you to say that name which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory for ever  thereupon he caught up a great stone and would have hurled it at the magpie if it had not at that moment uttered the name of the princess  this was so unexpected that the princes arm fell helplessly to his side at the sound and he stood motionless  but the magpie in the tree who like all the rest of his family was not happy unless he could be for ever chattering began to repeat the message the princess had taught him and as soon as he understood it prince ratibors heart was filed with joy all his gloom and misery vanished in a moment and he anxiously questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess  but the magpie knew no more than the lesson he had learnt so he soon fluttered away while the prince hurried back to his castle to gather together a troop of horsemen full of courage for whatever might befall  the princess meanwhile was craftily pursuing her plan of escape she left off treating the gnome with coldness and indifference indeed there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might some day return his love and the idea pleased him mightily the next day as soon as the sun rose she made her appearance decked as a bride in the wonderful robes and jewels which the fond gnome had prepared for her her golden hair was braided and crowned with myrtle blossoms and her flowing veil sparkled with gems in these magnificent garments she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace  loveliest of maidens he stammered bowing low before her let me gaze into your dear eyes and read in them that you will no longer refuse my love but will make me the happiest being the sun shines upon  so saying he would have drawn aside her veil but the princess only held it more closely about her  your constancy has overcome me she said i can no longer oppose your wishes but believe my words and suffer this veil still to hide my blushes and tears  why tears beloved one cried the gnome anxiously every tear of yours falls upon my heart like a drop of molten gold greatly as i desire your love i do not ask a sacrifice  ah cried the false princess why do you misunderstand my tears my heart answers to your tenderness and yet i am fearful a wife cannot always charm and though you will never alter the beauty of mortals is as a flower that fades how can i be sure that you will always be as loving and charming as you are now  ask some proof sweetheart said he put my obedience and my patience to some test by which you can judge of my unalterable love  be it so answered the crafty maiden then give me just one proof of your goodness go count the turnips in yonder meadow my wedding feast must not lack guests they shall provide me with bridemaidens too but beware lest you deceive me and do not miss a single one that shall be the test of your truth towards me  unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment he obeyed her commands without delay and hurried off to begin his task he skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper and had soon counted them all but to be quite certain that he had made no mistake he thought he would just run over them again this time to his great annoyance the number was different so he reckoned them for the third time but now the number was not the same as either of the previous ones and this was hardly to be wondered at as his mind was full of the princesss pretty looks and words  as for the maiden no sooner was her deluded lover fairly out of sight than she began to prepare for flight she had a fine fresh turnip hidden close at hand which she changed into a spirited horse all saddled and bridled and springing upon its back she galloped away over hill and dale till she reached the thorny valley and flung herself into the arms of her beloved prince ratibor  meanwhile the toiling gnome went through his task over and over again till his back ached and his head swam and he could no longer put two and two together but as he felt tolerably certain of the exact number of turnips in the field big and little together he hurried back eager to prove to his beloved one what a delightful and submissive husband he would be he felt very well satisfied with himself as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had left her but alas she was no longer there  he searched every thicket and path he looked behind every tree and gazed into every pond but without success then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room peering into every hole and corner and calling her by name but only echo answered in the marble hallsthere was neither voice nor footstep  then he began to perceive that something was amiss and throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him he flew out of the palace and soared high into the air and saw the fugitive princess in the far distance just as the swift horse carried her across the boundary of his dominions  furiously did the enraged gnome fling two great clouds together and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years but his fury was vain the thunderclouds melted away into a soft mist and the gnome after flying about for a while in despair bewailing to the four winds his unhappy fate went sorrowfully back to the palace and stole once more through every room with many sighs and lamentations he passed through the gardens which for him had lost their charm and the sight of the princesss footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief all was lonely empty sorrowful and the forsaken gnome resolved that he would have no more dealings with such false creatures as he had found men to be  thereupon he stamped three times upon the earth and the magic palace with all its treasures vanished away into the nothingness out of which he had called it and the gnome fled once more to the depths of his underground kingdom  while all this was happening prince ratibor was hurrying away with his prize to a place of safety with great pomp and triumph he restored the lovely princess to her father and was then and there married to her and took her back with him to his own castle  but long after she was dead and her children too the villagers would tell the tale of her imprisonment underground as they sat carving wood in the winter nights  volksmahrchen der deutschen    story of the king who would be stronger than fate    once upon a time far away in the east country there lived a king who loved hunting so much that when once there was a deer in sight he was careless of his own safety indeed he often became quite separated from his nobles and attendants and in fact was particularly fond of lonely adventures another of his favourite amusements was to give out that he was not well and could not be seen and then with the knowledge only of his faithful grand wazeer to disguise himself as a pedlar load a donkey with cheap wares and travel about in this way he found out what the common people said about him and how his judges and governors fulfilled their duties  one day his queen presented him with a baby daughter as beautiful as the dawn and the king himself was so happy and delighted that for a whole week he forgot to hunt and spent the time in public and private rejoicing  not long afterwards however he went out after some deer which were to be found in a far corner of his forests in the course of the beat his dogs disturbed a beautiful snowwhite stag and directly he saw it the king determined that he would have it at any cost so he put the spurs to his horse and followed it as hard as he could gallop of course all his attendants followed at the best speed that they could manage but the king was so splendidly mounted and the stag was so swift that at the end of an hour the king found that only his favourite hound and himself were in the chase all the rest were far far behind and out of sight  nothing daunted however he went on and on till he perceived that he was entering a valley with great rocky mountains on all sides and that his horse was getting very tired and trembled at every stride worse than all evening was already drawing on and the sun would soon set in vain had he sent arrow after arrow at the beautiful stag every shot fell short or went wide of the mark and at last just as darkness was setting in he lost sight altogether of the beast by this time his horse could hardly move from fatigue his hound staggered panting along beside him he was far away amongst mountains where he had never been before and had quite missed his way and not a human creature or dwelling was in sight  all this was very discouraging but the king would not have minded if he had not lost that beautiful stag that troubled him a good deal but he never worried over what he could not help so he got down from his horse slipped his arm through the bridle and led the animal along the rough path in hopes of discovering some shepherds hut or at least a cave or shelter under some rock where he might pass the night  presently he heard the sound of rushing water and made towards it he toiled over a steep rocky shoulder of a hill and there just below him was a stream dashing down a precipitous glen and almost beneath his feet twinkling and flickering from the level of the torrent was a dim light as of a lamp towards this light the king with his horse and hound made his way sliding and stumbling down a steep stony path at the bottom the king found a narrow grassy ledge by the brink of the stream across which the light from a rude lantern in the mount of a cave shed a broad beam of uncertain light at the edge of the stream sat an old hermit with a long white beard who neither spoke nor moved as the king approached but sat throwing into the stream dry leaves which lay scattered about the ground near him  peace be upon you said the king giving the usual country salutation  and upon you peace answered the hermit but still he never looked up nor stopped what he was doing  for a minute or two the king stood watching him he noticed that the hermit threw two leaves in at a time and watched them attentively sometimes both were carried rapidly down by the stream sometimes only one leaf was carried off and the other after whirling slowly round and round on the edge of the current would come circling back on an eddy to the hermits feet at other times both leaves were held in the backward eddy and failed to reach the main current of the noisy stream  what are you doing asked the king at last and the hermit replied that he was reading the fates of men every ones fate he said was settled from the beginning and whatever it were there was no escape from it the king laughed  i care little he said what my fate may be but i should be curious to know the fate of my little daughter  i cannot say answered the hermit  do you not know then demanded the king  i might know returned the hermit but it is not always wisdom to know much  but the king was not content with this reply and began to press the old man to say what he knew which for a long time he would not do at last however the king urged him so greatly that he said  the kings daughter will marry the son of a poor slavegirl called puruna who belongs to the king of the land of the north there is no escaping from fate  the king was wild with anger at hearing these words but he was also very tired so he only laughed and answered that he hoped there would be a way out of that fate anyhow then he asked if the hermit could shelter him and his beasts for the night and the hermit said yes so very soon the king had watered and tethered his horse and after a supper of bread and parched peas lay down in the cave with the hound at his feet and tried to go to sleep but instead of sleeping he only lay awake and thought of the hermits prophecy and the more he thought of it the angrier he felt until he gnashed his teeth and declared that it should never never come true  morning came and the king got up pale and sulky and after learning from the hermit which path to take was soon mounted and found his way home without much difficulty directly he reached his palace he wrote a letter to the king of the land of the north begging him as a favour to sell him his slave girl puruna and her son and saying that if he consented he would send a messenger to receive them at the river which divided the kingdoms  for five days he awaited the reply and hardly slept or ate but was as cross as could be all the time on the fifth day his messenger returned with a letter to say that the king of the land of the north would not sell but he would give the king the slave girl and her son the king was overjoyed he sent for his grand wazeer and told him that he was going on one of his lonely expeditions and that the wazeer must invent some excuse to account for his absence next he disguised himself as an ordinary messenger mounted a swift camel and sped away to the place where the slave girl was to be handed over to him when he got there he gave the messengers who brought her a letter of thanks and a handsome present for their master and rewards for themselves and then without delay he took the poor woman and her tiny babyboy up on to his camel and rode off to a wild desert  after riding for a day and a night almost without stopping he came to a great cave where he made the woman dismount and taking her and the baby into the cave he drew his sword and with one blow chopped her head off but although his anger made him cruel enough for anything so dreadful the king felt that he could not turn his great sword on the helpless baby who he was sure must soon die in this solitary place without its mother so he left it in the cave where it was and mounting his camel rode home as fast as he could  now in a small village in his kingdom there lived an old widow who had no children or relations of any kind she made her living mostly by selling the milk of a flock of goats but she was very very poor and not very strong and often used to wonder how she would live if she got too weak or ill to attend to her goats every morning she drove the goats out into the desert to graze on the shrubs and bushes which grew there and every evening they came home of themselves to be milked and to be shut up safely for the night  one evening the old woman was astonished to find that her very best nannygoat returned without a drop of milk she thought that some naughty boy or girl was playing a trick upon her and had caught the goat on its way home and stolen all the milk but when evening after evening the goat remained almost dry she determined to find out who the thief was so the next day she followed the goats at a distance and watched them while they grazed at length in the afternoon the old woman noticed this particular nannygoat stealing off by herself away from the herd and she at once went after her on and on the goat walked for some way and then disappeared into a cave in the rocks the old woman followed the goat into the cave and then what should she see but the animal giving her milk to a little boybaby whilst on the ground near by lay the sad remains of the babys dead mother wondering and frightened the old woman thought at last that this little baby might be a son to her in her old age and that he would grow up and in time to come be her comfort and support so she carried home the baby to her hut and next day she took a spade to the cave and dug a grave where she buried the poor mother  years passed by and the baby grew up into a find handsome lad as daring as he was beautiful and as industrious as he was brave one day when the boy whom the old woman had named nur mahomed was about seventeen years old he was coming from his days work in the fields when he saw a strange donkey eating the cabbages in the garden which surround their little cottage seizing a big stick he began to beat the intruder and to drive him out of his garden a neighbour passing by called out to himhi i say why are you beating the pedlars donkey like that  the pedlar should keep him from eating my cabbages said nur mahomed if he comes this evening here again ill cut off his tail for him  whereupon he went off indoors whistling cheerfully it happened that this neighbour was one of those people who make mischief by talking too much so meeting the pedlar in the serai or inn that evening he told him what had occurred and added yes and the young spitfire said that if beating the donkey would not do he would beat you also and cut your nose off for a thief  a few days later the pedlar having moved on two men appeared in the village inquiring who it was who had threatened to illtreat and to murder an innocent pedlar they declared that the pedlar in fear of his life had complained to the king and that they had been sent to bring the lawless person who had said these things before the king himself of course they soon found out about the donkey eating nur mahomeds cabbages and about the young mans hot words but although the lad assured them that he had never said anything about murdering anyone they replied they were ordered to arrest him and bring him to take his trial before the king so in spite of his protests and the wails of his mother he was carried off and in due time brought before the king of course nur mahomed never guessed that the supposed pedlar happened to have been the king himself although nobody knew it  but as he was very angry at what he had been told he declared that he was going to make an example of this young man and intended to teach him that even poor travelling pedlars could get justice in his country and be protected from such lawlessness however just as he was going to pronounce some very heavy sentence there was a stir in the court and up came nur mahomeds old mother weeping and lamenting and begging to be heard the king ordered her to speak and she began to plead for the boy declaring how good he was and how he was the support of her old age and if he were put in prison she would die the king asked her who she was she replied that she was his mother  his mother said the king you are too old surely to have so young a son  then the old woman in her fright and distress confessed the whole story of how she found the baby and how she rescued and brought him up and ended by beseeching the king for mercy  it is easy to guess how as the story came out the king looked blacker and blacker and more and more grim until at last he was half fainting with rage and astonishment this then was the baby he had left to die after cruelly murdering his mother surely fate might have spared him this he wished he had sufficient excuse to put the boy to death for the old hermits prophecy came back to him as strongly as ever and yet the young man had done nothing bad enough to deserve such a punishment everyone would call him a tyrant if he were to give such an orderin fact he dared not try it  at length he collected himself enough to sayif this young man will enlist in my army i will let him off we have need of such as him and a little discipline will do him good still the old woman pleaded that she could not live without her son and was nearly as terrified at the idea of his becoming a soldier as she was at the thought of his being put in prison but at length the kingdetermined to get the youth into his clutchespacified her by promising her a pension large enough to keep her in comfort and nur mahomed to his own great delight was duly enrolled in the kings army  as a soldier nur mahomed seemed to be in luck he was rather surprised but much pleased to find that he was always one of those chosen when any difficult or dangerous enterprise was afoot and although he had the narrowest escapes on some occasions still the very desperateness of the situations in which he found himself gave him special chances of displaying his courage and as he was also modest and generous he became a favourite with his officers and his comrades  thus it was not very surprising that before very long he became enrolled amongst the picked men of the kings bodyguard the fact is that the king had hoped to have got him killed in some fight or another but seeing that on the contrary he throve on hard knocks he was now determined to try more direct and desperate methods  one day soon after nur mahomed had entered the bodyguard he was selected to be one of the soldiers told off to escort the king through the city the procession was marching on quite smoothly when a man armed with a dagger rushed out of an alley straight towards the king nur mahomed who was the nearest of the guards threw himself in the way and received the stab that had been apparently intended for the king luckily the blow was a hurried one and the dagger glanced on is breastbone so that although he received a severe wound his youth and strength quickly got the better of it the king was of course obliged to take some notice of this brave deed and as a reward made him one of his own attendants  after this the strange adventures the young man passed through were endless officers of the bodyguard were often sent on all sorts of secret and difficult errands and such errands had a curious way of becoming necessary when nur mahomed was on duty once while he was taking a journey a footbridge gave way under him once he was attacked by armed robbers a rock rolled down upon him in a mountain pass a heavy stone coping fell from a roof at his feet in a narrow city alley altogether nur mahomed began to think that somewhere or other he had made an enemy but he was lighthearted and the thought did not much trouble him he escaped somehow every time and felt amused rather than anxious about the next adventure  it was the custom of that city that the officer for the day of the palace guards should receive all his food direct from the kings kitchen one day when nur mahomeds turn came to be on duty he was just sitting down to a delicious stew that had been sent in from the palace when one of those gaunt hungry dogs which in eastern countries run about the streets poked his nose in at the open guardroom door and looked at nur mahomed with mouth watering and nostrils working the kindhearted young man picked out a lump of meat went to the door and threw it outside to him the dog pounced upon it and gulped it down greedily and was just turning to go when it staggered fell rolled over and died nur mahomed who had been lazily watching him stood still for a moment then he came back whistling softly he gathered up the rest of his dinner and carefully wrapped it up to carry away and bury somewhere and then he sent back the empty plates  how furious the king was when at the next mornings durbar nur mahomed appeared before him fresh alert and smiling as usual he was determined however to try once more and bidding the young man come into his presence that evening gave orders that he was to carry a secret despatch to the governor of a distant province make your preparations at once added he and be ready to start in the morning i myself will deliver you the papers at the last moment  now this province was four or five days journey from the palace and the governor of it was the most faithful servant the king had he could be silent as the grave and prided himself on his obedience whilst he was an old and tried servant of the kings his wife had been almost a mother to the young princess ever since the queen had died some years before it happened that a little before this time the princess had been sent away for her health to another remote province and whilst she was there her old friend the governors wife had begged her to come and stay with them as soon as she could  the princess accepted gladly and was actually staying in the governors house at the very time when the king made up his mind to send nur mahomed there with the mysterious despatch  according to orders nur mahomed presented himself early the next morning at the kings private apartments his best horse was saddled food placed in is saddlebag and with some money tied up in his waistband he was ready to start the king handed over to him a sealed packet desiring him to give it himself only into the hands of the governor and to no one else nur mahomed hid it carefully in his turban swung himself into the saddle and five minutes later rode out of the city gates and set out on his long journey  the weather was very hot but nur mahomed thought that the sooner his precious letter was delivered the better so that by dint of riding most of each night and resting only in the hottest part of the day he found himself by noon on the third day approaching the town which was his final destination  not a soul was to be seen anywhere and nur mahomed stiff dry thirsty and tired looked longingly over the wall into the gardens and marked the fountains the green grass the shady apricot orchards and giant mulberry trees and wished he were there  at length he reached the castle gates and was at once admitted as he was in the uniform of the kings bodyguard the governor was resting the soldier said and could not see him until the evening so nur mahomed handed over his horse to an attendant and wandered down into the lovely gardens he had seen from the road and sat down in the shade to rest himself he flung himself on his back and watched the birds twittering and chattering in the trees above him through the branches he could see great patches of sky where the kites wheeled and circled incessantly with shrill whistling cried bees buzzed over the flowers with a soothing sound and in a few minutes nur mahomed was fast asleep  every day through the heat of the afternoon the governor and his wife also used to lie down for two or three hours in their own rooms and so for the matter of that did most people in the palace but the princess like many other girls was restless and preferred to wander about the garden rather than rest on a pile of soft cushions what a torment her stout old attendants and servants sometime thought her when she insisted on staying awake and making them chatter or do something when they could hardly keep their eyes open sometimes however the princess would pretend to go to sleep and then after all her women had gladly followed her example she would get up and go out by herself her veil hanging loosely about her if she was discovered her old hostess scolded her severely but the princess only laughed and did the same thing next time  this very afternoon the princess had left all her women asleep and after trying in vain to amuse herself indoors she had slipped out into the great garden and rambled about in all her favourite nooks and corners feeling quite safe as there was not a creature to be seen suddenly on turning a corner she stopped in surprise for before her lay a man fast asleep in her hurry she had almost tripped over him but there he was a young man tanned and dusty with travel in the uniform of an officer of the kings guard one of the few faults of this lovely princess was a devouring curiosity and she lived such an idle life that she had plenty of time to be curious out of one of the folds of this young mans turban there peeped the corner of a letter she wondered what the letter waswhom it was for she drew her veil a little closer and stole across on tiptoe and caught hold of the corner of the letter then she pulled it a little and just a little more a great big seal came into view which she saw to be her fathers and at the sight of it she paused for a minute half ashamed of what she was doing but the pleasure of taking a letter which was not meant for her was more than she could resist and in another moment it was in her hand all at once she remembered that it would be death to this poor officer if he lost the letter and that at all hazards she must put it back again but this was not so easy and moreover the letter in her hand burnt her with longing to read it and see what was inside she examined the seal it was sticky with being exposed to the hot sun and with a very little effort it parted from the paper the letter was open and she read it and this was what was written  behead the messenger who brings this letter secretly and at once ask no questions  the girl grew pale what a shame she thought she would not let a handsome young fellow like that be beheaded but how to prevent it was not quite clear at the moment some plan must be invented and she wished to lock herself in where no one could interrupt her as might easily happen in the garden so she crept softly to her room and took a piece of paper and wrote upon it marry the messenger who brings this letter to the princess openly at once ask no questions and even contrived to work the seals off the original letter and to fix them to this so that no one could tell unless they examined it closely that it had ever been opened then she slipped back shaking with fear and excitement to where the young officer still lay asleep thrust the letter into the fold so his turban and hurried back to her room it was done  late in the afternoon nur mahomed woke and making sure that the precious despatch was still safe went off to get ready for his audience with the governor as soon as he was ushered into his presence he took the letter from his turban and placed it in the governors hands according to orders when he had read it the governor was certainly a little astonished but he was told in the letter to ask no questions and he knew how to obey orders he sent for his wife and told her to get the princess ready to be married at once  nonsense said his wife what in the world do you mean  these are the kings commands he answered go and do as i bid you the letter says at once and ask no questions the marriage therefore must take place this evening  in vain did his wife urge every objection the more she argued the more determined was her husband i know how to obey orders he said and these are as plain as the nose on my face so the princess was summoned and somewhat to their surprise she seemed to take the news very calmly next nur mahomed was informed and he was greatly startled but of course he could but be delighted at the great and unexpected honour which he thought the king had done him then all the castle was turned upside down and when the news spread in the town that was turned upside down too everybody ran everywhere and tried to do everything at once and in the middle of it all the old governor went about with his hair standing on end muttering something about obeying orders  and so the marriage was celebrated and there was a great feast in the castle and another in the soldiers barracks and illuminations all over the town and in the beautiful gardens and all the people declared that such a wonderful sight had never been seen and talked about it to the ends of their lives  the next day the governor despatched the princess and her bridegroom to the king with a troop of horsemen splendidly dressed and he sent a mounted messenger on before them with a letter giving the account of the marriage to the king  when the king got the governors letter he grew so red in the face that everyone thought he was going to have apoplexy they were all very anxious to know what had happened but he rushed off and locked himself into a room where he ramped and raved until he was tired then after awhile he began to think he had better make the best of it especially as the old governor had been clever enough to send him back his letter and the king was pretty sure that this was in the princesss handwriting he was fond of his daughter and though she had behaved badly he did not wish to cut her head off and he did not want people to know the truth because it would make him look foolish in fact the more he considered the matter the more he felt that he would be wise to put a good face on it and to let people suppose that he had really brought about the marriage of his own free will  so when the young couple arrived the king received them with all state and gave his soninlaw a province to govern nur mahomed soon proved himself as able and honourable a governor as he was a brave soldier and when the old king died he became king in his place and reigned long and happily  nur mahomeds old mother lived for a long time in her sons palace and died in peace the princess his wife although she had got her husband by a trick found that she could not trick him and so she never tried but busied herself in teaching her children and scolding her maids as for the old hermit no trace of him was ever discovered but the cave is there and the leaves lie thick in front of it unto this day  told the writer by an indian     story of wali dad the simplehearted    once upon a time there lived a poor old man whose name was wali dad gunjay or wali dad the bald he had no relations but lived all by himself in a little mud hut some distance from any town and made his living by cutting grass in the jungle and selling it as fodder for horses he only earned by this five halfpence a day but he was a simple old man and needed so little out of it that he saved up one halfpenny daily and spent the rest upon such food and clothing as he required  in this way he lived for many years until one night he thought that he would count the money he had hidden away in the great earthen pot under the floor of his hut so he set to work and with much trouble he pulled the bag out on to the floor and sat gazing in astonishment at the heap of coins which tumbled out of it what should he do with them all he wondered but he never thought of spending the money on himself because he was content to pass the rest of his days as he had been doing for ever so long and he really had no desire for any greater comfort or luxury  at last he threw all the money into an old sack which he pushed under his bead and then rolled in his ragged old blanket he went off to sleep  early next morning he staggered off with his sack of money to the shop of a jeweller whom he knew in the town and bargained with him for a beautiful little gold bracelet with this carefully wrapped up in his cotton waistband he went to the house of a rich friend who was a travelling merchant and used to wander about with his camels and merchandise through many countries wali dad was lucky enough to find him at home so he sat down and after a little talk he asked the merchant who was the most virtuous and beautiful lady he had ever met with the merchant replied that the princess of khaistan was renowned everywhere as well for the beauty of her person as for the kindness and generosity of her disposition  then said wali dad next time you go that way give her this little bracelet with the respectful compliments of one who admires virtue far more than he desires wealth  with that he pulled the bracelet from his waistband and handed it to his friend the merchant was naturally much astonished but said nothing and made no objection to carrying out his friends plan  time passed by and at length the merchant arrived in the course of his travels at the capital of khaistan as soon as he had opportunity he presented himself at the palace and sent in the bracelet neatly packed in a little perfumed box provided by himself giving at the same time the message entrusted to him by wali dad  the princess could not think who could have bestowed this present on her but she bade her servant to tell the merchant that if he would return after he had finished his business in the city she would give him her reply in a few days therefore the merchant came back and received from the princess a return present in the shape of a camelload or rich silks besides a present of money for himself with these he set out on his journey  some months later he got home again from his journeyings and proceeded to take wali dad the princesss present great was the perplexity of the good man to find a camelload of silks tumbled at his door what was he to do with these costly things but presently after much thought he begged the merchant to consider whether he did not know of some young prince to whom such treasures might be useful  of course cried the merchant greatly amused from delhi to baghdad and from constantinople to lucknow i know them all and there lives none worthier than the gallant and wealthy young prince of nekabad  very well then take the silks to him with the blessing of an old man said wali dad much relieved to be rid of them  so the next time that the merchant journeyed that way he carried the silks with him and in due course arrived at nekabad and sought an audience of the prince when he was shown into his presence he produced the beautiful gift of silks that wali dad had sent and begged the young man to accept them as a humble tribute to his worth and greatness the prince was much touched by the generosity of the giver and ordered as a return present twelve of the finest breed of horses for which his country was famous to be delivered over to the merchant to whom also before he took his leave he gave a munificent reward for his services  as before the merchant at last arrived at home and next day he set out for wali dads house with the twelve horses when the old man saw them coming in the distance he said to himself heres luck a troop of horses coming they are sure to want quantities of grass and i shall sell all i have without having to drag it to market thereupon he rushed off and cut grass as fast he could when he got back with as much grass as he could possibly carry he was greatly discomfited to find that the horses were all for himself at first he could not think what to do with them but after a little a brilliant idea struck him he gave two to the merchant and begged him to take the rest to the princess of khaistan who was clearly the fittest person to possess such beautiful animals  the merchant departed laughing but true to his old friends request he took the horses with him on his next journey and eventually presented them safely to the princess this time the princess sent for the merchant and questioned him about the giver now the merchant was usually a most honest man but he did not quite like to describe wali dad in his true light as an old man whose income was five halfpence a day and who had hardly clothes to cover him so he told her that his friend had heard stories of her beauty and goodness and had longed to lay the best he had at her feet the princess then took her father into her confidence and begged him to advise her what courtesy she might return to one who persisted in making her such presents  well said the king you cannot refuse them so the best thing you can do is to send this unknown friend at once a present so magnificent that he is not likely to be able to send you anything better and so will be ashamed to send anything at all then he ordered that in place of each of the ten horses two mules laden with silver should be returned by her  thus in a few hours the merchant found himself in charge of a splendid caravan and he had to hire a number of armed men to defend it on the road against the robbers and he was glad indeed to find himself back again in wali dads hut  well now cried wali dad as he viewed all the wealth laid at his door i can well repay that kind prince for his magnificent present of horses but to be sure you have been put to great expenses still if you will accept six mules and their loads and will take the rest straight to nekabad i shall thank you heartily  the merchant felt handsomely repaid for his trouble and wondered greatly how the matter would turn out so he made no difficulty about it and as soon as he could get things ready he set out for nekabad with this new and princely gift  this time the prince too was embarrassed and questioned the merchant closely the merchant felt that his credit was at stake and whilst inwardly determining that he would not carry the joke any further could not help describing wali dad in such glowing terms that the old man would never have known himself had he heard them the prince like the king of khaistan determined that he would send in return a gift that would be truly royal and which would perhaps prevent the unknown giver sending him anything more so he made up a caravan on twenty splendid horses caparisoned in gold embroidered cloths with fine morocco saddles and silver bridles and stirrups also twenty camels of the best breed which had the speed of racehorses and could swing along at a trot all day without getting tired and lastly twenty elephants with magnificent silver howdahs and coverings of silk embroidered with pearls to take care of these animals the merchant hired a little army of men and the troop made a great show as they travelled along  when wali dad from a distance saw the cloud of dust which the caravan made and the glitter of its appointments he said to himself by allah heres a grand crowd coming elephants too grass will be selling well today and with that he hurried off to the jungle and cut grass as fast as he could as soon as he got back he found the caravan had stopped at his door and the merchant was waiting a little anxiously to tell him the news and to congratulate him upon his riches  riches cried wali dad what has an old man like me with one foot in the grave to do with riches that beautiful young princess now shed be the one to enjoy all these fine things do you take for yourself two horses two camels and two elephants with all their trappings and present the rest to her  the merchant at first objected to these remarks and pointed out to wali dad that he was beginning to feel these embassies a little awkward of course he was himself richly repaid so far as expenses went but still he did not like going so often and he was getting nervous at length however he consented to go once more but he promised himself never to embark on another such enterprise  so after a few days rest the caravan started off once more for khaistan  the moment the king of khaistan saw the gorgeous train of men and beasts entering his palace courtyard he was so amazed that he hurried down in person to inquire about it and became dumb when he heard that these also were a present from the princely wali dad and were for the princess his daughter he went hastily off to her apartments and said to her i tell you what it is my dear this man wants to marry you that is the meaning of all these presents there is nothing for it but that we go and pay him a visit in person he must be a man of immense wealth and as he is so devoted to you perhaps you might do worse than marry him  the princess agreed with all that her father said and orders were issued for vast numbers of elephants and camels and gorgeous tents and flags and litters for the ladies and horses for the men to be prepared without delay as the king and princess were going to pay a visit to the great and munificent prince wali dad the merchant the king declared was to guide the party  the feelings of the poor merchant in this sore dilemma can hardly be imagined willingly would he have run away but he was treated with so much hospitality as wali dads representative that he hardly got an instants real peace and never any opportunity of slipping away in fact after a few days despair possessed him to such a degree that he made up his mind that all that happened was fate and that escape was impossible but he hoped devoutly some turn of fortune would reveal to him a way out of the difficulties which he had with the best intentions drawn upon himself  on the seventh day they all started amidst thunderous salutes from the ramparts of the city and much dust and cheering and blaring of trumpets  day after day they moved on and every day the poor merchant felt more ill and miserable he wondered what kind of death the king would invent for him and went through almost as much torture as he lay awake nearly the whole of every night thinking over the situation as he would have suffered if the kings executioners were already setting to work upon his neck  at last they were only one days march from wali dads little mud home here a great encampment was made and the merchant was sent on to tell wali dad that the king and princess of khaistan had arrived and were seeking an interview when the merchant arrived he found the poor old man eating his evening meal of onions and dry bread and when he told him of all that had happened he had not the heart to proceed to load him with the reproaches which rose to his tongue for wali dad was overwhelmed with grief and shame for himself for his friend and for the name and honour of the princess and he wept and plucked at his beard and groaned most piteously with tears he begged the merchant to detain them for one day by any kind of excuse he could think of and to come in the morning to discuss what they should do  as soon as the merchant was gone wali dad made up his mind that there was only one honourable way out of the shame and distress that he had created by his foolishness and that wasto kill himself so without stopping to ask any ones advice he went off in the middle of the night to a place where the river wound along at the base of steep rocky cliffs of great height and determined to throw himself down and put an end to his life when he got to the place he drew back a few paces took a little run and at the very edge of that dreadful black gulf he stopped short he could not do it  from below unseen in the blackness of the deep night shadows the water roared and boiled round the jagged rockshe could picture the place as he knew it only ten times more pitiless and forbidding in the visionless darkness the wind soughed through the gorge with fearsome sighs and rustlings and whisperings and the bushes and grasses that grew in the ledges of the cliffs seemed to him like living creatures that danced and beckoned shadowy and indistinct an owl laughed hoo hoo almost in his face as he peered over the edge of the gulf and the old man threw himself back in a perspiration of horror he was afraid he drew back shuddering and covering his face in his hands he wept aloud  presently he was aware of a gentle radiance that shed itself before him surely morning was not already coming to hasten and reveal his disgrace he took his hands from before his face and saw before him two lovely beings whom his instinct told him were not mortal but were peris from paradise  why do you weep old man said one in a voice as clear and musical as that of the bulbul  i weep for shame replied he  what do you here questioned the other  i came here to die said wali dad and as they questioned him he confessed all his story  then the first stepped forward and laid a hand upon his shoulder and wali dad began to feel that something strangewhat he did not knowwas happening to him his old cotton rags of clothes were changed to beautiful linen and embroidered cloth on his hard bare feet were warm soft shoes and on his head a great jewelled turban round his neck there lay a heavy golden chain and the little old bent sickle which he cut grass with and which hung in his waistband had turned into a gorgeous scimetar whose ivory hilt gleamed in the pale light like snow in moonlight as he stood wondering like a man in a dream the other peri waved her hand and bade him turn and see and lo before him a noble gateway stood open and up an avenue of giant place trees the peris led him dumb with amazement at the end of the avenue on the very spot where his hut had stood a gorgeous palace appeared ablaze with myriads of lights its great porticoes and verandahs were occupied by hurrying servants and guards paced to and fro and saluted him respectfully as he drew near along mossy walks and through sweeping grassy lawns where fountains were playing and flowers scented the air wali dad stood stunned and helpless  fear not said one of the peris go to your house and learn that god rewards the simplehearted  with these words they both disappeared and left him he walked on thinking still that he must be dreaming very soon he retired to rest in a splendid room far grander than anything he had ever dreamed of  when morning dawned he woke and found that the palace and himself and his servants were all real and that he was not dreaming after all  if he was dumbfounded the merchant who was ushered into his presence soon after sunrise was much more so he told wali dad that he had not slept all night and by the first streak of daylight had started to seek out his friend and what a search he had had a great stretch of wild jungle country had in the night been changed into parks and gardens and if it had not been for some of wali dads new servants who found him and brought him to the palace he would have fled away under the impression that his trouble had sent him crazy and that all he saw was only imagination  then wali dad told the merchant all that had happened by his advice he sent an invitation to the king and princess of khaistan to come and be his guests together with all their retinue and servants down to the very humblest in the camp  for three nights and days a great feast was held in honour of the royal guests every evening the king and his nobles were served on golden plates and from golden cups and the smaller people on silver plates and from silver cups and each evening each guest was requested to keep the places and cups that they had used as a remembrance of the occasion never had anything so splendid been seen besides the great dinners there were sports and hunting and dances and amusements of all sorts  on the fourth day the king of khaistan took his host aside and asked him whether it was true as he had suspected that he wished to marry his daughter but wali dad after thanking him very much for the compliment said that he had never dreamed of so great an honour and that he was far too old and ugly for so fair a lady but he begged the king to stay with him until he could send for the prince of nekabad who was a most excellent brave and honourable young man and would surely be delighted to try to win the hand of the beautiful princess  to this the king agreed and wali dad sent the merchant to nekabad with a number of attendants and with such handsome presents that the prince came at once fell head over ears in love with the princess and married her at wali dads palace amidst a fresh outburst of rejoicings  and now the king of khaistan and the prince and princess of nekabad each went back to their own country and wali dad lived to a good old age befriending all who were in trouble and preserving in his prosperity the simplehearted and generous nature that he had when he was only wali dad gunjay the grass cutter  told the author by an indian     tale of a tortoise and of a mischievous monkey    once upon a time there was a country where the rivers were larger and the forests deeper than anywhere else hardly any men came there and the wild creatures had it all to themselves and used to play all sorts of strange games with each other the great trees chained one to the other by thick flowering plants with bright scarlet or yellow blossoms were famous hidingplaces for the monkeys who could wait unseen till a puma or an elephant passed by and then jump on their backs and go for a ride swinging themselves up by the creepers when they had had enough near the rivers huge tortoises were to be found and though to our eyes a tortoise seems a dull slow thing it is wonderful to think how clever they were and how often they outwitted many of their livelier friends  there was one tortoise in particular that always managed to get the better of everybody and many were the tales told in the forest of his great deeds they began when he was quite young and tired of staying at home with his father and mother he left them one day and walked off in search of adventures in a wide open space surrounded by trees he met with an elephant who was having his supper before taking his evening bath in the river which ran close by let us see which of us two is strongest said the young tortoise marching up to the elephant very well replied the elephant much amused at the impertinence of the little creature when would you like the trial to be  in an hours time i have some business to do first answered the tortoise and he hastened away as fast as his short legs would carry him  in a pool of the river a whale was resting blowing water into the air and making a lovely fountain the tortoise however was too young and too busy to admire such things and he called to the whale to stop as he wanted to speak to him would you like to try which of us is the stronger said he the whale looked at him sent up another fountain and answered oh yes certainly when do you wish to begin i am quite ready  then give me one of your longest bones and i will fasten it to my leg when i give the signal you must pull and we will see which can pull the hardest  very good replied the whale and he took out one of his bones and passed it to the tortoise  the tortoise picked up the end of the bone in his mouth and went back to the elephant i will fasten this to your leg said he in the same way as it is fastened to mine and we must both pull as hard as we can we shall soon see which is the stronger so he wound it carefully round the elephants leg and tied it in a firm knot now cried he plunging into a thick bush behind him  the whale tugged at one end and the elephant tugged at the other and neither had any idea that he had not the tortoise for his foe when the whale pulled hardest the elephant was dragged into the water and when the elephant pulled the hardest the whale was hauled on to the land they were very evenly matched and the battle was a hard one  at last they were quite tired and the tortoise who was watching saw that they could play no more so he crept from his hidingplace and dipping himself in the river he went to the elephant and said i see that you really are stronger than i thought suppose we give it up for today then he dried himself on some moss and went to the whale and said i see that you really are stronger than i thought suppose we give it up for today  the two adversaries were only too glad to be allowed to rest and believed to the end of their days that after all the tortoise was stronger than either of them  a day or two later the young tortoise was taking a stroll when he met a fox and stopped to speak to him let us try said he in a careless manner which of us can lie buried in the ground during seven years  i shall be delighted answered the fox only i would rather that you began  it is all the same to me replied the tortoise if you come round this way tomorrow you will see that i have fulfilled my part of the bargain  so he looked about for a suitable place and found a convenient hole at the foot of an orange tree he crept into it and the next morning the fox heaped up the earth round him and promised to feed him every day with fresh fruit the fox so far kept his word that each morning when the sun rose he appeared to ask how the tortoise was getting on oh very well but i wish you would give me some fruit replied he  alas the fruit is not ripe enough yet for you to eat answered the fox who hoped that the tortoise would die of hunger long before the seven years were over  oh dear oh dear i am so hungry cried the tortoise  i am sure you must be but it will be all right tomorrow said the fox trotting off not knowing that the oranges dropped down the hollow trunk straight into the tortoises hole and that he had as many as he could possibly eat  so the seven years went by and when the tortoise came out of his hole he was as fat as ever  now it was the foxs turn and he chose his hole and the tortoise heaped the earth round promising to return every day or two with a nice young bird for his dinner well how are you getting on he would ask cheerfully when he paid his visits  oh all right only i wish you had brought a bird with you answered the fox  i have been so unlucky i have never been able to catch one replied the tortoise however i shall be more fortunate tomorrow i am sure  but not many tomorrows after when the tortoise arrived with his usual question well how are you getting on he received no answer for the fox was lying in his hole quite still dead of hunger  by this time the tortoise was grown up and was looked up to throughout the forest as a person to be feared for his strength and wisdom but he was not considered a very swift runner until an adventure with a deer added to his fame  one day when he was basking in the sun a stag passed by and stopped for a little conversation would you care to see which of us can run fastest asked the tortoise after some talk the stag thought the question so silly that he only shrugged his shoulders of course the victor would have the right to kill the other went on the tortoise oh on that condition i agree answered the deer but i am afraid you are a dead man  it is no use trying to frighten me replied the tortoise but i should like three days for training then i shall be ready to start when the sun strikes on the big tree at the edge of the great clearing  the first thing the tortoise did was to call his brothers and his cousins together and he posted them carefully under ferns all along the line of the great clearing making a sort of ladder which stretched for many miles this done to his satisfaction he went back to the starting place  the stag was quite punctual and as soon as the suns rays struck the trunk of the tree the stag started off and was soon far out of the sight of the tortoise every now and then he would turn his head as he ran and call out how are you getting on and the tortoise who happened to be nearest at that moment would answer all right i am close up to you  full of astonishment the stag would redouble his efforts but it was no use each time he asked are you there the answer would come yes of course where else should i be and the stag ran and ran and ran till he could run no more and dropped down dead on the grass  and the tortoise when he thinks about it laughs still  but the tortoise was not the only creature of whose tricks stories were told in the forest there was a famous monkey who was just as clever and more mischievous because he was so much quicker on his feet and with his hands it was quite impossible to catch him and give him the thrashing he so often deserved for he just swung himself up into a tree and laughed at the angry victim who was sitting below sometimes however the inhabitants of the forest were so foolish as to provoke him and then they got the worst of it this was what happened to the barber whom the monkey visited one morning saying that he wished to be shaved the barber bowed politely to his customer and begging him to be seated tied a large cloth round his neck and rubbed his chin with soap but instead of cutting off his beard the barber made a snip at the end of his tail it was only a very little bit and the monkey started up more in rage than in pain give me back the end of my tail he roared or i will take one of your razors the barber refused to give back the missing piece so the monkey caught up a razor from the table and ran away with it and no one in the forest could be shaved for days as there was not another to be got for miles and miles  as he was making his way to his own particular palmtree where the cocoanuts grew which were so useful for pelting passersby he met a woman who was scaling a fish with a bit of wood for in this side of the forest a few people lived in huts near the river  that must be hard work said the monkey stopping to look try my knifeyou will get on quicker and he handed her the razor as he spoke a few days later he came back and rapped at the door of the hut i have called for my razor he said when the woman appeared  i have lost it answered she  if you dont give it to me at once i will take your sardine replied the monkey who did not believe her the woman protested she had not got the knife so he took the sardine and ran off  a little further along he saw a baker who was standing at the door eating one of his loaves that must be rather dry said the monkey try my fish and the man did not need twice telling a few days later the monkey stopped again at the bakers hut ive called for that fish he said  that fish but i have eaten it exclaimed the baker in dismay  if you have eaten it i shall take this barrel of meal in exchange replied the monkey and he walked off with the barrel under his arm  as he went he saw a woman with a group of little girls round her teaching them how to dress hair here is something to make cakes for the children he said putting down his barrel which by this time he found rather heavy the children were delighted and ran directly to find some flat stones to bake their cakes on and when they had made and eaten them they thought they had never tasted anything so nice indeed when they saw the monkey approaching not long after they rushed to meet him hoping that he was bringing them some more presents but he took no notice of their questions he only said to their mother ive called for my barrel of meal  why you gave it to me to make cakes of cried the mother  if i cant get my barrel of meal i shall take one of your children answered the monkey i am in want of somebody who can bake my bread when i am tired of fruit and who knows how to make cocoanut cakes  oh leave me my child and i will find you another barrel of meal wept the mother  i dont want another barrel i want that one answered the monkey sternly and as the woman stood wringing her hands he caught up the little girl that he thought the prettiest and took her to his home in the palm tree  she never went back to the hut but on the whole she was not much to be pitied for monkeys are nearly as good as children to play with and they taught her how to swing and to climb and to fly from tree to tree and everything else they knew which was a great deal  now the monkeys tiresome tricks had made him many enemies in the forest but no one hated him so much as the puma the cause of their quarrel was known only to themselves but everybody was aware of the fact and took care to be out of the way when there was any chance of these two meeting often and often the puma had laid traps for the monkey which he felt sure his foe could not escape and the monkey would pretend that he saw nothing and rejoice the hidden pumas heart by seeming to walk straight into the snare when lo a loud laugh would be heard and the monkeys grinning face would peer out of a mass of creepers and disappear before his foe could reach him  this state of things had gone on for quite a long while when at last there came a season such as the oldest parrot in the forest could never remember instead of two or three hundred inches of rain falling which they were all accustomed to month after month passed without a cloud and the rivers and springs dried up till there was only one small pool left for everyone to drink from there was not an animal for miles round that did not grieve over this shocking condition of affairs not one at least except the puma his only thought for years had been how to get the monkey into his power and this time he imagined his chance had really arrived he would hide himself in a thicket and when the monkey came down to drinkand come he mustthe puma would spring out and seize him yes on this occasion there could be no escape  and no more there would have been if the puma had had greater patience but in his excitement he moved a little too soon the monkey who was stooping to drink heard a rustling and turning caught the gleam of two yellow murderous eyes with a mighty spring he grasped a creeper which was hanging above him and landed himself on the branch of a tree feeling the breath of the puma on his feet as the animal bounded from is cover never had the monkey been so near death and it was some time before he recovered enough courage to venture on the ground again  up there in the shelter of the trees he began to turn over in his head plans for escaping the snares of the puma and at length chance helped him peeping down to the earth he saw a man coming along the path carrying on his head a large gourd filled with honey  he waited till the man was just underneath the tree then he hung from a bough and caught the gourd while the man looked up wondering for he was no treeclimber then the monkey rubbed the honey all over him and a quantity of leaves from a creeper that was hanging close by he stuck them all close together into the honey so that he looked like a walking bush this finished he ran to the pool to see the result and quite pleased with himself set out in search of adventures  soon the report went through the forest that a new animal had appeared from no one knew where and that when somebody had asked his name the strange creature had answered that it was jackinthegreen thanks to this the monkey was allowed to drink at the pool as often as he liked for neither beast nor bird had the faintest notion who he was and if they made any inquiries the only answer they got was that the water of which he had drunk deeply had turned his hair into leaves so that they all knew what would happen in case they became too greedy  byandby the great rains began again the rivers and streams filled up and there was no need for him to go back to the pool near the home of his enemy the puma as there was a large number of places for him to choose from so one night when everything was still and silent and even the chattering parrots were asleep on one leg the monkey stole down softly from his perch and washed off the honey and the leaves and came out from his bath in his own proper skin on his way to breakfast he met a rabbit and stopped for a little talk  i am feeling rather dull he remarked i think it would do me good to hunt a while what do you say  oh i am quite willing answered the rabbit proud of being spoken to by such a large creature but the question is what shall we hunt  there is no credit in going after an elephant or a tiger replied the monkey stroking his chin they are so big they could not possibly get out of your way it shows much more skill to be able to catch a small thing that can hide itself in a moment behind a leaf ill tell you what suppose i hunt butterflies and you serpents  the rabbit who was young and without experience was delighted with this idea and they both set out on their various ways  the monkey quietly climbed up the nearest tree and ate fruit most of the day but the rabbit tired himself to death poking his nose into every heap of dried leaves he saw hoping to find a serpent among them luckily for himself the serpents were all away for the afternoon at a meeting of their own for there is nothing a serpent likes so well for dinner as a nice plump rabbit but as it was the dried leaves were all empty and the rabbit at last fell asleep where he was then the monkey who had been watching him fell down and pulled his ears to the rage of the rabbit who vowed vengeance  it was not easy to catch the monkey off his guard and the rabbit waited long before an opportunity arrived but one day jackinthegreen was sitting on a stone wondering what he should do next when the rabbit crept softly behind him and gave his tail a sharp pull the monkey gave a shriek of pain and darted up into a tree but when he saw that it was only the rabbit who had dared to insult him so he chattered so fast in his anger and looked so fierce that the rabbit fled into the nearest hole and stayed there for several days trembling with fright  soon after this adventure the monkey went away into another part of the country right on the outskirts of the forest where there was a beautiful garden full of oranges hanging ripe from the trees this garden was a favourite place for birds of all kinds each hoping to secure an orange for dinner and in order to frighten the birds away and keep a little fruit for himself the master had fastened a waxen figure on one of the boughs  now the monkey was as fond of oranges as any of the birds and when he saw a man standing in the tree where the largest and sweetest oranges grew he spoke to him at once you man he said rudely throw me down that big orange up there or i will throw a stone at you the wax figure took no notice of this request so the monkey who was easily made angry picked up a stone and flung it with all his force but instead of falling to the ground again the stone stuck to the soft wax  at this moment a breeze shook the tree and the orange on which the monkey had set his heart dropped from the bough he picked it up and ate it every bit including the rind and it was so good he thought he should like another so he called again to the wax figure to throw him an orange and as the figure did not move he hurled another stone which stuck to the wax as the first had done seeing that the man was quite indifferent to stones the monkey grew more angry still and climbing the tree hastily gave the figure a violent kick but like the two stones his leg remained stuck to the wax and he was held fast let me go at once or i will give you another kick he cried suiting the action to the word and this time also his foot remained in the grasp of the man not knowing what he did the monkey hit out first with one hand and then with the other and when he found that he was literally bound hand and foot he became so mad with anger and terror that in his struggles he fell to the ground dragging the figure after him this freed his hands and feet but besides the shock of the fall they had tumbled into a bed of thorns and he limped away broken and bruised and groaning loudly for when monkeys are hurt they take pains that everybody shall know it  it was a long time before jack was well enough to go about again but when he did he had an encounter with his old enemy the puma and this was how it came about  one day the puma invited his friend the stag to go with him and see a comrade who was famous for the good milk he got from his cows the stag loved milk and gladly accepted the invitation and when the sun began to get a little low the two started on their walk on the way they arrived on the banks of a river and as there were no bridges in those days it was necessary to swim across it the stag was not fond of swimming and began to say that he was tired and thought that after all it was not worth going so far to get milk and that he would return home but the puma easily saw through these excuses and laughed at him  the river is not deep at all he said why you will never be off your feet come pluck up your courage and follow me  the stag was afraid of the river still he was much more afraid of being laughed at and he plunged in after the puma but in an instant the current had swept him away and if it had not borne him by accident to a shallow place on the opposite side where he managed to scramble up the bank he would certainly have been drowned as it was he scrambled out shaking with terror and found the puma waiting for him you had a narrow escape that time said the puma  after resting for a few minutes to let the stag recover from his fright they went on their way till they came to a grove of bananas  they look very good observed the puma with a longing glance and i am sure you must be hungry friend stag suppose you were to climb the tree and get some you shall eat the green ones they are the best and sweetest and you can throw the yellow ones down to me i dare say they will do quite well the stag did as he was bid though not being used to climbing it gave him a deal of trouble and sore knees and besides his horns were continually getting entangled in the creepers what was worse when once he had tasted the bananas he found them not at all to his liking so he threw them all down green and yellow alike and let the puma take his choice and what a dinner he made when he had quite done they set forth once more  the path lay through a field of maize where several men were working as they came up to them the puma whispered go on in front friend stag and just say bad luck to all workers the stag obeyed but the men were hot and tired and did not think this a good joke so they set their dogs at him and he was obliged to run away as fast as he could  i hope your industry will be rewarded as it deserves said the puma as he passed along and the men were pleased and offered him some of their maize to eat  byandby the puma saw a small snake with a beautiful shining skin lying coiled up at the foot of a tree what a lovely bracelet that would make for your daughter friend stag said he the stag stooped and picked up the snake which bit him and he turned angrily to the puma why did you not tell me it would bite he asked  is it my fault if you are an idiot replied the puma  at last they reached their journeys end but by this time it was late and the pumas comrade was ready for bed so they slung their hammocks in convenient places and went to sleep but in the middle of the night the puma rose softly and stole out of the door to the sheepfold where he killed and ate the fattest sheep he could find and taking a bowl full of its blood he sprinkled the sleeping stag with it this done he returned to bed  in the morning the shepherd went as usual to let the sheep out of the fold and found one of them missing he thought directly of the puma and ran to accuse him of having eaten the sheep i my good man what had put it into your head to think of such a thing have i got any blood about me if anyone has eaten a sheep it must be my friend the stag then the shepherd went to examine the sleeping stag and of course he saw the blood ah i will teach you how to steal cried he and he hit the stag such a blow on his skull that he died in a moment the noise awakened the comrade above and he came downstairs the puma greeted him with joy and begged he might have some of the famous milk as soon as possible for he was very thirsty a large bucket was set before the puma directly he drank it to the last drop and then took leave  on his way home he met the monkey are you fond of milk asked he i know a place where you get it very nice i will show you it if you like the monkey knew that the puma was not so goodnatured for nothing but he felt quite able to take care of himself so he said he should have much pleasure in accompanying his friend  they soon reached the same river and as before the puma remarked friend monkey you will find it very shallow there is no cause for fear jump in and i will follow  do you think you have the stag to deal with asked the monkey laughing i should prefer to follow if not i shall go no further the puma understood that it was useless trying to make the monkey do as he wished so he chose a shallow place and began to swim across the monkey waited till the puma had got to the middle then he gave a great spring and jumped on his back knowing quite well that the puma would be afraid to shake him off lest he should be swept away into deep water so in this manner they reached the bank  the banana grove was not far distant and here the puma thought he would pay the monkey out for forcing him to carry him over the river friend monkey look what fine bananas cried he you are fond of climbing suppose you run up and throw me down a few you can eat the green ones which are the nicest and i will be content with the yellow  very well answered the monkey swinging himself up but he ate all the yellow ones himself and only threw down the green ones that were left the puma was furious and cried out i will punch your head for that but the monkey only answered if you are gong to talk such nonsense i wont walk with you and the puma was silent  in a few minutes more they arrived at the field were the men were reaping the maize and the puma remarked as he had done before friend monkey if you wish to please these men just say as you go by bad luck to all workers  very well replied the monkey but instead he nodded and smiled and said i hope your industry may be rewarded as it deserves the men thanked him heartily let him pass on and the puma followed behind him  further along the path they saw the shining snake lying on the moss what a lovely necklace for your daughter exclaimed the puma pick it up and take it with you  you are very kind but i will leave it for you answered the monkey and nothing more was said about the snake  not long after this they reached the comrades house and found him just ready to go to bed so without stopping to talk the guests slung their hammocks the monkey taking care to place his so high that no one could get at him besides he thought it would be more prudent not to fall asleep so he only lay still and snored loudly when it was quite dark and no sound was to be heard the puma crept out to the sheepfold killed the sheep and carried back a bowl full of its blood with which to sprinkle the monkey but the monkey who had been watching out of the corner of his eye waited until the puma drew near and with a violent kick upset the bowl all over the puma himself  when the puma saw what had happened he turned in a great hurry to leave the house but before he could do so he saw the shepherd coming and hastily lay down again  this is the second time i have lost a sheep the man said to the monkey it will be the worse for the thief when i catch him i can tell you the monkey did not answer but silently pointed to the puma who was pretending to be asleep the shepherd stooped and saw the blood and cried out ah so it is you is it then take that and with his stick he gave the puma such a blow on the head that he died then and there  then the monkey got up and went to the dairy and drank all the milk he could find afterwards he returned home and married and that is the last we heard of him  adapted from folklore bresilien    the knights of the fish    once upon a time there lived an old cobbler who worked hard at his trade from morning till night and scarcely gave himself a moment to eat but industrious as he was he could hardly buy bread and cheese for himself and his wife and they grew thinner and thinner daily  for a long while whey pretended to each other that they had no appetite and that a few blackberries from the hedges were a great deal nicer than a good strong bowl of soup but at length there came a day when the cobbler could bear it no longer and he threw away his last and borrowing a rod from a neighbour he went out to fish  now the cobbler was as patient about fishing as he had been about cobbling from dawn to dark he stood on the banks of the little stream without hooking anything better than an eel or a few old shoes that even he clever though he was felt were not worth mending at length his patience began to give way and as he undressed one night he said to himself well i will give it one more chance and if i dont catch a fish tomorrow i will go and hang myself  he had not cast his line for ten minutes the next morning before he drew from the river the most beautiful fish he had ever seen in his life but he nearly fell into the water from surprise when the fish began to speak to him in a small squeaky voice  take me back to your hut and cook me then cut me up and sprinkle me over with pepper and salt give two of the pieces to your wife and bury two more in the garden  the cobbler did not know what to make of these strange words but he was wiser than many people and when he did not understand he thought it was well to obey his children wanted to eat all the fish themselves and begged their father to tell them what to do with the pieces he had put aside but the cobbler only laughed and told them it was no business of theirs and when they were safe in bed he stole out and buried the two pieces in the garden  by and by two babies exactly alike lay in a cradle and in the garden were two tall plants with two brilliant shields on the top  years passed away and the babies were almost men they were tired of living quietly at home being mistaken for each other by everybody they saw and determined to set off in different directions to seek adventures  so one fine morning the two brothers left the hut and walked together to the place where the great road divided there they embraced and parted promising that if anything remarkable had happened to either he would return to the cross roads and wait till his brother came  the youth who took the path that ran eastwards arrived presently at a large city where he found everybody standing at the doors wringing their hands and weeping bitterly  what is the matter asked he pausing and looking round and a man replied in a faltering voice that each year a beautiful girl was chosen by lot to be offered up to a dreadful fiery dragon who had a mother even worse than himself and this year the lot had fallen on their peerless princess  but where is the princess said the young man once more and again the man answered him she is standing under a tree a mile away waiting for the dragon  this time the knight of the fish did not stop to hear more but ran off as fast as he could and found the princess bathed in tears and trembling from head to foot  she turned as she heard the sound of his sword and removed her handkerchief from his eyes  fly she cried fly while you have yet time before that monster sees you  she said it and she mean it yet when he had turned his back she felt more forsaken than before but in reality it was not more than a few minutes before he came back galloping furiously on a horse he had borrowed and carrying a huge mirror across its neck  i am in time then he cried dismounting very carefully and placing the mirror against the trunk of a tree  give me your veil he said hastily to the princess and when she had unwound it from her head he covered the mirror with it  the moment the dragon comes near you you must tear off the veil cried he and be sure you hide behind the mirror have no fear i shall be at hand  he and his horse had scarcely found shelter amongst some rocks when the flap of the dragons wings could be plainly heard he tossed his head with delight at the sight of her and approached slowly to the place where she stood a little in front of the mirror then still looking the monster steadily in the face she passed one hand behind her back and snatched off the veil stepping swiftly behind the tree as she did so  the princess had not known when she obeyed the orders of the knight of the fish what she expected to happen would the dragon with snaky locks be turned to stone she wondered like the dragon in an old story her nurse had told her or would some fiery spark dart from the heart of the mirror and strike him dead neither of these things occurred but instead the dragon stopped short with surprise and rage when he saw a monster before him as big and strong as himself he shook his mane with rage and fury the enemy in front did exactly the same he lashed his tail and rolled his red eyes and the dragon opposite was no whit behind him opening his mouth to its very widest he gave an awful roar but the other dragon only roared back this was too much and with another roar which made the princess shake in her shoes he flung himself upon his foe in an instant the mirror lay at his feet broken into a thousand pieces but as every piece reflected part of himself the dragon thought that he too had been smashed into atoms  it was the moment for which the knight of the fish had watched and waited and before the dragon could find out that he was not hurt at all the young mans lance was down his throat and he was rolling dead on the grass  oh what shouts of joy rang through the great city when the youth came riding back with the princess sitting behind him and dragging the horrible monster by a cord everybody cried out that the king must give the victor the hand of the princess and so he did and no one had ever seen such balls and feasts and sports before and when they were all over the young couple went to the palace prepared for them which was so large that it was three miles round  the first wet day after their marriage the bridegroom begged the bride to show him all the rooms in the palace and it was so big and took so long that the sun was shining brightly again before they stepped on to the roof to see the view  what castle is that out there asked the knight it seems to be made of black marble  it is called the castle of albatroz answered the princess it is enchanted and no one that has tried to enter it has ever come back  her husband said nothing and began to talk of something else but the next morning he ordered his horse took his spear called his bloodhound and set off for the castle  it needed a brave man to approach it for it made your hair stand on end merely to look at it it was as dark as the night of a storm and as silent as the grave but the knight of the fish knew no fear and had never turned his back on an enemy so he drew out his horn and blew a blast  the sound awoke all the sleeping echoes in the castle and was repeated now loudly now softly now near and now far but nobody stirred for all that  is there anyone inside cried the young man in his loudest voice anyone who will give a knight hospitality neither governor nor squire not even a page  not even a page answered the echoes but the young man did not heed them and only struck a furious blow at the gate  then a small grating opened and there appeared the tip of a huge nose which belonged to the ugliest old woman that ever was seen  what do you want said she  to enter he answered shortly can i rest here this night yes or no  no no no repeated the echoes  between the fierce sun and his anger at being kept waiting the knight of the fish had grown so hot that he lifted his visor and when the old woman saw how handsome he was she began fumbling with the lock of the gate  come in come in said she so fine a gentleman will do us no harm  harm repeated the echoes but again the young man paid no heed  let us go in ancient dame but she interrupted him  you must call me the lady berberisca she answered sharply and this is my castle to which i bid you welcome you shall live here with me and be my husband but at these words the knight let his spear fall so surprised was he  i marry you why you must be a hundred at least cried he you are mad all i desire is to inspect the castle and then go as he spoke he heard the voices give a mocking laugh but the old woman took no notice and only bade the knight follow her  old though she was it seemed impossible to tire her there was no room however small she did not lead him into and each room was full of curious things he had never seen before  at length they came to a stone staircase which was so dark that you could not see your hand if you held it up before your face  i have kept my most precious treasure till the last said the old woman but let me go first for the stairs are steep and you might easily break your leg so on she went now and then calling back to the young man in the darkness but he did not know that she had slipped aside into a recess till suddenly he put his foot on a trap door which gave way under him and he fell down down as many good knights had done before him and his voice joined the echoes of theirs  so you would not marry me chuckled the old witch ha ha ha ha  meanwhile his brother had wandered far and wide and at last he wandered back to the same great city where the other young knight had met with so many adventures he noticed with amazement that as he walked through the streets the guards drew themselves up in line and saluted him and the drummers played the royal march but he was still more bewildered when several servants in livery ran up to him and told him that the princess was sure something terrible had befallen him and had made herself ill with weeping at last it occurred to him that once more he had been taken for his brother i had better say nothing thought he perhaps i shall be able to help him after all  so he suffered himself to be borne in triumph to the palace where the princess threw herself into his arms  and so you did go to the castle she asked  yes of course i did answered he  and what did you see there  i am forbidden to tell you anything about it until i have returned there once more replied he  must you really go back to that dreadful place she asked wistfully you are the only man who has ever come back from it  i must was all he answered and the princess who was a wise woman only said well go to bed now for i am sure you must be very tired  but the knight shook his head i have sworn never to lie in a bed as long as my work in the castle remains standing and the princess again sighed and was silent  early next day the young man started for the castle feeling sure that some terrible thing must have happened to his brother  at the blast of his horn the long nose of the old woman appeared at the grating but the moment she caught sight of his face she nearly fainted from fright as she thought it was the ghost of the youth whose bones were lying in the dungeon of the castle  lady of all the ages cried the new comer did you not give hospitality to a young knight but a short time ago  a short time ago wailed the voices  and how have you illtreated him he went on  illtreated him answered the voices the woman did not stop to hear more she turned to fly but the knights sword entered her body  where is my brother cruel hag asked he sternly  i will tell you said she but as i feel that i am going to die i shall keep that piece of news to myself till you have brought me to life again  the young man laughed scornfully how do you propose that i should work that miracle  oh it is quite easy go into the garden and gather the flowers of the everlasting plant and some of dragons blood crush them together and boil them in a large tub of water and then put me into it  the knight did as the old witch bade him and sure enough she came out quite whole but uglier than ever she then told the young man what had become of his brother and he went down into the dungeon and brought up his body and the bodies of the other victims who lay there and when they were all washed in the magic water their strength was restored to them  and besides these he found in another cavern the bodies of the girls who had been sacrificed to the dragon and brought them back to life also  as to the old witch in the end she died of rage at seeing her prey escape her and at the moment she drew her last breath the castle of albatroz fell into ruins with a great noise  from
