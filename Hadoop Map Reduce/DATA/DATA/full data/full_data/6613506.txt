6613506	peveril of the peak  by sir walter scott bart      peveril of the peak     chapter i                 when civil dudgeon first grew high                and men fell out they knew not why                when foul words jealousies and fears                set folk together by the ears                                              butler  william the conqueror of england was or supposed himself to be the father of a certain william peveril who attended him to the battle of hastings and there distinguished himself the liberalminded monarch who assumed in his charters the veritable title of gulielmus bastardus was not likely to let his sons illegitimacy be any bar to the course of his royal favour when the laws of england were issued from the mouth of the norman victor and the lands of the saxons were at his unlimited disposal william peveril obtained a liberal grant of property and lordships in derbyshire and became the erecter of that gothic fortress which hanging over the mouth of the devils cavern so well known to tourists gives the name of castleton to the adjacent village  from this feudal baron who chose his nest upon the principles on which an eagle selects her eyry and built it in such a fashion as if he had intended it as an irishman said of the martello towers for the sole purpose of puzzling posterity there was or conceived themselves to be descended for their pedigree was rather hypothetical an opulent family of knightly rank in the same county of derby the great fief of castleton with its adjacent wastes and forests and all the wonders which they contain had been forfeited in king johns stormy days by one william peveril and had been granted anew to the lord ferrers of that day yet this williams descendants though no longer possessed of what they alleged to have been their original property were long distinguished by the proud title of peverils of the peak which served to mark their high descent and lofty pretensions  in charles the seconds time the representative of this ancient family was sir geoffrey peveril a man who had many of the ordinary attributes of an oldfashioned country gentleman and very few individual traits to distinguish him from the general portrait of that worthy class of mankind he was proud of small advantages angry at small disappointments incapable of forming any resolution or opinion abstracted from his own prejudiceshe was proud of his birth lavish in his housekeeping convivial with those kindred and acquaintances who would allow his superiority in rankcontentious and quarrelsome with all that crossed his pretensionskind to the poor except when they plundered his gamea royalist in his political opinions and one who detested alike a roundhead a poacher and a presbyterian in religion sir geoffrey was a highchurchman of so exalted a strain that many thought he still nourished in private the roman catholic tenets which his family had only renounced in his fathers time and that he had a dispensation for conforming in outward observances to the protestant faith there was at least such a scandal amongst the puritans and the influence which sir geoffrey peveril certainly appeared to possess amongst the catholic gentlemen of derbyshire and cheshire seemed to give countenance to the rumour  such was sir geoffrey who might have passed to his grave without further distinction than a brassplate in the chancel had he not lived in times which forced the most inactive spirits into exertion as a tempest influences the sluggish waters of the deadest mere when the civil wars broke out peveril of the peak proud from pedigree and brave by constitution raised a regiment for the king and showed upon several occasions more capacity for command than men had heretofore given him credit for  even in the midst of the civil turmoil he fell in love with and married a beautiful and amiable young lady of the noble house of stanley and from that time had the more merit in his loyalty as it divorced him from her society unless at very brief intervals when his duty permitted an occasional visit to his home scorning to be allured from his military duty by domestic inducements peveril of the peak fought on for several rough years of civil war and performed his part with sufficient gallantry until his regiment was surprised and cut to pieces by poyntz cromwells enterprising and successful general of cavalry the defeated cavalier escaped from the field of battle and like a true descendant of william the conqueror disdaining submission threw himself into his own castellated mansion which was attacked and defended in a siege of that irregular kind which caused the destruction of so many baronial residences during the course of those unhappy wars martindale castle after having suffered severely from the cannon which cromwell himself brought against it was at length surrendered when in the last extremity sir geoffrey himself became a prisoner and while his liberty was only restored upon a promise of remaining a peaceful subject to the commonwealth in future his former delinquencies as they were termed by the ruling party were severely punished by fine and sequestration  but neither his forced promise nor the fear of farther unpleasant consequences to his person or property could prevent peveril of the peak from joining the gallant earl of derby the night before the fatal engagement in wiggan lane where the earls forces were dispersed sir geoffrey having had his share in that action escaped with the relics of the royalists after the defeat to join charles ii he witnessed also the final defeat of worcester where he was a second time made prisoner and as in the opinion of cromwell and the language of the times he was regarded as an obstinate malignant he was in great danger of having shared with the earl of derby his execution at boltonlemoor having partaken with him the dangers of two actions but sir geoffreys life was preserved by the interest of a friend who possessed influence in the councils of oliverthis was a mr bridgenorth a gentleman of middling quality whose father had been successful in some commercial adventure during the peaceful reign of james i and who had bequeathed his son a considerable sum of money in addition to the moderate patrimony which he inherited from his father  the substantial though smallsized brick building of moultrassie hall was but two miles distant from martindale castle and the young bridgenorth attended the same school with the heir of the peverils a sort of companionship if not intimacy took place betwixt them which continued during their youthful sportsthe rather that bridgenorth though he did not at heart admit sir geoffreys claims of superiority to the extent which the others vanity would have exacted paid deference in a reasonable degree to the representative of a family so much more ancient and important than his own without conceiving that he in any respect degraded himself by doing so  mr bridgenorth did not however carry his complaisance so far as to embrace sir geoffreys side during the civil war on the contrary as an active justice of the peace he rendered much assistance in arraying the militia in the cause of the parliament and for some time held a military commission in that service this was partly owing to his religious principles for he was a zealous presbyterian partly to his political ideas which without being absolutely democratical favoured the popular side of the great national question besides he was a moneyed man and to a certain extent had a shrewd eye to his worldly interest he understood how to improve the opportunities which civil war afforded of advancing his fortune by a dexterous use of his capital and he was not at a loss to perceive that these were likely to be obtained in joining the parliament while the kings cause as it was managed held out nothing to the wealthy but a course of exaction and compulsory loans for these reasons bridgenorth became a decided roundhead and all friendly communication betwixt his neighbour and him was abruptly broken asunder this was done with the less acrimony that during the civil war sir geoffrey was almost constantly in the field following the vacillating and unhappy fortunes of his master while major bridgenorth who soon renounced active military service resided chiefly in london and only occasionally visited the hall  upon these visits it was with great pleasure he received the intelligence that lady peveril had shown much kindness to mrs bridgenorth and had actually given her and her family shelter in martindale castle when moultrassie hall was threatened with pillage by a body of prince ruperts illdisciplined cavaliers this acquaintance had been matured by frequent walks together which the vicinity of their places of residence suffered the lady peveril to have with mrs bridgenorth who deemed herself much honoured in being thus admitted into the society of so distinguished a lady major bridgenorth heard of this growing intimacy with great pleasure and he determined to repay the obligation as far as he could without much hurt to himself by interfering with all his influence in behalf of her unfortunate husband it was chiefly owing to major bridgenorths mediation that sir geoffreys life was saved after the battle of worcester he obtained him permission to compound for his estate on easier terms than many who had been less obstinate in malignancy and finally when in order to raise the money to the composition the knight was obliged to sell a considerable portion of his patrimony major bridgenorth became the purchaser and that at a larger price than had been paid to any cavalier under such circumstances by a member of the committee for sequestrations it is true the prudent committeeman did not by any means lose sight of his own interest in the transaction for the price was after all very moderate and the property lay adjacent to moultrassie hall the value of which was at least trebled by the acquisition but then it was also true that the unfortunate owner must have submitted to much worse conditions had the committeeman used as others did the full advantages which his situation gave him and bridgenorth took credit to himself and received it from others for having on this occasion fairly sacrificed his interest to his liberality  sir geoffrey peveril was of the same opinion and the rather that mr bridgenorth seemed to bear his exaltation with great moderation and was disposed to show him personally the same deference in his present sunshine of prosperity which he had exhibited formerly in their early acquaintance it is but justice to major bridgenorth to observe that in this conduct he paid respect as much to the misfortunes as to the pretensions of his fardescended neighbour and that with the frank generosity of a blunt englishman he conceded points of ceremony about which he himself was indifferent merely because he saw that his doing so gave pleasure to sir geoffrey  peveril of the peak did justice to his neighbours delicacy in consideration of which he forgot many things he forgot that major bridgenorth was already in possession of a fair third of his estate and had various pecuniary claims affecting the remainder to the extent of onethird more he endeavoured even to forget what it was still more difficult not to remember the altered situation in which they and their mansions now stood to each other  before the civil war the superb battlements and turrets of martindale castle looked down on the red brickbuilt hall as it stole out from the green plantations just as an oak in martindale chase would have looked beside one of the stunted and formal young beechtrees with which bridgenorth had graced his avenue but after the siege which we have commemorated the enlarged and augmented hall was as much predominant in the landscape over the shattered and blackened ruins of the castle of which only one wing was left habitable as the youthful beech in all its vigour of shoot and bud would appear to the same aged oak stripped of its boughs and rifted by lightning onehalf laid in shivers on the ground and the other remaining a blackened and ungraceful trunk rent and splintered and without either life or leaves sir geoffrey could not but feel that the situation and prospects were exchanged as disadvantageously for himself as the appearance of their mansions and that though the authority of the man in office under the parliament the sequestrator and the committeeman had been only exerted for the protection of the cavalier and the malignant they would have been as effectual if applied to procure his utter ruin and that he was become a client while his neighbour was elevated into a patron  there were two considerations besides the necessity of the case and the constant advice of his lady which enabled peveril of the peak to endure with some patience this state of degradation the first was that the politics of major bridgenorth began on many points to assimilate themselves to his own as a presbyterian he was not an utter enemy to monarchy and had been considerably shocked at the unexpected trial and execution of the king as a civilian and a man of property he feared the domination of the military and though he wished not to see charles restored by force of arms yet he arrived at the conclusion that to bring back the heir of the royal family on such terms of composition as might ensure the protection of those popular immunities and privileges for which the long parliament had at first contended would be the surest and most desirable termination to the mutations in state affairs which had agitated britain indeed the majors ideas on this point approached so nearly those of his neighbour that he had wellnigh suffered sir geoffrey who had a finger in almost all the conspiracies of the royalists to involve him in the unfortunate rising of penruddock and groves in the west in which many of the presbyterian interest as well as the cavalier party were engaged and though his habitual prudence eventually kept him out of this and other dangers major bridgenorth was considered during the last years of cromwells domination and the interregnum which succeeded as a disaffected person to the commonwealth and a favourer of charles stewart  but besides this approximation to the same political opinions another bond of intimacy united the families of the castle and the hall major bridgenorth fortunate and eminently so in all his worldly transactions was visited by severe and reiterated misfortunes in his family and became in this particular an object of compassion to his poorer and more decayed neighbour betwixt the breaking out of the civil war and the restoration he lost successively a family of no less than six children apparently through a delicacy of constitution which cut off the little prattlers at the early age when they most wind themselves round the heart of the parents  in the beginning of the year 1658 major bridgenorth was childless ere it ended he had a daughter indeed but her birth was purchased by the death of an affectionate wife whose constitution had been exhausted by maternal grief and by the anxious and harrowing reflection that from her the children they had lost derived that delicacy of health which proved unable to undergo the tear and wear of existence the same voice which told bridgenorth that he was the father of a living child it was the friendly voice of lady peveril communicated to him the melancholy intelligence that he was no longer a husband the feelings of major bridgenorth were strong and deep rather than hasty and vehement and his grief assumed the form of a sullen stupor from which neither the friendly remonstrances of sir geoffrey who did not fail to be with his neighbour at this distressing conjuncture even though he knew he must meet the presbyterian pastor nor the ghastly exhortations of this latter person were able to rouse the unfortunate widower  at length lady peveril with the ready invention of a female sharped by the sight of distress and the feelings of sympathy tried on the sufferer one of those experiments by which grief is often awakened from despondency into tears she placed in bridgenorths arms the infant whose birth had cost him so dear and conjured him to remember that his alice was not yet dead since she survived in the helpless child she had left to his paternal care  take her awaytake her away said the unhappy man and they were the first words he had spoken let me not look on herit is but another blossom that has bloomed to fade and the tree that bore it will never flourish more  he almost threw the child into lady peverils arms placed his hands before his face and wept aloud lady peveril did not say be comforted but she ventured to promise that the blossom should ripen to fruit  never never said bridgenorth take the unhappy child away and let me only know when i shall wear black for herwear black he exclaimed interrupting himself what other colour shall i wear during the remainder of my life  i will take the child for a season said lady peveril since the sight of her is so painful to you and the little alice shall share the nursery of our julian until it shall be pleasure and not pain for you to look on her  that hour will never come said the unhappy father her doom is writtenshe will follow the restgods will be donelady i thank youi trust her to your care and i thank god that my eye shall not see her dying agonies  without detaining the readers attention longer on this painful theme it is enough to say that the lady peveril did undertake the duties of a mother to the little orphan and perhaps it was owing in a great measure to her judicious treatment of the infant that its feeble hold of life was preserved since the glimmering spark might probably have been altogether smothered had it like the majors former children undergone the overcare and overnursing of a mother rendered nervously cautious and anxious by so many successive losses the lady was the more ready to undertake this charge that she herself had lost two infant children and that she attributed the preservation of the third now a fine healthy child of three years old to julians being subjected to rather a different course of diet and treatment than was then generally practised she resolved to follow the same regiment with the little orphan which she had observed in the case of her own boy and it was equally successful by a more sparing use of medicine by a bolder admission of fresh air by a firm yet cautious attention to encourage rather than to supersede the exertions of nature the puny infant under the care of an excellent nurse gradually improved in strength and in liveliness  sir geoffrey like most men of his frank and goodnatured disposition was naturally fond of children and so much compassionated the sorrows of his neighbour that he entirely forgot his being a presbyterian until it became necessary that the infant should be christened by a teacher of that persuasion  this was a trying casethe father seemed incapable of giving direction and that the threshold of martindale castle should be violated by the heretical step of a dissenting clergyman was matter of horror to its orthodox owner he had seen the famous hugh peters with a bible in one hand and a pistol in the other ride in triumph through the courtdoor when martindale was surrendered and the bitterness of that hour had entered like iron into his soul yet such was lady peverils influence over the prejudices of her husband that he was induced to connive at the ceremony taking place in a remote garden house which was not properly within the precincts of the castlewall the lady even dared to be present while the ceremony was performed by the reverend master solsgrace who had once preached a sermon of three hours length before the house of commons upon a thanksgiving occasion after the relief of exeter sir geoffrey peveril took care to be absent the whole day from the castle and it was only from the great interest which he took in the washing perfuming and as it were purification of the summerhouse that it could have been guessed he knew anything of what had taken place in it  but whatever prejudices the good knight might entertain against his neighbours form of religion they did not in any way influence his feelings towards him as a sufferer under severe affliction the mode in which he showed his sympathy was rather singular but exactly suited the character of both and the terms on which they stood with each other  morning after morning the good baronet made moultrassie hall the termination of his walk or ride and said a single word of kindness as he passed sometimes he entered the old parlour where the proprietor sat in solitary wretchedness and despondency but more frequently for sir geoffrey did not pretend to great talents of conversation he paused on the terrace and stopping or halting his horse by the latticed window said aloud to the melancholy inmate how is it with you master bridgenorth the knight would never acknowledge his neighbours military rank of major i just looked in to bid you keep a good heart man and to tell you that julian is well and little alice is well and all are well at martindale castle  a deep sigh sometimes coupled with i thank you sir geoffrey my grateful duty waits on lady peveril was generally bridgenorths only answer but the news was received on the one part with the kindness which was designed upon the other it gradually became less painful and more interesting the lattice window was never closed nor was the leathern easychair which stood next to it ever empty when the usual hour of the baronets momentary visit approached at length the expectation of that passing minute became the pivot upon which the thoughts of poor bridgenorth turned during all the rest of the day most men have known the influence of such brief but ruling moments at some period of their lives the moment when a lover passes the window of his mistressthe moment when the epicure hears the dinnerbellis that into which is crowded the whole interest of the day the hours which precede it are spent in anticipation the hours which follow in reflection on what has passed and fancy dwelling on each brief circumstance gives to seconds the duration of minutes to minutes that of hours thus seated in his lonely chair bridgenorth could catch at a distance the stately step of sir geoffrey or the heavy tramp of his warhorse black hastings which had borne him in many an action he could hear the hum of the king shall enjoy his own again or the habitual whistle of cuckolds and roundheads die unto reverential silence as the knight approached the mansion of affliction and then came the strong hale voice of the huntsman soldier with its usual greeting  by degrees the communication became something more protracted as major bridgenorths grief like all human feelings lost its overwhelming violence and permitted him to attend in some degree to what passed around him to discharge various duties which pressed upon him and to give a share of attention to the situation of the country distracted as it was by the contending factions whose strife only terminated in the restoration still however though slowly recovering from the effects of the shock which he had sustained major bridgenorth felt himself as yet unable to make up his mind to the effort necessary to see his infant and though separated by so short a distance from the being in whose existence he was more interested than in anything the world afforded he only made himself acquainted with the windows of the apartment where little alice was lodged and was often observed to watch them from the terrace as they brightened in the evening under the influence of the setting sun in truth though a strongminded man in most respects he was unable to lay aside the gloomy impression that this remaining pledge of affection was soon to be conveyed to that grave which had already devoured all besides that was dear to him and he awaited in miserable suspense the moment when he should hear that symptoms of the fatal malady had begun to show themselves  the voice of peveril continued to be that of a comforter until the month of april 1660 when it suddenly assumed a new and different tone the king shall enjoy his own again far from ceasing as the hasty tread of black hastings came up the avenue bore burden to the clatter of his hoofs on the paved courtyard as sir geoffrey sprang from his great warsaddle now once more garnished with pistols of two feet in length and armed with steelcap back and breast and a truncheon in his hand he rushed into the apartment of the astonished major with his eyes sparkling and his cheek inflamed while he called out up up neighbour no time now to mope in the chimneycorner where is your buffcoat and broadsword man take the true side once in your life and mend past mistakes the king is all lenity manall royal nature and mercy i will get your full pardon  what means all this said bridgenorthis all well with youall well at martindale castle sir geoffrey  well as you could wish them alice and julian and all

buff and bandoleer for king charles i have a letter from fairfax to secure derby and chesterfield with all the men i can make dn him fine that i should take orders from him but never mind thatall are friends now and you and i good neighbour will charge abreast as good neighbours should see there readreadreadand then boot and saddle in an instant   hey for cavaliersho for cavaliers   pray for cavaliers     dubadub dubadub     have at old beelzebub   oliver shakes in his bier  after thundering forth this elegant effusion of loyal enthusiasm the sturdy cavaliers heart became too full he threw himself on a seat and exclaiming did ever i think to live to see this happy day he wept to his own surprise as much as to that of bridgenorth  upon considering the crisis in which the country was placed it appeared to major bridgenorth as it had done to fairfax and other leaders of the presbyterian party that their frank embracing of the royal interest was the wisest and most patriotic measure which they could adopt in the circumstances when all ranks and classes of men were seeking refuge from the uncertainty and varied oppression attending the repeated contests between the factions of westminster hall and of wallingford house accordingly he joined with sir geoffrey with less enthusiasm indeed but with equal sincerity taking such measures as seemed proper to secure their part of the country on the kings behalf which was done as effectually and peaceably as in other parts of england the neighbours were both at chesterfield when news arrived that the king had landed in england and sir geoffrey instantly announced his purpose of waiting upon his majesty even before his return to the castle of martindale  who knows neighbour he said whether sir geoffrey peveril will ever return to martindale titles must be going amongst them yonder and i have deserved something among the restlord peveril would sound wellor stay earl of martindaleno not of martindaleearl of the peakmeanwhile trust your affairs to mei will see you securedi would you had been no presbyterian neighboura knighthoodi mean a knightbachelor not a knightbaronetwould have served your turn well  i leave these things to my betters sir geoffrey said the major and desire nothing so earnestly as to find all well at martindale when i return  you willyou will find them all well said the baronet julian alice lady peveril and all of thembear my commendations to them and kiss them all neighbour lady peveril and allyou may kiss a countess when i come back all will go well with you now you are turned honest man  i always meant to be so sir geoffrey said bridgenorth calmly  well well wellno offence meant said the knight all is well nowso you to moultrassie hall and i to whitehall said i well aha so ho mine host a stoup of canary to the kings health ere we get to horsei forgot neighbouryou drink no healths  i wish the kings health as sincerely as if i drank a gallon to it replied the major and i wish you sir geoffrey all success on your journey and a safe return     chapter ii         why then we will have bellowing of beeves        broaching of barrels brandishing of spigots        blood shall flow freely but it shall be gore        of herds and flocks and venison and poultry        joind to the brave heartsblood of johnabarleycorn                                                 old play  whatever rewards charles might have condescended to bestow in acknowledgement of the sufferings and loyalty of peveril of the peak he had none in his disposal equal to the pleasure which providence had reserved for bridgenorth on his return to derbyshire the exertion to which he had been summoned had had the usual effect of restoring to a certain extent the activity and energy of his character and he felt it would be unbecoming to relapse into the state of lethargic melancholy from which it had roused him time also had its usual effect in mitigating the subjects of his regret and when he had passed one day at the hall in regretting that he could not expect the indirect news of his daughters health which sir geoffrey used to communicate in his almost daily call he reflected that it would be in every respect becoming that he should pay a personal visit at martindale castle carry thither the remembrances of the knight to his lady assure her of his health and satisfy himself respecting that of his daughter he armed himself for the worsthe called to recollection the thin cheeks faded eye wasted hand pallid lip which had marked the decaying health of all his former infants  i shall see he said these signs of mortality once morei shall once more see a beloved being to whom i have given birth gliding to the grave which ought to enclose me long before her no matterit is unmanly so long to shrink from that which must begods will be done  he went accordingly on the subsequent morning to martindale castle and gave the lady the welcome assurances of her husbands safety and of his hopes of preferment  for the first may almighty god be praised said the lady peveril and be the other as our gracious and restored sovereign may will it we are great enough for our means and have means sufficient for contentment though not for splendour and now i see good master bridgenorth the folly of putting faith in idle presentiments of evil so often had sir geoffreys repeated attempts in favour of the stewarts led him into new misfortunes that when the other morning i saw him once more dressed in his fatal armour and heard the sound of his trumpet which had been so long silent it seemed to me as if i saw his shroud and heard his deathknell i say this to you good neighbour the rather because i fear your own mind has been harassed with anticipations of impending calamity which it may please god to avert in your case as it has done in mine and here comes a sight which bears good assurance of it  the door of the apartment opened as she spoke and two lovely children entered the eldest julian peveril a fine boy betwixt four and five years old led in his hand with an air of dignified support and attention a little girl of eighteen months who rolled and tottered along keeping herself with difficulty upright by the assistance of her elder stronger and masculine companion  bridgenorth cast a hasty and fearful glance upon the countenance of his daughter and even in that glimpse perceived with exquisite delight that his fears were unfounded he caught her in his arms pressed her to his heart and the child though at first alarmed at the vehemence of his caresses presently as if prompted by nature smiled in reply to them again he held her at some distance from him and examined her more attentively he satisfied himself that the complexion of the young cherub he had in his arms was not the hectic tinge of disease but the clear hue of ruddy health and that though her little frame was slight it was firm and springy  i did not think that it could have been thus he said looking to lady peveril who had sat observing the scene with great pleasure but praise be to god in the first instance and next thanks to you madam who have been his instrument  julian must lose his playfellow now i suppose said the lady but the hall is not distant and i will see my little charge often dame martha the housekeeper at moultrassie has sense and is careful i will tell her the rules i have observed with little alice and  god forbid my girl should ever come to moultrassie said major bridgenorth hastily it has been the grave of her race the air of the low grounds suited them notor there is perhaps a fate connected with the mansion i will seek for her some other place of abode  that you shall not under your favour be it spoken major bridgenorth answered the lady if you do so we must suppose that you are undervaluing my qualities as a nurse if she goes not to her fathers house she shall not quit mine i will keep the little lady as a pledge of her safety and my own skill and since you are afraid of the damp of the low grounds i hope you will come here frequently to visit her  this was a proposal which went to the heart of major bridgenorth it was precisely the point which he would have given worlds to arrive at but which he saw no chance of attaining  it is too well known that those whose families are long pursued by such a fatal disease as existed in his become it may be said superstitious respecting its fatal effects and ascribe to place circumstance and individual care much more perhaps than these can in any case contribute to avert the fatality of constitutional distemper lady peveril was aware that this was peculiarly the impression of her neighbour that the depression of his spirits the excess of his care the feverishness of his apprehensions the restraint and gloom of the solitude in which he dwelt were really calculated to produce the evil which most of all he dreaded she pitied him she felt for him she was grateful for former protection received at his handsshe had become interested in the child itself what female fails to feel such interest in the helpless creature she has tended and to sum the whole up the dame had a share of human vanity and being a sort of lady bountiful in her way for the character was not then confined to the old and the foolish she was proud of the skill by which she had averted the probable attacks of hereditary malady so inveterate in the family of bridgenorth it needed not perhaps in other cases that so many reasons should be assigned for an act of neighbourly humanity but civil war had so lately torn the country asunder and broken all the usual ties of vicinage and good neighbourhood that it was unusual to see them preserved among persons of different political opinions  major bridgenorth himself felt this and while the tear of joy in his eye showed how gladly he would accept lady peverils proposal he could not help stating the obvious inconveniences attendant upon her scheme though it was in the tone of one who would gladly hear them overruled madam he said your kindness makes me the happiest and most thankful of men but can it be consistent with your own convenience sir geoffrey has his opinions on many points which have differed and probably do still differ from mine he is highborn and i of middling parentage only he uses the church service and i the catechism of the assembly of divines at westminster  i hope you will find prescribed in neither of them said the lady peveril that i may not be a mother to your motherless child i trust master bridgenorth the joyful restoration of his majesty a work wrought by the direct hand of providence may be the means of closing and healing all civil and religious dissensions among us and that instead of showing the superior purity of our faith by persecuting those who think otherwise from ourselves on doctrinal points we shall endeavour to show its real christian tendency by emulating each other in actions of goodwill towards man as the best way of showing our love to god  your ladyship speaks what your own kind heart dictates answered bridgenorth who had his own share of the narrowmindedness of the time and sure am i that if all who call themselves loyalists and cavaliers thought like youand like my friend sir geoffreythis he added after a moments pause being perhaps rather complimentary than sincerewe who thought it our duty in time past to take arms for freedom of conscience and against arbitrary power might now sit down in peace and contentment but i wot not how it may fall you have sharp and hot spirits amongst you i will not say our power was always moderately used and revenge is sweet to the race of fallen adam  come master bridgenorth said the lady peveril gaily those evil omenings do but point out conclusions which unless they were so anticipated are most unlikely to come to pass you know what shakespeare says   to fly the boar before the boar pursues   were to incense the boar to follow us   and make pursuit when he did mean no chase  but i crave your pardonit is so long since we have met that i forgot you love no playbooks  with reverence to your ladyship said bridgenorth i were much to blame did i need the idle words of a warwickshire stroller to teach me my grateful duty to your ladyship on this occasion which appoints me to be directed by you in all things which my conscience will permit  since you permit me such influence then replied the lady peveril i shall be moderate in exercising it in order that i may in my domination at least give you a favourable impression of the new order of things so if you will be a subject of mine for one day neighbour i am going at my lord and husbands command to issue out my warrants to invite the whole neighbourhood to a solemn feast at the castle on thursday next and i not only pray you to be personally present yourself but to prevail on your worthy pastor and such neighbours and friends high and low as may think in your own way to meet with the rest of the neighbourhood to rejoice on this joyful occasion of the kings restoration and thereby to show that we are to be henceforward a united people  the parliamentarian major was considerably embarrassed by this proposal he looked upward and downward and around cast his eye first to the oakcarved ceiling and anon fixed it upon the floor then threw it around the room till it lighted on his child the sight of whom suggested another and a better train of reflections than ceiling and floor had been able to supply  madam he said i have long been a stranger to festivity perhaps from constitutional melancholy perhaps from the depression which is natural to a desolate and deprived man in whose ear mirth is marred like a pleasant air when performed on a mistuned instrument but though neither my thoughts nor temperament are jovial or mercurial it becomes me to be grateful to heaven for the good he has sent me by the means of your ladyship david the man after gods own heart did wash and eat bread when his beloved child was removedmine is restored to me and shall i not show gratitude under a blessing when he showed resignation under an affliction madam i will wait on your gracious invitation with acceptance and such of my friends with whom i may possess influence and whose presence your ladyship may desire shall accompany me to the festivity that our israel may be as one people  having spoken these words with an aspect which belonged more to a martyr than to a guest bidden to a festival and having kissed and solemnly blessed his little girl major bridgenorth took his departure for moultrassie hall     chapter iii              heres neither want of appetite nor mouths             pray heaven we be not scant of meat or mirth                                                 old play  even upon ordinary occasions and where means were ample a great entertainment in those days was not such a sinecure as in modern times when the lady who presides has but to intimate to her menials the day and hour when she wills it to take place at that simple period the lady was expected to enter deeply into the arrangement and provision of the whole affair and from a little gallery which communicated with her own private apartment and looked down upon the kitchen her shrill voice was to be heard from time to time like that of the warning spirit in a tempest rising above the clash of pots and stewpansthe creaking spitsthe clattering of marrowbones and cleaversthe scolding of cooksand all the other various kinds of din which form an accompaniment to dressing a large dinner  but all this toil and anxiety was more than doubled in the case of the approaching feast at martindale castle where the presiding genius of the festivity was scarce provided with adequate means to carry her hospitable purpose into effect the tyrannical conduct of husbands in such cases is universal and i scarce know one householder of my acquaintance who has not on some illomened and most inconvenient season announced suddenly to his innocent helpmate that he had invited   some odious major rock   to drop in at six oclock  to the great discomposure of the lady and the discredit perhaps of her domestic arrangements  peveril of the peak was still more thoughtless for he had directed his lady to invite the whole honest men of the neighbourhood to make good cheer at martindale castle in honour of the blessed restoration of his most sacred majesty without precisely explaining where the provisions were to come from the deerpark had lain waste ever since the siege the dovecot could do little to furnish forth such an entertainment the fishponds it is true were well provided which the neighbouring presbyterians noted as a suspicious circumstance and game was to be had for the shooting upon the extensive heaths and hills of derbyshire but these were but the secondary parts of a banquet and the housesteward and bailiff lady peverils only coadjutors and counsellors could not agree how the butchermeatthe most substantial part or as it were the main body of the entertainmentwas to be supplied the housesteward threatened the sacrifice of a fine yoke of young bullocks which the bailiff who pleaded the necessity of their agricultural services tenaciously resisted and lady peverils good and dutiful nature did not prevent her from making some impatient reflections on the want of consideration of her absent knight who had thus thoughtlessly placed her in so embarrassing a situation  these reflections were scarcely just if a man is only responsible for such resolutions as he adopts when he is fully master of himself sir geoffreys loyalty like that of many persons in his situation had by dint of hopes and fears victories and defeats struggles and sufferings all arising out of the same moving cause and turning as it were on the same pivot acquired the character of an intense and enthusiastic passion and the singular and surprising change of fortune by which his highest wishes were not only gratified but far exceeded occasioned for some time a kind of intoxication of loyal rapture which seemed to pervade the whole kingdom sir geoffrey had seen charles and his brothers and had been received by the merry monarch with that graceful and at the same time frank urbanity by which he conciliated all who approached him the knights services and merits had been fully acknowledged and recompense had been hinted at if not expressly promised was it for peveril of the peak in the jubilee of his spirits to consider how his wife was to find beef and mutton to feast his neighbours  luckily however for the embarrassed lady there existed some one who had composure of mind sufficient to foresee this difficulty just as she had made up her mind very reluctantly to become debtor to major bridgenorth for the sum necessary to carry her husbands commands into effect and whilst she was bitterly regretting this departure from the strictness of her usual economy the steward who bythebye had not been absolutely sober since the news of the kings landing at dover burst into the apartment snapping his fingers and showing more marks of delight than was quite consistent with the dignity of my ladys large parlour  what means this whitaker said the lady somewhat peevishly for she was interrupted in the commencement of a letter to her neighbour on the unpleasant business of the proposed loanis it to be always thus with youare you dreaming  a vision of good omen i trust said the steward with a triumphant flourish of the hand far better than pharaohs though like his it be of fat kine  i prithee be plain man said the lady or fetch some one who can speak to purpose  why oddsmylife madam said the steward mine errand can speak for itself do you not hear them low do you not hear them bleat a yoke of fat oxen and half a score prime wethers the castle is victualled for this bout let them storm when they will and gatherill may have his dd mains ploughed to the boot  the lady without farther questioning her elated domestic rose and went to the window where she certainly beheld the oxen and sheep which had given rise to whitakers exultation whence come they said she in some surprise  let them construe that who can answered whitaker the fellow who drove them was a westcountry man and only said they came from a friend to help to furnish out your ladyships entertainment the man would not stay to drinki am sorry he would not stay to drinki crave your ladyships pardon for not keeping him by the ears to drinkit was not my fault  that ill be sworn it was not said the lady  nay madam by g i assure you it was not said the zealous steward for rather than the castle should lose credit i drank his health myself in double ale though i had had my morning draught already i tell you the naked truth my lady by g  it was no great compulsion i suppose said the lady but whitaker suppose you should show your joy on such occasions by drinking and swearing a little less rather than a little more would it not be as well think you  i crave your ladyships pardon said whitaker with much reverence i hope i know my place i am your ladyships poor servant and i know it does not become me to drink and swear like your ladyshipthat is like his honour sir geoffrey i would say but i pray you if i am not to drink and swear after my degree how are men to know peveril of the peaks stewardand i may say butler too since i have had the keys of the cellar ever since old spigots was shot dead on the northwest turret with a black jack in his handi say how is an old cavalier like me to be known from those cuckoldly roundheads that do nothing but fast and pray if we are not to drink and swear according to our degree  the lady was silent for she well knew speech availed nothing and after a moments pause proceeded to intimate to the steward that she would have the persons whose names were marked in a written paper which she delivered to him invited to the approaching banquet  whitaker instead of receiving the list with the mute acquiescence of a modern major domo carried it into the recess of one of the windows and adjusting his spectacles began to read it to himself the first names being those of distinguished cavalier families in the neighbourhood he muttered over in a tone of approbationpaused and pshawed at that of bridgenorthyet acquiesced with the observation but he is a good neighbour so it may pass for once but when he read the name and surname of nehemiah solsgrace the presbyterian parson whitakers patience altogether forsook him and he declared he would as soon throw himself into eldonhole as consent that the intrusive old puritan howlet who had usurped the pulpit of a sound orthodox divine should ever darken the gates of martindale castle by any message or mediation of his   a chasm in the earth supposed to be unfathomable one of the     wonders of the peak  the false cropeared hypocrites cried he with a hearty oath have had their turn of the good weather the sun is on our side of the hedge now and we will pay off old scores as sure as my name is richard whitaker  you presume on your long services whitaker and on your masters absence or you had not dared to use me thus said the lady  the unwonted agitation of her voice attracted the attention of the refractory steward notwithstanding his present state of elevation but he no sooner saw that her eye glistened and her cheek reddened than his obstinacy was at once subdued  a murrain on me he said but i have made my lady angry in good earnest and that is an unwonted sight for to seei crave your pardon my lady it was not poor dick whitaker disputed your honourable commands but only that second draught of double ale we have put a double stroke of malt to it as your ladyship well knows ever since the happy restoration to be sure i hate a fanatic as i do the cloven foot of satan but then your honourable ladyship hath a right to invite satan himself cloven foot and all to martindale castle and to send me to hells gate with a billet of invitationand so your will shall be done  the invitations were sent round accordingly in all due form and one of the bullocks was sent down to be roasted whole at the marketplace of a little village called martindalemoultrassie which stood considerably to the eastward both of the castle and hall from which it took its double name at about an equal distance from both so that suppose a line drawn from the one manorhouse to the other to be the base of a triangle the village would have occupied the salient angle as the said village since the late transference of a part of peverils property belonged to sir geoffrey and to bridgenorth in nearly equal portions the lady judged it not proper to dispute the right of the latter to add some hogsheads of beer to the popular festivity  in the meanwhile she could not but suspect the major of being the unknown friend who had relieved her from the dilemma arising from the want of provisions and she esteemed herself happy when a visit from him on the day preceding the proposed entertainment gave her as she thought an opportunity of expressing her gratitude     chapter iv            no siri will not pledgeim one of those           who think good wine needs neither bush nor preface           to make it welcome if you doubt my word           fill the quartcup and see if i will choke ont                                                    old play  there was a serious gravity of expression in the disclamation with which major bridgenorth replied to the thanks tendered to him by lady peveril for the supply of provisions which had reached her castle so opportunely he seemed first not to be aware what she alluded to and when she explained the circumstance he protested so seriously that he had no share in the benefit conferred that lady peveril was compelled to believe him the rather that being a man of plain downright character affecting no refined delicacy of sentiment and practising almost a quakerlike sincerity of expression it would have been much contrary to his general character to have made such a disavowal unless it were founded in truth  my present visit to you madam said he had indeed some reference to the festivity of tomorrow lady peveril listened but as her visitor seemed to find some difficulty in expressing himself she was compelled to ask an explanation madam said the major you are not perhaps entirely ignorant that the more tenderconscienced among us have scruples at certain practices so general amongst your people at times of rejoicing that you may be said to insist upon them as articles of faith or at least greatly to resent their omission  i trust master bridgenorth said the lady peveril not fully comprehending the drift of his discourse that we shall as your entertainers carefully avoid all allusions or reproaches founded on past misunderstanding  we would expect no less madam from your candour and courtesy said bridgenorth but i perceive you do not fully understand me to be plain then i allude to the fashion of drinking healths and pledging each other in draughts of strong liquor which most among us consider as a superfluous and sinful provoking of each other to debauchery and the excessive use of strong drink and which besides if derived as learned divines have supposed from the custom of the blinded pagans who made libations and invoked idols when they drank may be justly said to have something in it heathenish and allied to demonworship  the lady had already hastily considered all the topics which were likely to introduce discord into the proposed festivity but this very ridiculous yet fatal discrepancy betwixt the manners of the parties on convivial occasions had entirely escaped her she endeavoured to soothe the objecting party whose brows were knit like one who had fixed an opinion by which he was determined to abide  i grant she said my good neighbour that this custom is at least idle and may be prejudicial if it leads to excess in the use of liquor which is apt enough to take place without such conversation but i think when it hath not this consequence it is a thing indifferent affords a unanimous mode of expressing our good wishes to our friends and our loyal duty to our sovereign and without meaning to put any force upon the inclination of those who believe otherwise i cannot see how i can deny my guests and friends the privilege of drinking a health to the king or to my husband after the old english fashion  my lady said the major if the age of fashion were to command it popery is one of the oldest english fashions that i have heard of but it is our happiness that we are not benighted like our fathers and therefore we must act according to the light that is in us and not after their darkness i had myself the honour to attend the lordkeeper whitelocke when at the table of the chamberlain of the kingdom of sweden he did positively refuse to pledge the health of his queen christina thereby giving great offence and putting in peril the whole purpose of that voyage which it is not to be thought so wise a man would have done but that he held such compliance a thing not merely indifferent but rather sinful and damnable  with all respect to whitelocke said the lady peveril i continue of my own opinion though heaven knows i am no friend to riot or wassail i would fain accommodate myself to your scruples and will discourage all other pledges but surely those of the king and of peveril of the peak may be permitted  i dare not answered bridgenorth lay even the ninetyninth part of a grain of incense upon an altar erected to satan  how sir said the lady do you bring satan into comparison with our master king charles and with my noble lord and husband  pardon me madam answered bridgenorth i have no such thoughtsindeed they would ill become me i do wish the kings health and sir geoffreys devoutly and i will pray for both but i see not what good it should do their health if i should prejudice my own by quaffing pledges out of quart flagons  since we cannot agree upon this matter said lady peveril we must find some resource by which to offend those of neither party suppose you winked at our friends drinking these pledges and we should connive at your sitting still  but neither would this composition satisfy bridgenorth who was of opinion as he expressed himself that it would be holding a candle to beelzebub in fact his temper naturally stubborn was at present rendered much more so by a previous conference with his preacher who though a very good man in the main was particularly and illiberally tenacious of the petty distinctions which his sect adopted and while he thought with considerable apprehension on the accession of power which popery prelacy and peveril of the peak were like to acquire by the late revolution became naturally anxious to put his flock on their guard and prevent their being kidnapped by the wolf he disliked extremely that major bridgenorth indisputably the head of the presbyterian interest in that neighbourhood should have given his only daughter to be as he termed it nursed by a canaanitish woman and he told him plainly that he liked not this going to feast in the high places with the uncircumcised in heart and looked on the whole conviviality only as a makingmerry in the house of tirzah  upon receiving this rebuke from his pastor bridgenorth began to suspect he might have been partly wrong in the readiness which in his first ardour of gratitude he had shown to enter into intimate intercourse with the castle of martindale but he was too proud to avow this to the preacher and it was not till after a considerable debate betwixt them that it was mutually agreed their presence at the entertainment should depend upon the condition that no healths or pledges should be given in their presence bridgenorth therefore as the delegate and representative of his party was bound to stand firm against all entreaty and the lady became greatly embarrassed she now regretted sincerely that her wellintended invitation had ever been given for she foresaw that its rejection was to awaken all former subjects of quarrel and perhaps to lead to new violences amongst people who had not many years since been engaged in civil war to yield up the disputed point to the presbyterians would have been to offend the cavalier party and sir geoffrey in particular in the most mortal degree for they made it as firm a point of honour to give healths and compel others to pledge them as the puritans made it a deep article of religion to refuse both at length the lady changed the discourse introduced that of major bridgenorths child caused it to be sent for and put into his arms the mothers stratagem took effect for though the parliamentary major stood firm the father as in the case of the governor of tilbury was softened and he agreed that his friends should accept a compromise this was that the major himself the reverend divine and such of their friends as held strict puritan tenets should form a separate party in the large parlour while the hall should be occupied by the jovial cavaliers and that each party should regulate their potations after their own conscience or after their own fashion  major bridgenorth himself seemed greatly relieved after this important matter had been settled he had held it matter of conscience to be stubborn in maintaining his own opinion but was heartily glad when he escaped from the apparently inevitable necessity of affronting lady peveril by the refusal of her invitation he remained longer than usual and spoke and smiled more than was his custom his first care on his return was to announce to the clergyman and his congregation the compromise which he had made and this not as a matter for deliberation but one upon which he had already resolved and such was his authority among them that though the preacher longed to pronounce a separation of the parties and to exclaimto your tents o israel he did not see the chance of being seconded by so many as would make it worth while to disturb the unanimous acquiescence in their delegates proposal  nevertheless each party being put upon the alert by the consequences of major bridgenorths embassy so many points of doubt and delicate discussion were started in succession that the lady peveril the only person perhaps who was desirous of achieving an effectual reconciliation between them incurred in reward for her good intentions the censure of both factions and had much reason to regret her wellmeant project of bringing the capulets and montagues of derbyshire together on the same occasion of public festivity  as it was now settled that the guests were to form two different parties it became not only a subject of dispute betwixt themselves which should be first admitted within the castle of martindale but matter of serious apprehension to lady peveril and major bridgenorth lest if they were to approach by the same avenue and entrance a quarrel might take place betwixt them and proceed to extremities even before they reached the place of entertainment the lady believed she had discovered an admirable expedient for preventing the possibility of such interference by directing that the cavaliers should be admitted by the principal entrance while the roundheads should enter the castle through a great breach which had been made in the course of the siege and across which there had been made a sort of bypath to drive the cattle down to their pasture in the wood by this contrivance the lady peveril imagined she had altogether avoided the various risks which might occur from two such parties encountering each other and disputing for precedence several other circumstances of less importance were adjusted at the same time and apparently so much to the satisfaction of the presbyterian teacher that in a long lecture on the subject of the marriage garment he was at the pains to explain to his hearers that outward apparel was not alone meant by that scriptural expression but also a suitable frame of mind for enjoyment of peaceful festivity and therefore he exhorted the brethren that whatever might be the errors of the poor blinded malignants with whom they were in some sort to eat and drink upon the morrow they ought not on this occasion to show any evil will against them lest they should therein become troublers of the peace of israel  honest doctor dummerar the elected episcopal vicar of martindale cum moultrassie preached to the cavaliers on the same subject he had served the cure before the breaking out of the rebellion and was in high favour with sir geoffrey not merely on account of his sound orthodoxy and deep learning but his exquisite skill in playing at bowls and his facetious conversation over a pipe and tankard of october for these latter accomplishments the doctor had the honour to be recorded by old century white amongst the roll of lewd incompetent profligate clergymen of the church of england whom he denounced to god and man on account chiefly of the heinous sin of playing at games of skill and chance and of occasionally joining in the social meetings of their parishioners when the kings party began to lose ground doctor dummerar left his vicarage and betaking himself to the camp showed upon several occasions when acting as chaplain to sir geoffrey peverils regiment that his portly bodily presence included a stout and masculine heart when all was lost and he himself with most other loyal divines was deprived of his living he made such shift as he could now lurking in the garrets of old friends in the university who shared with him and such as him the slender means of livelihood which the evil times had left them and now lying hid in the houses of the oppressed and sequestered gentry who respected at once his character and sufferings when the restoration took place doctor dummerar emerged from some one of his hidingplaces and hied him to martindale castle to enjoy the triumph inseparable from this happy change  his appearance at the castle in his full clerical dress and the warm reception which he received from the neighbouring gentry added not a little to the alarm which was gradually extending itself through the party which were so lately the uppermost it is true doctor dummerar framed honest worthy man no extravagant views of elevation or preferment but the probability of his being replaced in the living from which he had been expelled under very flimsy pretences inferred a severe blow to the presbyterian divine who could not be considered otherwise than as an intruder the interest of the two preachers therefore as well as the sentiments of their flocks were at direct variance and here was another fatal objection in the way of lady peverils scheme of a general and comprehensive healing ordinance  nevertheless as we have already hinted doctor dummerar behaved as handsomely upon the occasion as the presbyterian incumbent had done it is true that in a sermon which he preached in the castle hall to several of the most distinguished cavalier families besides a world of boys from the village who went to see the novel circumstance of a parson in a cassock and surplice he went at great length into the foulness of the various crimes committed by the rebellious party during the late evil times and greatly magnified the merciful and peaceful nature of the honourable lady of the manor who condescended to look upon or receive into her house in the way of friendship and hospitality men holding the principles which had led to the murder of the kingthe slaying and despoiling his loyal subjectsand the plundering and breaking down of the church of god but then he wiped all this handsomely up again with the observation that since it was the will of their gracious and newlyrestored sovereign and the pleasure of the worshipful lady peveril that this contumacious and rebellious race should be for a time forborne by their faithful subjects it would be highly proper that all the loyal liegemen should for the present eschew subjects of dissension or quarrel with these sons of shimei which lesson of patience he enforced by the comfortable assurance that they could not long abstain from their old rebellious practices in which case the royalists would stand exculpated before god and man in extirpating them from the face of the earth  the close observers of the remarkable passages of the times from which we draw the events of our history have left it upon record that these two several sermons much contrary doubtless to the intention of the worthy divines by whom they were delivered had a greater effect in exasperating than in composing the disputes betwixt the two factions under such evil auspices and with corresponding forebodings on the mind of lady peveril the day of festivity at length arrived  by different routes and forming each a sort of procession as if the adherents of each party were desirous of exhibiting its strength and numbers the two several factions approached martindale castle and so distinct did they appear in dress aspect and manners that it seemed as if the revellers of a bridal party and the sad attendants upon a funeral solemnity were moving towards the same point from different quarters  the puritanical party was by far the fewer in numbers for which two excellent reasons might be given in the first place they had enjoyed power for several years and of course became unpopular among the common people never at any time attached to those who being in the immediate possession of authority are often obliged to employ it in controlling their humours besides the country people of england had and still have an animated attachment to field sports and a natural unrestrained joviality of disposition which rendered them impatient under the severe discipline of the fanatical preachers while they were not less naturally discontented with the military despotism of cromwells majorgenerals secondly the people were fickle as usual and the return of the king had novelty in it and was therefore popular the side of the puritans was also deserted at this period by a numerous class of more thinking and prudential persons who never forsook them till they became unfortunate these sagacious personages were called in that age the waiters upon providence and deemed it a high delinquency towards heaven if they afforded countenance to any cause longer than it was favoured by fortune  but though thus forsaken by the fickle and the selfish a solemn enthusiasm a stern and determined depth of principle a confidence in the sincerity of their own motives and the manly english pride which inclined them to cling to their former opinions like the traveller in the fable to his cloak the more strongly that the tempest blew around them detained in the ranks of the puritans many who if no longer formidable from numbers were still so from their character they consisted chiefly of the middling gentry with others whom industry or successful speculations in commerce or in mining had raised into eminencethe persons who feel most umbrage from the overshadowing aristocracy and are usually the most vehement in defence of what they hold to be their rights their dress was in general studiously simple and unostentatious or only remarkable by the contradictory affectation of extreme simplicity or carelessness the dark colour of their cloaks varying from absolute black to what was called sadcolouredtheir steeplecrowned hats with their broad shadowy brimstheir long swords suspended by a simple strap around the loins without shoulderbelt swordknot plate buckles or any of the other decorations with which the cavaliers loved to adorn their trusty rapiersthe shortness of their hair which made their ears appear of disproportioned sizeabove all the stern and gloomy gravity of their looks announced their belonging to that class of enthusiasts who resolute and undismayed had cast down the former fabric of government and who now regarded with somewhat more than suspicion that which had been so unexpectedly substituted in its stead there was gloom in their countenances but it was not that of dejection far less of despair they looked like veterans after a defeat which may have checked their career and wounded their pride but has left their courage undiminished  the melancholy now become habitual which overcast major bridgenorths countenance well qualified him to act as the chief of the group who now advanced from the village when they reached the point by which they were first to turn aside into the wood which surrounded the castle they felt a momentary impression of degradation as if they were yielding the high road to their old and oftdefeated enemies the cavaliers when they began to ascend the winding path which had been the daily passage of the cattle the opening of the wooded glade gave them a view of the castle ditch half choked with the rubbish of the breach and of the breach itself which was made at the angle of a large square flankingtower onehalf of which had been battered into ruins while the other fragment remained in a state strangely shattered and precarious and seemed to be tottering above the huge aperture in the wall a stern still smile was exchanged among the puritans as the sight reminded them of the victories of former days holdfast clegg a millwright of derby who had been himself active at the siege pointed to the breach and said with a grim smile to mr solsgrace i little thought that when my own hand helped to level the cannon which oliver pointed against yon tower we should have been obliged to climb like foxes up the very walls which we won by our bow and by our spear methought these malignants had then enough of shutting their gates and making high their horn against us  be patient my brother said solsgrace be patient and let not thy soul be disquieted we enter not this high place dishonourably seeing we ascend by the gate which the lord opened to the godly  the words of the pastor were like a spark to gunpowder the countenances of the mournful retinue suddenly expanded and accepting what had fallen from him as an omen and a light from heaven how they were to interpret their present situation they uplifted with one consent one of the triumphant songs in which the israelites celebrated the victories which had been vouchsafed to them over the heathen inhabitants of the promised land   let god arise and then his foes     shall turn themselves to flight   his enemies for fear shall run     and scatter out of sight    and as wax melts before the fire     and wind blows smoke away   so in the presence of the lord     the wicked shall decay    gods army twenty thousand is     of angels bright and strong   the lord also in sinai     is present them among    thou didst o lord ascend on high     and captive ledst them all   who in times past thy chosen flock     in bondage did enthral  these sounds of devotional triumph reached the joyous band of the cavaliers who decked in whatever pomp their repeated misfortunes and impoverishment had left them were moving towards the same point though by a different road and were filling the principal avenue to the castle with tiptoe mirth and revelry the two parties were strongly contrasted for during that period of civil dissension the manners of the different factions distinguished them as completely as separate uniforms might have done if the puritan was affectedly plain in his dress and ridiculously precise in his manners the cavalier often carried his love of ornament into tawdry finery and his contempt of hypocrisy into licentious profligacy gay gallant fellows young and old thronged together towards the ancient castle with general and joyous manifestation of those spirits which as they had been buoyant enough to support their owners during the worst of times as they termed olivers usurpation were now so inflated as to transport them nearly beyond the reach of sober reason feathers waved lace glittered spears jingled steeds caracoled and here and there a petronel or pistol was fired off by some one who found his own natural talents for making a noise inadequate to the dignity of the occasion boysfor as we said before the rabble were with the uppermost party as usualhallood and whooped down with the rump and fie upon oliver musical instruments of as many different fashions as were then in use played all at once and without any regard to each others tune and the glee of the occasion while it reconciled the pride of the highborn of the party to fraternise with the general rout derived an additional zest from the conscious triumph that their exultation was heard by their neighbours the crestfallen roundheads  when the loud and sonorous swell of the psalmtune multiplied by all the echoes of the cliffs and ruinous halls came full upon their ear as if to warn them how little they were to reckon upon the depression of their adversaries at first it was answered with a scornful laugh raised to as much height as the scoffers lungs would permit in order that it might carry to the psalmodists the contempt of their auditors but this was a forced exertion of party spleen there is something in melancholy feelings more natural to an imperfect and suffering state than in those of gaiety and when they are brought into collision the former seldom fail to triumph if a funeraltrain and weddingprocession were to meet unexpectedly it will readily be allowed that the mirth of the last would be speedily merged in the gloom of the others but the cavaliers moreover had sympathies of a different kind the psalmtune which now came rolling on their ear had been heard too often and upon too many occasions had preceded victory gained over the malignants to permit them even in their triumph to hear it without emotion there was a sort of pause of which the party themselves seemed rather ashamed until the silence was broken by the stout old knight sir jasper cranbourne whose gallantry was so universally acknowledged that he could afford if we may use such an expression to confess emotions which men whose courage was in any respect liable to suspicion would have thought it imprudent to acknowledge  adad said the old knight may i never taste claret again if that is not the very tune with which the prickeared villains began their onset at wiggan lane where they trowled us down like so many ninepins faith neighbours to say truth and shame the devil i did not like the sound of it above half  if i thought the roundheaded rogues did it in scorn of us said dick wildblood of the dale i would cudgel their psalmody out of their peasantly throats with this very truncheon a motion which being seconded by old roger raine the drunken tapster of the peveril arms in the village might have brought on a general battle but that sir jasper forbade the feud  well have no ranting dick said the old knight to the young franklin adad man well have none for three reasons first because it would be ungentle to lady peveril then because it is against the kings peace and lastly dick because if we did set on the psalmsinging knaves thou mightest come by the worst my boy as has chanced to thee before  who i sir jasper answered dicki come by the worstill be dd if it ever happened but in that accursed lane where we had no more flank front or rear than if we had been so many herrings in a barrel  that was the reason i fancy answered sir jasper that you to mend the matter scrambled into the hedge and stuck there horse and man till i beat thee through it with my leadingstaff and then instead of charging to the front you went rightabout and away as fast as your feet would carry you  this reminiscence produced a laugh at dicks expense who was known or at least suspected to have more tongue in his head than mettle in his bosom and this sort of rallying on the part of the knight having fortunately abated the resentment which had begun to awaken in the breasts of the royalist cavalcade farther cause for offence was removed by the sudden ceasing of the sounds which they had been disposed to interpret into those of premeditated insult  this was owing to the arrival of the puritans at the bottom of the large and wide breach which had been formerly made in the wall of the castle by their victorious cannon the sight of its gaping heaps of rubbish and disjointed masses of building up which slowly winded a narrow and steep path such as is made amongst ancient ruins by the rare passage of those who occasionally visit them was calculated when contrasted with the grey and solid massiveness of the towers and curtains which yet stood uninjured to remind them of their victory over the stronghold of their enemies and how they had bound nobles and princes with fetters of iron  but feelings more suitable to the purpose of their visit to martindale castle were awakened in the bosoms even of these stern sectaries when the lady of the castle still in the very prime of beauty and of womanhood appeared at the top of the breach with her principal female attendants to receive her guests with the honour and courtesy becoming her invitation she had laid aside the black dress which had been her sole attire for several years and was arrayed with a splendour not unbecoming her high descent and quality jewels indeed she had none but her long and dark hair was surmounted with a chaplet made of oak leaves interspersed with lilies the former being the emblem of the kings preservation in the royal oak and the latter of his happy restoration what rendered her presence still more interesting to those who looked on her was the presence of the two children whom she held in either hand one of whom was well known to them all to be the child of their leader major bridgenorth who had been restored to life and health by the almost maternal care of the lady peveril  if even the inferior persons of the party felt the healing influence of her presence thus accompanied poor bridgenorth was almost overwhelmed with it the strictness of his cast and manners permitted him not to sink on his knee and kiss the hand which held his little orphan but the deepness of his obeisancethe faltering tremor of his voiceand the glistening of his eye showed a grateful respect for the lady whom he addressed deeper and more reverential than could have been expressed even by persian prostration a few courteous and mild words expressive of the pleasure she found in once more seeing her neighbours as her friendsa few kind inquiries addressed to the principal individuals among her guests concerning their families and connections completed her triumph over angry thoughts and dangerous recollections and disposed mens bosoms to sympathise with the purposes of the meeting  even solsgrace himself although imagining himself bound by his office and duty to watch over and counteract the wiles of the amalekitish woman did not escape the sympathetic infection being so much struck with the marks of peace and goodwill exhibited by lady peveril that he immediately raised the psalm   o what a happy thing it is     and joyful for to see   brethren to dwell together in     friendship and unity  accepting this salutation as a mark of courtesy repaid the lady peveril marshalled in person this party of her guests to the apartment where ample good cheer was provided for them and had even the patience to remain while master nehemiah solsgrace pronounced a benediction of portentous length as an introduction to the banquet her presence was in some measure a restraint on the worthy divine whose prolusion lasted the longer and was the more intricate and embarrassed that he felt himself debarred from rounding it off by his usual alliterative petition for deliverance from popery prelacy and peveril of the peak which had become so habitual to him that after various attempts to conclude with some other form of words he found himself at last obliged to pronounce the first words of his usual formula aloud and mutter the rest in such a manner as not to be intelligible even by those who stood nearest to him  the ministers silence was followed by all the various sounds which announce the onset of a hungry company on a wellfurnished table and at the same time gave the lady an opportunity to leave the apartment and look to the accommodation of her other company she felt indeed that it was high time to do so and that the royalist guests might be disposed to misapprehend or even to resent the prior attentions which she had thought it prudent to offer to the puritans  these apprehensions were not altogether illfounded it was in vain that the steward had displayed the royal standard with its proud motto of tandem triumphans on one of the great towers which flanked the main entrance of the castle while from the other floated the banner of peveril of the peak under which many of those who now approached had fought during all the vicissitudes of civil war it was in vain he repeated his clamorous welcome noble cavaliers welcome generous gentlemen there was a slight murmur amongst them that their welcome ought to have come from the mouth of the colonels ladynot from that of a menial sir jasper cranbourne who had sense as well as spirit and courage and who was aware of his fair cousins motives having been indeed consulted by her upon all the arrangements which she had adopted saw matters were in such a state that no time ought to be lost in conducting the guests to the banqueting apartment where a fortunate diversion from all these topics of rising discontent might be made at the expense of the good cheer of all sorts which the ladys care had so liberally provided  the stratagem of the old soldier succeeded in its utmost extent he assumed the great oakenchair usually occupied by the steward at his audits and dr dummerar having pronounced a brief latin benediction which was not the less esteemed by the hearers that none of them understood it sir jasper exhorted the company to wet their appetites to the dinner by a brimming cup to his majestys health filled as high and as deep as their goblets would permit in a moment all was bustle with the clank of winecups and of flagons in another moment the guests were on their feet like so many statues all hushed as death but with eyes glancing with expectation and hands outstretched which displayed their loyal brimmers the voice of sir jasper clear sonorous and emphatic as the sound of his wartrumpet announced the health of the restored monarch hastily echoed back by the assemblage impatient to render it due homage another brief pause was filled by the draining of their cups and the mustering breath to join in a shout so loud that not only the rafters of the old hall trembled while they echoed it back but the garlands of oaken boughs and flowers with which they were decorated waved wildly and rustled as if agitated by a sudden whirlwind this rite observed the company proceeded to assail the good cheer with which the table groaned animated as they were to the attack both by mirth and melody for they were attended by all the minstrels of the district who like the episcopal clergy had been put to silence during the reign of the selfentitled saints of the commonwealth the social occupation of good eating and drinking the exchange of pledges betwixt old neighbours who had been fellowsoldiers in the moment of resistancefellowsufferers in the time of depression and subjugation and were now partners in the same general subject of congratulation soon wiped from their memory the trifling cause of complaint which in the minds of some had darkened the festivity of the day so that when the lady peveril walked into the hall accompanied as before with the children and her female attendants she was welcomed with the acclamations due to the mistress of the banquet and of the castlethe dame of the noble knight who had led most of them to battle with an undaunted and persevering valour which was worthy of better success  her address to them was brief and matronly yet spoken with so much feeling as found its way to every bosom she apologised for the lateness of her personal welcome by reminding them that there were then present in martindale castle that day persons whom recent happy events had converted from enemies into friends but on whom the latter character was so recently imposed that she dared not neglect with them any point of ceremonial but those whom she now addressed were the best the dearest the most faithful friends of her husbands house to whom and to their valour peveril had not only owed those successes which had given them and him fame during the late unhappy times but to whose courage she in particular had owed the preservation of their leaders life even when it could not avert defeat a word or two of heartfelt authority completed all which she had boldness to add and bowing gracefully round her she lifted a cup to her lips as if to welcome her guests  there still remained and especially amongst the old cavaliers of the period some glimmering of that spirit which inspired froissart when he declares that a knight hath double courage at need when animated by the looks and words of a beautiful and virtuous woman it was not until the reign which was commencing at the moment we are treating of that the unbounded licence of the age introducing a general course of profligacy degraded the female sex into mere servants of pleasure and in so doing deprived society of that noble tone of feeling towards the sex which considered as a spur to raise the clear spirit is superior to every other impulse save those of religion and of patriotism the beams of the ancient hall of martindale castle instantly rang with a shout louder and shriller than that at which they had so lately trembled and the names of the knight of the peak and his lady were proclaimed amid waving of caps and hats and universal wishes for their health and happiness  under these auspices the lady peveril glided from the hall and left free space for the revelry of the evening  that of the cavaliers may be easily conceived since it had the usual accompaniments of singing jesting quaffing of healths and playing of tunes which have in almost every age and quarter of the world been the accompaniments of festive cheer the enjoyments of the puritans were of a different and less noisy character they neither sung jested heard music nor drank healths and yet they seemed not the less in their own phrase to enjoy the creaturecomforts which the frailty of humanity rendered grateful to their outward man old whitaker even protested that though much the smaller party in point of numbers they discussed nearly as much sack and claret as his own more jovial associates but those who considered the stewards prejudices were inclined to think that in order to produce such a result he must have thrown in his own bydrinkingsno inconsiderable itemto the sum total of the presbyterian potations  without adopting such a partial and scandalous report we shall only say that on this occasion as on most others the rareness of indulgence promoted the sense of enjoyment and that those who made abstinence or at least moderation a point of religious principle enjoyed their social meeting the better that such opportunities rarely presented themselves if they did not actually drink each others healths they at least showed by looking and nodding to each other as they raised their glasses that they all were sharing the same festive gratification of the appetite and felt it enhanced because it was at the same time enjoyed by their friends and neighbours religion as it was the principal topic of their thoughts became also the chief subject of their conversation and as they sat together in small separate knots they discussed doctrinal and metaphysical points of belief balanced the merits of various preachers compared the creeds of contending sects and fortified by scriptural quotations those which they favoured some contests arose in the course of these debates which might have proceeded farther than was seemly but for the cautious interference of major bridgenorth he suppressed also in the very bud a dispute betwixt gaffer hodgeson of charnelycot and the reverend mr solsgrace upon the tender subject of laypreaching and layministering nor did he think it altogether prudent or decent to indulge the wishes of some of the warmer enthusiasts of the party who felt disposed to make the rest partakers of their gifts in extemporaneous prayer and exposition these were absurdities that belonged to the time which however the major had sense enough to perceive were unfitted whether the offspring of hypocrisy or enthusiasm for the present time and place  the major was also instrumental in breaking up the party at an early and decorous hour so that they left the castle long before their rivals the cavaliers had reached the springtide of their merriment an arrangement which afforded the greatest satisfaction to the lady who dreaded the consequences which might not improbably have taken place had both parties met at the same period and point of retreat  it was near midnight ere the greater part of the cavaliers meaning such as were able to effect their departure without assistance withdrew to the village of martindale moultrassie with the benefit of the broad moon to prevent the chance of accidents their shouts and the burden of their roaring chorus of   the king shall enjoy his own again  were heard with no small pleasure by the lady heartily glad that the riot of the day was over without the occurrence of any unpleasing accident the rejoicing was not however entirely ended for the elevated cavaliers finding some of the villagers still on foot around a bonfire on the street struck merrily in with themsent to roger raine of the peveril arms the loyal publican whom we have already mentioned for two tubs of merry stingo as it was termed and lent their own powerful assistance at the dusting it off to the health of the king and the loyal general monk their shouts for a long time disturbed and even alarmed the little village but no enthusiasm is able to withstand for ever the natural consequences of late hours and potations pottledeep the tumult of the exulting royalists at last sunk into silence and the moon and the owl were left in undisturbed sovereignty over the old tower of the village church which rising white above a circle of knotty oaks was tenanted by the bird and silvered by the planet     chapter v               twas when they raised mid sap and siege              the banners of their rightful liege                at their shecaptains call              who miracle of womankind              lent mettle to the meanest hind                that mannd her castle wall                                            william s rose  on the morning succeeding the feast the lady peveril fatigued with the exertions and the apprehensions of the former day kept her apartment for two or three hours later than her own active habits and the matutinal custom of the time rendered usual meanwhile mistress ellesmere a person of great trust in the family and who assumed much authority in her mistresss absence laid her orders upon deborah the governante immediately to carry the children to their airing in the park and not to let any one enter the gilded chamber which was usually their sportingplace deborah who often rebelled and sometimes successfully against the deputed authority of ellesmere privately resolved that it was about to rain and that the gilded chamber was a more suitable place for the childrens exercise than the wet grass of the park on a raw morning  but a womans brain is sometimes as inconstant as a popular assembly and presently after she had voted the morning was like to be rainy and that the gilded chamber was the fittest playroom for the children mistress deborah came to the somewhat inconsistent resolution that the park was the fittest place for her own morning walk it is certain that during the unrestrained joviality of the preceding evening she had danced till midnight with lance outram the parkkeeper but how far the seeing him just pass the window in his woodland trim with a feather in his hat and a crossbow under his arm influenced the discrepancy of the opinions mistress deborah formed concerning the weather we are far from presuming to guess it is enough for us that so soon as mistress ellesmeres back was turned mistress deborah carried the children into the gilded chamber not without a strict charge for we must do her justice to master julian to take care of his little wife mistress alice and then having taken so satisfactory a precaution she herself glided into the park by the glassdoor of the stillroom which was nearly opposite to the great breach  the gilded chamber in which the children were by this arrangement left to amuse themselves without better guardianship than what julians manhood afforded was a large apartment hung with stamped spanish leather curiously gilded representing in a manner now obsolete but far from unpleasing a series of tilts and combats betwixt the saracens of grenada and the spaniards under the command of king ferdinand and queen isabella during that memorable siege which was terminated by the overthrow of the last fragments of the moorish empire in spain  the little julian was careering about the room for the amusement of his infant friend as well as his own mimicking with a reed the menacing attitude of the abencerrages and zegris engaged in the eastern sport of hurling the jerid or javelin and at times sitting down beside her and caressing her into silence and good humour when the petulant or timid child chose to become tired of remaining an inactive spectator of his boisterous sport when on a sudden he observed one of the panelled compartments of the leather hangings slide apart so as to show a fair hand with its fingers resting upon its edge prepared it would seem to push it still farther back julian was much surprised and somewhat frightened at what he witnessed for the tales of the nursery had strongly impressed on his mind the terrors of the invisible world yet naturally bold and highspirited the little champion placed himself beside his defenceless sister continuing to brandish his weapon in her defence as boldly as he had himself been an abencerrage of grenada  the panel on which his eye was fixed gradually continued to slide back and display more and more the form to which the hand appertained until in the dark aperture which was disclosed the children saw the figure of a lady in a mourning dress past the meridian of life but whose countenance still retained traces of great beauty although the predominant character both of her features and person was an air of almost royal dignity after pausing a moment on the threshold of the portal which she had thus unexpectedly disclosed and looking with some surprise at the children whom she had not probably observed while engaged with the management of the panel the stranger stepped into the apartment and the panel upon a touch of a spring closed behind her so suddenly that julian almost doubted it had ever been open and began to apprehend that the whole apparition had been a delusion  the stately lady however advanced to him and said are not you the little peveril  yes said the boy reddening not altogether without a juvenile feeling of that rule of chivalry which forbade any one to disown his name whatever danger might be annexed to the avowal of it  then said the stately stranger go to your mothers room and tell her to come instantly to speak with me  i wonot said the little julian  how said the ladyso young and so disobedientbut you do but follow the fashion of the time why will you not go my pretty boy when i ask it of you as a favour  i would go madam said the boy butand he stopped short still drawing back as the lady advanced on him but still holding by the hand alice bridgenorth who too young to understand the nature of the dialogue clung trembling to her companion  the stranger saw his embarrassment smiled and remained standing fast while she asked the child once more what are you afraid of my brave boyand why should you not go to your mother on my errand  because answered julian firmly if i go little alice must stay alone with you  you are a gallant fellow said the lady and will not disgrace your blood which never left the weak without protection  the boy understood her not and still gazed with anxious apprehension first on her who addressed him and then upon his little companion whose eyes with the vacant glance of infancy wandered from the figure of the lady to that of her companion and protector and at length infected by a portion of the fear which the latters magnanimous efforts could not entirely conceal she flew into julians arms and clinging to him greatly augmented his alarm and by screaming aloud rendered it very difficult for him to avoid the sympathetic fear which impelled him to do the same  there was something in the manner and bearing of this unexpected inmate which might justify awe at least if not fear when joined to the singular and mysterious mode in which she had made her appearance her dress was not remarkable being the hood and female riding attire of the time such as was worn by the inferior class of gentlewomen but her black hair was very long and several locks having escaped from under her hood hung down dishevelled on her neck and shoulders her eyes were deep black keen and piercing and her features had something of a foreign expression when she spoke her language was marked by a slight foreign accent although in construction it was pure english her slightest tone and gesture had the air of one accustomed to command and to be obeyed the recollection of which probably suggested to julian the apology he afterwards made for being frightened that he took the stranger for an enchanted queen  while the stranger lady and the children thus confronted each other two persons entered almost at the same instant but from different doors whose haste showed that they had been alarmed by the screams of the latter  the first was major bridgenorth whose ears had been alarmed with the cries of his child as he entered the hall which corresponded with what was called the gilded chamber his intention had been to remain in the more public apartment until the lady peveril should make her appearance with the goodnatured purpose of assuring her that the preceding day of tumult had passed in every respect agreeably to his friends and without any of those alarming consequences which might have been apprehended from a collision betwixt the parties but when it is considered how severely he had been agitated by apprehensions for his childs safety and health too well justified by the fate of those who had preceded her it will not be thought surprising that the infantine screams of alice induced him to break through the barriers of form and intrude farther into the interior of the house than a sense of strict propriety might have warranted  he burst into the gilded chamber therefore by a sidedoor and narrow passage which communicated betwixt that apartment and the hall and snatching the child up in his arms endeavoured by a thousand caresses to stifle the screams which burst yet more violently from the little girl on beholding herself in the arms of one to whose voice and manner she was but for one brief interview an entire stranger  of course alices shrieks were redoubled and seconded by those of julian peveril who on the appearance of this second intruder was frightened into resignation of every more manly idea of rescue than that which consisted in invoking assistance at the very top of his lungs  alarmed by this noise which in half a minute became very clamorous lady peveril with whose apartment the gilded chamber was connected by a private door of communication opening into her wardrobe entered on the scene the instant she appeared the little alice extricating herself from the grasp of her father ran towards her protectress and when she had once taken hold of her skirts not only became silent but turned her large blue eyes in which the tears were still glistening with a look of wonder rather than alarm towards the strange lady julian manfully brandished his reed a weapon which he had never parted with during the whole alarm and stood prepared to assist his mother if there should be danger in the encounter betwixt her and the stranger  in fact it might have puzzled an older person to account for the sudden and confused pause which the lady peveril made as she gazed on her unexpected guest as if dubious whether she did or did not recognise in her still beautiful though wasted and emaciated features a countenance which she had known well under far different circumstances  the stranger seemed to understand the cause of hesitation for she said in that heartthrilling voice which was peculiarly her own  time and misfortune have changed me much margaretthat every mirror tells meyet methinks margaret stanley might still have known charlotte de la tremouille  the lady peveril was little in the custom of giving way to sudden emotion but in the present case she threw herself on her knees in a rapture of mingled joy and grief and half embracing those of the stranger exclaimed in broken language  my kind my noble benefactressthe princely countess of derbythe royal queen in mancould i doubt your voice your features for a momentoh forgive forgive me  the countess raised the suppliant kinswoman of her husbands house with all the grace of one accustomed from early birth to receive homage and to grant protection she kissed the lady peverils forehead and passed her hand in a caressing manner over her face as she said  you too are changed my fair cousin but it is a change becomes you from a pretty and timid maiden to a sage and comely matron but my own memory which i once held a good one has failed me strangely if this gentleman be sir geoffrey peveril  a kind and good neighbour only madam said lady peveril sir geoffrey is at court  i understood so much said the countess of derby when i arrived here last night  how madam said lady peverildid you arrive at martindale castleat the house of margaret stanley where you have such right to command and did not announce your presence to her  oh i know you are a dutiful subject margaret answered the countess though it be in these days a rare characterbut it was our pleasure she added with a smile to travel incognitoand finding you engaged in general hospitality we desired not to disturb you with our royal presence  but how and where were you lodged madam said lady peveril or why should you have kept secret a visit which would if made have augmented tenfold the happiness of every true heart that rejoiced here yesterday  my lodging was well cared for by ellesmereyour ellesmere now as she was formerly mineshe has acted as quartermaster ere now you know and on a broader scale you must excuse hershe had my positive order to lodge me in the most secret part of your castlehere she pointed to the sliding panelshe obeyed orders in that and i suppose also in sending you now hither  indeed i have not yet seen her said the lady and therefore was totally ignorant of a visit so joyful so surprising  and i said the countess was equally surprised to find none but these beautiful children in the apartment where i thought i heard you moving our ellesmere has become sillyyour goodnature has spoiled hershe has forgotten the discipline she learned under me  i saw her run through the wood said the lady peveril after a moments recollection undoubtedly to seek the person who has charge of the children in order to remove them  your own darlings i doubt not said the countess looking at the children margaret providence has blessed you  that is my son said the lady peveril pointing to julian who stood devouring their discourse with greedy ear the little girli may call mine too major bridgenorth who had in the meantime again taken up his infant and was engaged in caressing it set it down as the countess of derby spoke sighed deeply and walked towards the oriel window he was well aware that the ordinary rules of courtesy would have rendered it proper that he should withdraw entirely or at least offer to do so but he was not a man of ceremonious politeness and he had a particular interest in the subjects on which the countesss discourse was likely to turn which induced him to dispense with ceremony the ladies seemed indeed scarce to notice his presence the countess had now assumed a chair and motioned to the lady peveril to sit upon a stool which was placed by her side we will have old times once more though there are here no roaring of rebel guns to drive you to take refuge at my side and almost in my pocket  i have a gun madam said little julian and the parkkeeper is to teach me how to fire it next year  i will list you for my soldier then said the countess  ladies have no soldiers said the boy looking wistfully at her  he has the true masculine contempt of our frail sex i see said the countess it is born with the insolent varlets of mankind and shows itself so soon as they are out of their long clothesdid ellesmere never tell you of latham house and charlotte of derby my little master  a thousand thousand times said the boy colouring and how the queen of man defended it six weeks against three thousand roundheads under rogue harrison the butcher  it was your mother defended latham house said the countess not i my little soldierhadst thou been there thou hadst been the best captain of the three  do not say so madam said the boy for mamma would not touch a gun for all the universe  not i indeed julian said his mother there i was for certain but as useless a part of the garrison  you forget said the countess you nursed our hospital and made lint for the soldiers wounds  but did not papa come to help you said julian  papa came at last said the countess and so did prince rupertbut not i think till they were both heartily wished fordo you remember that morning margaret when the roundheaded knaves that kept us pent up so long retreated without bag or baggage at the first glance of the princes standards appearing on the hilland how you took every highcrested captain you saw for peveril of the peak that had been your partner three months before at the queens mask nay never blush for the thought of itit was an honest affectionand though it was the music of trumpets that accompanied you both to the old chapel which was almost entirely ruined by the enemys bullets and though prince rupert when he gave you away at the altar was clad in buff and bandoleer with pistols in his belt yet i trust these warlike signs were no type of future discord  heaven has been kind to me said the lady peveril in blessing me with an affectionate husband  and in preserving him to you said the countess with a deep sigh while mine alas sealed with his blood his devotion to his kingoh had he lived to see this day   the earl of derby and king in man was beheaded at boltononthe     moors after having been made prisoner in a previous skirmish in     wiggan lane  alas alas that he was not permitted answered lady peveril how had that brave and noble earl rejoiced in the unhopedfor redemption of our captivity  the countess looked on lady peveril with an air of surprise  thou hast not then heard cousin how it stands with our househow indeed had my noble lord wondered had he been told that the very monarch for whom he had laid down his noble life on the scaffold at boltonlemoor should make it his first act of restored monarchy to complete the destruction of our property already wellnigh ruined in the royal cause and to persecute me his widow  you astonish me madam said the lady peveril it cannot be that youthat you the wife of the gallant the faithful the murdered earlyou countess of derby and queen in manyou who took on you even the character of a soldier and seemed a man when so many men proved womenthat you should sustain evil from the event which has fulfilledexceededthe hopes of every faithful subjectit cannot be  thou art as simple i see in this worlds knowledge as ever my fair cousin answered the countess this restoration which has given others security has placed me in dangerthis change which relieved other royalists scarce less zealous i presume to think than ihas sent me here a fugitive and in concealment to beg shelter and assistance from you fair cousin  from me answered the lady peverilfrom me whose youth your kindness shelteredfrom the wife of peveril your gallant lords companion in armsyou have a right to command everything but alas that you should need such assistance as i can renderforgive me but it seems like some illomened vision of the nighti listen to your words as if i hoped to be relieved from their painful import by awaking  it is indeed a dreama vision said the countess of derby but it needs no seer to read itthe explanation hath been long since givenput not your faith in princes i can soon remove your surprisethis gentleman your friend is doubtless honest  the lady peveril well knew that the cavaliers like other factions usurped to themselves the exclusive denomination of the honest party and she felt some difficulty in explaining that her visitor was not honest in that sense of the word  had we not better retire madam she said to the countess rising as if in order to attend her but the countess retained her seat  it was but a question of habit she said the gentlemans principles are nothing to me for what i have to tell you is widely blazed and i care not who hears my share of it you rememberyou must have heard for i think margaret stanley would not be indifferent to my fatethat after my husbands murder at bolton i took up the standard which he never dropped until his death and displayed it with my own hand in our sovereignty of man  i did indeed hear so madam said the lady peveril and that you had bidden a bold defiance to the rebel government even after all other parts of britain had submitted to them my husband sir geoffrey designed at one time to have gone to your assistance with some few followers but we learned that the island was rendered to the parliament party and that you dearest lady were thrown into prison  but you heard not said the countess how that disaster befell memargaret i would have held out that island against the knaves as long as the sea continued to flow around it till the shoals which surround it had become safe anchoragetill its precipices had melted beneath the sunshinetill of all its strong abodes and castles not one stone remained upon anotherwould i have defended against these villainous hypocritical rebels my dear husbands hereditary dominion the little kingdom of man should have been yielded only when not an arm was left to wield a sword not a finger to draw a trigger in its defence but treachery did what force could never have done when we had foiled various attempts upon the island by open forcetreason accomplished what blake and lawson with their floating castles had found too hazardous an enterprisea base rebel whom we had nursed in our own bosoms betrayed us to the enemy this wretch was named christian  major bridgenorth started and turned towards the speaker but instantly seemed to recollect himself and again averted his face the countess proceeded without noticing the interruption which however rather surprised lady peveril who was acquainted with her neighbours general habits of indifference and apathy and therefore the more surprised at his testifying such sudden symptoms of interest she would once again have moved the countess to retire to another apartment but lady derby proceeded with too much vehemence to endure interruption  this christian she said had eaten of my lord his sovereigns bread and drunk of his cup even from childhoodfor his fathers had been faithful servants to the house of man and derby he himself had fought bravely by my husbands side and enjoyed all his confidence and when my princely earl was martyred by the rebels he recommended to me amongst other instructions communicated in the last message i received from him to continue my confidence in christians fidelity i obeyed although i never loved the man he was cold and phlegmatic and utterly devoid of that sacred fire which is the incentive to noble deeds suspected too of leaning to the cold metaphysics of calvinistic subtlety but he was brave wise and experienced and as the event proved possessed but too much interest with the islanders when these rude people saw themselves without hope of relief and pressed by a blockade which brought want and disease into their island they began to fall off from the faith which they had hitherto shown  what said the lady peveril could they forget what was due to the widow of their benefactorshe who had shared with the generous derby the task of bettering their condition  do not blame them said the countess the rude herd acted but according to their kindin present distress they forgot former benefits and nursed in their earthen hovels with spirits suited to their dwellings they were incapable of feeling the glory which is attached to constancy in suffering but that christian should have headed their revoltthat he born a gentleman and bred under my murdered derbys own care in all that was chivalrous and noblethat he should have forgot a hundred benefitswhy do i talk of benefitsthat he should have forgotten that kindly intercourse which binds man to man far more than the reciprocity of obligationthat he should have headed the ruffians who broke suddenly into my apartmentimmured me with my infants in one of my own castles and assumed or usurped the tyranny of the islandthat this should have been done by william christian my vassal my servant my friend was a deed of ungrateful treachery which even this age of treason will scarcely parallel  and you were then imprisoned said the lady peveril and in your own sovereignty  for more than seven years i have endured strict captivity said the countess i was indeed offered my liberty and even some means of support if i would have consented to leave the island and pledge my word that i would not endeavour to repossess my son in his fathers rights but they little knew the princely house from which i springand as little the royal house of stanley which i uphold who hoped to humble charlotte of tremouille into so base a composition i would rather have starved in the darkest and lowest vault of rushin castle than have consented to aught which might diminish in one hairsbreadth the right of my son over his fathers sovereignty  and could not your firmness in a case where hope seemed lost induce them to be generous and dismiss you without conditions  they knew me better than thou dost wench answered the countess once at liberty i had not been long without the means of disturbing their usurpation and christian would have as soon encaged a lioness to combat with as have given me the slightest power of returning to the struggle with him but time had liberty and revenge in storei had still friends and partisans in the island though they were compelled to give way to the storm even among the islanders at large most had been disappointed in the effects which they expected from the change of power they were loaded with exactions by their new masters their privileges were abridged and their immunities abolished under the pretext of reducing them to the same condition with the other subjects of the pretended republic when the news arrived of the changes which were current in britain these sentiments were privately communicated to me calcott and others acted with great zeal and fidelity and a rising effected as suddenly and effectually as that which had made me a captive placed me at liberty and in possession of the sovereignty of man as regent for my son the youthful earl of derby do you think i enjoyed that sovereignty long without doing justice on that traitor christian  how madam said lady peveril who though she knew the high and ambitious spirit of the countess scarce anticipated the extremities to which it was capable of hurrying herhave you imprisoned christian  ay wenchin that sure prison which felon never breaks from answered the countess  bridgenorth who had insensibly approached them and was listening with an agony of interest which he was unable any longer to suppress broke in with the stern exclamation  lady i trust you have not dared  the countess interrupted him in her turn  i know not who you are who questionand you know not me when you speak to me of that which i dare or dare not do but you seem interested in the fate of this christian and you shall hear iti was no sooner placed in possession of my rightful power than i ordered the dempster of the island to hold upon the traitor a high court of justice with all the formalities of the isle as prescribed in its oldest records the court was held in the open air before the dempster and the keys of the island assembled under the vaulted cope of heaven and seated on the terrace of the zonwald hill where of old druid and scald held their courts of judgment the criminal was heard at length in his own defence which amounted to little more than those specious allegations of public consideration which are ever used to colour the ugly front of treason he was fully convicted of his crime and he received the doom of a traitor  but which i trust is not yet executed said lady peveril not without an involuntary shudder  you are a fool margaret said the countess sharply think you i delayed such an act of justice until some wretched intrigues of the new english court might have prompted their interference no wenchhe passed from the judgmentseat to the place of execution with no farther delay than might be necessary for his souls sake he was shot to death by a file of musketeers in the common place of execution called hango hill  bridgenorth clasped his hands together wrung them and groaned bitterly  as you seem interested for this criminal added the countess addressing bridgenorth i do him but justice in repeating to you that his death was firm and manly becoming the general tenor of his life which but for that gross act of traitorous ingratitude had been fair and honourable but what of that the hypocrite is a saint and the false traitor a man of honour till opportunity that faithful touchstone proves their metal to be base  it is false womanit is false said bridgenorth no longer suppressing his indignation  what means this bearing master bridgenorth said lady peveril much surprised what is this christian to you that you should insult the countess of derby under my roof  speak not to me of countesses and of ceremonies said bridgenorth grief and anger leave me no leisure for idle observances to humour the vanity of overgrown childreno christianworthy well worthy of the name thou didst bear my friendmy brotherthe brother of my blessed alicethe only friend of my desolate estate art thou then cruelly murdered by a female fury who but for thee had deservedly paid with her own blood that of gods saints which she as well as her tyrant husband had spilled like wateryes cruel murderess he continued addressing the countess he whom thou hast butchered in thy insane vengeance sacrificed for many a year the dictates of his own conscience to the interest of thy family and did not desert it till thy frantic zeal for royalty had wellnigh brought to utter perdition the little community in which he was born even in confining thee he acted but as the friends of the madman who bind him with iron for his own preservation and for thee as i can bear witness he was the only barrier between thee and the wrath of the commons of england and but for his earnest remonstrances thou hadst suffered the penalty of thy malignancy even like the wicked wife of ahab  master bridgenorth said the lady peveril i will allow for your impatience upon hearing these unpleasing tidings but there is neither use nor propriety in farther urging this question if in your grief you forget other restraints i pray you to remember that the countess is my guest and kinswoman and is under such protection as i can afford her i beseech you in simple courtesy to withdraw as what must needs be the best and most becoming course in these trying circumstances  nay let him remain said the countess regarding him with composure not unmingled with triumph i would not have it otherwise i would not that my revenge should be summed up in the stinted gratification which christians death hath afforded this mans rude and clamorous grief only proves that the retribution i have dealt has been more widely felt than by the wretched sufferer himself i would i knew that it had but made sore as many rebel hearts as there were loyal breasts afflicted by the death of my princely derby  so please you madam said lady peveril since master bridgenorth hath not the manners to leave us upon my request we will if your ladyship lists leave him and retire to my apartmentfarewell master bridgenorth we will meet hereafter on better terms  pardon me madam said the major who had been striding hastily through the room but now stood fast and drew himself up as one who has taken a resolutionto yourself i have nothing to say but what is respectful but to this woman i must speak as a magistrate she has confessed a murder in my presencethe murder too of my brotherinlawas a man and as a magistrate i cannot permit her to pass from hence excepting under such custody as may prevent her farther flight she has already confessed that she is a fugitive and in search of a place of concealment until she should be able to escape into foreign partscharlotte countess of derby i attach thee of the crime of which thou hast but now made thy boast  i shall not obey your arrest said the countess composedly i was born to give but not to receive such orders what have your english laws to do with my acts of justice and of government within my sons hereditary kingdom am i not queen in man as well as countess of derby a feudatory sovereign indeed but yet independent so long as my dues of homage are duly discharged what right can you assert over me  that given by the precepts of scripture answered bridgenorthwhoso spilleth mans blood by man shall his blood be spilled think not the barbarous privileges of ancient feudal customs will avail to screen you from the punishment due for an englishman murdered upon pretexts inconsistent with the act of indemnity  master bridgenorth said the lady peveril if by fair terms you desist not from your present purpose i tell you that i neither dare nor will permit any violence against this honourable lady within the walls of my husbands castle  you will find yourself unable to prevent me from executing my duty madam said bridgenorth whose native obstinacy now came in aid of his grief and desire of revenge i am a magistrate and act by authority  i know not that said lady peveril that you were a magistrate master bridgenorth under the late usurping powers i know well but till i hear of your having a commission in the name of the king i now hesitate to obey you as such  i shall stand on small ceremony said bridgenorth were i no magistrate every man has title to arrest for murder against the terms of the indemnities held out by the kings proclamations and i will make my point good  what indemnities what proclamations said the countess of derby indignantly charles stuart may if he pleases and it doth seem to please him consort with those whose hands have been red with the blood and blackened with the plunder of his father and of his loyal subjects he may forgive them if he will and count their deeds good service what has that to do with this christians offence against me and mine born a mankesmanbred and nursed in the islandhe broke the laws under which he lived and died for the breach of them after the fair trial which they allowedmethinks margaret we have enough of this peevish and foolish magistratei attend you to your apartment  major bridgenorth placed himself betwixt them and the door in a manner which showed him determined to interrupt their passage when the lady peveril who thought she already showed more deference to him in this matter than her husband was likely to approve of raised her voice and called loudly on her steward whitaker that alert person who had heard high talking and a female voice with which he was unacquainted had remained for several minutes stationed in the anteroom much afflicted with the anxiety of his own curiosity of course he entered in an instant  let three of the men instantly take arms said the lady bring them into the anteroom and wait my farther orders     chapter vi              you shall have no worse prison than my chamber             nor jailer than myself                                                the captain  the command which lady peveril laid on her domestics to arm themselves was so unlike the usual gentle acquiescence of her manners that major bridgenorth was astonished how mean you madam said he i thought myself under a friendly roof  and you are so master bridgenorth said the lady peveril without departing from the natural calmness of her voice and manner but it is a roof which must not be violated by the outrage of one friend against another  it is well madam said bridgenorth turning to the door of the apartment the worthy master solsgrace has already foretold that the time was returned when high houses and proud names should be once more an excuse for the crimes of those who inhabit the one and bear the other i believed him not but now see he is wiser than i yet think not i will endure this tamely the blood of my brotherof the friend of my bosomshall not long call from the altar how long o lord how long if there is one spark of justice left in this unhappy england that proud woman and i shall meet where she can have no partial friend to protect her  so saying he was about to leave the apartment when lady peveril said you depart not from this place master bridgenorth unless you give me your word to renounce all purpose against the noble countesss liberty upon the present occasion  i would sooner answered he subscribe to my own dishonour madam written down in express words than to any such composition if any man offers to interrupt me his blood be on his own head as major bridgenorth spoke whitaker threw open the door and showed that with the alertness of an old soldier who was not displeased to see things tend once more towards a state of warfare he had got with him four stout fellows in the knight of the peaks livery well armed with swords and carabines buffcoats and pistols at their girdles  i will see said major bridgenorth if any of these men be so desperate as to stop me a freeborn englishman and a magistrate in the discharge of my duty  so saying he advanced upon whitaker and his armed assistants with his hand on the hilt of his sword  do not be so desperate master bridgenorth exclaimed lady peveril and added in the same moment lay hold upon and disarm him whitaker but do him no injury  her commands were obeyed bridgenorth though a man of moral resolution was not one of those who undertook to cope in person with odds of a description so formidable he half drew his sword and offered such show of resistance as made it necessary to secure him by actual force but then yielded up his weapon and declared that submitting to force which one man was unable to resist he made those who commanded and who employed it responsible for assailing his liberty without a legal warrant  never mind a warrant on a pinch master bridgenorth said old whitaker sure enough you have often acted upon a worse yourself my ladys word is as good as a warrant sure as old nolls commission and you bore that many a day master bridgenorth and moreover you laid me in the stocks for drinking the kings health master bridgenorth and never cared a farthing about the laws of england  hold your saucy tongue whitaker said the lady peveril and do you master bridgenorth not take it to heart that you are detained prisoner for a few hours until the countess of derby can have nothing to fear from your pursuit i could easily send an escort with her that might bid defiance to any force you could muster but i wish heaven knows to bury the remembrance of old civil dissensions not to awaken new once more will you think better of itassume your sword again and forget whom you have now seen at martindale castle  never said bridgenorth the crime of this cruel woman will be the last of human injuries which i can forget the last thought of earthly kind which will leave me will be the desire that justice shall be done on her  if such be your sentiments said lady peveril though they are more allied to revenge than to justice i must provide for my friends safety by putting restraint upon your person in this room you will be supplied with every necessary of life and every convenience and a message shall relieve your domestics of the anxiety which your absence from the hall is not unlikely to occasion when a few hours at most two days are over i will myself relieve you from confinement and demand your pardon for now acting as your obstinacy compels me to do  the major made no answer but that he was in her hands and must submit to her pleasure and then turned sullenly to the window as if desirous to be rid of their presence  the countess and the lady peveril left the apartment arm in arm and the lady issued forth her directions to whitaker concerning the mode in which she was desirous that bridgenorth should be guarded and treated during his temporary confinement at the same time explaining to him that the safety of the countess of derby required that he should be closely watched  in all proposals for the prisoners security such as the regular relief of guards and the like whitaker joyfully acquiesced and undertook body for body that he should be detained in captivity for the necessary period but the old steward was not half so docile when it came to be considered how the captives bedding and table should be supplied and he thought lady peveril displayed a very undue degree of attention to her prisoners comforts i warrant he said that the cuckoldly roundhead ate enough of our fat beef yesterday to serve him for a month and a little fasting will do his health good marry for drink he shall have plenty of cold water to cool his hot liver which i will be bound is still hissing with the strong liquors of yesterday and as for bedding there are the fine dry boardmore wholesome than the wet straw i lay upon when i was in the stocks i trow  whitaker said the lady peremptorily i desire you to provide master bridgenorths bedding and food in the way i have signified to you and to behave yourself towards him in all civility  lackaday yes my lady said whitaker you shall have all your directions punctually obeyed but as an old servant i cannot but speak my mind  the ladies retired after this conference with the steward in the antechamber and were soon seated in another apartment which was peculiarly dedicated to the use of the mistress of the mansionhaving on the one side access to the family bedroom and on the other to the stillroom which communicated with the garden there was also a small door which ascending a few steps led to that balcony already mentioned that overhung the kitchen and the same passage by a separate door admitted to the principal gallery in the chapel so that the spiritual and temporal affairs of the castle were placed almost at once within the reach of the same regulating and directing eye   this peculiar collocation of apartments may be seen at haddon     hall derbyshire once a seat of the vernons where in the ladys     pew in the chapel there is a sort of scuttle which opens into     the kitchen so that the good lady could ever and anon without     much interruption of her religious duties give an eye that the     roastmeat was not permitted to burn and that the turnbroche did     his duty  in the tapestried room from which issued these various sallyports the countess and lady peveril were speedily seated and the former smiling upon the latter said as she took her hand two things have happened today which might have surprised me if anything ought to surprise me in such timesthe first is that yonder roundheaded fellow should have dared to use such insolence in the house of peveril of the peak if your husband is yet the same honest and downright cavalier whom i once knew and had chanced to be at home he would have thrown the knave out of window but what i wonder at still more margaret is your generalship i hardly thought you had courage sufficient to have taken such decided measures after keeping on terms with the man so long when he spoke of justices and warrants you looked so overawed that i thought i felt the clutch of the parishbeadles on my shoulder to drag me to prison as a vagrant  we owe master bridgenorth some deference my dearest lady answered the lady peveril he has served us often and kindly in these late times but neither he nor any one else shall insult the countess of derby in the house of margaret stanley  thou art become a perfect heroine margaret replied the countess  two sieges and alarms innumerable said lady peveril may have taught me presence of mind my courage is i believe as slender as ever  presence of mind is courage answered the countess real valour consists not in being insensible to danger but in being prompt to confront and disarm itand we may have present occasion for all that we possess she added with some slight emotion for i hear the trampling of horses steps on the pavement of the court  in one moment the boy julian breathless with joy came flying into the room to say that papa was returned with lamington and sam brewer and that he was himself to ride black hastings to the stable in the second the tramp of the honest knights heavy jackboots was heard as in his haste to see his lady he ascended the staircase by two steps at a time he burst into the room his manly countenance and disordered dress showing marks that he had been riding fast and without looking to any one else caught his good lady in his arms and kissed her a dozen of timesblushing and with some difficulty lady peveril extricated herself from sir geoffreys arms and in a voice of bashful and gentle rebuke bid him for shame observe who was in the room  one said the countess advancing to him who is right glad to see that sir geoffrey peveril though turned courtier and favourite still values the treasure which she had some share in bestowing upon him you cannot have forgot the raising of the leaguer of latham house  the noble countess of derby said sir geoffrey doffing his plumed hat with an air of deep deference and kissing with much reverence the hand which she held out to him i am as glad to see your ladyship in my poor house as i would be to hear that they had found a vein of lead in the brown tor i rode hard in the hope of being your escort through the country i feared you might have fallen into bad hands hearing there was a knave sent out with a warrant from the council  when heard you so and from whom  it was from cholmondley of vale royal said sir geoffrey he is come down to make provision for your safety through cheshire and i promised to bring you there in safety prince rupert ormond and other friends do not doubt the matter will be driven to a fine but they say the chancellor and harry bennet and some others of the oversea counsellors are furious at what they call a breach of the kings proclamation hang them say ithey left us to bear all the beating and now they are incensed that we should wish to clear scores with those who rode us like nightmares  what did they talk of for my chastisement said the countess  i wot not said sir geoffrey some friends as i said from our kind cheshire and others tried to bring it to a fine but some again spoke of nothing but the tower and a long imprisonment  i have suffered imprisonment long enough for king charless sake said the countess and have no mind to undergo it at his hand besides if i am removed from the personal superintendence of my sons dominions in man i know not what new usurpation may be attempted there i must be obliged to you cousin to contrive that i may get in security to vale royal and from thence i know i shall be guarded safely to liverpool  you may rely on my guidance and protection noble lady answered her host though you had come here at midnight and with the rogues head in your apron like judith in the holy apocrypha which i joy to hear once more read in churches  do the gentry resort much to the court said the lady  ay madam replied sir geoffrey and according to our saying when miners do begin to bore in these parts it is for the grace of god and what they there may find  meet the old cavaliers with much countenance continued the countess  faith madam to speak truth replied the knight the king hath so gracious a manner that it makes every mans hopes blossom though we have seen but few that have ripened into fruit  you have not yourself my cousin answered the countess had room to complain of ingratitude i trust few have less deserved it at the kings hand  sir geoffrey was unwilling like most prudent persons to own the existence of expectations which had proved fallacious yet had too little art in his character to conceal his disappointment entirely who i madam he said alas what should a poor country knight expect from the king besides the pleasure of seeing him in whitehall once more and enjoying his own again and his majesty was very gracious when i was presented and spoke to me of worcester and of my horse black hastingshe had forgot his name thoughfaith and mine too i believe had not prince rupert whispered it to him and i saw some old friends such as his grace of ormond sir marmaduke langdale sir philip musgrave and so forth and had a jolly rouse or two to the tune of old times  i should have thought so many wounds receivedso many dangers riskedsuch considerable lossesmerited something more than a few smooth words said the countess  nay my lady there were other friends of mine who had the same thought answered peveril some were of opinion that the loss of so many hundred acres of fair land was worth some reward of honour at least and there were who thought my descent from william the conquerorcraving your ladyships pardon for boasting it in your presencewould not have become a higher rank or title worse than the pedigree of some who have been promoted but what said the witty duke of buckingham forsooth whose grandsire was a leistershire knightrather poorer and scarcely so wellborn as myselfwhy he said that if all of my degree who deserved well of the king in the late times were to be made peers the house of lords must meet upon salisbury plain  and that bad jest passed for a good argument said the countess and well it might where good arguments pass for bad jests but here comes one i must be acquainted with  this was little julian who now reentered the hall leading his little sister as if he had brought her to bear witness to the boastful tale which he told his father of his having manfully ridden black hastings to the stableyard alone in the saddle and that saunders though he walked by the horses head did not once put his hand upon the rein and brewer though he stood beside him scarce held him by the knee the father kissed the boy heartily and the countess calling him to her so soon as sir geoffrey had set him down kissed his forehead also and then surveyed all his features with a keen and penetrating eye  he is a true peveril said she mixed as he should be with some touch of the stanley cousin you must grant me my boon and when i am safely established and have my present affair arranged you must let me have this little julian of yours some time hence to be nurtured in my house held as my page and the playfellow of the little derby i trust in heaven they will be such friends as their fathers have been and may god send them more fortunate times  marry and i thank you for the proposal with all my heart madam said the knight there are so many noble houses decayed and so many more in which the exercise and discipline for the training of noble youths is given up and neglected that i have often feared i must have kept gil to be young master at home and i have had too little nurture myself to teach him much and so he would have been a mere hunting hawking knight of derbyshire but in your ladyships household and with the noble young earl he will have all and more than all the education which i could desire  there shall be no distinction betwixt them cousin said the countess margaret stanleys son shall be as much the object of care to me as my own since you are kindly disposed to entrust him to my chargeyou look pale margaret she continued and the tear stands in your eye do not be so foolish my lovewhat i ask is better than you can desire for your boy for the house of my father the duke de la tremouille was the most famous school of chivalry in france nor have i degenerated from him or suffered any relaxation in that noble discipline which trained young gentlemen to do honour to their race you can promise your julian no such advantages if you train him up a mere homebred youth  i acknowledge the importance of the favour madam said lady peveril and must acquiesce in what your ladyship honours us by proposing and sir geoffrey approves of but julian is an only child and  an only son said the countess but surely not an only child you pay too high deference to our masters the male sex if you allow julian to engross all your affection and spare none for this beautiful girl  so saying she set down julian and taking alice bridgenorth on her lap began to caress her and there was notwithstanding her masculine character something so sweet in the tone of her voice and in the cast of her features that the child immediately smiled and replied to her marks of fondness this mistake embarrassed lady peveril exceedingly knowing the blunt impetuosity of her husbands character his devotion to the memory of the deceased earl of derby and his corresponding veneration for his widow she was alarmed for the consequences of his hearing the conduct of bridgenorth that morning and was particularly desirous that he should not learn it save from herself in private and after due preparation but the countesss error led to a more precipitate disclosure  that pretty girl madam answered sir geoffrey is none of oursi wish she were she belongs to a neighbour hard bya good man and to say truth a good neighbourthough he was carried off from his allegiance in the late times by a dd presbyterian scoundrel who calls himself a parson and whom i hope to fetch down from his perch presently with a wannion to him he has been cock of the roost long enoughthere are rods in pickle to switch the geneva cloak with i can tell the sourfaced rogues that much but this child is the daughter of bridgenorthneighbour bridgenorth of moultrassie hall  bridgenorth said the countess i thought i had known all the honourable names in derbyshirei remember nothing of bridgenorthbut staywas there not a sequestrator and committeeman of that name sure it cannot be he  peveril took some shame to himself as he replied it is the very man whom your ladyship means and you may conceive the reluctance with which i submitted to receive good offices from one of his kidney but had i not done so i should have scarce known how to find a roof to cover dame margarets head  the countess as he spoke raised the child gently from her lap and placed it upon the carpet though little alice showed a disinclination to the change of place which the lady of derby and man would certainly have indulged in a child of patrician descent and loyal parentage  i blame you not she said no one knows what temptation will bring us down to yet i did think peveril of the peak would have resided in its deepest cavern sooner than owed an obligation to a regicide  nay madam answered the knight my neighbour is bad enough but not so bad as you would make him he is but a presbyterianthat i must confessbut not an independent  a variety of the same monster said the countess who hallooed while the others hunted and bound the victim whom the independents massacred betwixt such sects i prefer the independents they are at least bold barefaced merciless villains have more of the tiger in them and less of the crocodile i have no doubt it was that worthy gentleman who took it upon him this morning  she stopped short for she saw lady peveril was vexed and embarrassed  i am she said the most luckless of beings i have said something i know not what to distress you margaretmystery is a bad thing and betwixt us there should be none  there is none madam said lady peveril something impatiently i waited but an opportunity to tell my husband what had happenedsir geoffrey master bridgenorth was unfortunately here when the lady derby and i met and he thought it part of his duty to speak of  to speak of what said the knight bending his brows you were ever something too fond dame of giving way to the usurpation of such people  i only mean said lady peveril that as the personhe to whom lord derbys story relatedwas the brother of his late lady he threatenedbut i cannot think that he was serious  threatenthreaten the lady of derby and man in my housethe widow of my friendthe noble charlotte of latham houseby heaven the prickeared slave shall answer it how comes it that my knaves threw him not out of the window  alas sir geoffrey you forget how much we owe him said the lady  owe him said the knight still more indignant for in his singleness of apprehension he conceived that his wife alluded to pecuniary obligationsif i do owe him some money hath he not security for it and must he have the right over and above to domineer and play the magistrate in martindale castlewhere is hewhat have you made of him i willi must speak with him  be patient sir geoffrey said the countess who now discerned the cause of her kinswomans apprehension and be assured i did not need your chivalry to defend me against this discourteous faitour as morte darthur would have called him i promise you my kinswoman hath fully righted my wrong and i am so pleased to owe my deliverance entirely to her gallantry that i charge and command you as a true knight not to mingle in the adventure of another  lady peveril who knew her husbands blunt and impatient temper and perceived that he was becoming angry now took up the story and plainly and simply pointed out the cause of master bridgenorths interference  i am sorry for it said the knight i thought he had more sense and that this happy change might have done some good upon him but you should have told me this instantlyit consists not with my honour that he should be kept prisoner in this house as if i feared anything he could do to annoy the noble countess while she is under my roof or within twenty miles of this castle  so saying and bowing to the countess he went straight to the gilded chamber leaving lady peveril in great anxiety for the event of an angry meeting between a temper hasty as that of her husband and stubborn like that of bridgenorth her apprehensions were however unnecessary for the meeting was not fated to take place  when sir geoffrey peveril having dismissed whitaker and his sentinels entered the gilded chamber in which he expected to find his captive the prisoner had escaped and it was easy to see in what manner the sliding panel had in the hurry of the moment escaped the memory of lady peveril and of whitaker the only persons who knew anything of it it was probable that a chink had remained open sufficient to indicate its existence to bridgenorth who withdrawing it altogether had found his way into the secret apartment with which it communicated and from thence to the postern of the castle by another secret passage which had been formed in the thickness of the wall as is not uncommon in ancient mansions the lords of which were liable to so many mutations of fortune that they usually contrived to secure some lurking place and secret mode of retreat from their fortresses that bridgenorth had discovered and availed himself of this secret mode of retreat was evident because the private doors communicating with the postern and the sliding panel in the gilded chamber were both left open  sir geoffrey returned to the ladies with looks of perplexity while he deemed bridgenorth within his reach he was apprehensive of nothing he could do for he felt himself his superior in personal strength and in that species of courage which induces a man to rush without hesitation upon personal danger but when at a distance he had been for many years accustomed to consider bridgenorths power and influence as something formidable and notwithstanding the late change of affairs his ideas so naturally reverted to his neighbour as a powerful friend or dangerous enemy that he felt more apprehension on the countesss score than he was willing to acknowledge even to himself the countess observed his downcast and anxious brow and requested to know if her stay there was likely to involve him in any trouble or in any danger  the trouble should be welcome said sir geoffrey and more welcome the danger which should come on such an account my plan was that your ladyship should have honoured martindale with a few days residence which might have been kept private until the search after you was ended had i seen this fellow bridgenorth i have no doubt i could have compelled him to act discreetly but he is now at liberty and will keep out of my reach and what is worse he has the secret of the priests chamber  here the knight paused and seemed much embarrassed  you can then neither conceal nor protect me said the countess  pardon my honoured lady answered the knight and let me say out my say the plain truth is that this man hath many friends among the presbyterians here who are more numerous than i would wish them and if he falls in with the pursuivant fellow who carries the warrant of the privy council it is likely he will back him with force sufficient to try to execute it and i doubt whether any of our friends can be summoned together in haste sufficient to resist such a power as they are like to bring together  nor would i wish any friends to take arms in my name against the kings warrant sir geoffrey said the countess  nay for that matter replied the knight an his majesty will grant warrants against his best friends he must look to have them resisted but the best i can think of in this emergence isthough the proposal be something inhospitablethat your ladyship should take presently to horse if your fatigue will permit i will mount also with some brisk fellows who will lodge you safe at vale royal though the sheriff stopped the way with a whole posse comitatus  the countess of derby willingly acquiesced in this proposal she had enjoyed a nights sound repose in the private chamber to which ellesmere had guided her on the preceding evening and was quite ready to resume her route or flightshe scarce knew she said which of the two she should term it  lady peveril wept at the necessity which seemed to hurry her earliest friend and protectress from under her roof at the instant when the clouds of adversity were gathering around her but she saw no alternative equally safe nay however strong her attachment to lady derby she could not but be more readily reconciled to her hasty departure when she considered the inconvenience and even danger in which her presence at such a time and in such circumstances was likely to involve a man so bold and hottempered as her husband sir geoffrey  while lady peveril therefore made every arrangement which time permitted and circumstances required for the countess prosecuting her journey her husband whose spirits always rose with the prospect of action issued his orders to whitaker to get together a few stout fellows with back and breast pieces and steelcaps there are the two lackeys and outram and saunders besides the other groom fellow and roger raine and his son but bid roger not come drunk againthyself young dick of the dale and his servant and a file or two of the tenantswe shall be enough for any force they can make all these are fellows that will strike hard and ask no question whytheir hands are ever readier than their tongues and their mouths are more made for drinking than speaking  whitaker apprised of the necessity of the case asked if he should not warn sir jasper cranbourne  not a word to him as you live said the knight this may be an outlawry as they call it for what i know and therefore i will bring no lands or tenements into peril saving mine own sir jasper hath had a troublesome time of it for many a year by my will he shall sit quiet for the rest ofs days     chapter vii           fanga rescue a rescue          mrs quicklygood people bring a rescue or two                                             henry iv part i  the followers of peveril were so well accustomed to the sound of boot and saddle that they were soon mounted and in order and in all the form and with some of the dignity of danger proceeded to escort the countess of derby through the hilly and desert tract of country which connects the frontier of the shire with the neighbouring county of cheshire the cavalcade moved with considerable precaution which they had been taught by the discipline of the civil wars one wary and wellmounted trooper rode about two hundred yards in advance followed at about half that distance by two more with their carabines advanced as if ready for action about one hundred yards behind the advance came the main body where the countess of derby mounted on lady peverils ambling palfrey for her own had been exhausted by the journey from london to martindale castle accompanied by one groom of approved fidelity and one waitingmaid was attended and guarded by the knight of the peak and three files of good and practised horsemen in the rear came whitaker with lance outram as men of especial trust to whom the covering the retreat was confided they rode as the spanish proverb expresses it with the beard on the shoulder looking around that is from time to time and using every precaution to have the speediest knowledge of any pursuit which might take place  but however wise in discipline peveril and his followers were somewhat remiss in civil policy the knight had communicated to whitaker though without any apparent necessity the precise nature of their present expedition and whitaker was equally communicative to his comrade lance the keeper it is strange enough master whitaker said the latter when he had heard the case and i wish you being a wise man would expound itwhy when we have been wishing for the kingand praying for the kingand fighting for the kingand dying for the king for these twenty years the first thing we find to do on his return is to get into harness to resist his warrant  pooh you silly fellow said whitaker that is all you know of the true bottom of our quarrel why man we fought for the kings person against his warrant all along from the very beginning for i remember the rogues proclamations and so forth always ran in the name of the king and parliament  ay was it even so replied lance nay then if they begin the old game so soon again and send out warrants in the kings name against his loyal subjects well fare our stout knight say i who is ready to take them down in their stockingsoles and if bridgenorth takes the chase after us i shall not be sorry to have a knock at him for one  why the man bating he is a pestilent roundhead and puritan said whitaker is no bad neighbour what has he done to thee man  he has poached on the manor answered the keeper  the devil he has replied whitaker thou must be jesting lance bridgenorth is neither hunter nor hawker he hath not so much of honesty in him  ay but he runs after game you little think of with his sour melancholy face that would scare babes and curdle milk answered lance  thou canst not mean the wenches said whitaker why he hath been melancholy mad with moping for the death of his wife thou knowest our lady took the child for fear he should strangle it for putting him in mind of its mother in some of his tantrums under her favour and among friends there are many poor cavaliers children that care would be better bestowed uponbut to thy tale  why thus it runs said lance i think you may have noticed master whitaker that a certain mistress deborah hath manifested a certain favour for a certain person in a certain household  for thyself to wit answered whitaker lance outram thou art the vainest coxcomb  coxcomb said lance why twas but last night the whole family saw her as one would say fling herself at my head  i would she had been a brickbat then to have broken it for thy impertinence and conceit said the steward  well but do but hearken the next morningthat is this very blessed morningi thought of going to lodge a buck in the park judging a bit of venison might be wanted in the larder after yesterdays wassail and as i passed under the nursery window i did but just look up to see what madam governante was about and so i saw her through the casement whip on her hood and scarf as soon as she had a glimpse of me immediately after i saw the stillroom door open and made sure she was coming through the garden and so over the breach and down to the park and so thought i aha mistress deb if you are so ready to dance after my pipe and tabor i will give you a couranto before you shall come up with me and so i went down ivytod dingle where the copse is tangled and the ground swampy and round by haxleybottom thinking all the while she was following and laughing in my sleeve at the round i was giving her  you deserved to be ducked for it said whitaker for a weatherheaded puppy but what is all this jackalantern story to bridgenorth  why it was all along of he man continued lance that is of bridgenorth that she did not follow megad i first walked slow and then stopped and then turned back a little and then began to wonder what she had made of herself and to think i had borne myself something like a jackass in the matter  that i deny said whitaker never jackass but would have borne him betterbut go on  why turning my face towards the castle i went back as if i had my nose bleeding when just by the copely thorn which stands you know a flightshort from the posterngate i saw madam deb in close conference with the enemy  what enemy said the steward  what enemy why who but bridgenorth they kept out of sight and among the copse but thought i it is hard if i cannot stalk you that have stalked so many bucks if so i had better give my shafts to be pudding pins so i cast round the thicket to watch their waters and may i never bend crossbow again if i did not see him give her gold and squeeze her by the hand  and was that all you saw pass between them said the steward  faith and it was enough to dismount me from my hobby said lance what when i thought i had the prettiest girl in the castle dancing after my whistle to find that she gave me the bag to hold and was smuggling in a corner with a rich old puritan  credit me lance it is not as thou thinkest said whitaker bridgenorth cares not for these amorous toys and thou thinkest of nothing else but it is fitting our knight should know that he has met with deborah in secret and given her gold for never puritan gave gold yet but it was earnest for some devils work done or to be done  nay but said lance i would not be such a dogbolt as to go and betray the girl to our master she hath a right to follow her fancy as the dame said who kissed her cowonly i do not much approve her choice that is all he cannot be six years short of fifty and a verjuice countenance under the penthouse of a slouched beaver and bag of meagre dried bones swaddled up in a black cloak is no such temptation methinks  i tell you once more said whitaker you are mistaken and that there neither is nor can be any matter of love between them but only some intrigue concerning perhaps this same noble countess of derby i tell thee it behoves my master to know it and i will presently tell it to him  so saying and in spite of all the remonstrances which lance continued to make on behalf of mistress deborah the steward rode up to the main body of their little party and mentioned to the knight and the countess of derby what he had just heard from the keeper adding at the same time his own suspicions that master bridgenorth of moultrassie hall was desirous to keep up some system of espial in the castle of martindale either in order to secure his menaced vengeance on the countess of derby as authoress of his brotherinlaws death or for some unknown but probably sinister purpose  the knight of the peak was filled with high resentment at whitakers communication according to his prejudices those of the opposite faction were supposed to make up by wit and intrigue what they wanted in open force and he now hastily conceived that his neighbour whose prudence he always respected and sometimes even dreaded was maintaining for his private purposes a clandestine correspondence with a member of his family if this was for the betrayal of his noble guest it argued at once treachery and presumption or viewing the whole as lance had done a criminal intrigue with a woman so near the person of lady peveril was in itself he deemed a piece of sovereign impertinence and disrespect on the part of such a person as bridgenorth against whom sir geoffreys anger was kindled accordingly  whitaker had scarce regained his post in the rear when he again quitted it and galloped to the main body with more speed than before with the unpleasing tidings that they were pursued by half a score of horseman and better  ride on briskly to hartleynick said the knight and there with god to help we will bide the knavescountess of derbyone word and a short onefarewellyou must ride forward with whitaker and another careful fellow and let me alone to see that no one treads on your skirts  i will abide with you and stand them said the countess you know of old i fear not to look on mans work  you must ride on madam said the knight for the sake of the young earl and the rest of my noble friends family there is no manly work which can be worth your looking upon it is but childs play that these fellows bring with them  as she yielded a reluctant consent to continue her flight they reached the bottom of hartleynick a pass very steep and craggy and where the road or rather path which had hitherto passed over more open ground became pent up and confined betwixt copsewood on the one side and on the other the precipitous bank of a mountain stream  the countess of derby after an affectionate adieu to sir geoffrey and having requested him to convey her kind commendations to her little pageelect and his mother proceeded up the pass at a round pace and with her attendants and escort was soon out of sight immediately after she had disappeared the pursuers came up with sir geoffrey peveril who had divided and drawn up his party so as completely to occupy the road at three different points  the opposite party was led as sir geoffrey had expected by major bridgenorth at his side was a person in black with a silver greyhound on his arm and he was followed by about eight or ten inhabitants of the village of martindale moultrassie two or three of whom were officers of the peace and others were personally known to sir geoffrey as favourers of the subverted government  as the party rode briskly up sir geoffrey called to them to halt and as they continued advancing he ordered his own people to present their pistols and carabines and after assuming that menacing attitude he repeated with a voice of thunder halt or we fire  the other party halted accordingly and major bridgenorth advanced as if to parley  why how now neighbour said sir geoffrey as if he had at that moment recognised him for the first timewhat makes you ride so sharp this morning are you not afraid to harm your horse or spoil your spurs  sir geoffrey said the major i have not time for jestingim on the kings affairs  are you sure it is not upon old nolls neighbour you used to hold his the better errand said the knight with a smile which gave occasion to a horselaugh among his followers  show him your warrant said bridgenorth to the man in black formerly mentioned who was a pursuivant then taking the warrant from the officer he gave it to sir geoffreyto this at least you will pay regard  the same regard which you would have paid to it a month back or so said the knight tearing the warrant to shredswhat a plague do you stare at do you think you have a monopoly of rebellion and that we have not a right to show a trick of disobedience in our turn  make way sir geoffrey peveril said bridgenorth or you will compel me to do that i may be sorry for i am in this matter the avenger of the blood of one of the lords saints and i will follow the chase while heaven grants me an arm to make my way  you shall make no way here but at your peril said sir geoffrey this is my groundi have been harassed enough for these twenty years by saints as you call yourselves i tell you master you shall neither violate the security of my house nor pursue my friends over the grounds nor tamper as you have done amongst my servants with impunity i have had you in respect for certain kind doings which i will not either forget or deny and you will find it difficult to make me draw a sword or bend a pistol against you but offer any hostile movement or presume to advance a foot and i will make sure of you presently and for those rascals who come hither to annoy a noble lady on my bounds unless you draw them off i will presently send some of them to the devil before their time  make room at your proper peril said major bridgenorth and he put his right hand on his holsterpistol sir geoffrey closed with him instantly seized him by the collar and spurred black hastings checking him at the same time so that the horse made a courbette and brought the full weight of his chest against the counter of the other a ready soldier might in bridgenorths situation have rid himself of his adversary with a bullet but bridgenorths courage notwithstanding his having served some time with the parliament army was rather of a civil than a military character and he was inferior to his adversary not only in strength and horsemanship but also and especially in the daring and decisive resolution which made sir geoffrey thrust himself readily into personal contest while therefore they tugged and grappled together upon terms which bore such little accordance with their long acquaintance and close neighbourhood it was no wonder that bridgenorth should be unhorsed with much violence while sir geoffrey sprung from the saddle the party of bridgenorth advanced to rescue their leader and that of the knight to oppose them swords were unsheathed and pistols presented but sir geoffrey with the voice of a herald commanded both parties to stand back and to keep the peace  the pursuivant took the hint and easily found a reason for not prosecuting a dangerous duty the warrant he said was destroyed they that did it must be answerable to the council for his part he could proceed no farther without his commission  well said and like a peaceable fellow said sir geoffreylet him have refreshment at the castlehis nag is sorely out of conditioncome neighbour bridgenorth get up mani trust you have had no hurt in this mad affray i was loath to lay hand on you man till you plucked out your petronel  as he spoke thus he aided the major to rise the pursuivant meanwhile drew aside and with him the constable and headborough who were not without some tacit suspicion that though peveril was interrupting the direct course of law in this matter yet he was likely to have his offence considered by favourable judges and therefore it might be as much for their interest and safety to give way as to oppose him but the rest of the party friends of bridgenorth and of his principles kept their ground notwithstanding this defection and seemed from their looks sternly determined to rule their conduct by that of their leader whatever it might be  but it was evident that bridgenorth did not intend to renew the struggle he shook himself rather roughly free from the hands of sir geoffrey peveril but it was not to draw his sword on the contrary he mounted his horse with a sullen and dejected air and making a sign to his followers turned back the same road which he had come sir geoffrey looked after him for some minutes now there goes a man said he who would have been a right honest fellow had he not been a presbyterian but there is no heartiness about themthey can never forgive a fair fall upon the sodthey bear malice and that i hate as i do a black cloak or a geneva skullcap and a pair of long ears rising on each side ont like two chimneys at the gable ends of a thatched cottage they are as sly as the devil to boot and therefore lance outram take two with you and keep after them that they may not turn our flank and get on the track of the countess again after all  i had as soon they should course my ladys white tame doe answered lance in the spirit of his calling he proceeded to execute his masters orders by dogging major bridgenorth at a distance and observing his course from such heights as commanded the country but it was soon evident that no manoeuvre was intended and that the major was taking the direct road homeward when this was ascertained sir geoffrey dismissed most of his followers and retaining only his own domestics rode hastily forward to overtake the countess  it is only necessary to say farther that he completed his purpose of escorting the countess of derby to vale royal without meeting any further hindrance by the way the lord of the mansion readily undertook to conduct the highminded lady to liverpool and the task of seeing her safely embarked for her sons hereditary dominions where there was no doubt of her remaining in personal safety until the accusation against her for breach of the royal indemnity by the execution of christian could be brought to some compromise  for a length of time this was no easy matter clarendon then at the head of charless administration considered her rash action though dictated by motives which the human breast must in some respects sympathise with as calculated to shake the restored tranquillity of england by exciting the doubts and jealousies of those who had to apprehend the consequences of what is called in our own time a reaction at the same time the high services of this distinguished familythe merits of the countess herselfthe memory of her gallant husbandand the very peculiar circumstances of jurisdiction which took the case out of all common rules pleaded strongly in her favour and the death of christian was at length only punished by the imposition of a heavy fine amounting we believe to many thousand pounds which was levied with great difficulty out of the shattered estates of the young earl of derby     chapter viii                       my native land good night                                            byron  lady peveril remained in no small anxiety for several hours after her husband and the countess had departed from martindale castle more especially when she learned that major bridgenorth concerning whose motions she made private inquiry had taken horse with a party and was gone to the westward in the same direction with sir geoffrey  at length her immediate uneasiness in regard to the safety of her husband and the countess was removed by the arrival of whitaker with her husbands commendations and an account of the scuffle betwixt himself and major bridgenorth  lady peveril shuddered to see how nearly they had approached to renewal of the scenes of civil discord and while she was thankful to heaven for her husbands immediate preservation she could not help feeling both regret and apprehension for the consequences of his quarrel with major bridgenorth they had now lost an old friend who had showed himself such under those circumstances of adversity by which friendship is most severely tried and she could not disguise from herself that bridgenorth thus irritated might be a troublesome if not a dangerous enemy his rights as a creditor he had hitherto used with gentleness but if he should employ rigour lady peveril whose attention to domestic economy had made her much better acquainted with her husbands affairs than he was himself foresaw considerable inconvenience from the measures which the law put in his power she comforted herself with the recollection however that she had still a strong hold on bridgenorth through his paternal affection and from the fixed opinion which he had hitherto manifested that his daughters health could only flourish while under her charge but any expectations of reconciliation which lady peveril might probably have founded on this circumstance were frustrated by an incident which took place in the course of the following morning  the governante mistress deborah who has been already mentioned went forth as usual with the children to take their morning exercise in the park attended by rachael a girl who acted occasionally as her assistant in attending upon them but not as usual did she return it was near the hour of breakfast when ellesmere with an unwonted degree of primness in her mouth and manner came to acquaint her lady that mistress deborah had not thought proper to come back from the park though the breakfast hour approached so near  she will come then presently said lady peveril with indifference  ellesmere gave a short and doubtful cough and then proceeded to say that rachael had been sent home with little master julian and that mistress deborah had been pleased to say she would walk on with miss bridgenorth as far as moultrassie holt which was a point at which the property of the major as matters now stood bounded that of sir geoffrey peveril  is the wench turned silly exclaimed the lady something angrily that she does not obey my orders and return at regular hours  she may be turning silly said ellesmere mysteriously or she may be turning too sly and i think it were as well your ladyship looked to it  looked to what ellesmere said the lady impatiently you are strangely oracular this morning if you know anything to the prejudice of this young woman i pray you speak it out  i prejudice said ellesmere i scorn to prejudice man woman or child in the way of a fellowservant only i wish your ladyship to look about you and use your own eyesthat is all  you bid me use my own eyes ellesmere but i suspect answered the lady you would be better pleased were i contented to see through your spectacles i charge youand you know i will be obeyedi charge you to tell me what you know or suspect about this girl deborah debbitch  i see through spectacles exclaimed the indignant abigail your ladyship will pardon me in that for i never use them unless a pair that belonged to my poor mother which i put on when your ladyship wants your pinners curiously wrought no woman above sixteen ever did whiteseam without barnacles and then as to suspecting i suspect nothing for as your ladyship hath taken mistress deborah debbitch from under my hand to be sure it is neither bread nor butter of mine only here she began to speak with her lips shut so as scarce to permit a sound to issue and mincing her words as if she pinched off the ends of them before she suffered them to escapeonly madam if mistress deborah goes so often of a morning to moultrassie holt why i should not be surprised if she should never find the way back again  once more what do you mean ellesmere you were wont to have some senselet me know distinctly what the matter is  only madam pursued the abigail that since bridgenorth came back from chesterfield and saw you at the castle hall mistress deborah has been pleased to carry the children every morning to that place and it has so happened that she has often met the major as they call him there in his walks for he can walk about now like other folks and i warrant you she hath not been the worse of the meetingone way at least for she hath bought a new hood might serve yourself madam but whether she hath had anything in hand besides a piece of money no doubt your ladyship is best judge  lady peveril who readily adopted the more goodnatured construction of the governantes motives could not help laughing at the idea of a man of bridgenorths precise appearance strict principles and reserved habits being suspected of a design of gallantry and readily concluded that mistress deborah had found her advantage in gratifying his parental affection by a frequent sight of his daughter during the few days which intervened betwixt his first seeing little alice at the castle and the events which had followed but she was somewhat surprised when an hour after the usual breakfast hour during which neither the child nor mistress deborah appeared major bridgenorths only manservant arrived at the castle on horseback dressed as for a journey and having delivered a letter addressed to herself and another to mistress ellesmere rode away without waiting any answer  there would have been nothing remarkable in this had any other person been concerned but major bridgenorth was so very quiet and orderly in all his proceedingsso little liable to act hastily or by impulse that the least appearance of bustle where he was concerned excited surprise and curiosity  lady peveril broke her letter hastily open and found that it contained the following lines    for the hands of the honourable and honoured lady peveril   these   madamplease it your ladyshipi write more to excuse myself to   your ladyship than to accuse either you or others in respect   that i am sensible it becomes our frail nature better to confess   our own imperfections than to complain of those of others   neither do i mean to speak of past times particularly in respect   of your worthy ladyship being sensible that if i have served you   in that period when our israel might be called triumphant you   have more than requited me in giving to my arms a child   redeemed as it were from the vale of the shadow of death and   therefore as i heartily forgive to your ladyship the unkind and   violent measure which you dealt to me at our last meeting seeing   that the woman who was the cause of strife is accounted one of   your kindred people i do entreat you in like manner to pardon   my enticing away from your service the young woman called deborah   debbitch whose direction is it may be indispensable to the   health of my dearest child i had purposed madam with your   gracious permission that alice should have remained at martindale   castle under your kind charge until she could so far discern   betwixt good and evil that it should be matter of conscience to   teach her the way in which she should go for it is not unknown to   your ladyship and in no way do i speak it reproachfully but   rather sorrowfully that a person so excellently gifted as   yourselfi mean touching natural qualitieshas not yet received   that true light which is a lamp to the paths but are contented   to stumble in darkness and among the graves of dead men it has   been my prayer in the watches of the night that your ladyship   should cease from the doctrine which causeth to err but i grieve   to say that our candlestick being about to be removed the land   will most likely be involved in deeper darkness than ever and the   return of the king to which i and many looked forward as a   manifestation of divine favour seems to prove little else than a   permitted triumph of the prince of the air who setteth about to   restore his vanityfair of bishops deans and such like   extruding the peaceful ministers of the word whose labours have   proved faithful to many hungry souls so hearing from a sure   hand that commission has gone forth to restore these dumb dogs   the followers of laud and of williams who were cast forth by the   late parliament and that an act of conformity or rather of   deformity of worship was to be expected it is my purpose to   flee from the wrath to come and to seek some corner where i may   dwell in peace and enjoy liberty of conscience for who would   abide in the sanctuary after the carved work thereof is broken   down and when it hath been made a place for owls and satyrs of   the wildernessand herein i blame myself madam that i went in   the singleness of my heart too readily into that carousing in the   house of feasting wherein my love of union and my desire to show   respect to your ladyship were made a snare to me but i trust it   will be an atonement that i am now about to absent myself from   the place of my birth and the house of my fathers as well as   from the place which holdeth the dust of those pledges of my   affection i have also to remember that in this land my honour   after the worldly estimation hath been abated and my utility   circumscribed by your husband sir geoffrey peveril and that   without any chance of my obtaining reparation at his hand whereby   i may say the hand of a kinsman was lifted up against my credit   and my life these things are bitter to the taste of the old adam   wherefore to prevent farther bickerings and it may be   bloodshed it is better that i leave this land for a time the   affairs which remain to be settled between sir geoffrey and   myself i shall place in the hand of the righteous master joachim   winthefight an attorney in chester who will arrange them with   such attention to sir geoffreys convenience as justice and the   due exercise of the law will permit for as i trust i shall   have grace to resist the temptation to make the weapons of carnal   warfare the instruments of my revenge so i scorn to effect it   through the means of mammon wishing madam that the lord may   grant you every blessing and in especial that which is over all   others namely the true knowledge of his way i remain your   devoted servant to command     ralph bridgenorth   written at moultrassie hall this tenth         day of july 1660   so soon as lady peveril had perused this long and singular homily in which it seemed to her that her neighbour showed more spirit of religious fanaticism than she could have supposed him possessed of she looked up and beheld ellesmerewith a countenance in which mortification and an affected air of contempt seemed to struggle togetherwho tired with watching the expression of her mistresss countenance applied for confirmation of her suspicions in plain terms  i suppose madam said the waitingwoman the fanatic fool intends to marry the wench they say he goes to shift the country truly its time indeed for besides that the whole neighbourhood would laugh him to scorn i should not be surprised if lance outram the keeper gave him a bucks head to bear for that is all in the way of his office  there is no great occasion for your spite at present ellesmere replied her lady my letter says nothing of marriage but it would appear that master bridgenorth being to leave this country has engaged deborah to take care of his child and i am sure i am heartily glad of it for the infants sake  and i am glad of it for my own said ellesmere and indeed for the sake of the whole houseand your ladyship thinks she is not like to be married to him troth i could never see how he should be such an idiot but perhaps she is going to do worse for she speaks here of coming to high preferment and that scarce comes by honest servitude nowadays then she writes me about sending her things as if i were mistress of the wardrobe to her ladyshipay and recommends master julian to the care of my age and experience forsooth as if she needed to recommend the dear little jewel to me and then to speak of my agebut i will bundle away her rags to the hall with a witness  do it with all civility said the lady and let whitaker send her the wages for which she has served and a broadpiece over and above for though a lightheaded young woman she was kind to the children  i know who is kind to their servants madam and would spoil the best ever pinned a gown  i spoiled a good one ellesmere when i spoiled thee said the lady but tell mistress deborah to kiss the little alice for me and to offer my good wishes to major bridgenorth for his temporal and future happiness  she permitted no observation or reply but dismissed her attendant without entering into farther particulars  when ellesmere had withdrawn lady peveril began to reflect with much feeling of compassion on the letter of major bridgenorth a person in whom there were certainly many excellent qualities but whom a series of domestic misfortunes and the increasing gloom of a sincere yet stern feeling of devotion rendered lonely and unhappy and she had more than one anxious thought for the happiness of the little alice brought up as she was likely to be under such a father still the removal of bridgenorth was on the whole a desirable event for while he remained at the hall it was but too likely that some accidental collision with sir geoffrey might give rise to a rencontre betwixt them more fatal than the last had been  in the meanwhile she could not help expressing to doctor dummerar her surprise and sorrow that all which she had done and attempted to establish peace and unanimity betwixt the contending factions had been perversely fated to turn out the very reverse of what she had aimed at  but for my unhappy invitation she said bridgenorth would not have been at the castle on the morning which succeeded the feast would not have seen the countess and would not have incurred the resentment and opposition of my husband and but for the kings return an event which was so anxiously expected as the termination of all our calamities neither the noble lady nor ourselves had been engaged in this new path of difficulty and danger  honoured madam said doctor dummerar were the affairs of this world to be guided implicitly by human wisdom or were they uniformly to fall out according to the conjectures of human foresight events would no longer be under the domination of that time and chance which happen unto all men since we should in the one case work out our own purposes to a certainty by our own skill and in the other regulate our conduct according to the views of unerring prescience but man is while in this vale of tears like an uninstructed bowler so to speak who thinks to attain the jack by delivering his bowl straight forward upon it being ignorant that there is a concealed bias within the spheroid which will make it in all probability swerve away and lose the cast  having spoken this with a sententious air the doctor took his shovelshaped hat and went down to the castle green to conclude a match of bowls with whitaker which had probably suggested this notable illustration of the uncertain course of human events  two days afterwards sir geoffrey arrived he had waited at vale royal till he heard of the countesss being safely embarked for man and then had posted homeward to his castle and dame margaret on his way he learned from some of his attendants the mode in which his lady had conducted the entertainment which she had given to the neighbourhood at his order and notwithstanding the great deference he usually showed in cases where lady peveril was concerned he heard of her liberality towards the presbyterian party with great indignation  i could have admitted bridgenorth he said for he always bore him in neighbourly and kindly fashion till this last careeri could have endured him so he would have drunk the kings health like a true manbut to bring that snuffling scoundrel solsgrace with all his beggarly longeared congregation to hold a conventicle in my fathers houseto let them domineer it as they listedwhy i would not have permitted them such liberty when they held their head the highest they never in the worst of times found any way into martindale castle but what nolls cannon made for them and that they should come and cant there when good king charles is returnedby my hand dame margaret shall hear of it  but notwithstanding these ireful resolutions resentment altogether subsided in the honest knights breast when he saw the fair features of his lady lightened with affectionate joy at his return in safety as he took her in his arms and kissed her he forgave her ere he mentioned her offence  thou hast played the knave with me meg he said shaking his head and smiling at the same time and thou knowest in what manner but i think thou art true churchwoman and didst only act from silly womanish fancy of keeping fair with these roguish roundheads but let me have no more of this i had rather martindale castle were again rent by their bullets than receive any of the knaves in the way of friendshipi always except ralph bridgenorth of the hall if he should come to his senses again  lady peveril was here under the necessity of explaining what she had heard of master bridgenorththe disappearance of the governante with his daughter and placed bridgenorths letter in his hand sir geoffrey shook his head at first and then laughed extremely at the idea that there was some little loveintrigue between bridgenorth and mistress deborah  it is the true end of a dissenter he said to marry his own maidservant or some other persons deborah is a good likely wench and on the merrier side of thirty as i should think  nay nay said the lady peveril you are as uncharitable as ellesmerei believe it but to be affection to his child  pshaw pshaw answered the knight women are eternally thinking of children but among men dame many one carresses the infant that he may kiss the childs maid and wheres the wonder or the harm either if bridgenorth should marry the wench her father is a substantial yeoman his family has had the same farm since bosworthfieldas good a pedigree as that of the greatgrandson of a chesterfield brewer i trow but let us hear what he says for himselfi shall spell it out if there is any roguery in the letter about love and liking though it might escape your innocence dame margaret  the knight of the peak began to peruse the letter accordingly but was much embarrassed by the peculiar language in which it was couched what he means by moving of candlesticks and breaking down of carved work in the church i cannot guess unless he means to bring back the large silver candlesticks which my grandsire gave to be placed on the altar at martindale moultrassie and which his cropeared friends like sacrilegious villains as they are stole and melted down and in like manner the only breaking i know of was when they pulled down the rails of the communion table for which some of their fingers are hot enough by this time and when the brass ornaments were torn down from peveril monuments and that was breaking and removing with a vengeance however dame the upshot is that poor bridgenorth is going to leave the neighbourhood i am truly sorry for it though i never saw him oftener than once a day and never spoke to him above two words but i see how it isthat little shake by the shoulder sticks in his stomach and yet meg i did but lift him out of the saddle as i might have lifted thee into it margareti was careful not to hurt him and i did not think him so tender in point of honour as to mind such a thing much but i see plainly where his sore lies and i warrant you i will manage that he stays at the hall and that you get back julians little companion faith i am sorry myself at the thought of losing the baby and of having to choose another ride when it is not hunting weather than round by the hall with a word at the window  i should be very glad sir geoffrey said the lady peveril that you could come to a reconciliation with this worthy man for such i must hold master bridgenorth to be  but for his dissenting principles as good a neighbour as ever lived said sir geoffrey  but i scarce see continued the lady any possibility of bringing about a conclusion so desirable  tush dame answered the knight thou knowest little of such matters i know the foot he halts upon and you shall see him go as sound as ever  lady peveril had from her sincere affection and sound sense as good a right to claim the full confidence of her husband as any woman in derbyshire and upon this occasion to confess the truth she had more anxiety to know his purpose than her sense of their mutual and separate duties permitted her in general to entertain she could not imagine what mode of reconciliation with his neighbour sir geoffrey no very acute judge of mankind or their peculiarities could have devised which might not be disclosed to her and she felt some secret anxiety lest the means resorted to might be so ill chosen as to render the breach rather wider but sir geoffrey would give no opening for farther inquiry he had been long enough colonel of a regiment abroad to value himself on the right of absolute command at home and to all the hints which his ladys ingenuity could devise and throw out he only answered patience dame margaret patience this is no case for thy handling thou shalt know enough ont byandby damego look to julian will the boy never have done crying for lack of that little sprout of a roundhead but we will have little alice back with us in two or three days and all will be well again  as the good knight spoke these words a post winded his horn in the court and a large packet was brought in addressed to the worshipful sir geoffrey peveril justice of the peace and so forth for he had been placed in authority as soon as the kings restoration was put upon a settled basis upon opening the packet which he did with no small feeling of importance he found that it contained the warrant which he had solicited for replacing doctor dummerar in the parish from which he had been forcibly ejected during the usurpation  few incidents could have given more delight to sir geoffrey he could forgive a stout ablebodied sectary or nonconformist who enforced his doctrines in the field by downright blows on the casques and cuirasses of himself and other cavaliers but he remembered with most vindictive accuracy the triumphant entrance of hugh peters through the breach of his castle and for his sake without nicely distinguishing betwixt sects or their teachers he held all who mounted a pulpit without warrant from the church of englandperhaps he might also in private except that of rometo be disturbers of the public tranquillityseducers of the congregation from their lawful preachersinstigators of the late civil warand men well disposed to risk the fate of a new one  then on the other hand besides gratifying his dislike to solsgrace he saw much satisfaction in the task of replacing his old friend and associate in sport and in danger the worthy doctor dummerar in his legitimate rights and in the ease and comforts of his vicarage he communicated the contents of the packet with great triumph to the lady who now perceived the sense of the mysterious paragraph in major bridgenorths letter concerning the removal of the candlestick and the extinction of light and doctrine in the land she pointed this out to sir geoffrey and endeavoured to persuade him that a door was now opened to reconciliation with his neighbour by executing the commission which he had received in an easy and moderate manner after due delay and with all respect to the feelings both of solsgrace and his congregation which circumstances admitted of this the lady argued would be doing no injury whatever to doctor dummerarnay might be the means of reconciling many to his ministry who might otherwise be disgusted with it for ever by the premature expulsion of a favourite preacher  there was much wisdom as well as moderation in this advice and at another time sir geoffrey would have sense enough to have adopted it but who can act composedly or prudently in the hour of triumph the ejection of mr solsgrace was so hastily executed as to give it some appearance of persecution though more justly considered it was the restoring of his predecessor to his legal rights solsgrace himself seemed to be desirous to make his sufferings as manifest as possible he held out to the last and on the sabbath after he had received intimation of his ejection attempted to make his way to the pulpit as usual supported by master bridgenorths attorney winthefight and a few zealous followers  just as their party came into the churchyard on the one side doctor dummerar dressed in full pontificals in a sort of triumphal procession accompanied by peveril of the peak sir jasper cranbourne and other cavaliers of distinction entered at the other  to prevent an actual struggle in the church the parish officers were sent to prevent the farther approach of the presbyterian minister which was effected without farther damage than a broken head inflicted by roger raine the drunken innkeeper of the peveril arms upon the presbyterian attorney of chesterfield  unsubdued in spirit though compelled to retreat by superior force the undaunted mr solsgrace retired to the vicarage where under some legal pretext which had been started by mr winthefight in that day unaptly named he attempted to maintain himselfbolted gatesbarred windowsand as report said though falsely made provision of firearms to resist the officers a scene of clamour and scandal accordingly took place which being reported to sir geoffrey he came in person with some of his attendants carrying armsforced the outergate and innerdoors of the house and proceeding to the study found no other garrison save the presbyterian parson with the attorney who gave up possession of the premises after making protestation against the violence that had been used  the rabble of the village being by this time all in motion sir geoffrey both in prudence and goodnature saw the propriety of escorting his prisoners for so they might be termed safely through the tumult and accordingly conveyed them in person through much noise and clamour as far as the avenue of moultrassie hall which they chose for the place of their retreat  but the absence of sir geoffrey gave the rein to some disorders which if present he would assuredly have restrained some of the ministers books were torn and flung about as treasonable and seditious trash by the zealous parishofficers or their assistants a quantity of his ale was drunk up in healths to the king and peveril of the peak and finally the boys who bore the exparson no goodwill for his tyrannical interference with their games at skittles football and so forth and moreover remembered the unmerciful length of his sermons dressed up an effigy with his geneva gown and band and his steeplecrowned hat which they paraded through the village and burned on the spot whilom occupied by a stately maypole which solsgrace had formerly hewed down with his own reverend hands  sir geoffrey was vexed at all this and sent to mr solsgrace offering satisfaction for the goods which he had lost but the calvinistical divine replied from a thread to a shoelatchet i will not take anything that is thine let the shame of the work of thy hands abide with thee  considerable scandal indeed arose against sir geoffrey peveril as having proceeded with indecent severity and haste upon this occasion and rumour took care to make the usual additions to the reality it was currently reported that the desperate cavalier peveril of the peak had fallen on a presbyterian congregation while engaged in the peaceable exercise of religion with a band of armed menhad slain some desperately wounded many more and finally pursued the preacher to his vicarage which he burned to the ground some alleged the clergyman had perished in the flames and the most mitigated report bore that he had only been able to escape by disposing his gown cap and band near a window in such a manner as to deceive them with the idea of his person being still surrounded by flames while he himself fled by the back part of the house and although few people believed in the extent of the atrocities thus imputed to our honest cavalier yet still enough of obloquy attached to him to infer very serious consequences as the reader will learn at a future period of our history     chapter ix               bessustis a challenge sir is it not              gentlemantis an inviting to the field                                            king and no king  for a day or two after this forcible expulsion from the vicarage mr solsgrace continued his residence at moultrassie hall where the natural melancholy attendant on his situation added to the gloom of the owner of the mansion in the morning the ejected divine made excursions to different families in the neighbourhood to whom his ministry had been acceptable in the days of his prosperity and from whose grateful recollections of that period he now found sympathy and consolation he did not require to be condoled with because he was deprived of an easy and competent maintenance and thrust out upon the common of life after he had reason to suppose he would be no longer liable to such mutations of fortune the piety of mr solsgrace was sincere and if he had many of the uncharitable prejudices against other sects which polemical controversy had generated and the civil war brought to a head he had also that deep sense of duty by which enthusiasm is so often dignified and held his very life little if called upon to lay it down in attestation of the doctrines in which he believed but he was soon to prepare for leaving the district which heaven he conceived had assigned to him as his corner of the vineyard he was to abandon his flock to the wolfwas to forsake those with whom he had held sweet counsel in religious communionwas to leave the recently converted to relapse into false doctrines and forsake the wavering whom his continued cares might have directed into the right paththese were of themselves deep causes of sorrow and were aggravated doubtless by those natural feelings with which all men especially those whose duties or habits have confined them to a limited circle regard the separation from wonted scenes and their accustomed haunts of solitary musing or social intercourse  there was indeed a plan of placing mr solsgrace at the head of a nonconforming congregation in his present parish which his followers would have readily consented to endow with a sufficient revenue but although the act for universal conformity was not yet passed such a measure was understood to be impending and there existed a general opinion among the presbyterians that in no hands was it likely to be more strictly enforced than in those of peveril of the peak solsgrace himself considered not only his personal danger as being considerablefor assuming perhaps more consequence than was actually attached to him or his productions he conceived the honest knight to be his mortal and determined enemybut he also conceived that he should serve the cause of his church by absenting himself from derbyshire  less known pastors he said though perhaps more worthy of the name may be permitted to assemble the scattered flocks in caverns or in secret wilds and to them shall the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim be better than the vintage of abiezer but i that have so often carried the banner forth against the mightyi whose tongue hath testified morning and evening like the watchman upon the tower against popery prelacy and the tyrant of the peakfor me to abide here were but to bring the sword of bloody vengeance amongst you that the shepherd might be smitten and the sheep scattered the shedders of blood have already assailed me even within that ground which they themselves call consecrated and yourselves have seen the scalp of the righteous broken as he defended my cause therefore i will put on my sandals and gird my loins and depart to a far country and there do as my duty shall call upon me whether it be to act or to sufferto bear testimony at the stake or in the pulpit  such were the sentiments which mr solsgrace expressed to his desponding friends and which he expatiated upon at more length with major bridgenorth not failing with friendly zeal to rebuke the haste which the latter had shown to thrust out the hand of fellowship to the amalekite woman whereby he reminded him he had been rendered her slave and bondsman for a season like samson betrayed by delilah and might have remained longer in the house of dagon had not heaven pointed to him a way out of the snare also it sprung originally from the majors going up to feast in the high place of baal that he who was the champion of the truth was stricken down and put to shame by the enemy even in the presence of the host  these objurgations seeming to give some offence to major bridgenorth who liked no better than any other man to hear of his own mishaps and at the same time to have them imputed to his own misconduct the worthy divine proceeded to take shame to himself for his own sinful compliance in that matter for to the vengeance justly due for that unhappy dinner at martindale castle which was he said a crying of peace when there was no peace and a dwelling in the tents of sin he imputed his ejection from his living with the destruction of some of his most pithy and highly prized volumes of divinity with the loss of his cap gown and band and a double hogshead of choice derby ale  the mind of major bridgenorth was strongly tinged with devotional feeling which his late misfortunes had rendered more deep and solemn and it is therefore no wonder that when he heard these arguments urged again and again by a pastor whom he so much respected and who was now a confessor in the cause of their joint faith he began to look back with disapproval on his own conduct and to suspect that he had permitted himself to be seduced by gratitude towards lady peveril and by her special arguments in favour of a mutual and tolerating liberality of sentiments into an action which had a tendency to compromise his religious and political principles  one morning as major bridgenorth had wearied himself with several details respecting the arrangement of his affairs he was reposing in the leathern easychair beside the latticed window a posture which by natural association recalled to him the memory of former times and the feelings with which he was wont to expect the recurring visit of sir geoffrey who brought him news of his childs welfaresurely he said thinking as it were aloud there was no sin in the kindness with which i then regarded that man  solsgrace who was in the apartment and guessed what passed through his friends mind acquainted as he was with every point of his history repliedwhen god caused elijah to be fed by ravens while hiding at the brook cherith we hear not of his fondling the unclean birds whom contrary to their ravening nature a miracle compelled to minister to him  it may be so answered bridgenorth yet the flap of their wings must have been gracious in the ear of the famished prophet like the tread of his horse in mine the ravens doubtless resumed their nature when the season was passed and even so it has fared with himhark he exclaimed starting i hear his horses hoof tramp even now  it was seldom that the echoes of that silent house and courtyard were awakened by the trampling of horses but such was now the case  both bridgenorth and solsgrace were surprised at the sound and even disposed to anticipate some farther oppression on the part of the government when the majors old servant introduced with little ceremony for his manners were nearly as plain as his masters a tall gentleman on the farther side of middle life whose vest and cloak long hair slouched hat and drooping feather announced him as a cavalier he bowed formally but courteously to both gentlemen and said that he was sir jasper cranbourne charged with an especial message to master ralph bridgenorth of moultrassie hall by his honourable friend sir geoffrey peveril of the peak and that he requested to know whether master bridgenorth would be pleased to receive his acquittal of commission here or elsewhere  anything which sir geoffrey peveril can have to say to me said major bridgenorth may be told instantly and before my friend from whom i have no secrets  the presence of any other friend were instead of being objectionable the thing in the world most to be desired said sir jasper after a moments hesitation and looking at mr solsgrace but this gentleman seems to be a sort of clergyman  i am not conscious of any secrets answered bridgenorth nor do i desire to have any in which a clergyman is unfitting confidant  at your pleasure replied sir jasper the confidence for aught i know may be well enough chosen for your divines always under your favour have proved no enemies to such matters as i am to treat with you upon  proceed sir answered mr bridgenorth gravely and i pray you to be seated unless it is rather your pleasure to stand  i must in the first place deliver myself of my small commission answered sir jasper drawing himself up and it will be after i have seen the reception thereof that i shall know whether i am or am not to sit down at moultrassie hallsir geoffrey peveril master bridgenorth hath carefully considered with himself the unhappy circumstances which at present separate you as neighbours and he remembers many passages in former timesi speak his very wordswhich incline him to do all that can possibly consist with his honour to wipe out unkindness between you and for this desirable object he is willing to condescend in a degree which as you could not have expected it will no doubt give you great pleasure to learn  allow me to say sir jasper said bridgenorth that this is unnecessary i have made no complaints of sir geoffreyi have required no submission from himi am about to leave this country and what affairs we may have together can be as well settled by others as by ourselves  in a word said the divine the worthy major bridgenorth hath had enough of trafficking with the ungodly and will no longer on any terms consort with them  gentleman both said sir jasper with imperturbable politeness bowing you greatly mistake the tenor of my commission which you will do as well to hear out before making any reply to iti think master bridgenorth you cannot but remember your letter to the lady peveril of which i have here a rough copy in which you complain of the hard measure which you have received at sir geoffreys hand and in particular when he pulled you from your horse at or near hartleynick now sir geoffrey thinks so well of you as to believe that were it not for the wide difference betwixt his descent and rank and your own you would have sought to bring this matter to a gentlemanlike arbitrament as the only mode whereby your stain may be honourably wiped away wherefore in this slight note he gives you in his generosity the offer of what you in your modesty for to nothing else does he impute your acquiescence have declined to demand of him and withal i bring you the measure of his weapon and when you have accepted the cartel which i now offer you i shall be ready to settle the time place and other circumstances of your meeting  and i said solsgrace with a solemn voice should the author of evil tempt my friend to accept of so bloodthirsty a proposal would be the first to pronounce against him sentence of the greater excommunication  it is not you whom i address reverend sir replied the envoy your interest not unnaturally may determine you to be more anxious about your patrons life than about his honour i must know from himself to which he is disposed to give the preference  so saying and with a graceful bow he again tendered the challenge to major bridgenorth there was obviously a struggle in that gentlemans bosom between the suggestions of human honour and those of religious principle but the latter prevailed he calmly waived receiving the paper which sir jasper offered to him and spoke to the following purposeit may not be known to you sir jasper that since the general pouring out of christian light upon this kingdom many solid men have been led to doubt whether the shedding human blood by the hand of a fellowcreature be in any respect justifiable and although this rule appears to me to be scarcely applicable to our state in this stage of trial seeing that such nonresistance if general would surrender our civil and religious rights into the hands of whatsoever daring tyrants might usurp the same yet i am and have been inclined to limit the use of carnal arms to the case of necessary selfdefence whether such regards our own person or the protection of our country against invasion or of our rights of property and the freedom of our laws and of our conscience against usurping power and as i have never shown myself unwilling to draw my sword in any of the latter causes so you shall excuse my suffering it now to remain in the scabbard when having sustained a grievous injury the man who inflicted it summons me to combat either upon an idle punctilio or as is more likely in mere bravado  i have heard you with patience said sir jasper and now master bridgenorth take it not amiss if i beseech you to bethink yourself better on this matter i vow to heaven sir that your honour lies ableeding and that in condescending to afford you this fair meeting and thereby giving you some chance to stop its wounds sir geoffrey has been moved by a tender sense of your condition and an earnest wish to redeem your dishonour and it will be but the crossing of your blade with his honoured sword for the space of some few minutes and you will either live or die a noble and honoured gentleman besides that the knights exquisite skill of fence may enable him as his goodnature will incline him to disarm you with some flesh wound little to the damage of your person and greatly to the benefit of your reputation  the tender mercies of the wicked said master solsgrace emphatically by way of commenting on this speech which sir jasper had uttered very pathetically are cruel  i pray to have no farther interruption from your reverence said sir jasper especially as i think this affair very little concerns you and i entreat that you permit me to discharge myself regularly of my commission from my worthy friend  so saying he took his sheathed rapier from his belt and passing the point through the silk thread which secured the letter he once more and literally at sword point gracefully tendered it to major bridgenorth who again waved it aside though colouring deeply at the same time as if he was putting a marked constraint upon himselfdrew back and made sir jasper cranbourne a deep bow  since it is to be thus said sir jasper i must myself do violence to the seal of sir geoffreys letter and read it to you that i may fully acquit myself of the charge entrusted to me and make you master bridgenorth equally aware of the generous intentions of sir geoffrey on your behalf  if said major bridgenorth the contents of the letter be to no other purpose than you have intimated methinks farther ceremony is unnecessary on this occasion as i have already taken my course  nevertheless said sir jasper breaking open the letter it is fitting that i read to you the letter of my worshipful friend and he read accordingly as follows          for the worthy hands of ralph bridgenorth esquire of                       moultrassie hallthese         by the honoured conveyance of the worshipful sir jasper                cranbourne knight of longmallington   master bridgenorthwe have been given to understand by your   letter to our loving wife dame margaret peveril that you hold   hard construction of certain passages betwixt you and i of a late   date as if your honour should have been in some sort prejudiced   by what then took place and although you have not thought it fit   to have direct recourse to me to request such satisfaction as is   due from one gentleman of condition to another yet i am fully   minded that this proceeds only from modesty arising out of the   distinction of our degree and from no lack of that courage which   you have heretofore displayed i would i could say in a good   cause wherefore i am purposed to give you by my friend sir   jasper cranbourne a meeting for the sake of doing that which   doubtless you entirely long for sir jasper will deliver you the   length of my weapon and appoint circumstances and an hour for our   meeting which whether early or lateon foot or horsebackwith   rapier or backswordi refer to yourself with all the other   privileges of a challenged person only desiring that if you   decline to match my weapon you will send me forthwith the length   and breadth of your own and nothing doubting that the issue of   this meeting must needs be to end in one way or other all   unkindness betwixt two near neighboursi remain your humble   servant to command                                     geoffrey peveril of the peak   given from my poor house of martindale castle this same  of    sixteen hundred and sixty   bear back my respects to sir geoffrey peveril said major bridgenorth according to his light his meaning may be fair towards me but tell him that our quarrel had its rise in his own wilful aggression towards me and that though i wish to be in charity with all mankind i am not so wedded to his friendship as to break the laws of god and run the risk of suffering or committing murder in order to regain it and for you sir methinks your advanced years and past misfortunes might teach you the folly of coming on such idle errands  i shall do your message master ralph bridgenorth said sir jasper and shall then endeavour to forget your name as a sound unfit to be pronounced or even remembered by a man of honour in the meanwhile in return for your uncivil advice be pleased to accept of mine namely that as your religion prevents your giving a gentleman satisfaction it ought to make you very cautious of offering him provocation  so saying and with a look of haughty scorn first at the major and then at the divine the envoy of sir geoffrey put his hat on his head replaced his rapier in its belt and left the apartment in a few minutes afterwards the tread of his horse died away at a considerable distance  bridgenorth had held his hand upon his brow ever since his departure and a tear of anger and shame was on his face as he raised it when the sound was heard no more he carries this answer to martindale castle he said men will hereafter think of me as a whipped beaten dishonourable fellow whom every one may baffle and insult at their pleasure it is well i am leaving the house of my father  master solsgrace approached his friend with much sympathy and grasped him by the hand noble brother he said with unwonted kindness of manner though a man of peace i can judge what this sacrifice hath cost to thy manly spirit but god will not have from us an imperfect obedience we must not like ananias and sapphira reserve behind some darling lust some favourite sin while we pretend to make sacrifice of our worldly affections what avails it to say that we have but secreted a little matter if the slightest remnant of the accursed thing remain hidden in our tent would it be a defence in thy prayers to say i have not murdered this man for the lucre of gain like a robbernor for the acquisition of power like a tyrantnor for the gratification of revenge like a darkened savage but because the imperious voice of worldly honour said go forthkill or be killedis it not i that have sent thee bethink thee my worthy friend how thou couldst frame such a vindication in thy prayers and if thou art forced to tremble at the blasphemy of such an excuse remember in thy prayers the thanks due to heaven which enabled thee to resist the strong temptation  reverend and dear friend answered bridgenorth i feel that you speak the truth bitterer indeed and harder to the old adam is the text which ordains him to suffer shame than that which bids him to do valiantly for the truth but happy am i that my path through the wilderness of this world will for some space at least be along with one whose zeal and friendship are so active to support me when i am fainting in the way  while the inhabitants of moultrassie hall thus communicated together upon the purport of sir jasper cranbournes visit that worthy knight greatly excited the surprise of sir geoffrey peveril by reporting the manner in which his embassy had been received  i took him for a man of other metal said sir geoffreynay i would have sworn it had any one asked my testimony but there is no making a silken purse out of a sows ear i have done a folly for him that i will never do for another and that is to think a presbyterian would fight without his preachers permission give them a two hours sermon and let them howl a psalm to a tune that is worse than the cries of a flogged hound and the villains will lay on like threshers but for a calm cool gentlemanlike turn upon the sod hand to hand in a neighbourly way they have not honour enough to undertake it but enough of our cropeared cur of a neighboursir jasper you will tarry with us to dine and see how dame margarets kitchen smokes and after dinner i will show you a longwinged falcon fly she is not mine but the countesss who brought her from london on her fist almost the whole way for all the haste she was in and left her with me to keep the perch for a season  this match was soon arranged and dame margaret overheard the good knights resentment mutter itself off with those feelings with which we listen to the last growling of the thunderstorm which as the black cloud sinks beneath the hill at once assures us that there has been danger and that the peril is over she could not indeed but marvel in her own mind at the singular path of reconciliation with his neighbour which her husband had with so much confidence and in the actual sincerity of his goodwill to mr bridgenorth attempted to open and she blessed god internally that it had not terminated in bloodshed but these reflections she locked carefully within her own bosom well knowing that they referred to subjects in which the knight of the peak would neither permit his sagacity to be called in question nor his will to be controlled  the progress of the history hath hitherto been slow but after this period so little matter worth of mark occurred at martindale that we must hurry over hastily the transactions of several years     chapter x                cleopatragive me to drink mandragora               that i may sleep away this gap of time                                        antony and cleopatra  there passed as we hinted at the conclusion of the last chapter four or five years after the period we have dilated upon the events of which scarcely require to be discussed so far as our present purpose is concerned in as many lines the knight and his lady continued to reside at their castleshe with prudence and with patience endeavouring to repair the damages which the civil wars had inflicted upon their fortune and murmuring a little when her plans of economy were interrupted by the liberal hospitality which was her husbands principal expense and to which he was attached not only from his own english heartiness of disposition but from ideas of maintaining the dignity of his ancestryno less remarkable according to the tradition of their buttery kitchen and cellar for the fat beeves which they roasted and the mighty ale which they brewed than for their extensive estates and the number of their retainers  the world however upon the whole went happily and easily with the worthy couple sir geoffreys debt to his neighbour bridgenorth continued it is true unabated but he was the only creditor upon the martindale estateall others being paid off it would have been most desirable that this encumbrance also should be cleared and it was the great object of dame margarets economy to effect the discharge for although interest was regularly settled with master winthefight the chesterfield attorney yet the principal sum which was a large one might be called for at an inconvenient time the man too was gloomy important and mysterious and always seemed as if he was thinking upon his broken head in the churchyard of martindalecummoultrassie  dame margaret sometimes transacted the necessary business with him in person and when he came to the castle on these occasions she thought she saw a malicious and disobliging expression in his manner and countenance yet his actual conduct was not only fair but liberal for indulgence was given in the way of delay of payment whenever circumstances rendered it necessary to the debtor to require it it seemed to lady peveril that the agent in such cases was acting under the strict orders of his absent employer concerning whose welfare she could not help feeling a certain anxiety  shortly after the failure of the singular negotiation for attaining peace by combat which peveril had attempted to open with major bridgenorth that gentleman left his seat of moultrassie hall in the care of his old housekeeper and departed no one knew whither having in company with him his daughter alice and mrs deborah debbitch now formally installed in all the duties of a governante to these was added the reverend master solsgrace for some time public rumour persisted in asserting that major bridgenorth had only retreated to a distant part of the country for a season to achieve his supposed purpose of marrying mrs deborah and of letting the news be cold and the laugh of the neighbourhood be ended ere he brought her down as mistress of moultrassie hall this rumour died away and it was then affirmed that he had removed to foreign parts to ensure the continuance of health in so delicate a constitution as that of little alice but when the majors dread of popery was remembered together with the still deeper antipathies of worthy master nehemiah solsgrace it was resolved unanimously that nothing less than what they might deem a fair chance of converting the pope would have induced the parties to trust themselves within catholic dominions the most prevailing opinion was that they had gone to new england the refuge then of many whom too intimate concern with the affairs of the late times or the desire of enjoying uncontrolled freedom of conscience had induced to emigrate from britain  lady peveril could not help entertaining a vague idea that bridgenorth was not so distant the extreme order in which everything was maintained at moultrassie hall seemedno disparagement to the care of dame dickens the housekeeper and the other persons engagedto argue that the masters eye was not so very far off but that its occasional inspection might be apprehended it is true that neither the domestics nor the attorney answered any questions respecting the residence of master bridgenorth but there was an air of mystery about them when interrogated that seemed to argue more than met the ear  about five years after master bridgenorth had left the country a singular incident took place sir geoffrey was absent at the chesterfield races and lady peveril who was in the habit of walking around every part of the neighbourhood unattended or only accompanied by ellesmere or her little boy had gone down one evening upon a charitable errand to a solitary hut whose inhabitant lay sick of a fever which was supposed to be infectious lady peveril never allowed apprehensions of this kind to stop devoted charitable deeds but she did not choose to expose either her son or her attendant to the risk which she herself in some confidence that she knew precautions for escaping the danger did not hesitate to incur  lady peveril had set out at a late hour in the evening and the way proved longer than she expectedseveral circumstances also occurred to detain her at the hut of her patient it was a broad autumn moonlight when she prepared to return homeward through the broken glades and upland which divided her from the castle this she considered as a matter of very little importance in so quiet and sequestered a country where the road lay chiefly through her own domains especially as she had a lad about fifteen years old the son of her patient to escort her on the way the distance was better than two miles but might be considerably abridged by passing through an avenue belonging to the estate of moultrassie hall which she had avoided as she came not from the ridiculous rumours which pronounced it to be haunted but because her husband was much displeased when any attempt was made to render the walks of the castle and hall common to the inhabitants of both the good lady in consideration perhaps of extensive latitude allowed to her in the more important concerns of the family made a point of never interfering with her husbands whims or prejudices and it is a compromise which we would heartily recommend to all managing matrons of our acquaintance for it is surprising how much real power will be cheerfully resigned to the fair sex for the pleasure of being allowed to ride ones hobby in peace and quiet  upon the present occasion however although the dobbys walk was within the inhabited domains of the hall the lady peveril determined to avail herself of it for the purpose of shortening her road home and she directed her steps accordingly but when the peasantboy her companion who had hitherto followed her whistling cheerily with a hedgebill in his hand and his hat on one side perceived that she turned to the stile which entered to the dobbys walk he showed symptoms of great fear and at length coming to the ladys side petitioned her in a whimpering tonedont ye nowdont ye now my lady dont ye go yonder   dobby an old english name for goblin  lady peveril observing that his teeth chattered in his head and that his whole person exhibited great signs of terror began to recollect the report that the first squire of moultrassie the brewer of chesterfield who had brought the estate and then died of melancholy for lack of something to do and as was said not without suspicions of suicide was supposed to walk in this sequestered avenue accompanied by a large headless mastiff which when he was alive was a particular favourite of the exbrewer to have expected any protection from her escort in the condition to which superstitious fear had reduced him would have been truly a hopeless trust and lady peveril who was not apprehensive of any danger thought there would be great cruelty in dragging the cowardly boy into a scene which he regarded with so much apprehension she gave him therefore a silver piece and permitted him to return the latter boon seemed even more acceptable than the first for ere she could return the purse into her pocket she heard the wooden clogs of her bold convoy in full retreat by the way from whence they came  smiling within herself at the fear she esteemed so ludicrous lady peveril ascended the stile and was soon hidden from the broad light of the moonbeams by the numerous and entangled boughs of the huge elms which meeting from either side totally overarched the old avenue the scene was calculated to excite solemn thoughts and the distant glimmer of a light from one of the numerous casements in the front of moultrassie hall which lay at some distance was calculated to make them even melancholy she thought of the fate of that familyof the deceased mrs bridgenorth with whom she had often walked in this very avenue and who though a woman of no high parts or accomplishments had always testified the deepest respect and the most earnest gratitude for such notice as she had shown to her she thought of her blighted hopesher premature deaththe despair of her selfbanished husbandthe uncertain fate of their orphan child for whom she felt even at this distance of time some touch of a mothers affection  upon such sad subjects her thoughts were turned when just as she attained the middle of the avenue the imperfect and checkered light which found its way through the silvan archway showed her something which resembled the figure of a man lady peveril paused a moment but instantly advancedher bosom perhaps gave one startled throb as a debt to the superstitious belief of the times but she instantly repelled the thought of supernatural appearances from those that were merely mortal she had nothing to fear a marauder on the game was the worst character whom she was likely to encounter and he would be sure to hide himself from her observation she advanced accordingly steadily and as she did so had the satisfaction to observe that the figure as she expected gave place to her and glided away amongst the trees on the lefthand side of the avenue as she passed the spot on which the form had been so lately visible and bethought herself that this wanderer of the night might nay must be in her vicinity her resolution could not prevent her mending her pace and that with so little precaution that stumbling over the limb of a tree which twisted off by a late tempest still lay in the avenue she fell and as she fell screamed aloud a strong hand in a moment afterwards added to her fears by assisting her to rise and a voice to whose accents she was not a stranger though they had been long unheard said is it not you lady peveril  it is i said she commanding her astonishment and fear and if my ear deceive me not i speak to master bridgenorth  i was that man said he while oppression left me a name  he spoke nothing more but continued to walk beside her for a minute or two in silence she felt her situation embarrassing and to divest it of that feeling as well as out of real interest in the question she asked him how her goddaughter alice now was  of goddaughter madam answered major bridgenorth i know nothing that being one of the names which have been introduced to the corruption and pollution of gods ordinances the infant who owed to your ladyship so called her escape from disease and death is a healthy and thriving girl as i am given to understand by those in whose charge she is lodged for i have not lately seen her and it is even the recollection of these passages which in a manner impelled me alarmed also by your fall to offer myself to you at this time and mode which in other respects is no way consistent with my present safety  with your safety master bridgenorth said the lady peveril surely i could never have thought that it was in danger  you have some news then yet to learn madam said major bridgenorth but you will hear in the course of tomorrow reasons why i dare not appear openly in the neighbourhood of my own property and wherefore there is small judgment in committing the knowledge of my present residence to any one connected with martindale castle  master bridgenorth said the lady you were in former times prudent and cautiousi hope you have been misled by no hasty impressionby no rash schemei hope  pardon my interrupting you madam said bridgenorth i have indeed been changeday my very heart within me hath been changed in the times to which your ladyship so called thinks proper to refer i was a man of this worldbestowing on it all my thoughtsall my actions save formal observanceslittle deeming what was the duty of a christian man and how far his selfdenial ought to extendeven unto his giving all as if he gave nothing hence i thought chiefly on carnal thingson the adding of field to field and wealth to wealthof balancing between party and partysecuring a friend here without losing a friend therebut heaven smote me for my apostasy the rather that i abused the name of religion as a selfseeker and a most blinded and carnal willworshipperbut i thank him who hath at length brought me out of egypt  in our dayalthough we have many instances of enthusiasm among uswe might still suspect one who avowed it thus suddenly and broadly of hypocrisy or of insanity but according to the fashion of the times such opinions as those which bridgenorth expressed were openly pleaded as the ruling motives of mens actions the sagacious vanethe brave and skilful harrisonwere men who acted avowedly under the influence of such lady peveril therefore was more grieved than surprised at the language she heard major bridgenorth use and reasonably concluded that the society and circumstances in which he might lately have been engaged had blown into a flame the spark of eccentricity which always smouldered in his bosom this was the more probable considering that he was melancholy by constitution and descentthat he had been unfortunate in several particularsand that no passion is more easily nursed by indulgence than the species of enthusiasm of which he now showed tokens she therefore answered him by calmly hoping that the expression of his sentiments had not involved him in suspicion or in danger  in suspicion madam answered the majorfor i cannot forbear giving to you such is the strength of habit one of those idle titles by which we poor potsherds are wont in our pride to denominate each otheri walk not only in suspicion but in that degree of danger that were your husband to meet me at this instantme a native englishman treading on my own landsi have no doubt he would do his best to offer me to the moloch of roman superstition who now rages abroad for victims among gods people  you surprise me by your language major bridgenorth said the lady who now felt rather anxious to be relieved from his company and with that purpose walked on somewhat hastily he mended his pace however and kept close by her side  know you not said he that satan hath come down upon earth with great wrath because his time is short the next heir to the crown is an avowed papist and who dare assert save sycophants and timeservers that he who wears it is not equally ready to stoop to rome were he not kept in awe by a few noble spirits in the commons house you believe not thisyet in my solitary and midnight walks when i thought on your kindness to the dead and to the living it was my prayer that i might have the means granted to warn youand lo heaven hath heard me  what i was while in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity it signifies not to recall answered he i was then like to gallio who cared for none of these things i doted on creature comfortsi clung to worldly honour and reputemy thoughts were earthwardor those i turned to heaven were cold formal pharisaical meditationsi brought nothing to the altar save straw and stubble heaven saw need to chastise me in lovei was stript of all i clung to on earthmy worldly honour was torn from mei went forth an exile from the home of my fathers a deprived and desolate mana baffled and beaten and dishonoured man but who shall find out the ways of providence such were the means by which i was chosen forth as a champion for the truthholding my life as nothing if thereby that may be advanced but this was not what i wished to speak of thou hast saved the earthly life of my childlet me save the eternal welfare of yours  lady peveril was silent they were now approaching the point where the avenue terminated in a communication with a public road or rather pathway running through an unenclosed common field this the lady had to prosecute for a little way until a turn of the path gave her admittance into the park of martindale she now felt sincerely anxious to be in the open moonshine and avoided reply to bridgenorth that she might make the more haste but as they reached the junction of the avenue and the public road he laid his hand on her arm and commanded rather than requested her to stop she obeyed he pointed to a huge oak of the largest size which grew on the summit of a knoll in the open ground which terminated the avenue and was exactly so placed as to serve for a termination to the vista the moonshine without the avenue was so strong that amidst the flood of light which it poured on the venerable tree they could easily discover from the shattered state of the boughs on one side that it had suffered damage from lightning remember you he said when we last looked together on that tree i had ridden from london and brought with me a protection from the committee for your husband and as i passed the spothere on this spot where we now stand you stood with my lost alicetwothe last two of my beloved infants gambolled before you i leaped from my horseto her i was a husbandto those a fatherto you a welcome and revered protectorwhat am i now to any one he pressed his hand on his brow and groaned in agony of spirit  it was not in the lady peverils nature to hear sorrow without an attempt at consolation master bridgenorth she said i blame no mans creed while i believe and follow my own and i rejoice that in yours you have sought consolation for temporal afflictions but does not every christian creed teach us alike that affliction should soften our heart  ay woman said bridgenorth sternly as the lightning which shattered yonder oak hath softened its trunk no the seared wood is the fitter for the use of the workmenthe hardened and the driedup heart is that which can best bear the task imposed by these dismal times god and man will no longer endure the unbridled profligacy of the dissolutethe scoffing of the profanethe contempt of the divine lawsthe infraction of human rights the times demand righters and avengers and there will be no want of them  i deny not the existence of much evil said lady peveril compelling herself to answer and beginning at the same time to walk forward and from hearsay though not i thank heaven from observation i am convinced of the wild debauchery of the times but let us trust it may be corrected without such violent remedies as you hint at surely the ruin of a second civil warthough i trust your thoughts go not that dreadful lengthwere at best a desperate alternative  sharp but sure replied bridgenorth the blood of the paschal lamb chased away the destroying angelthe sacrifices offered on the threshingfloor of araunah stayed the pestilence fire and sword are severe remedies but they pure and purify  alas major bridgenorth said the lady wise and moderate in your youth can you have adopted in your advanced life the thoughts and language of those whom you yourself beheld drive themselves and the nation to the brink of ruin  i know not what i then wasyou know not what i now am he replied and suddenly broke off for they even then came forth into the open light and it seemed as if feeling himself under the ladys eye he was disposed to soften his tone and his language  at the first distinct view which she had of his person she was aware that he was armed with a short sword a poniard and pistols at his beltprecautions very unusual for a man who formerly had seldom and only on days of ceremony carried a walking rapier though such was the habitual and constant practice of gentlemen of his station in life there seemed also something of more stern determination than usual in his air which indeed had always been rather sullen than affable and ere she could repress the sentiment she could not help saying master bridgenorth you are indeed changed  you see but the outward man he replied the change within is yet deeper but it was not of myself that i desired to talki have already said that as you have preserved my child from the darkness of the grave i would willingly preserve yours from that more utter darkness which i fear hath involved the path and walks of his father  i must not hear this of sir geoffrey said the lady peveril i must bid you farewell for the present and when we again meet at a more suitable time i will at least listen to your advice concerning julian although i should not perhaps incline to it  that more suitable time may never come replied bridgenorth time wanes eternity draws nigh hearken it is said to be your purpose to send the young julian to be bred up in yonder bloody island under the hand of your kinswoman that cruel murderess by whom was done to death a man more worthy of vital existence than any that she can boast among her vaunted ancestry these are current tidingsare they true  i do not blame you master bridgenorth for thinking harshly of my cousin of derby said lady peveril nor do i altogether vindicate the rash action of which she hath been guilty nevertheless in her habitation it is my husbands opinion and my own that julian may be trained in the studies and accomplishments becoming his rank along with the young earl of derby  under the curse of god and the blessing of the pope of rome said bridgenorth you lady so quicksighted in matters of earthly prudence are you blind to the gigantic pace at which rome is moving to regain this country once the richest gem in her usurped tiara the old are seduced by goldthe youth by pleasurethe weak by flatterycowards by fearand the courageous by ambition a thousand baits for each taste and each bait concealing the same deadly hook  i am well aware master bridgenorth said lady peveril that my kinswoman is a catholic but her son is educated in the church of englands principles agreeably to the command of her deceased husband        i have elsewhere noticed that this is a deviation from      the truth   charlotte countess of derby was a huguenot  is it likely answered bridgenorth that she who fears not shedding the blood of the righteous whether on the field or scaffold will regard the sanction of her promise when her religion bids her break it or if she does what shall your son be the better if he remain in the mire of his father what are your episcopal tenets but mere popery save that ye have chosen a temporal tyrant for your pope and substitute a mangled mass in english for that which your predecessors pronounced in latinbut why speak i of these things to one who hath ears indeed and eyes yet cannot see listen to or understand what is alone worthy to be heard seen and known pity that what hath been wrought so fair and exquisite in form and disposition should be yet blind deaf and ignorant like the things which perish  we shall not agree on these subjects master bridgenorth said the lady anxious still to escape from this strange conference though scarce knowing what to apprehend once more i must bid you farewell  stay yet an instant he said again laying his hand on her arm i would stop you if i saw you rushing on the brink of an actual precipicelet me prevent you from a danger still greater how shall i work upon your unbelieving mind shall i tell you that the debt of bloodshed yet remains a debt to be paid by the bloody house of derby and wilt thou send thy son to be among those from whom it shall be exacted  you wish to alarm me in vain master bridgenorth answered the lady what penalty can be exacted from the countess for an action which i have already called a rash one has been long since levied  you deceive yourself retorted he sternly think you a paltry sum of money given to be wasted on the debaucheries of charles can atone for the death of such a man as christiana man precious alike to heaven and to earth not on such terms is the blood of the righteous to be poured forth every hours delay is numbered down as adding interest to the grievous debt which will one day be required from that bloodthirsty woman  at this moment the distant tread of horses was heard on the road on which they held this singular dialogue bridgenorth listened a moment and then said forget that you have seen mename not my name to your nearest or dearestlock my counsel in your breastprofit by it and it shall be well with you  so saying he turned from her and plunging through a gap in the fence regained the cover of his own wood along which the path still led  the noise of horses advancing at full trot now came nearer and lady peveril was aware of several riders whose forms rose indistinctly on the summit of the rising ground behind her she became also visible to them and one or two of the foremost made towards her at increased speed challenging her as they advanced with the cry of stand who goes there the foremost who came up however exclaimed mercy on us if it be not my lady and lady peveril at the same moment recognised one of her own servants her husband rode up immediately afterwards with how now dame margaret what makes you abroad so far from home and at an hour so late  lady peveril mentioned her visit at the cottage but did not think it necessary to say aught of having seen major bridgenorth afraid it may be that her husband might be displeased with that incident  charity is a fine thing and a fair answered sir geoffrey but i must tell you you do ill dame to wander about the country like a quacksalver at the call of every old woman who has a colicfit and at this time of night especially and when the land is so unsettled besides  i am sorry to hear that it so said the lady i had heard no such news  news repeated sir geoffrey why here has a new plot broken out among the roundheads worse than venners by a butts length and who should be so deep in it as our old neighbour bridgenorth there is search for him everywhere and i promise you if he is found he is like to pay old scores   the celebrated insurrection of the anabaptists and fifth monarchy     men in london in the year 1661  then i am sure i trust he will not be found said lady peveril  do you so replied sir geoffrey now i on my part hope that he will and it shall not be my fault if he be not for which effect i will presently ride down to moultrassie and make strict search according to my duty there shall neither rebel nor traitor earth so near martindale castle that i will assure them and you my lady be pleased for once to dispense with a pillion and get up as you have done before behind saunders who shall convey you safe home  the lady obeyed in silence indeed she did not dare to trust her voice in an attempt to reply so much was she disconcerted with the intelligence she had just heard  she rode behind the groom to the castle where she awaited in great anxiety the return of her husband he came back at length but to her great relief without any prisoner he then explained more fully than his haste had before permitted that an express had come down to chesterfield with news from court of a proposed insurrection amongst the old commonwealth men especially those who had served in the army and that bridgenorth said to be lurking in derbyshire was one of the principal conspirators  after some time this report of a conspiracy seemed to die away like many others of that period the warrants were recalled but nothing more was seen or heard of major bridgenorth although it is probable he might safely enough have shown himself as openly as many did who lay under the same circumstances of suspicion  about this time also lady peveril with many tears took a temporary leave of her son julian who was sent as had long been intended for the purpose of sharing the education of the young earl of derby although the boding words of bridgenorth sometimes occurred to lady peverils mind she did not suffer them to weigh with her in opposition to the advantages which the patronage of the countess of derby secured to her son  the plan seemed to be in every respect successful and when from time to time julian visited the house of his father lady peveril had the satisfaction to see him on every occasion improved in person and in manner as well as ardent in the pursuit of more solid acquirements in process of time he became a gallant and accomplished youth and travelled for some time upon the continent with the young earl this was the more especially necessary for the enlarging of their acquaintance with the world because the countess had never appeared in london or at the court of king charles since her flight to the isle of man in 1660 but had resided in solitary and aristocratic state alternately on her estates in england and in that island  this had given to the education of both the young men otherwise as excellent as the best teachers could render it something of a narrow and restricted character but though the disposition of the young earl was lighter and more volatile than that of julian both the one and the other had profited in a considerable degree by the opportunities afforded them it was lady derbys strict injunction to her son now returning from the continent that he should not appear at the court of charles but having been for some time of age he did not think it absolutely necessary to obey her in this particular and had remained for some time in london partaking the pleasures of the gay court there with all the ardour of a young man bred up in comparative seclusion  in order to reconcile the countess to this transgression of her authority for he continued to entertain for her the profound respect in which he had been educated lord derby agreed to make a long sojourn with her in her favourite island which he abandoned almost entirely to her management  julian peveril had spent at martindale castle a good deal of the time which his friend had bestowed in london and at the period to which passing over many years our story has arrived as it were per saltum they were both living as the countesss guests in the castle of rushin in the venerable kingdom of man     chapter xi               monalong hid from those who roam the main                                                    collins  the isle of man in the middle of the seventeenth century was very different as a place of residence from what it is now men had not then discovered its merit as a place of occasional refuge from the storms of life and the society to be there met with was of a very uniform tenor there were no smart fellows whom fortune had tumbled from the seat of their barouchesno plucked pigeons or winged rooksno disappointed speculatorsno ruined minersin short no one worth talking to the society of the island was limited to the natives themselves and a few merchants who lived by contraband trade the amusements were rare and monotonous and the mercurial young earl was soon heartily tired of his dominions the islanders also become too wise for happiness had lost relish for the harmless and somewhat childish sports in which their simple ancestors had indulged themselves may was no longer ushered in by the imaginary contest between the queen of returning winter and advancing spring the listeners no longer sympathised with the lively music of the followers of the one or the discordant sounds with which the other asserted a more noisy claim to attention christmas too closed and the steeples no longer jangled forth a dissonant peal the wren to seek for which used to be the sport dedicated to the holytide was left unpursued and unslain party spirit had come among these simple people and destroyed their good humour while it left them their ignorance even the races a sport generally interesting to people of all ranks were no longer performed because they were no longer interesting the gentlemen were divided by feuds hitherto unknown and each seemed to hold it scorn to be pleased with the same diversions that amused those of the opposite faction the hearts of both parties revolted from the recollection of former days when all was peace among them when the earl of derby now slaughtered used to bestow the prize and christian since so vindictively executed started horses to add to the amusement  julian was seated in the deep recess which led to a latticed window of the old castle and with his arms crossed and an air of profound contemplation was surveying the long perspective of ocean which rolled its successive waves up to the foot of the rock on which the ancient pile is founded the earl was suffering under the infliction of ennuinow looking into a volume of homernow whistlingnow swinging on his chairnow traversing the roomtill at length his attention became swallowed up in admiration of the tranquillity of his companion  king of men he said repeating the favourite epithet by which homer describes agamemnoni trust for the old greeks sake he had a merrier office than being king of manmost philosophical julian will nothing rouse theenot even a bad pun on my own royal dignity  i wish you would be a little more the king in man said julian starting from his reverie and then you would find more amusement in your dominions  what dethrone that royal semiramis my mother said the young lord who has as much pleasure in playing queen as if she were a real sovereigni wonder you can give me such counsel  your mother as you well know my dear derby would be delighted did you take any interest in the affairs of the island  ay truly she would permit me to be king but she would choose to remain viceroy over me why she would only gain a subject the more by my converting my spare time which is so very valuable to me to the cares of royalty no no julian she thinks it power to direct all the affairs of these poor manxmen and thinking it power she finds it pleasure i shall not interfere unless she hold a high court of justice again i cannot afford to pay another fine to my brother king charlesbut i forgetthis is a sore point with you  with the countess at least replied julian and i wonder you will speak of it  why i bear no malice against the poor mans memory any more than yourself though i have not the same reasons for holding it in veneration replied the earl of derby and yet i have some respect for it too i remember their bringing him out to dieit was the first holiday i ever had in my life and i heartily wish it had been on some other account  i would rather hear you speak of anything else my lord said julian  why there it goes answered the earl whenever i talk of anything that puts you on your mettle and warms your blood that runs as cold as a mermansto use a simile of this happy islandhey pass you press me to change the subjectwell what shall we talk ofo julian if you had not gone down to earth yourself among the castles and caverns of derbyshire we should have had enough of delicious topicsthe playhouses julianboth the kings house and the dukeslouiss establishment is a jest to themand the ring in the park which beats the corso at naplesand the beauties who beat the whole world  i am very willing to hear you speak on the subject my lord answered julian the less i have seen of london world myself the more i am likely to be amused by your account of it  ay my friendbut where to beginwith the wit of buckingham and sedley and etherege or with the grace of harry jermynthe courtesy of the duke of monmouth or with the loveliness of la belle hamiltonof the duchess of richmondof lady  the person of roxalana the smart humour of mrs nelly  or what say you to the bewitching sorceries of lady cynthia demanded his companion  faith i would have kept these to myself said the earl to follow your prudent example but since you ask me i fairly own i cannot tell what to say of them only i think of them twenty times as often as all the beauties i have spoken of and yet she is neither the twentieth part so beautiful as the plainest of these court beauties nor so witty as the dullest i have named nor so modishthat is the great matteras the most obscure i cannot tell what makes me dote on her except that she is a capricious as her whole sex put together  that i should think a small recommendation answered his companion  small do you term it replied the earl and write yourself a brother of the angle why which like you best to pull a dead strain on a miserable gudgeon which you draw ashore by main force as the fellows here tow in their fishingboatsor a lively salmon that makes your rod crack and your line whistleplays you ten thousand mischievous prankswearies your heart out with hopes and fearsand is only laid panting on the bank after you have shown the most unmatchable display of skill patience and dexteritybut i see you have a mind to go on angling after your own old fashion off laced coat and on brown jerkinlively colours scare fish in the sober waters of the isle of manfaith in london you will catch few unless the bait glistens a little but you are goingwell good luck to you i will take to the bargethe sea and wind are less inconstant than the tide you have embarked on  you have learned to say all these smart things in london my lord answered julian but we shall have you a penitent for them if lady cynthia be of my mind adieu and pleasure till we meet  the young men parted accordingly and while the earl betook him to his pleasure voyage julian as his friend had prophesied assumed the dress of one who means to amuse himself with angling the hat and feather were exchanged for a cap of grey cloth the deeplylaced cloak and doublet for a simple jacket of the same colour with hose conforming and finally with rod in hand and pannier at his back mounted upon a handsome manx pony young peveril rode briskly over the country which divided him from one of those beautiful streams that descend to the sea from the kirkmerlagh mountains  having reached the spot where he meant to commence his days sport julian let his little steed graze which accustomed to the situation followed him like a dog and now and then when tired of picking herbage in the valley through which the stream winded came near her masters side and as if she had been a curious amateur of the sport gazed on the trouts as julian brought them struggling to the shore but fairys master showed on that day little of the patience of a real angler and took no heed to old isaac waltons recommendation to fish the streams inch by inch he chose indeed with an anglers eye the most promising casts which the stream broke sparkling over a stone affording the wonted shelter to a trout or where gliding away from a rippling current to a still eddy it streamed under the projecting bank or dashed from the pool of some low cascade by this judicious selection of spots whereon to employ his art the sportsmans basket was soon sufficiently heavy to show that his occupation was not a mere pretext and so soon as this was the case he walked briskly up the glen only making a cast from time to time in case of his being observed from any of the neighbouring heights  it was a little green and rocky valley through which the brook strayed very lonely although the slight track of an unformed road showed that it was occasionally traversed and that it was not altogether void of inhabitants as peveril advanced still farther the right bank reached to some distance from the stream leaving a piece of meadow ground the lower part of which being close to the brook was entirely covered with rich herbage being possibly occasionally irrigated by its overflow the higher part of the level ground afforded a stance for an old house of singular structure with a terraced garden and a cultivated field or two beside it in former times a danish or norwegian fastness had stood here called the black fort from the colour of a huge healthy hill which rising behind the building appeared to be the boundary of the valley and to afford the source of the brook but the original structure had been long demolished as indeed it probably only consisted of dry stones and its materials had been applied to the construction of the present mansionthe work of some churchman during the sixteenth century as was evident from the huge stonework of its windows which scarce left room for light to pass through as well as from two or three heavy buttresses which projected from the front of the house and exhibited on their surface little niches for images these had been carefully destroyed and pots of flowers were placed in the niches in their stead besides their being ornamented by creeping plants of various kinds fancifully twined around them the garden was also in good order and though the spot was extremely solitary there was about it altogether an air of comfort accommodation and even elegance by no means generally characteristic of the habitations of the island at the time  with much circumspection julian peveril approached the low gothic porch which defended the entrance of the mansion from the tempests incident to its situation and was like the buttresses overrun with ivy and other creeping plants an iron ring contrived so as when drawn up and down to rattle against the bar of notched iron through which it was suspended served the purpose of a knocker and to this he applied himself though with the greatest precaution  he received no answer for some time and indeed it seemed as if the house was totally uninhabited when at length his impatience getting the upper hand he tried to open the door and as it was only upon the latch very easily succeeded he passed through a little lowarched hall the upper end of which was occupied by a staircase and turning to the left opened the door of a summer parlour wainscoted with black oak and very simply furnished with chairs and tables of the same materials the former cushioned with the leather the apartment was gloomyone of those stoneshafted windows which we have mentioned with its small latticed panes and thick garland of foliage admitting but an imperfect light  over the chimneypiece which was of the same massive materials with the panelling of the apartment was the only ornament of the room a painting namely representing an officer in the military dress of the civil wars it was a green jerkin then the national and peculiar wear of the manxmen his short band which hung down on the cuirassthe orangecoloured scarf but above all the shortness of his closecut hair showing evidently to which of the great parties he had belonged his right hand rested on the hilt of his sword and in the left he held a small bible bearing the inscription in hoc signo the countenance was of a light complexion with fair and almost effeminate blue eyes and an oval form of faceone of those physiognomies to which though not otherwise unpleasing we naturally attach the idea of melancholy and of misfortune apparently it was well known to julian peveril for after having looked at it for a long time he could not forbear muttering aloud what would i give that that man had never been born or that he still lived   i am told that a portrait of the unfortunate william christian is     still preserved in the family of waterson of ballnabow of kirk     church rushin william dhône is dressed in a green coat without     collar or cape after the fashion of those puritanic times with     the head in a close cropt wig resembling the bishops peruke of     the present day the countenance is youthful and welllooking     very unlike the expression of foreboding melancholy i have so far     taken advantage of this criticism as to bring my ideal portrait     in the present edition nearer to the complexion at least of the     fairhaired william dhône  how nowhow is this said a female who entered the room as he uttered this reflection you here master peveril in spite of all the warnings you have had you here in the possession of folks house when they are abroad and talking to yourself as i shall warrant  yes mistress deborah said peveril i am here once more as you see against every prohibition and in defiance of all dangerwhere is alice  where you will never see her master julianyou may satisfy yourself of that answered mistress deborah for it was that respectable governante and sinking down at the same time upon one of the large leathern chairs she began to fan herself with her handkerchief and complain of the heat in a most ladylike fashion  in fact mistress debbitch while her exterior intimated a considerable change of condition for the better and her countenance showed the less favourable effects of the twenty years which had passed over her head was in mind and manners very much what she had been when she battled the opinions of madam ellesmere at martindale castle in a word she was selfwilled obstinate and coquettish as ever otherwise no illdisposed person her present appearance was that of a woman of the better rank from the sobriety of the fashion of her dress and the uniformity of its colours it was plain she belonged to some sect which condemned superfluous gaiety in attire but no rules not those of a nunnery or of a quakers society can prevent a little coquetry in that particular where a woman is desirous of being supposed to retain some claim to personal attention all mistress deborahs garments were so arranged as might best set off a goodlooking woman whose countenance indicated ease and good cheerwho called herself fiveandthirty and was well entitled if she had a mind to call herself twelve or fifteen years older  julian was under the necessity of enduring all her tiresome and fantastic airs and awaiting with patience till she had prinked herself and pinned herselfflung her hoods back and drawn them forwardsnuffed at a little bottle of essencesclosed her eyes like a dying fowlturned them up like duck in a thunderstorm when at length having exhausted her round of minauderies she condescended to open the conversation  these walks will be the death of me she said and all on your account master julian peveril for if dame christian should learn that you have chosen to make your visits to her niece i promise you mistress alice would be soon obliged to find other quarters and so should i  come now mistress deborah be goodhumoured said julian consider was not all this intimacy of ours of your own making did you not make yourself known to me the very first time i strolled up this glen with my fishingrod and tell me that you were my former keeper and that alice had been my little playfellow and what could there be more natural than that i should come back and see two such agreeable persons as often as i could  yes said dame deborah but i did not bid you fall in love with us though or propose such a matter as marriage either to alice or myself  to do you justice you never did deborah answered the youth but what of that such things will come out before one is aware i am sure you must have heard such proposals fifty times when you least expected them  fie fie fie master julian peveril said the governante i would have you to know that i have always so behaved myself that the best of the land would have thought twice of it and have very well considered both what he was going to say and how he was going to say it before he came out with such proposals to me  true true mistress deborah continued julian but all the world hath not your discretion then alice bridgenorth is a childa mere child and one always asks a baby to be ones little wife you know come i know you will forgive me thou wert ever the bestnatured kindest woman in the world and you know you have said twenty times we were made for each other  oh no master julian peveril no no no ejaculated deborah i may indeed have said your estates were born to be united and to be sure it is natural for me that come of the old stock of the yeomanry of peveril of the peaks estate to wish that it was all within the ring fence again which sure enough it might be were you to marry alice bridgenorth but then there is the knight your father and my lady your mother and there is her father that is half crazy with his religion and her aunt that wears eternal black grogram for that unlucky colonel christian and there is the countess of derby that would serve us all with the same sauce if we were thinking of anything that would displease her and besides all that you have broke your word with mistress alice and everything is over between you and i am of opinion it is quite right it should be all over and perhaps it may be master julian that i should have thought so a long time ago before a child like alice put it into my head but i am so goodnatured  no flatterer like a lover who wishes to carry his point  you are the bestnatured kindest creature in the world deborahbut you have never seen the ring i bought for you at paris nay i will put it on your finger myselfwhat your fosterson whom you loved so well and took such care of  he easily succeeded in putting a pretty ring of gold with a humorous affectation of gallantry on the fat finger of mistress deborah debbitch hers was a soul of a kind often to be met with both among the lower and higher vulgar who without being on a broad scale accessible to bribes or corruption are nevertheless much attached to perquisites and considerably biassed in their line of duty though perhaps insensibly by the love of petty observances petty presents and trivial compliments mistress debbitch turned the ring round and round and round and at length said in a whisper well master julian peveril it signifies nothing denying anything to such a young gentleman as you for young gentlemen are always so obstinate and so i may as well tell you that mistress alice walked back from the kirktruagh along with me just now and entered the house at the same time with myself  why did you not tell me so before said julian starting up wherewhere is she  you had better ask why i tell you so now master julian said dame deborah for i promise you it is against her express commands and i would not have told you had you not looked so pitifulbut as for seeing you that she will notand she is in her own bedroom with a good oak door shut and bolted upon herthat is one comfortand so as for any breach of trust on my parti promise you the little saucy minx gives it no less nameit is quite impossible  do not say so deborahonly goonly trytell her to hear metell her i have a hundred excuses for disobeying her commandstell her i have no doubt to get over all obstacles at martindale castle  nay i tell you it is all in vain replied the dame when i saw your cap and rod lying in the hall i did but say there he is again and she ran up the stairs like a young deer and i heard key turned and bolt shot ere i could say a single word to stop heri marvel you heard her not  it was because i am as i ever was an owla dreaming fool who let all those golden minutes pass which my luckless life holds out to me so rarelywelltell her i gogo for evergo where she will hear no more of mewhere no one shall hear more of me  oh the father said the dame hear how he talkswhat will become of sir geoffrey and your mother and of me and of the countess if you were to go so far as you talk of and what would become of poor alice too for i will be sworn she likes you better than she says and i know she used to sit and look the way that you used to come up the stream and now and then ask me if the morning were good for fishing and all the while you were on the continent as they call it she scarcely smiled once unless it was when she got two beautiful long letters about foreign parts  friendship dame deborahonly friendshipcold and calm remembrance of one who by your kind permission stole in on your solitude now and then with news from the living world withoutonce indeed i thoughtbut it is all overfarewell  so saying he covered his face with one hand and extended the other in the act of bidding adieu to dame debbitch whose kind heart became unable to withstand the sight of his affliction  now do not be in such haste she said i will go up again and tell her how it stands with you and bring her down if it is in womans power to do it  and so saying she left the apartment and ran upstairs  julian peveril meanwhile paced the apartment in great agitation waiting the success of deborahs intercession and she remained long enough absent to give us time to explain in a short retrospect the circumstances which had led to his present situation     chapter xii              ah me for aught that ever i could read             could ever hear by tale or history             the course of true love never did run smooth                                        midsummer nights dream  the celebrated passage which we have prefixed to this chapter has like most observations of the same author its foundation in real experience the period at which love is formed for the first time and felt most strongly is seldom that at which there is much prospect of its being brought to a happy issue the state of artificial society opposes many complicated obstructions to early marriages and the chance is very great that such obstacles prove insurmountable in fine there are few men who do not look back in secret to some period of their youth at which a sincere and early affection was repulsed or betrayed or become abortive from opposing circumstances it is these little passages of secret history which leave a tinge of romance in every bosom scarce permitting us even in the most busy or the most advanced period of life to listen with total indifference to a tale of true love  julian peveril had so fixed his affections as to insure the fullest share of that opposition which early attachments are so apt to encounter yet nothing so natural as that he should have done so in early youth dame debbitch had accidentally met with the son of her first patroness and who had himself been her earliest charge fishing in the little brook already noticed which watered the valley in which she resided with alice bridgenorth the dames curiosity easily discovered who he was and besides the interest which persons in her condition usually take in the young people who have been under their charge she was delighted with the opportunity to talk about former timesabout martindale castle and friends thereabout sir geoffrey and his good ladyand now and then about lance outram the parkkeeper  the mere pleasure of gratifying her inquiries would scarce have had power enough to induce julian to repeat his visits to the lonely glen but deborah had a companiona lovely girlbred in solitude and in the quiet and unpretending tastes which solitude encouragesspirited also and inquisitive and listening with laughing cheek and an eager eye to every tale which the young angler brought from the town and castle  the visits of julian to the black fort were only occasionalso far dame deborah showed commonsensewhich was perhaps inspired by the apprehension of losing her place in case of discovery she had indeed great confidence in the strong and rooted beliefamounting almost to superstitionwhich major bridgenorth entertained that his daughters continued health could only be insured by her continuing under the charge of one who had acquired lady peverils supposed skill in treating those subject to such ailments this belief dame deborah had improved to the utmost of her simple cunningalways speaking in something of an oracular tone upon the subject of her charges health and hinting at certain mysterious rules necessary to maintain it in the present favourable state she had availed herself of this artifice to procure for herself and alice a separate establishment at the black fort for it was originally major bridgenorths resolution that his daughter and her governante should remain under the same roof with the sisterinlaw of his deceased wife the widow of the unfortunate colonel christian but this lady was broken down with premature age brought on by sorrow and in a short visit which major bridgenorth made to the island he was easily prevailed on to consider her house at kirktruagh as a very cheerless residence for his daughter dame deborah who longed for domestic independence was careful to increase this impression by alarming her patrons fears on account of alices health the mansion of kirktruagh stood she said much exposed to the scottish winds which could not but be cold as they came from a country where as she was assured there was ice and snow at midsummer in short she prevailed and was put into full possession of the black fort a house which as well as kirktruagh belonged formerly to christian and now to his widow  still however it was enjoined on the governante and her charge to visit kirktruagh from time to time and to consider themselves as under the management and guardianship of mistress christiana state of subjection the sense of which deborah endeavoured to lessen by assuming as much freedom of conduct as she possibly dared under the influence doubtless of the same feelings of independence which induced her at martindale hall to spurn the advice of mistress ellesmere  it was this generous disposition to defy control which induced her to procure for alice secretly some means of education which the stern genius of puritanism would have proscribed she ventured to have her charge taught musicnay even dancing and the picture of the stern colonel christian trembled on the wainscot where it was suspended while the sylphlike form of alice and the substantial person of dame deborah executed french chaussées and borrées to the sound of a small kit which screamed under the bow of monsieur de pigal half smuggler half dancingmaster this abomination reached the ears of the colonels widow and by her was communicated to bridgenorth whose sudden appearance in the island showed the importance he attached to the communication had she been faithless to her own cause that had been the latest hour of mrs deborahs administration but she retreated into her stronghold  dancing she said was exercise regulated and timed by music and it stood to reason that it must be the best of all exercise for a delicate person especially as it could be taken within doors and in all states of the weather  bridgenorth listened with a clouded and thoughtful brow when in exemplification of her doctrine mistress deborah who was no contemptible performer on the viol began to jangle sellengers round and desired alice to dance an old english measure to the tune as the halfbashful halfsmiling girl about fourteenfor such was her agemoved gracefully to the music the fathers eye unavoidably followed the light spring of her step and marked with joy the rising colour in her cheek when the dance was over he folded her in his arms smoothed her somewhat disordered locks with a fathers affectionate hand smiled kissed her brow and took his leave without one single word farther interdicting the exercise of dancing he did not himself communicate the result of his visit at the black fort to mrs christian but she was not long of learning it by the triumph of dame deborah on her next visit  it is well said the stern old lady my brother bridgenorth hath permitted you to make a herodias of alice and teach her dancing you have only now to find her a partner for lifei shall neither meddle nor make more in their affairs  in fact the triumph of dame deborah or rather of dame nature on this occasion had more important effects than the former had ventured to anticipate for mrs christian though she received with all formality the formal visits of the governante and her charge seemed thenceforth so pettish with the issue of her remonstrance upon the enormity of her niece dancing to a little fiddle that she appeared to give up interference in her affairs and left dame debbitch and alice to manage both education and housekeepingin which she had hitherto greatly concerned herselfmuch after their own pleasure  it was in this independent state that they lived when julian first visited their habitation and he was the rather encouraged to do so by dame deborah that she believed him to be one of the last persons in the world with whom mistress christian would have desired her niece to be acquaintedthe happy spirit of contradiction superseding with dame deborah on this as on other occasions all consideration of the fitness of things she did not act altogether without precaution neither she was aware she had to guard not only against any reviving interest or curiosity on the part of mistress christian but against the sudden arrival of major bridgenorth who never failed once in the year to make his appearance at the black fort when least expected and to remain there for a few days dame debbitch therefore exacted of julian that his visits should be few and far between that he should condescend to pass for a relation of her own in the eyes of two ignorant manx girls and a lad who formed her establishment and that he should always appear in his anglers dress made of the simple loughtan or buffcoloured wool of the island which is not subjected to dyeing by these cautions she thought his intimacy at the black fort would be entirely unnoticed or considered as immaterial while in the meantime it furnished much amusement to her charge and herself  this was accordingly the case during the earlier part of their intercourse while julian was a lad and alice a girl two or three years younger but as the lad shot up to youth and the girl to womanhood even dame deborah debbitchs judgment saw danger in their continued intimacy she took an opportunity to communicate to julian who miss bridgenorth actually was and the peculiar circumstances which placed discord between their fathers he heard the story of their quarrel with interest and surprise for he had only resided occasionally at martindale castle and the subject of bridgenorths quarrel with his father had never been mentioned in his presence his imagination caught fire at the sparks afforded by this singular story and far from complying with the prudent remonstrance of dame deborah and gradually estranging himself from the black fort and its fair inmate he frankly declared he considered his intimacy there so casually commenced as intimating the will of heaven that alice and he were designed for each other in spite of every obstacle which passion or prejudice could raise up betwixt them they had been companions in infancy and a little exertion of memory enabled him to recall his childish grief for the unexpected and sudden disappearance of his little companion whom he was destined again to meet with in the early bloom of opening beauty in a country which was foreign to them both  dame deborah was confounded at the consequences of her communication which had thus blown into a flame the passion which she hoped it would have either prevented or extinguished she had not the sort of head which resists the masculine and energetic remonstrances of passionate attachment whether addressed to her on her own account or on behalf of another she lamented and wondered and ended her feeble opposition by weeping and sympathising and consenting to allow the continuance of julians visits provided he should only address himself to alice as a friend to gain the world she would consent to nothing more she was not however so simple but that she also had her forebodings of the designs of providence on this youthful couple for certainly they could not be more formed to be united than the good estates of martindale and moultrassie  then came a long sequence of reflections martindale castle wanted but some repairs to be almost equal to chatsworth the hall might be allowed to go to ruin or what would be better when sir geoffreys time came for the good knight had seen service and must be breaking now the hall would be a good doweryhouse to which my lady and ellesmere might retreat while empress of the stillroom and queen of the pantry mistress deborah debbitch should reign housekeeper at the castle and extend perhaps the crownmatrimonial to lance outram provided he was not become too old too fat or too fond of ale  such were the soothing visions under the influence of which the dame connived at an attachment which lulled also to pleasing dreams though of a character so different her charge and her visitant  the visits of the young angler became more and more frequent and the embarrassed deborah though foreseeing all the dangers of discovery and the additional risk of an explanation betwixt alice and julian which must necessarily render their relative situation so much more delicate felt completely overborne by the enthusiasm of the young lover and was compelled to let matters take their course  the departure of julian for the continent interrupted the course of his intimacy at the black fort and while it relieved the elder of its inmates from much internal apprehension spread an air of languor and dejection over the countenance of the younger which at bridgenorths next visit to the isle of man renewed all his terrors for his daughters constitutional malady  deborah promised faithfully she should look better the next morning and she kept her word she had retained in her possession for some time a letter which julian had by some private conveyance sent to her charge for his youthful friend deborah had dreaded the consequences of delivering it as a billetdoux but as in the case of the dance she thought there could be no harm in administering it as a remedy  it had complete effect and next day the cheeks of the maiden had a tinge of the rose which so much delighted her father that as he mounted his horse he flung his purse into deborahs hand with the desire she should spare nothing that could make herself and his daughter happy and the assurance that she had his full confidence  this expression of liberality and confidence from a man of major bridgenorths reserved and cautious disposition gave full plumage to mistress deborahs hopes and emboldened her not only to deliver another letter of julians to the young lady but to encourage more boldly and freely than formerly the intercourse of the lovers when peveril returned from abroad  at length in spite of all julians precaution the young earl became suspicious of his frequent solitary fishing parties and he himself now better acquainted with the world than formerly became aware that his repeated visits and solitary walks with a person so young and beautiful as alice might not only betray prematurely the secret of his attachment but be of essential prejudice to her who was its object  under the influence of this conviction he abstained for an unusual period from visiting the black fort but when he next indulged himself with spending an hour in the place where he would gladly have abode for ever the altered manner of alicethe tone in which she seemed to upbraid his neglect penetrated his heart and deprived him of that power of selfcommand which he had hitherto exercised in their interviews it required but a few energetic words to explain to alice at once his feelings and to make her sensible of the real nature of her own she wept plentifully but her tears were not all of bitterness she sat passively still and without reply while he explained to her with many an interjection the circumstances which had placed discord between their families for hitherto all that she had known was that master peveril belonging to the household of the great countess or lady of man must observe some precautions in visiting a relative of the unhappy colonel christian but when julian concluded his tale with the warmest protestations of eternal love my poor father she burst forth and was this to be the end of all thy precautionsthis that the son of him that disgraced and banished thee should hold such language to your daughter  you err alice you err cried julian eagerly that i hold this languagethat the son of peveril addresses thus the daughter of your fatherthat he thus kneels to you for forgiveness of injuries which passed when we were both infants shows the will of heaven that in our affection should be quenched the discord of our parents what else could lead those who parted infants on the hills of derbyshire to meet thus in the valleys of man  alice however new such a scene and above all her own emotions might be was highly endowed with that exquisite delicacy which is imprinted in the female heart to give warning of the slightest approach to impropriety in a situation like hers  rise rise master peveril she said do not do yourself and me this injusticewe have done both wrongvery wrong but my fault was done in ignorance o god my poor father who needs comfort so muchis it for me to add to his misfortunes rise she added more firmly if you retain this unbecoming posture any longer i will leave the room and you shall never see me more  the commanding tone of alice overawed the impetuosity of her lover who took in silence a seat removed to some distance from hers and was again about to speak julian said she in a milder tone you have spoken enough and more than enough would you had left me in the pleasing dream in which i could have listened to you for ever but the hour of wakening is arrived peveril waited the prosecution of her speech as a criminal while he waits his doom for he was sufficiently sensible that an answer delivered not certainly without emotion but with firmness and resolution was not to be interrupted we have done wrong she repeated very wrong and if we now separate for ever the pain we may feel will be but a just penalty for our error we should never have met meeting we should part as soon as possible our farther intercourse can but double our pain at parting farewell julian and forget we ever have seen each other  forget said julian never never to you it is easy to speak the wordto think the thought to me an approach to either can only be by utter destruction why should you doubt that the feud of our fathers like so many of which we have heard might be appeased by our friendship you are my only friend i am the only one whom heaven has assigned to you why should we separate for the fault of others which befell when we were but children  you speak in vain julian said alice i pity youperhaps i pity myselfindeed i should pity myself perhaps the most of the two for you will go forth to new scenes and new faces and will soon forget me but i remaining in this solitude how shall i forgetthat however is not now the questioni can bear my lot and it commands us to part  hear me yet a moment said peveril this evil is not cannot be remediless i will go to my fatheri will use the intercession of my mother to whom he can refuse nothingi will gain their consentthey have no other childand they must consent or lose him for ever say alice if i come to you with my parents consent to my suit will you again say with that tone so touching and so sad yet so incredibly determinedjulian we must part alice was silent cruel girl will you not even deign to answer me said her lover  i would refer you to my father said alice blushing and casting her eyes down but instantly raising them again she repeated in a firmer and a sadder tone yes julian i would refer you to my father and you would find that your pilot hope had deceived you and that you had but escaped the quicksands to fall upon the rocks  i would that could be tried said julian methinks i could persuade your father that in ordinary eyes our alliance is not undesirable my family have fortune rank long descentall that fathers look for when they bestow a daughters hand  all this would avail you nothing said alice the spirit of my father is bent upon the things of another world and if he listened to hear you out it would be but to tell you that he spurned your offers  you know notyou know not alice said julian fire can soften ironthy fathers heart cannot be so hard or his prejudices so strong but i shall find some means to melt him forbid me notoh forbid me not at least the experiment  i can but advise said alice i can forbid you nothing for to forbid implies power to command obedience but if you will be wise and listen to mehere and on this spot we part for ever  not so by heaven said julian whose bold and sanguine temper scarce saw difficulty in attaining aught which he desired we now part indeed but it is that i may return armed with my parents consent they desire that i should marryin their last letters they pressed it more openlythey shall have their desire and such a bride as i will present to them has not graced their house since the conqueror gave it origin farewell alice farewell for a brief space  she replied farewell julian farewell for ever  julian within a week of this interview was at martindale castle with the view of communicating his purpose but the task which seems easy at a distance proves as difficult upon a nearer approach as the fording of a river which from afar appeared only a brook there lacked not opportunities of entering upon the subject for in the first ride which he took with his father the knight resumed the subject of his sons marriage and liberally left the lady to his choice but under the strict proviso that she was of a loyal and an honourable familyif she had fortune it was good and well or rather it was better than well but if she was poor why there is still some picking said sir geoffrey on the bones of the old estate and dame margaret and i will be content with the less that you young folks may have your share of it i am turned frugal already julian you see what a northcountry shambling bit of a galloway nag i ride upona different beast i wot from my own old black hastings who had but one fault and that was his wish to turn down moultrassie avenue  was that so great a fault said julian affecting indifference while his heart was trembling as it seemed to him almost in his very throat  it used to remind me of that base dishonourable presbyterian fellow bridgenorth said sir geoffrey and i would as lief think of a toadthey say he has turned independent to accomplish the full degree of rascalityi tell you gill i turned off the cowboy for gathering nuts in his woodsi would hang a dog that would so much as kill a hare therebut what is the matter with you you look pale  julian made some indifferent answer but too well understood from the language and tone which his father used that his prejudices against alices father were both deep and envenomed as those of country gentlemen often become who having little to do or think of are but too apt to spend their time in nursing and cherishing petty causes of wrath against their next neighbours  in the course of the same day he mentioned the bridgenorth to his mother as if in a casual manner but the lady peveril instantly conjured him never to mention the name especially in his fathers presence  was that major bridgenorth of whom i have heard the name mentioned said julian so very bad a neighbour  i do not say so said lady peveril nay we were more than once obliged to him in the former unhappy times but your father and he took some passages so ill at each others hands that the least allusion to him disturbs sir geoffreys temper in a manner quite unusual and which now that his health is somewhat impaired is sometimes alarming to me for heavens sake then my dear julian avoid upon all occasions the slightest allusion to moultrassie or any of its inhabitants  this warning was so seriously given that julian himself saw that mentioning his secret purpose would be the sure way to render it abortive and therefore he returned disconsolate to the isle  peveril had the boldness however to make the best he could of what had happened by requesting an interview with alice in order to inform her what had passed betwixt his parents and him on her account it was with great difficulty that this boon was obtained and alice bridgenorth showed no slight degree of displeasure when she discovered after much circumlocution and many efforts to give an air of importance to what he had to communicate that all amounted but to this that lady peveril continued to retain a favourable opinion of her father major bridgenorth which julian would fain have represented as an omen of their future more perfect reconciliation  i did not think you would thus have trifled with me master peveril said alice assuming an air of dignity but i will take care to avoid such intrusion in futurei request you will not again visit the black fort and i entreat of you good mistress debbitch that you will no longer either encourage or permit this gentlemans visits as the result of such persecution will be to compel me to appeal to my aunt and father for another place of residence and perhaps also for another and more prudent companion  this last hint struck mistress deborah with so much terror that she joined her ward in requiring and demanding julians instant absence and he was obliged to comply with their request but the courage of a youthful lover is not easily subdued and julian after having gone through the usual round of trying to forget his ungrateful mistress and entertaining his passion with augmented violence ended by the visit to the black fort the beginning of which we narrated in the last chapter  we then left him anxious for yet almost fearful of an interview with alice which he prevailed upon deborah to solicit and such was the tumult of his mind that while he traversed the parlour it seemed to him that the dark melancholy eyes of the slaughtered christians portrait followed him wherever he went with the fixed chill and ominous glance which announced to the enemy of his race mishap and misfortune  the door of the apartment opened at length and these visions were dissipated     chapter xiii           parents have flinty hearts no tears can move them                                                        otway  when alice bridgenorth at length entered the parlour where her anxious lover had so long expected her it was with a slow step and a composed manner her dress was arranged with an accurate attention to form which at once enhanced the appearance of its puritanic simplicity and struck julian as a bad omen for although the time bestowed upon the toilet may in many cases intimate the wish to appear advantageously at such an interview yet a ceremonious arrangement of attire is very much allied with formality and a preconceived determination to treat a lover with cold politeness  the sadcoloured gownthe pinched and plaited cap which carefully obscured the profusion of long darkbrown hairthe small ruff and the long sleeves would have appeared to great disadvantage on a shape less graceful than alice bridgenorths but an exquisite form though not as yet sufficiently rounded in the outlines to produce the perfection of female beauty was able to sustain and give grace even to this unbecoming dress her countenance fair and delicate with eyes of hazel and a brow of alabaster had notwithstanding less regular beauty than her form and might have been justly subjected to criticism there was however a life and spirit in her gaiety and a depth of sentiment in her gravity which made alice in conversation with the very few persons with whom she associated so fascinating in her manners and expression whether of language or countenanceso touching also in her simplicity and purity of thought that brighter beauties might have been overlooked in her company it was no wonder therefore that an ardent character like julian influenced by these charms as well as by the secrecy and mystery attending his intercourse with alice should prefer the recluse of the black fort to all others with whom he had become acquainted in general society  his heart beat high as she came into the apartment and it was almost without an attempt to speak that his profound obeisance acknowledged her entrance  this is a mockery master peveril said alice with an effort to speak firmly which yet was disconcerted by a slightly tremulous inflection of voicea mockery and a cruel one you come to this lone place inhabited only by two women too simple to command your absencetoo weak to enforce ityou come in spite of my earnest requestto the neglect of your own timeto the prejudice i may fear of my characteryou abuse the influence you possess over the simple person to whom i am entrustedall this you do and think to make up by low reverences and constrained courtesy is this honourable or is it fairis it she added after a moments hesitationis it kind  the tremulous accent fell especially on the last word she uttered and it was spoken in a low tone of gentle reproach which went to julians heart  if said he there was a mode by which at the peril of my life alice i could show my regardmy respectmy devoted tendernessthe danger would be dearer to me than ever was pleasure  you have said such things often said alice and they are such as i ought not to hear and do not desire to hear i have no tasks to impose on youno enemies to be destroyedno need or desire of protectionno wish heaven knows to expose you to dangerit is your visits here alone to which danger attaches you have but to rule your own wilful temperto turn your thoughts and your cares elsewhere and i can have nothing to asknothing to wish for use your own reasonconsider the injury you do yourselfthe injustice you do usand let me once more in fair terms entreat you to absent yourself from this placetilltill  she paused and julian eagerly interrupted hertill when alicetill whenimpose on me any length of absence which your severity can inflict short of a final separationsay begone for years but return when these years are over and slow and wearily as they must pass away still the thought that they must at length have their period will enable me to live through them let me then conjure thee alice to name a dateto fix a termto say till when  till you can bear to think of me only as a friend and sister  that is a sentence of eternal banishment indeed said julian it is seeming no doubt to fix a term of exile but attaching to it an impossible condition  and why impossible julian said alice in a tone of persuasion were we not happier ere you threw the mask from your own countenance and tore the veil from my foolish eyes did we not meet with joy spend our time happily and part cheerily because we transgressed no duty and incurred no selfreproach bring back that state of happy ignorance and you shall have no reason to call me unkind but while you form schemes which i know to be visionary and use language of such violence and passion you shall excuse me if i now and once for all declare that since deborah shows herself unfit for the trust reposed in her and must needs expose me to persecutions of this nature i will write to my father that he may fix me another place of residence and in the meanwhile i will take shelter with my aunt at kirktruagh  hear me unpitying girl said peveril hear me and you shall see how devoted i am to obedience in all that i can do to oblige you you say you were happy when we spoke not on such topicswellat all expense of my own suppressed feelings that happy period shall return i will meet youwalk with youread with youbut only as a brother would with his sister or a friend with his friend the thoughts i may nourish be they of hope or of despair my tongue shall not give birth to and therefore i cannot offend deborah shall be ever by your side and her presence shall prevent my even hinting at what might displease youonly do not make a crime to me of those thoughts which are the dearest part of my existence for believe me it were better and kinder to rob me of existence itself  this is the mere ecstasy of passion julian answered alice bridgenorth that which is unpleasant our selfish and stubborn will represents as impossible i have no confidence in the plan you proposeno confidence in your resolution and less than none in the protection of deborah till you can renounce honestly and explicitly the wishes you have lately expressed we must be strangersand could you renounce them even at this moment it were better that we should part for a long time and for heavens sake let it be as soon as possibleperhaps it is even now too late to prevent some unpleasant accidenti thought i heard a noise  it was deborah answered julian be not afraid alice we are secure against surprise  i know not said alice what you mean by such securityi have nothing to hide i sought not this interview on the contrary averted it as long as i couldand am now most desirous to break it off  and wherefore alice since you say it must be our last why should you shake the sand which is passing so fast the very executioner hurries not the prayers of the wretches upon the scaffoldand see you noti will argue as coldly as you can desiresee you not that you are breaking your own word and recalling the hope which yourself held out to me  what hope have i suggested what word have i given julian answered alice you yourself build wild hopes in the air and accuse me of destroying what had never any earthly foundation spare yourself julianspare meand in mercy to us both depart and return not again till you can be more reasonable  reasonable replied julian it is you alice who will deprive me altogether of reason did you not say that if our parents could be brought to consent to our union you would no longer oppose my suit  nonono said alice eagerly and blushing deeplyi did not say so julianit was your own wild imagination which put construction on my silence and my confusion  you do not say so then answered julian and if all other obstacles were removed i should find one in the cold flinty bosom of her who repays the most devoted and sincere affection with contempt and dislikeis that he added in a deep tone of feelingis that what alice bridgenorth says to julian peveril  indeedindeed julian said the almost weeping girl i do not say soi say nothing and i ought not to say anything concerning what i might do in a state of things which can never take place indeed julian you ought not thus to press me unprotected as i amwishing you wellvery wellwhy should you urge me to say or do what would lessen me in my own eyes to own affection for one from whom fate has separated me for ever it is ungenerousit is cruelit is seeking a momentary and selfish gratification to yourself at the expense of every feeling which i ought to entertain  you have said enough alice said julian with sparkling eyes you have said enough in deprecating my urgency and i will press you no farther but you overrate the impediments which lie betwixt usthey must and shall give way  so you said before answered alice and with what probability your own account may show you dared not to mention the subject to your own fatherhow should you venture to mention it to mine  that i will soon enable you to decide upon major bridgenorth by my mothers account is a worthy and an estimable man i will remind him that to my mothers care he owes the dearest treasure and comfort of his life and i will ask him if it is a just retribution to make that mother childless let me but know where to find him alice and you shall soon hear if i have feared to plead my cause with him  alas answered alice you well know my uncertainty as to my dear fathers residence how often has it been my earnest request to him that he would let me share his solitary abode or his obscure wanderings but the short and infrequent visits which he makes to this house are all that he permits me of his society something i might surely do however little to alleviate the melancholy by which he is oppressed  something we might both do said peveril how willingly would i aid you in so pleasing a task all old griefs should be forgottenall old friendships revived my fathers prejudices are those of an englishmanstrong indeed but not insurmountable by reason tell me then where major bridgenorth is and leave the rest to me or let me but know by what address your letters reach him and i will forthwith essay to discover his dwelling  do not attempt it i charge you said alice he is already a man of sorrows and what would he think were i capable of entertaining a suit so likely to add to them besides i could not tell you if i would where he is now to be found my letters reach him from time to time by means of my aunt christian but of his address i am entirely ignorant  then by heaven answered julian i will watch his arrival in this island and in this house and ere he has locked thee in his arms he shall answer to me on the subject of my suit  then demand that answer now said a voice from without the door which was at the same time slowly openeddemand that answer now for here stands ralph bridgenorth  as he spoke he entered the apartment with his usual slow and sedate stepraised his flappd and steeplecrowned hat from his brows and standing in the midst of the room eyed alternately his daughter and julian peveril with a fixed and penetrating glance  father said alice utterly astonished and terrified besides by his sudden appearance at such a conjuncturefather i am not to blame  of that anon alice said bridgenorth meantime retire to your apartmenti have that to say to this youth which will not endure your presence  indeedindeed father said alice alarmed at what she supposed these words indicated julian is as little to be blamed as i it was chance it was fortune which caused our meeting together then suddenly rushing forward she threw her arms around her father saying oh do him no injuryhe meant no wrong father you were wont to be a man of reason and religious peace  and wherefore should i not be so now alice said bridgenorth raising his daughter from the ground on which she had almost sunk in the earnestness of her supplication dost thou know aught maiden which should inflame my anger against this young man more than reason or religion may bridle gogo to thy chamber compose thine own passionslearn to rule theseand leave it to me to deal with this stubborn young man  alice arose and with her eyes fixed on the ground retired slowly from the apartment julian followed her steps with his eyes till the last wave of her garment was visible at the closing door then turned his looks to major bridgenorth and then sunk them on the ground the major continued to regard him in profound silence his looks were melancholy and even austere but there was nothing which indicated either agitation or keen resentment he motioned to julian to take a seat and assumed one himself after which he opened the conversation in the following manner  you seemed but now young gentleman anxious to learn where i was to be found such i at least conjectured from the few expressions which i chanced to overhear for i made bold though it may be contrary to the code of modern courtesy to listen a moment or two in order to gather upon what subject so young a man as you entertained so young a woman as alice in a private interview  i trust sir said julian rallying spirits in what he felt to be a case of extremity you have heard nothing on my part which has given offence to a gentleman whom though unknown i am bound to respect so highly  on the contrary said bridgenorth with the same formal gravity i am pleased to find that your business is or appears to be with me rather than with my daughter i only think you had done better to have entrusted it to me in the first instance as my sole concern  the utmost sharpness of attention which julian applied could not discover if bridgenorth spoke seriously or ironically to the above purpose he was however quickwitted beyond his experience and was internally determined to endeavour to discover something of the character and the temper of him with whom he spoke for that purpose regulating his reply in the same tone with bridgenorths observation he said that not having the advantage to know his place of residence he had applied for information to his daughter  who is now known to you for the first time said bridgenorth am i so to understand you  by no means answered julian looking down i have been known to your daughter for many years and what i wished to say respects both her happiness and my own  i must understand you said bridgenorth even as carnal men understand each other on the matters of this world you are attached to my daughter by the cords of love i have long known this  you master bridgenorth exclaimed peverilyou have long known it  yes young man think you that as the father of an only child i could have suffered alice bridgenorththe only living pledge of her who is now an angel in heavento have remained in this seclusion without the surest knowledge of all her material actions i have in person seen more both of her and of you than you could be aware of and when absent in the body i had the means of maintaining the same superintendence young man they say that such love as you entertain for my daughter teaches much subtilty but believe not that it can overreach the affection which a widowed father bears to an only child  if said julian his heart beating thick and joyfully if you have known this intercourse so long may i not hope that it has not met your disapprobation  the major paused for an instant and then answered in some respects certainly not had it done sohad there seemed aught on your side or on my daughters to have rendered your visits here dangerous to her or displeasing to me she had not been long the inhabitant of this solitude or of this island but be not so hasty as to presume that all which you may desire in this matter can be either easily or speedily accomplished  i foresee indeed difficulties answered julian but with your kind acquiescence they are such as i trust to remove my father is generousmy mother is candid and liberal they loved you once i trust they will love you again i will be the mediator betwixt youpeace and harmony shall once more inhabit our neighbourhood and  bridgenorth interrupted him with a grim smile for such it seemed as it passed over a face of deep melancholy my daughter well said but short while past that you were a dreamer of dreamsan architect of plans and hopes fantastic as the visions of the night it is a great thing you ask of methe hand of my only childthe sum of my worldly substance though that is but dross in comparison you ask the key of the only fountain from which i may yet hope to drink one pleasant draught you ask to be the sole and absolute keeper of my earthly happinessand what have you offered or what have you to offer in return for the surrender you require of me  i am but too sensible said peveril abashed at his own hasty conclusions how difficult it may be  nay but interrupt me not replied bridgenorth till i show you the amount of what you offer me in exchange for a boon which whatever may be its intrinsic value is earnestly desired by you and comprehends all that is valuable on earth which i have it in my power to bestow you may have heard that in the late times i was the antagonist of your fathers principles and his profane faction but not the enemy of his person  i have ever heard replied julian much the contrary and it was but now that i reminded you that you had been his friend  ay when he was in affliction and i in prosperity i was neither unwilling nor altogether unable to show myself such well the tables are turnedthe times are changed a peaceful and unoffending man might have expected from a neighbour now powerful in his turn such protection when walking in the paths of the law as all men subjects of the same realm have a right to expect even from perfect strangers what chances i pursue with the warrant of the king and law a murderess bearing on her hand the blood of my near connection and i had in such a case a right to call on every liege subject to render assistance to the execution my late friendly neighbour bound as a man and a magistrate to give ready assistance to a legal actionbound as a grateful and obliged friend to respect my rights and my personthrusts himself betwixt meme the avenger of bloodand my lawful captive beats me to the earth at once endangering my life and in mere human eyes sullying mine honour and under his protection the midianitish woman reaches like a seaeagle the nest which she hath made in the wavesurrounded rocks and remains there till gold duly administered at court wipes out all memory of her crime and baffles the vengeance due to the memory of the best and bravest of menbut he added apostrophising the portrait of christian thou art not yet forgotten my fairhaired william the vengeance which dogs thy murderess is slowbut it is sure  there was a pause of some moments which julian peveril willing to hear to what conclusion major bridgenorth was finally to arrive did not care to interrupt accordingly in a few minutes the latter proceededthese things he said i recall not in bitterness so far as they are personal to mei recall them not in spite of heart though they have been the means of banishing me from my place of residence where my fathers dwelt and where my earthly comforts lie interred but the public cause sets further strife betwixt your father and me who so active as he to execute the fatal edict of black st bartholomews day when so many hundreds of gospelpreachers were expelled from house and homefrom hearth and altarfrom church and parish to make room for bellygods and thieves who when a devoted few of the lords people were united to lift the fallen standard and once more advance the good cause was the readiest to break their purposeto search for persecute and apprehend them whose breath did i feel warm on my neckwhose naked sword was thrust within a foot of my body whilst i lurked darkling like a thief in concealment in the house of my fathersit was geoffrey peverilsit was your fatherswhat can you answer to all this or how can you reconcile it with your present wishes  these things i point out to you julian that i may show you how impossible in the eyes of a merely worldly man would be the union which you are desirous of but heaven hath at times opened a door where man beholds no means of issue julian your mother for one to whom the truth is unknown is after the fashion of the world one of the best and one of the wisest of women and providence which gave her so fair a form and tenanted that form with a mind as pure as the original frailty of our vile nature will permit means not i trust that she shall continue to the end to be a vessel of wrath and perdition of your father i say nothinghe is what the times and example of others and the counsels of his lordly priest have made him and of him once more i say nothing save that i have power over him which ere now he might have felt but that there is one within his chambers who might have suffered in his suffering nor do i wish to root up your ancient family if i prize not your boast of family honours and pedigree i would not willingly destroy them more than i would pull down a mossgrown tower or hew to the ground an ancient oak save for the straightening of the common path and advantage of the public i have therefore no resentment against the humbled house of peverilnay i have regard to it in its depression  he here made a second pause as if he expected julian to say something but notwithstanding the ardour with which the young man had pressed his suit he was too much trained in ideas of the importance of his family and in the better habit of respect for his parents to hear without displeasure some part of bridgenorths discourse  the house of peveril he replied was never humbled  had you said the sons of that house had never been humble answered bridgenorth you would have come nearer the truthare you not humbled live you not here the lackey of a haughty woman the playcompanion of an empty youth if you leave this isle and go to the court of england see what regard will there be paid to the old pedigree that deduces your descent from kings and conquerors a scurril or obscene jest an impudent carriage a laced cloak a handful of gold and the readiness to wager it on a card or a die will better advance you at the court of charles than your fathers ancient name and slavish devotion of blood and fortune to the cause of his father  that is indeed but too probable said peveril but the court shall be no element of mine i will live like my fathers among my people care for their comforts decide their differences  build maypoles and dance around them said bridgenorth with another of those grim smiles which passed over his features like the light of a sextons torch as it glares and is reflected by the window of the church when he comes from locking a funeral vault no julian these are not times in which by the dreaming drudgery of a country magistrate and the petty cares of a country proprietor a man can serve his unhappy country there are mighty designs afloat and men are called to make their choice betwixt god and baal the ancient superstitionthe abomination of our fathersis raising its head and flinging abroad its snares under the protection of the princes of the earth but she raises not her head unmarked or unwatched the true english hearts are as thousands which wait but a signal to arise as one man and show the kings of the earth that they have combined in vain we will cast their cords from usthe cup of their abominations we will not taste  you speak in darkness master bridgenorth said peveril knowing so much of me you may perhaps also be aware that i at least have seen too much of the delusions of rome to desire that they should be propagated at home  else wherefore do i speak to thee friendly and so free said bridgenorth do i not know with what readiness of early wit you baffled the wily attempts of the womans priest to seduce thee from the protestant faith do i not know how thou wast beset when abroad and that thou didst both hold thine own faith and secure the wavering belief of thy friend said i not this was done like the son of margaret peveril said i not he holdeth as yet but the dead letterbut the seed which is sown shall one day sprout and quickenenough however of this for today this is thy habitation i will see in thee neither the servant of the daughter of eshbaal nor the son of him who pursued my life and blemished my honours but thou shalt be to me for this day as the child of her without whom my house had been extinct  so saying he stretched out his thin bony hand and grasped that of julian peveril but there was such a look of mourning in his welcome that whatever delight the youth anticipated spending so long a time in the neighbourhood of alice bridgenorth perhaps in her society or however strongly he felt the prudence of conciliating her fathers goodwill he could not help feeling as if his heart was chilled in his company     chapter xiv             this day at least is friendshipson the morrow            let strife come an she will                                                        otway  deborah debbitch summoned by her master now made her appearance with her handkerchief at her eyes and an appearance of great mental trouble it was not my fault major bridgenorth she said how could i help it like will to likethe boy would comethe girl would see him  peace foolish woman said bridgenorth and hear what i have got to say  i know what your honour has to say well enough said deborah service i wot is no inheritance nowadayssome are wiser than other someif i had not been wheedled away from martindale i might have had a house of mine own by this time  peace idiot said bridgenorth but so intent was deborah on her vindication that he could but thrust the interjection as it were edgewise between her exclamations which followed as thick as is usual in cases where folks endeavour to avert deserved censure by a clamorous justification ere the charge be brought  no wonder she was cheated she said out of sight of her own interest when it was to wait on pretty miss alice all your honours gold should never have tempted me but that i knew she was but a dead castaway poor innocent if she were taken away from my lady or meand so this is the end ontup early and down lateand this is all my thanksbut your honour had better take care what you doshe has the short cough yet sometimesand should take physic spring and fall  peace chattering fool said her master so soon as her failing breath gave him an opportunity to strike in thinkest thou i knew not of this young gentlemans visits to the black fort and that if they had displeased me i would not have known how to stop them  did i know that your honour knew of his visits exclaimed deborah in a triumphant tonefor like most of her condition she never sought farther for her defence than a lie however inconsistent and improbabledid i know that your honour knew of itwhy how should i have permitted his visits else i wonder what your honour takes me for had i not been sure it was the thing in this world that your honour most desired would i have presumed to lend it a hand forward i trust i know my duty better hear if i ever asked another youngster into the house save himselffor i knew your honour was wise and quarrels cannot last for ever and love begins where hatred ends and to be sure they love as if they were born one for the otherand then the estates of moultrassie and martindale suit each other like sheath and knife  parrot of a woman hold your tongue said bridgenorth his patience almost completely exhausted or if you will prate let it be to your playfellows in the kitchen and bid them get ready some dinner presently for master peveril is far from home  that i will and with all my heart said deborah and if there are a pair of fatter fowls in man than shall clap their wings on the table presently your honour shall call me goose as well as parrot she then left the apartment  it is to such a woman as that said bridgenorth looking after her significantly that you conceived me to have abandoned the charge of my only child but enough of this subjectwe will walk abroad if you will while she is engaged in a province fitter for her understanding  so saying he left the house accompanied by julian peveril and they were soon walking side by side as if they had been old acquaintances  it may have happened to many of our readers as it has done to ourselves to be thrown by accident into society with some individual whose claims to what is called a serious character stand considerably higher than our own and with whom therefore we have conceived ourselves likely to spend our time in a very stiff and constrained manner while on the other hand our destined companion may have apprehended some disgust from the supposed levity and thoughtless gaiety of a disposition that when we with that urbanity and goodhumour which is our principal characteristic have accommodated ourself to our companion by throwing as much seriousness into our conversation as our habits will admit he on the other hand moved by our liberal example hath divested his manners of part of their austerity and our conversation has in consequence been of that pleasant texture betwixt the useful and agreeable which best resembles the fairyweb of night and day usually called in prose the twilight it is probable both parties may on such occasions have been the better for their encounter even if it went no farther than to establish for the time a community of feeling between men who separated more perhaps by temper than by principle are too apt to charge each other with profane frivolity on the one hand or fanaticism on the other  it fared thus in peverils walk with bridgenorth and in the conversation which he held with him  carefully avoiding the subject on which he had already spoken major bridgenorth turned his conversation chiefly on foreign travel and on the wonders he had seen in distant countries and which he appeared to have marked with a curious and observant eye this discourse made the time fly light away for although the anecdotes and observations thus communicated were all tinged with the serious and almost gloomy spirit of the narrator they yet contained traits of interest and of wonder such as are usually interesting to a youthful ear and were particularly so to julian who had in his disposition some cast of the romantic and adventurous  it appeared that bridgenorth knew the south of france and could tell many stories of the french huguenots who already began to sustain those vexations which a few years afterwards were summed up by the revocation of the edict of nantz he had even been in hungary for he spoke as from personal knowledge of the character of several of the heads of the great protestant insurrection which at this time had taken place under the celebrated tekeli and laid down solid reasons why they were entitled to make common cause with the great turk rather than submit to the pope of rome he talked also of savoy where those of the reformed religion still suffered a cruel persecution and he mentioned with a swelling spirit the protection which oliver had afforded to the oppressed protestant churches therein showing himself he added more fit to wield the supreme power than those who claiming it by right of inheritance use it only for their own vain and voluptuous pursuits  i did not expect said peveril modestly to have heard olivers panegyric from you master bridgenorth  i do not panegyrise him answered bridgenorth i speak but truth of that extraordinary man now being dead whom when alive i feared not to withstand to his face it is the fault of the present unhappy king if he make us look back with regret to the days when the nation was respected abroad and when devotion and sobriety were practised at homebut i mean not to vex your spirit by controversy you have lived amongst those who find it more easy and more pleasant to be the pensioners of france than her controllersto spend the money which she doles out to themselves than to check the tyranny with which she oppresses our poor brethren of the religion when the scales shall fall from thine eyes all this thou shalt see and seeing shalt learn to detest and despise it  by this time they had completed their walk and were returned to the black fort by a different path from that which had led them up the valley the exercise and the general tone of conversation had removed in some degree the shyness and embarrassment which peveril originally felt in bridgenorths presence and which the tenor of his first remarks had rather increased than diminished deborahs promised banquet was soon on the board and in simplicity as well as neatness and good order answered the character she had claimed for it in one respect alone there seemed some inconsistency perhaps a little affectation most of the dishes were of silver and the plates were of the same metal instead of the trenchers and pewter which peveril had usually seen employed on similar occasions at the black fort  presently with the feeling of one who walks in a pleasant dream from which he fears to awake and whose delight is mingled with wonder and with uncertainty julian peveril found himself seated between alice bridgenorth and her fatherthe being he most loved on earth and the person whom he had ever considered as the great obstacle to their intercourse the confusion of his mind was such that he could scarcely reply to the importunate civilities of dame deborah who seated with them at table in her quality of governante now dispensed the good things which had been prepared under her own eye  as for alice she seemed to have found a resolution to play the mute for she answered not excepting briefly to the questions of dame debbitch nay even when her father which happened once or twice attempted to bring her forward in the conversation she made no further reply than respect for him rendered absolutely necessary  upon bridgenorth himself then devolved the task of entertaining the company and contrary to his ordinary habits he did not seem to shrink from it his discourse was not only easy but almost cheerful though ever and anon crossed by some expressions indicative of natural and habitual melancholy or prophetic of future misfortune and woe flashes of enthusiasm too shot along his conversation gleaming like the sheetlightening of an autumn eve which throws a strong though momentary illumination across the sober twilight and all the surrounding objects which touched by it assume a wilder and more striking character in general however bridgenorths remarks were plain and sensible and as he aimed at no graces of language any ornament which they received arose out of the interest with which they were impressed on his hearers for example when deborah in the pride and vulgarity of her heart called julians attention to the plate from which they had been eating bridgenorth seemed to think an apology necessary for such superfluous expense  it was a symptom he said of approaching danger when such men as were not usually influenced by the vanities of life employed much money in ornaments composed of the precious metals it was a sign that the merchant could not obtain a profit for the capital which for the sake of security he invested in this inert form it was a proof that the noblemen or gentlemen feared the rapacity of power when they put their wealth into forms the most portable and the most capable of being hidden and it showed the uncertainty of credit when a man of judgment preferred the actual possession of a mass of a silver to the convenience of a goldsmiths or a bankers receipt while a shadow of liberty remained he said domestic rights were last invaded and therefore men disposed upon their cupboards and tables the wealth which in these places would remain longest though not perhaps finally sacred from the grasp of a tyrannical government but let there be a demand for capital to support a profitable commerce and the mass is at once consigned to the furnace and ceasing to be a vain and cumbrous ornament of the banquet becomes a potent and active agent for furthering the prosperity of the country  in war too said peveril plate has been found a ready resource  but too much so answered bridgenorth in the late times the plate of the nobles and gentry with that of the colleges and the sale of the crownjewels enabled the king to make his unhappy stand which prevented matters returning to a state of peace and good order until the sword had attained an undue superiority both over king and parliament  he looked at julian as he spoke much as he who proves a horse offers some object suddenly to his eyes then watches to see if he starts or blenches from it but julians thoughts were too much bent on other topics to manifest any alarm his answer referred to a previous part of bridgenorths discourse and was not returned till after a brief pause war then he said war the grand impoverisher is also a creator of wealth which it wastes and devours  yes replied bridgenorth even as the sluice brings into action the sleeping waters of the lake which it finally drains necessity invents arts and discovers means and what necessity is sterner than that of civil war therefore even war is not in itself unmixed evil being the creator of impulses and energies which could not otherwise have existed in society  men should go to war then said peveril that they may send their silver plate to the mint and eat from pewter dishes and wooden plates  not so my son said bridgenorth then checking himself as he observed the deep crimson in julians cheek and brow he added i crave your pardon for such familiarity but i meant not to limit what i said even now to such trifling consequences although it may be something salutary to tear men from their pomps and luxuries and teach those to be romans who would otherwise be sybarites but i would say that times of public danger as they call into circulation the misers hoard and the proud mans bullion and so add to the circulating wealth of the country do also call into action many a brave and noble spirit which would otherwise lie torpid give no example to the living and bequeath no name to future ages society knows not and cannot know the mental treasures which slumber in her bosom till necessity and opportunity call forth the statesman and the soldier from the shades of lowly life to the parts they are designed by providence to perform and the stations which nature had qualified them to hold so rose oliverso rose miltonso rose many another name which cannot be forgotteneven as the tempest summons forth and displays the address of the mariner  you speak said peveril as if national calamity might be in some sort an advantage  and if it were not so replied bridgenorth it had not existed in this state of trial where all temporal evil is alleviated by something good in its progress or result and where all that is good is close coupled with that which is in itself evil  it must be a noble sight said julian to behold the slumbering energies of a great mind awakened into energy and to see it assume the authority which is its due over spirits more meanly endowed  i once witnessed said bridgenorth something to the same effect and as the tale is brief i will tell it you if you willamongst my wanderings the transatlantic settlements have not escaped me more especially the country of new england into which our native land has shaken from her lap as a drunkard flings from him his treasures so much that is precious in the eyes of god and of his children there thousands of our best and most godly mensuch whose righteousness might come of citiesare content to be the inhabitants of the desert rather encountering the unenlightened savages than stooping to extinguish under the oppression practised in britain the light that is within their own minds there i remained for a time during the wars which the colony maintained with philip a great indian chief or sachem as they were called who seemed a messenger sent from satan to buffet them his cruelty was greathis dissimulation profound and the skill and promptitude with which he maintained a destructive and desultory warfare inflicted many dreadful calamities on the settlement i was by chance at a small village in the woods more than thirty miles from boston and in its situation exceedingly lonely and surrounded with thickets nevertheless there was no idea of any danger from the indians at that time for men trusted to the protection of a considerable body of troops who had taken the field for protection of the frontiers and who lay or were supposed to lie betwixt the hamlet and the enemys country but they had to do with a foe whom the devil himself had inspired at once with cunning and cruelty it was on a sabbath morning when we had assembled to take sweet counsel together in the lords house our temple was but constructed of wooden logs but when shall the chant of trained hirelings or the sounding of tin and brass tubes amid the aisles of a minster arise so sweetly to heaven as did the psalm in which we united at once our voices and our hearts an excellent worthy who now sleeps in the lord nehemia solsgrace long the companion of my pilgrimage had just begun to wrestle in prayer when a woman with disordered looks and dishevelled hair entered our chapel in a distracted manner screaming incessantly the indians the indiansin that land no man dares separate himself from his means of defence and whether in the city or in the field in the ploughed land or the forest men keep beside them their weapons as did the jews at the rebuilding of the temple so we sallied forth with our guns and pikes and heard the whoop of these incarnate devils already in possession of a part of the town and exercising their cruelty on the few whom weighty causes or indisposition had withheld from public worship and it was remarked as a judgment that upon that bloody sabbath adrian hanson a dutchman a man well enough disposed towards man but whose mind was altogether given to worldly gain was shot and scalped as he was summing his weekly gains in his warehouse in fine there was much damage done and although our arrival and entrance into combat did in some sort put them back yet being surprised and confused and having no appointed leader of our band the devilish enemy shot hard at us and had some advantage it was pitiful to hear the screams of women and children amid the report of guns and the whistling of bullets mixed with the ferocious yells of these savages which they term their warwhoop several houses in the upper part of the village were soon on fire and the roaring of the flames and crackling of the great beams as they blazed added to the horrible confusion while the smoke which the wind drove against us gave farther advantage to the enemy who fought as it were invisible and under cover whilst we fell fast by their unerring fire in this state of confusion and while we were about to adopt the desperate project of evacuating the village and placing the women and children in the centre of attempting a retreat to the nearest settlement it pleased heaven to send us unexpected assistance a tall man of a reverend appearance whom no one of us had ever seen before suddenly was in the midst of us as we hastily agitated the resolution of retreating his garments were of the skin of the elk and he wore sword and carried gun i never saw anything more august than his features overshadowed by locks of grey hair which mingled with a long beard of the same colour men and brethren he said in a voice like that which turns back the flight why sink your hearts and why are you thus disquieted fear ye that the god we serve will give you up to yonder heathen dogs follow me and you shall see this day that there is a captain in israel he uttered a few brief but distinct orders in a tone of one who was accustomed to command and such was the influence of his appearance his mien his language and his presence of mind that he was implicitly obeyed by men who had never seen him until that moment we were hastily divided by his orders into two bodies one of which maintained the defence of the village with more courage than ever convinced that the unknown was sent by god to our rescue at his command they assumed the best and most sheltered positions for exchanging their deadly fire with the indians while under cover of the smoke the stranger sallied from the town at the head of the other division of the new england men and fetching a circuit attacked the red warriors in the rear the surprise as is usual amongst savages had complete effect for they doubted not that they were assailed in their turn and placed betwixt two hostile parties by the return of a detachment from the provincial army the heathens fled in confusion abandoning the halfwon village and leaving behind them such a number of their warriors that the tribe hath never recovered its loss never shall i forget the figure of our venerable leader when our men and not they only but the women and children of the village rescued from the tomahawk and scalpingknife stood crowded around him yet scarce venturing to approach his person and more minded perhaps to worship him as a descended angel than to thank him as a fellowmortal not unto me be the glory he said i am but an implement frail as yourselves in the hand of him who is strong to deliver bring me a cup of water that i may allay my parched throat ere i essay the task of offering thanks where they are most due i was nearest to him as he spoke and i gave into his hand the water he requested at that moment we exchanged glances and it seemed to me that i recognised a noble friend whom i had long since deemed in glory but he gave me no time to speak had speech been prudent sinking on his knees and signing us to obey him he poured forth a strong and energetic thanksgiving for the turning back of the battle which pronounced with a voice loud and clear as a wartrumpet thrilled through the joints and marrow of the hearers i have heard many an act of devotion in my life had heaven vouchsafed me grace to profit by them but such a prayer as this uttered amid the dead and the dying with a rich tone of mingled triumph and adoration was beyond them allit was like the song of the inspired prophetess who dwelt beneath the palmtree between ramah and bethel he was silent and for a brief space we remained with our faces bent to the earthno man daring to lift his head at length we looked up but our deliverer was no longer amongst us nor was he ever again seen in the land which he had rescued  here bridgenorth who had told this singular story with an eloquence and vivacity of detail very contrary to the usual dryness of his conversation paused for an instant and then resumedthou seest young man that men of valour and of discretion are called forth to command in circumstances of national exigence though their very existence is unknown in the land which they are predestined to deliver  but what thought the people of the mysterious stranger said julian who had listened with eagerness for the story was of a kind interesting to the youthful and the brave  many things answered bridgenorth and as usual little to the purpose the prevailing opinion was notwithstanding his own disclamation that the stranger was really a supernatural being others believed him an inspired champion transported in the body from some distant climate to show us the way to safety others again concluded that he was a recluse who either from motives of piety or other cogent reasons had become a dweller in the wilderness and shunned the face of man  and if i may presume to ask said julian to which of these opinions were you disposed to adhere  the last suited best with the transient though close view with which i had perused the strangers features replied bridgenorth for although i dispute not that it may please heaven on high occasions even to raise one from the dead in defence of his country yet i doubted not then as i doubt not now that i looked on the living form of one who had indeed powerful reasons to conceal him in the cleft of the rock  are these reasons a secret said julian peveril  not properly a secret replied bridgenorth for i fear not thy betraying what i might tell thee in private discourse and besides wert thou so base the prey lies too distant for any hunters to whom thou couldst point out its traces but the name of this worthy will sound harsh in thy ear on account of one action of his lifebeing his accession to a great measure which made the extreme isles of the earth to tremble have you never heard of richard whalley  of the regicide exclaimed peveril starting  call his act what thou wilt said bridgenorth he was not less the rescuer of that devoted village that with other leading spirits of the age he sat in the judgmentseat when charles stewart was arraigned at the bar and subscribed the sentence that went forth upon him  i have ever heard said julian in an altered voice and colouring deeply that you master bridgenorth with other presbyterians were totally averse to that detestable crime and were ready to have made jointcause with the cavaliers in preventing so horrible a parricide  if it were so said bridgenorth we have been richly rewarded by his successor  rewarded exclaimed julian does the distinction of good and evil and our obligation to do the one and forbear the other depend on the reward which may attach to our actions  god forbid answered bridgenorth yet those who view the havoc which this house of stewart have made in the church and statethe tyranny which they exercise over mens persons and consciencesmay well doubt whether it be lawful to use weapons in their defence yet you hear me not praise or even vindicate the death of the king though so far deserved as he was false to his oath as a prince and magistrate i only tell you what you desired to know that richard whalley one of the late kings judges was he of whom i have just been speaking i knew his lofty brow though time had made it balder and higher his grey eye retained all its lustre and though the grizzled beard covered the lower part of his face it prevented me not from recognising him the scent was hot after him for his blood but by the assistance of those friends whom heaven had raised up for his preservation he was concealed carefully and emerged only to do the will of providence in the matter of that battle perhaps his voice may be heard in the field once more should england need one of her noblest hearts  now god forbid said julian  amen returned bridgenorth may god avert civil war and pardon those whose madness would bring it on us  there was a long pause during which julian who had scarce lifted his eyes towards alice stole a glance in that direction and was struck by the deep cast of melancholy which had stolen over features to which a cheerful if not gay expression was most natural so soon as she caught his eye she remarked and as julian thought with significance that the shadows were lengthening and evening coming on  he heard and although satisfied that she hinted at his departure he could not upon the instant find resolution to break the spell which detained him the language which bridgenorth held was not only new and alarming but so contrary to the maxims in which he was brought up that as a son of sir geoffrey peveril of the peak he would in another case have thought himself called upon to dispute its conclusions even at the swords point but bridgenorths opinions were delivered with so much calmnessseemed so much the result of convictionthat they excited in julian rather a spirit of wonder than of angry controversy there was a character of sober decision and sedate melancholy in all that he said which even had he not been the father of alice and perhaps julian was not himself aware how much he was influenced by that circumstance would have rendered it difficult to take personal offence his language and sentiments were of that quiet yet decided kind upon which it is difficult either to fix controversy or quarrel although it be impossible to acquiesce in the conclusions to which they lead  while julian remained as if spellbound to his chair scarce more surprised at the company in which he found himself than at the opinions to which he was listening another circumstance reminded him that the proper time of his stay at black fort had been expended little fairy the manx pony which well accustomed to the vicinity of black fort used to feed near the house while her master made his visits there began to find his present stay rather too long she had been the gift of the countess to julian whilst a youth and came of a highspirited mountain breed remarkable alike for hardiness for longevity and for a degree of sagacity approaching to that of the dog fairy showed the latter quality by the way in which she chose to express her impatience to be moving homewards at least such seemed the purpose of the shrill neigh with which she startled the female inmates of the parlour who the moment afterwards could not forbear smiling to see the nose of the pony advanced through the opened casement  fairy reminds me said julian looking to alice and rising that the term of my stay here is exhausted  speak with me yet one moment said bridgenorth withdrawing him into a gothic recess of the oldfashioned apartment and speaking so low that he could not be overheard by alice and her governante who in the meantime caressed and fed with fragments of bread the intruder fairy  you have not after all said bridgenorth told me the cause of your coming hither he stopped as if to enjoy his embarrassment and then added and indeed it were most unnecessary that you should do so i have not so far forgotten the days of my youth or those affections which bind poor frail humanity but too much to the things of this world will you find no words to ask of me the great boon which you seek and which peradventure you would not have hesitated to have made your own without my knowledge and against my consentnay never vindicate thyself but mark me farther the patriarch bought his beloved by fourteen years hard service to her father laban and they seemed to him but as a few days but he that would wed my daughter must serve in comparison but a few days though in matters of such mighty import that they shall seem as the service of many years reply not to me now but go and peace be with you  he retired so quickly after speaking that peveril had literally not an instant to reply he cast his eyes around the apartment but deborah and her charge had also disappeared his gaze rested for a moment on the portrait of christian and his imagination suggested that his dark features were illuminated by a smile of haughty triumph he stared and looked more attentivelyit was but the effect of the evening beam which touched the picture at the instant the effect was gone and there remained but the fixed grave inflexible features of the republican soldier  julian left the apartment as one who walks in a dream he mounted fairy and agitated by a variety of thoughts which he was unable to reduce to order he returned to castle rushin before the night sat down  here he found all in movement the countess with her son had upon some news received or resolution formed during his absence removed with a principal part of their family to the yet stronger castle of holmpeel about eight miles distance across the island and which had been suffered to fall into a much more dilapidated condition than that of castletown so far as it could be considered as a place of residence but as a fortress holmpeel was stronger than castletown nay unless assailed regularly was almost impregnable and was always held by a garrison belonging to the lords of man here peveril arrived at nightfall he was told in the fishingvillage that the nightbell of the castle had been rung earlier than usual and the watch set with circumstances of unusual and jealous repetition  resolving therefore not to disturb the garrison by entering at that late hour he obtained an indifferent lodging in the town for the night and determined to go to the castle early on the succeeding morning he was not sorry thus to gain a few hours of solitude to think over the agitating events of the preceding day     chapter xv                  what seemd its head                 the likeness of a kingly crown had on                                            paradise lost  sodor or holmpeel so is named the castle to which our julian directed his course early on the following morning is one of those extraordinary monuments of antiquity with which this singular and interesting island abounds it occupies the whole of a high rocky peninsula or rather an island for it is surrounded by the sea at highwater and scarcely accessible even when the tide is out although a stone causeway of great solidity erected for the express purpose connects the island with the mainland the whole space is surrounded by double walls of great strength and thickness and the access to the interior at the time which we treat of was only by two flights of steep and narrow steps divided from each other by a strong tower and guardhouse under the former of which there is an entrancearch the open space within the walls extends to two acres and contains many objects worthy of antiquarian curiosity there were besides the castle itself two cathedral churches dedicated the earlier to st patrick the latter to st germain besides two smaller churches all of which had become even in that day more or less ruinous their decayed walls exhibiting the rude and massive architecture of the most remote period were composed of a ragged greystone which formed a singular contrast with the bright red freestone of which the windowcases cornerstones arches and other ornamental parts of the building were composed  besides these four ruinous churches the space of ground enclosed by the massive exterior walls of holmpeel exhibited many other vestiges of the olden time there was a square mound of earth facing with its angles to the points of the compass one of those motes as they were called on which in ancient times the northern tribes elected or recognised their chiefs and held their solemn popular assemblies or comitia there was also one of those singular towers so common in ireland as to have proved the favourite theme of her antiquaries but of which the real use and meaning seems yet to be hidden in the mist of ages this of holmpeel had been converted to the purpose of a watchtower there were besides runic monuments of which legends could not be deciphered and later inscriptions to the memory of champions of whom the names only were preserved from oblivion but tradition and superstitious eld still most busy where real history is silent had filled up the long blank of accurate information with tales of seakings and pirates hebridean chiefs and norwegian resolutes who had formerly warred against and in defence of this famous castle superstition too had her tales of fairies ghosts and spectresher legions of saints and demons of fairies and of familiar spirits which in no corner of the british empire are told and received with more absolute credulity than in the isle of man  amidst all these ruins of an older time arose the castle itselfnow ruinousbut in charles iis reign well garrisoned and in a military point of view kept in complete order it was a venerable and very ancient building containing several apartments of sufficient size and height to be termed noble but in the surrender of the island by christian the furniture had been in a great measure plundered or destroyed by the republican soldiers so that as we have before hinted its present state was ill adapted for the residence of the noble proprietor yet it had been often the abode not only of the lords of man but of those state prisoners whom the kings of britain sometimes committed to their charge  in this castle of holmpeel the great kingmaker richard earl of warwick was confined during one period of his eventful life to ruminate at leisure on his farther schemes of ambition and here too eleanor the haughty wife of the good duke of gloucester pined out in seclusion the last days of her banishment the sentinels pretended that her discontented spectre was often visible at night traversing the battlements of the external walls or standing motionless beside a particular solitary turret of one of the watchtowers with which they are flanked but dissolving into air at cockcrow or when the bell tolled from the yet remaining tower of st germains church  such was holmpeel as records inform us till towards the end of the seventeenth century  it was in one of the lofty but almost unfurnished apartments of this ancient castle that julian peveril found his friend the earl of derby who had that moment sat down to a breakfast composed of various sorts of fish welcome most imperial julian he said welcome to our royal fortress in which as yet we are not like to be starved with hunger though wellnigh dead for cold  julian answered by inquiring the meaning of this sudden movement  upon my word replied the earl you know nearly as much of it as i do my mother has told me nothing about it supposing i believe that i shall at length be tempted to inquire but she will find herself much mistaken i shall give her credit for full wisdom in her proceedings rather than put her to the trouble to render a reason though no woman can render one better  come come this is affectation my good friend said julian you should inquire into these matters a little more curiously  to what purpose said the earl to hear old stories about the tinwald laws and the contending rights of the lords and the clergy and all the rest of that celtic barbarism which like burgesses thoroughpaced doctrine enters at one ear paces through and goes out at the other  come my lord said julian you are not so indifferent as you would represent yourselfyou are dying of curiosity to know what this hurry is about only you think it the courtly humour to appear careless about your own affairs  why what should it be about said the young earl unless some factious dispute between our majestys minister governor nowel and our vassals or perhaps some dispute betwixt our majesty and the ecclesiastical jurisdictions for all which our majesty cares as little as any king in christendom  i rather suppose there is intelligence from england said julian i heard last night in peeltown that greenhalgh is come over with unpleasant news  he brought me nothing that was pleasant i wot well said the earl i expected something from st evremond or hamiltonsome new plays by dryden or lee and some waggery or lampoons from the rose coffeehouse and the fellow has brought me nothing but a parcel of tracts about protestants and papists and a folio playbook one of the conceptions as she calls them of that old madwoman the duchess of newcastle  hush my lord for heavens sake said peveril here comes the countess and you know she takes fire at the least slight to her ancient friend  let her read her ancient friends works herself then said the earl and think her as wise as she can but i would not give one of wallers songs or denhams satires for a whole cartload of her graces trashbut here comes our mother with care on her brow  the countess of derby entered the apartment accordingly holding in her hand a number of papers her dress was a mourning habit with a deep train of black velvet which was borne by a little favourite attendant a deaf and dumb girl whom in compassion to her misfortune the countess had educated about her person for some years upon this unfortunate being with the touch of romance which marked many of her proceedings lady derby had conferred the name of fenella after some ancient princess of the island the countess herself was not much changed since we last presented her to our readers age had rendered her step more slow but not less majestic and while it traced some wrinkles on her brow had failed to quench the sedate fire of her dark eye the young men rose to receive her with the formal reverence which they knew she loved and were greeted by her with equal kindness  cousin peveril she said for so she always called julian in respect of his mother being a kinswoman of her husband you were ill abroad last night when we much needed your counsel  julian answered with a blush which he could not prevent that he had followed his sport among the mountains too farhad returned lateand finding her ladyship was removed from castletown had instantly followed the family hither but as the nightbell was rung and the watch set he had deemed it more respectful to lodge for the night in the town  it is well said the countess and to do you justice julian you are seldom a truant neglecter of appointed hours though like the rest of the youth of this age you sometimes suffer your sports to consume too much of time that should be spent otherwise but for your friend philip he is an avowed contemner of good order and seems to find pleasure in wasting time even when he does not enjoy it  i have been enjoying my time just now at least said the earl rising from table and picking his teeth carelessly these fresh mullets are delicious and so is the lachrymæ christi i pray you to sit down to breakfast julian and partake the goods my royal foresight has provided never was king of man nearer being left to the mercy of the execrable brandy of his dominions old griffiths would never in the midst of our speedy retreat of last night have had sense enough to secure a few flasks had i not given him a hint on that important subject but presence of mind amid danger and tumult is a jewel i have always possessed  i wish then philip you would exert it to better purpose said the countess half smiling half displeased for she doated upon her son with all a mothers fondness even when she was most angry with him for being deficient in the peculiar and chivalrous disposition which had distinguished his father and which was so analogous to her own romantic and highminded character lend me your signet she added with a sigh for it were i fear vain to ask you to read over these despatches from england and execute the warrants which i have thought necessary to prepare in consequence  my signet you shall command with all my heart madam said earl philip but spare me the revision of what you are much more capable to decide upon i am you know a most complete roi fainéant and never once interfered with my maire de palais in her proceedings  the countess made signs to her little trainbearer who immediately went to seek for wax and a light with which she presently returned  in the meanwhile the countess continued addressing peveril philip does himself less than justice when you were absent julian for if you had been here i would have given you the credit of prompting your friend he had a spirited controversy with the bishop for an attempt to enforce spiritual censures against a poor wretch by confining her in the vault under the chapel   beneath the only one of the four churches in castle rushin which     is or was kept a little in repair is a prison or dungeon for     ecclesiastical offenders this says waldron is certainly one     of the most dreadful places that imagination can form the sea     runs under it through the hollows of the rock with such a     continual roar that you would think it were every moment breaking     in upon you and over it are the vaults for burying the dead the     stairs descending to this place of terrors are not above thirty     but so steep and narrow that they are very difficult to go down     a child of eight or nine years not being able to pass them but     sidewayswaldrons description of the isle of man in his     works p 105 folio  do not think better of me than i deserve said the earl to peveril my mother has omitted to tell you the culprit was pretty peggy of ramsey and her crime what in cupids courts would have been called a peccadillo  do not make yourself worse than you are replied peveril who observed the countesss cheek reddenyou know you would have done as much for the oldest and poorest cripple in the island why the vault is under the burialground of the chapel and for aught i know under the ocean itself such a roaring do the waves make in its vicinity i think no one could remain there long and retain his reason  it is an infernal hole answered the earl and i will have it built up one daythat is full certainbut holdholdfor gods sake madamwhat are you going to dolook at the seal before you put it to the warrantyou will see it is a choice antique cameo cupid riding on a flying fishi had it for twenty zechins from signor furabosco at romea most curious matter for an antiquary but which will add little faith to a manx warrant  my signetmy signetoh you mean that with the three monstrous legs which i supposed was devised as the most preposterous device to represent our most absurd majesty of manthe signeti have not seen it since i gave it to gibbon my monkey to play withhe did whine for it most piteouslyi hope he has not gemmed the green breast of ocean with my symbol of sovereignty  now by heaven said the countess trembling and colouring deeply with anger it was your fathers signet the last pledge which he sent with his love to me and his blessing to thee the night before they murdered him at bolton  mother dearest mother said the earl startled out of his apathy and taking her hand which he kissed tenderly i did but jestthe signet is safepeveril knows that it is sogo fetch it julian for heavens sakehere are my keysit is in the lefthand drawer of my travelling cabinetnay mother forgive meit was but a mauvaise plaisanterie only an illimagined jest ungracious and in bad taste i allowbut only one of philips follies look at me dearest mother and forgive me  the countess turned her eyes towards him from which the tears were fast falling  philip she said you try me too unkindly and too severely if times are changed as i have heard you allegeif the dignity of rank and the high feelings of honour and duty are now drowned in giddy jests and trifling pursuits let me at least who live secluded from all others die without perceiving the change which has happened and above all without perceiving it in mine own son let me not learn the general prevalence of this levity which laughs at every sense of dignity or duty through your personal disrespectlet me not think that when i die  speak nothing of it mother said the earl interrupting her affectionately it is true i cannot promise to be all my father and his fathers were for we wear silk vests for their steel coats and feathered beavers for their crested helmets but believe me though to be an absolute palmerin of england is not in my nature no son ever loved a mother more dearly or would do more to oblige her and that you may own this i will forthwith not only seal the warrants to the great endangerment of my precious fingers but also read the same from end to end as well as the despatches thereunto appertaining  a mother is easily appeased even when most offended and it was with an expanding heart that the countess saw her sons very handsome features while reading these papers settle into an expression of deep seriousness such as they seldom wore it seemed to her as if the family likeness to his gallant but unfortunate father increased when the expression of their countenances became similar in gravity the earl had no sooner perused the despatches which he did with great attention than he rose and said julian come with me  the countess looked surprised i was wont to share your fathers counsels my son she said but do not think that i wish to intrude myself upon yours i am too well pleased to see you assume the power and the duty of thinking for yourself which is what i have so long urged you to do nevertheless my experience who have been so long administrator of your authority in man might not i think be superfluous to the matter in hand  hold me excused dearest mother said the earl gravely the interference was none of my seeking had you taken your own course without consulting me it had been well but since i have entered on the affairand it appears sufficiently importanti must transact it to the best of my own ability  go then my son said the countess and may heaven enlighten thee with its counsel since thou wilt have none of minei trust that you master peveril will remind him of what is fit for his own honour and that only a coward abandons his rights and only a fool trusts his enemies  the earl answered not but taking peveril by the arm led him up a winding stair to his own apartment and from thence into a projecting turret where amidst the roar of waves and seamews clang he held with him the following conversation  peveril it is well i looked into these warrants my mother queens it at such a rate as may cost me not only my crown which i care little for but perhaps my head which though others may think little of i would feel it an inconvenience to be deprived of  what on earth is the matter said peveril with considerable anxiety  it seems said the earl of derby that old england who takes a frolicsome brainfever once every two or three years for the benefit of her doctors and the purification of the torpid lethargy brought on by peace and prosperity is now gone stark staring mad on the subject of a real or supposed popish plot i read one programme on the subject by a fellow called oates and thought it the most absurd foolery i ever perused but that cunning fellow shaftesbury and some others amongst the great ones having taken it up and are driving on at such a rate as makes harness crack and horses smoke for it the king who has sworn never to kiss the pillow his father went to sleep on temporises and gives way to the current the duke of york suspected and hated on account of his religion is about to be driven to the continent several principal catholic nobles are in the tower already and the nation like a bull at tutburyrunning is persecuted with so many inflammatory rumours and pestilent pamphlets that she has cocked her tail flung up her heels taken the bit betwixt her teeth and is as furiously unmanageable as in the year 1642  all this you must have known already said peveril i wonder you told me not of news so important  it would have taken long to tell said the earl moreover i desired to have you solus thirdly i was about to speak when my mother entered and to conclude it was no business of mine but these despatches of my politic mothers private correspondent put a new face on the whole matter for it seems some of the informersa trade which having become a thriving one is now pursued by manyhave dared to glance at the countess herself as an agent in this same plotay and have found those that are willing enough to believe their report  on mine honour said peveril you both take it with great coolness i think the countess the more composed of the two for except her movement hither she exhibited no mark of alarm and moreover seemed no way more anxious to communicate the matter to your lordship than decency rendered necessary  my good mother said the earl loves power though it has cost her dear i wish i could truly say that my neglect of business is entirely assumed in order to leave it in her hands but that better motive combines with natural indolence but she seems to have feared i should not think exactly like her in this emergency and she was right in supposing so  how comes the emergency upon you said julian and what form does the danger assume  marry thus it is said the earl i need not bid you remember the affair of colonel christian that man besides his widow who is possessed of large propertydame christian of kirk truagh whom you have often heard of and perhaps seenleft a brother called edward christian whom you never saw at all now this brotherbut i dare say you know all about it  not i on my honour said peveril you know the countess seldom or never alludes to the subject  why replied the earl i believe in her heart she is something ashamed of that gallant act of royalty and supreme jurisdiction the consequences of which maimed my estate so cruellywell cousin this same edward christian was one of the dempsters at the time and naturally enough was unwilling to concur in the sentence which adjudged his aîné to be shot like a dog my mother who was then in high force and not to be controlled by any one would have served the dempster with the same sauce with which she dressed his brother had he not been wise enough to fly from the island since that time the thing has slept on all hands and though we knew that dempster christian made occasionally secret visits to his friends in the island along with two or three other puritans of the same stamp and particularly a prickeared rogue called bridgenorth brotherinlaw to the deceased yet my mother thank heaven has hitherto had the sense to connive at them though for some reason or other she holds this bridgenorth in especial disfavour  and why said peveril forcing himself to speak in order to conceal the very unpleasant surprise which he felt why does the countess now depart from so prudent a line of conduct  you must know the case is now different the rogues are not satisfied with tolerationthey would have supremacy they have found friends in the present heat of the popular mind my mothers name and especially that of her confessor aldrick the jesuit have been mentioned in this beautiful maze of a plot which if any such at all exists she knows as little of as you or i however she is a catholic and that is enough and i have little doubt that if the fellows could seize on our scrap of a kingdom here and cut all our throats they would have the thanks of the present house of commons as willingly as old christian had those of the rump for a similar service  from whence did you receive all this information said peveril again speaking though by the same effort which a man makes who talks in his sleep  aldrick has seen the duke of york in secret and his royal highness who wept while he confessed his want of power to protect his friendsand it is no trifle will wring tears from himtold him to send us information that we should look to our safety for that dempster christian and bridgenorth were in the island with secret and severe orders that they had formed a considerable party there and were likely to be owned and protected in anything they might undertake against us the people of ramsey and castletown are unluckily discontented about some new regulation of the imposts and to tell you the truth though i thought yesterdays sudden remove a whim of my mothers i am almost satisfied they would have blockaded us in rushin castle where we could not have held out for lack of provisions here we are better supplied and as we are on our guard it is likely the intended rising will not take place  and what is to be done in this emergency said peveril  that is the very question my gentle coz answered the earl my mother sees but one way of going to work and that is by royal authority here are the warrants she had prepared to search for take and apprehend the bodies of edward christian and robertno ralph bridgenorth and bring them to instant trial no doubt she would soon have had them in the castle court with a dozen of the old matchlocks levelled against themthat is her way of solving all sudden difficulties  but in which i trust you do not acquiesce my lord answered peveril whose thoughts instantly reverted to alice if they could ever be said to be absent from her  truly i acquiesce in no such matter said the earl william christians death cost me a fair half of my inheritance i have no fancy to fall under the displeasure of my royal brother king charles for a new escapade of the same kind but how to pacify my mother i know not i wish the insurrection would take place and then as we are better provided than they can be we might knock the knaves on the head and yet since they began the fray we should keep the law on our side  were it not better said peveril if by any means these men could be induced to quit the island  surely replied the earl but that will be no easy matterthey are stubborn on principle and empty threats will not move them this stormblast in london is wind in their sails and they will run their length you may depend on it i have sent orders however to clap up the manxmen upon whose assistance they depended and if i can find the two worthies themselves here are sloops enough in the harbouri will take the freedom to send them on a pretty distant voyage and i hope matters will be settled before they return to give an account of it  at this moment a soldier belonging to the garrison approached the two young men with many bows and tokens of respect how now friend said the earl to him leave off thy courtesies and tell thy business  the man who was a native islander answered in manx that he had a letter for his honour master julian peveril julian snatched the billet hastily and asked whence it came  it was delivered to him by a young woman the soldier replied who had given him a piece of money to deliver it into master peverils own hand  thou art a lucky fellow julian said the earl with that grave brow of thine and thy character for sobriety and early wisdom you set the girls awooing without waiting till they are asked whilst i their drudge and vassal waste both language and leisure without getting a kind word or look far less a billetdoux  this the young earl said with a smile of conscious triumph as in fact he valued himself not a little upon the interest which he supposed himself to possess with the fair sex  meanwhile the letter impressed on peveril a different train of thoughts from what his companion apprehended it was in alices hand and contained these few words    i fear what i am going to do is wrong but i must see you meet me   at noon at goddard crovans stone with as much secrecy as you   may   the letter was signed only with the initials a b but julian had no difficulty in recognising the handwriting which he had often seen and which was remarkably beautiful he stood suspended for he saw the difficulty and impropriety of withdrawing himself from the countess and his friend at this moment of impending danger and yet to neglect this invitation was not to be thought of he paused in the utmost perplexity  shall i read your riddle said the earl go where love calls youi will make an excuse to my motheronly most grave anchorite be hereafter more indulgent to the failings of others than you have been hitherto and blaspheme not the power of the little deity  nay but cousin derby said peveril and stopped short for he really knew not what to say secured himself by a virtuous passion from the contagious influence of the time he had seen with regret his noble kinsman mingle more in its irregularities than he approved of and had sometimes played the part of a monitor circumstances seemed at present to give the earl a right of retaliation he kept his eye fixed on his friend as if he waited till he should complete his sentence and at length exclaimed what cousin quite àlamort oh most judicious julian oh most precise peveril have you bestowed so much wisdom on me that you have none left for yourself come be franktell me name and placeor say but the colour of the eyes of the most emphatic sheor do but let me have the pleasure to hear thee say i loveconfess one touch of human frailtyconjugate the verb amo and i will be a gentle schoolmaster and you shall have as father richards used to say when we were under his ferule licentia exeundi  enjoy your pleasant humour at my expense my lord said peveril i fairly will confess thus much that i would fain if it consisted with my honour and your safety have two hours at my own disposal the more especially as the manner in which i shall employ them may much concern the safety of the island  very likely i dare say answered the earl still laughing no doubt you are summoned out by some lady politic wouldbe of the isle to talk over some of the breastlaws but never mindgo and go speedily that you may return as quickly as possible i expect no immediate explosion of this grand conspiracy when the rogues see us on our guard they will be cautious how they break out only once more make haste  peveril thought this last advice was not to be neglected and glad to extricate himself from the raillery of his cousin walked down towards the gate of the castle meaning to cross over to the village and there take horse at the earls stables for the place of rendezvous     chapter xvi           acastocan she not speak          oswaldif speech be only in accented sounds          framed by the tongue and lips the maidens dumb

for her eyes          like the bright stars of heaven can hold discourse          though it be mute and soundless                                                    old play  at the head of the first flight of steps which descended towards the difficult and welldefended entrance of the castle of holmpeel peveril was met and stopped by the countesss trainbearer this little creaturefor she was of the least and slightest size of womankindwas exquisitely well formed in all her limbs which the dress she usually wore a green silk tunic of a peculiar form set off to the best advantage her face was darker than the usual hue of europeans and the profusion of long and silken hair which when she undid the braids in which she commonly wore it fell down almost to her ankles was also rather a foreign attribute her countenance resembled a most beautiful miniature and there was a quickness decision and fire in fenellas look and especially in her eyes which was probably rendered yet more alert and acute because through the imperfection of her other organs it was only by sight that she could obtain information of what passed around her  the pretty mute was mistress of many little accomplishments which the countess had caused to be taught to her in compassion for her forlorn situation and which she learned with the most surprising quickness thus for example she was exquisite in the use of the needle and so ready and ingenious a draughtswoman that like the ancient mexicans she sometimes made a hasty sketch with her pencil the means of conveying her ideas either by direct or emblematical representation above all in the art of ornamental writing much studied at that period fenella was so great a proficient as to rival the fame of messrs snow shelley and other masters of the pen whose copybooks preserved in the libraries of the curious still show the artists smiling on the frontispiece in all the honours of flowing gowns and fullbottomed wigs to the eternal glory of caligraphy  the little maiden had besides these accomplishments much ready wit and acuteness of intellect with lady derby and with the two young gentlemen she was a great favourite and used much freedom in conversing with them by means of a system of signs which had been gradually established amongst them and which served all ordinary purposes of communication  but though happy in the indulgence and favour of her mistress from whom indeed she was seldom separate fenella was by no means a favourite with the rest of the household in fact it seemed that her temper exasperated perhaps by a sense of her misfortune was by no means equal to her abilities she was very haughty in her demeanour even towards the upper domestics who in that establishment were of a much higher rank and better birth than in the families of the nobility in general these often complained not only of her pride and reserve but of her high and irascible temper and vindictive disposition her passionate propensity had been indeed idly encouraged by the young men and particularly by the earl who sometimes amused himself with teasing her that he might enjoy the various singular motions and murmurs by which she expressed her resentment towards him these were of course only petulant and whimsical indications of pettish anger but when she was angry with others of inferior degreebefore whom she did not control herselfthe expression of her passion unable to display itself in language had something even frightful so singular were the tones contortions and gestures to which she had recourse the lower domestics to whom she was liberal almost beyond her apparent means observed her with much deference and respect but much more from fear than from any real attachment for the caprices of her temper displayed themselves even in her gifts and those who most frequently shared her bounty seemed by no means assured of the benevolence of the motives which dictated her liberality  all these peculiarities led to a conclusion consonant with manx superstition devout believers in all the legends of fairies so dear to the celtic tribes the manx people held it for certainty that the elves were in the habit of carrying off mortal children before baptism and leaving in the cradle of the new born babe one of their own brood which was almost always imperfect in some one or other of the organs proper to humanity such a being they conceived fenella to be and the smallness of her size her dark complexion her long locks of silken hair the singularity of her manners and tones as well as the caprices of her temper were to their thinking all attributes of the irritable fickle and dangerous race from which they supposed her to be sprung and it seemed that although no jest appeared to offend her more than when lord derby called her in sport the elfin queen or otherwise alluded to her supposed connection with the pigmy folk yet still her perpetually affecting to wear the colour of green proper to the fairies as well as some other peculiarities seemed voluntarily assumed by her in order to countenance the superstition perhaps because it gave her more authority among the lower orders  many were the tales circulated respecting the countesss elf as fenella was currently called in the island and the malcontents of the stricter persuasion were convinced that no one but a papist and a malignant would have kept near her person a creature of such doubtful origin they conceived that fenellas deafness and dumbness were only towards those of this world and that she had been heard talking and singing and laughing most elvishly with the invisibles of her own race they alleged also that she had a double a sort of apparition resembling her which slept in the countesss anteroom or bore her train or wrought in her cabinet while the real fenella joined the song of the mermaids on the moonlight sands or the dance of the fairies in the haunted valley of glenmoy or on the heights of snawfell and barool the sentinels too would have sworn they had seen the little maiden trip past them in their solitary night walks without their having it in their power to challenge her any more than if they had been as mute as herself to all this mass of absurdities the better informed paid no more attention than to the usual idle exaggerations of the vulgar which so frequently connect that which is unusual with what is supernatural  such in form and habits was the little female who holding in her hand a small oldfashioned ebony rod which might have passed for a divining wand confronted julian on the top of the flight of steps which led down the rock from the castle court we ought to observe that as julians manner to the unfortunate girl had been always gentle and free from those teasing jests in which his gay friend indulged with less regard to the peculiarity of her situation and feelings so fenella on her part had usually shown much greater deference to him than to any of the household her mistress the countess always excepted  on the present occasion planting herself in the very midst of the narrow descent so as to make it impossible for peveril to pass by her she proceeded to put him to the question by a series of gestures which we will endeavour to describe she commenced by extending her hand slightly accompanied with the sharp inquisitive look which served her as a note of interrogation this was meant as an inquiry whether he was going to a distance julian in reply extended his arm more than half to intimate that the distance was considerable fenella looked grave shook her head and pointed to the countesss window which was visible from the spot where they stood peveril smiled and nodded to intimate there was no danger in quitting her mistress for a short space the little maiden next touched an eagles feather which she wore in her hair a sign which she usually employed to designate the earl and then looked inquisitively at julian once more as if to say goes he with you peveril shook his head and somewhat wearied by these interrogatories smiled and made an effort to pass fenella frowned struck the end of her ebony rod perpendicularly on the ground and again shook her head as if opposing his departure but finding that julian persevered in his purpose she suddenly assumed another and milder mood held him by the skirt of his cloak with one hand and raised the other in an imploring attitude whilst every feature of her lively countenance was composed into the like expression of supplication and the fire of the large dark eyes which seemed in general so keen and piercing as almost to overanimate the little sphere to which they belonged seemed quenched for the moment in the large drops which hung on her long eyelashes but without falling  julian peveril was far from being void of sympathy towards the poor girl whose motives in opposing his departure appeared to be her affectionate apprehension for her mistresss safety he endeavoured to reassure by smiles and at the same time by such signs as he could devise to intimate that there was no danger and that he would return presently and having succeeded in extricating his cloak from her grasp and in passing her on the stair he began to descend the steps as speedily as he could in order to avoid farther importunity  but with activity much greater than his the dumb maiden hastened to intercept him and succeeded by throwing herself at the imminent risk of life and limb a second time into the pass which he was descending so as to interrupt his purpose in order to achieve this she was obliged to let herself drop a considerable height from the wall of a small flanking battery where two patereroes were placed to scour the pass in case any enemy could have mounted so high julian had scarce time to shudder at her purpose as he beheld her about to spring from the parapet ere like a thing of gossamer she stood light and uninjured on the rocky platform below he endeavoured by the gravity of his look and gesture to make her understand how much he blamed her rashness but the reproof though obviously quite intelligible was entirely thrown away a hasty wave of her hand intimated how she contemned the danger and the remonstrance while at the same time she instantly resumed with more eagerness than before the earnest and impressive gestures by which she endeavoured to detain him in the fortress  julian was somewhat staggered by her pertinacity is it possible he thought that any danger can approach the countess of which this poor maiden has by the extreme acuteness of her observation obtained knowledge which has escaped others  he signed to fenella hastily to give him the tablets and the pencil which she usually carried with her and wrote on them the question is there danger near to your mistress that you thus stop me  there is danger around the countess was the answer instantly written down but there is much more in your own purpose  howwhatwhat know you of my purpose said julian forgetting in his surprise that the party he addressed had neither ear to comprehend nor voice to reply to uttered language she had regained her book in the meantime and sketched with a rapid pencil on one of the leaves a scene which she showed to julian to his infinite surprise he recognised goddard crovans stone a remarkable monument of which she had given the outline with sufficient accuracy together with a male and female figure which though only indicated by a few slight touches of the pencil bore yet he thought some resemblance to himself and alice bridgenorth  when he had gazed on the sketch for an instant with surprise fenella took the book from his hand laid her finger upon the drawing and slowly and sternly shook her head with a frown which seemed to prohibit the meeting which was there represented julian however though disconcerted was in no shape disposed to submit to the authority of his monitress by whatever means she who so seldom stirred from the countesss apartment had become acquainted with a secret which he thought entirely his own he esteemed it the more necessary to keep the appointed rendezvous that he might learn from alice if possible how the secret had transpired he had also formed the intention of seeking out bridgenorth entertaining an idea that a person so reasonable and calm as he had shown himself in their late conference might be persuaded when he understood that the countess was aware of his intrigues to put an end to her danger and his own by withdrawing from the island and could he succeed in this point he should at once he thought render a material benefit to the father of his beloved aliceremove the earl from his state of anxietysave the countess from a second time putting her feudal jurisdiction in opposition to that of the crown of englandand secure quiet possession of the island to her and her family  with this scheme of mediation on his mind peveril determined to rid himself of the opposition of fenella to his departure with less ceremony than he had hitherto observed towards her and suddenly lifting up the damsel in his arms before she was aware of his purpose he turned about set her down on the steps above him and began to descend the pass himself as speedily as possible it was then that the dumb maiden gave full course to the vehemence of her disposition and clapping her hands repeatedly expressed her displeasure in sound or rather a shriek so extremely dissonant that it resembled more the cry of a wild creature than anything which could have been uttered by female organs peveril was so astounded at the scream as it rung through the living rocks that he could not help stopping and looking back in alarm to satisfy himself that she had not sustained some injury he saw her however perfectly safe though her face seemed inflamed and distorted with passion she stamped at him with her foot shook her clenched hand and turning her back upon him without further adieu ran up the rude steps as lightly as a kid could have tripped up that rugged ascent and paused for a moment at the summit of the first flight  julian could feel nothing but wonder and compassion for the impotent passion of a being so unfortunately circumstanced cut off as it were from the rest of mankind and incapable of receiving in childhood that moral discipline which teaches us mastery of our wayward passions ere yet they have attained their meridian strength and violence he waved his hand to her in token of amicable farewell but she only replied by once more menacing him with her little hand clenched and then ascending the rocky staircase with almost preternatural speed was soon out of sight  julian on his part gave no farther consideration to her conduct or its motives but hastening to the village on the mainland where the stables of the castle were situated he again took his palfrey from the stall and was soon mounted and on his way to the appointed place of rendezvous much marvelling as he ambled forward with speed far greater than was promised by the diminutive size of the animal he was mounted on what could have happened to produce so great a change in alices conduct towards him that in place of enjoining his absence as usual or recommending his departure from the island she should now voluntarily invite him to a meeting under impression of the various doubts which succeeded each other in his imagination he sometimes pressed fairys sides with his legs sometimes laid his holly rod lightly on her neck sometimes incited her by his voice for the mettled animal needed neither whip nor spur and achieved the distance betwixt the castle of holmpeel and the stone at goddard crovan at the rate of twelve miles within the hour  the monumental stone designed to commemorate some feat of an ancient king of man which had been long forgotten was erected on the side of a narrow lonely valley or rather glen secluded from observation by the steepness of its banks upon a projection of which stood the tall shapeless solitary rock frowning like a shrouded giant over the brawling of the small rivulet which watered the ravine     chapter xvii            this a lovemeeting see the maiden mourns           and the sad suitor bends his looks on earth           theres more hath passd between them than belongs           to loves sweet sorrows                                                    old play  as he approached the monument of goddard crovan julian cast many an anxious glance to see whether any object visible beside the huge grey stone should apprise him whether he was anticipated at the appointed place of rendezvous by her who had named it nor was it long before the flutter of a mantle which the breeze slightly waved and the motion necessary to replace it upon the wearers shoulders made him aware that alice had already reached their place of meeting one instant set the palfrey at liberty with slackened girths and loosened reins to pick its own way through the dell at will another placed julian peveril by the side of alice bridgenorth  that alice should extend her hand to her lover as with the ardour of a young greyhound he bounded over the obstacles of the rugged path was as natural as that julian seizing on the hand so kindly stretched out should devour it with kisses and for a moment or two without reprehension while the other hand which should have aided in the liberation of its fellow served to hide the blushes of the fair owner but alice young as she was and attached to julian by such long habits of kindly intimacy still knew well how to subdue the tendency of her own treacherous affections  this is not right she said extricating her hand from julians grasp this is not right julian if i have been too rash in admitting such a meeting as the present it is not you that should make me sensible of my folly  julian peverils mind had been early illuminated with that touch of romantic fire which deprives passion of selfishness and confers on it the high and refined tone of generous and disinterested devotion he let go the hand of alice with as much respect as he could have paid to that of a princess and when she seated herself upon a rocky fragment over which nature had stretched a cushion of moss and lichen interspersed with wild flowers backed with a bush of copsewood he took his place beside her indeed but at such distance as to intimate the duty of an attendant who was there only to hear and to obey alice bridgenorth became more assured as she observed the power which she possessed over her lover and the selfcommand which peveril exhibited which other damsels in her situation might have judged inconsistent with intensity of passion she appreciated more justly as a proof of his respectful and disinterested sincerity she recovered in addressing him the tone of confidence which rather belonged to the scenes of their early acquaintance than to those which had passed betwixt them since peveril had disclosed his affection and thereby had brought restraint upon their intercourse  julian she said your visit of yesterdayyour most illtimed visit has distressed me much it has misled my fatherit has endangered you at all risks i resolved that you should know this and blame me not if i have taken a bold and imprudent step in desiring this solitary interview since you are aware how little poor deborah is to be trusted  can you fear misconstruction from me alice replied peveril warmly from me whom you have thus highly favouredthus deeply obliged  cease your protestations julian answered the maiden they do but make me the more sensible that i have acted over boldly but i did for the besti could not see you whom i have known so longyou who say you regard me with partiality  say that i regard you with partiality interrupted peveril in his turn ah alice with a cold and doubtful phrase you have used to express the most devoted the most sincere affection  well then said alice sadly we will not quarrel about words but do not again interrupt mei could not i say see you who i believe regard me with sincere though vain and fruitless attachment rush blindfold into a snare deceived and seduced by those very feelings towards me  i understand you not alice said peveril nor can i see any danger to which i am at present exposed the sentiments which your father has expressed towards me are of a nature irreconcilable with hostile purposes if he is not offended with the bold wishes i may have formedand his whole behaviour shows the contraryi know not a man on earth from whom i have less cause to apprehend any danger or illwill  my father said alice means well by his country and well by you yet i sometimes fear he may rather injure than serve his good cause and still more do i dread that in attempting to engage you as an auxiliary he may forget those ties which ought to bind you and i am sure which will bind you to a different line of conduct from his own  you lead me into still deeper darkness alice answered peveril that your fathers especial line of politics differs widely from mine i know well but how many instances have occurred even during the bloody scenes of civil warfare of good and worthy men laying the prejudice of party affections aside and regarding each other with respect and even with friendly attachment without being false to principle on either side  it may be so said alice but such is not the league which my father desires to form with you and that to which he hopes your misplaced partiality towards his daughter may afford a motive for your forming with him  and what is it said peveril which i would refuse with such a prospect before me  treachery and dishonour replied alice whatever would render you unworthy of the poor boon at which you aimay were it more worthless than i confess it to be  would your father said peveril as he unwillingly received the impression which alice designed to conveywould he whose views of duty are so strict and severewould he wish to involve me in aught to which such harsh epithets as treachery and dishonour can be applied with the lightest shadow of truth  do not mistake me julian replied the maiden my father is incapable of requesting aught of you that is not to his thinking just and honourable nay he conceives that he only claims from you a debt which is due as a creature to the creator and as a man to your fellowmen  so guarded where can be the danger of our intercourse replied julian if he be resolved to require and i determined to accede to nothing save what flows from conviction what have i to fear alice and how is my intercourse with your father dangerous believe not so his speech has already made impression on me in some particulars and he listened with candour and patience to the objections which i made occasionally you do master bridgenorth less than justice in confounding him with the unreasonable bigots in policy and religion who can listen to no argument but what favours their own prepossessions  julian replied alice it is you who misjudge my fathers powers and his purpose with respect to you and who overrate your own powers of resistance i am but a girl but i have been taught by circumstances to think for myself and to consider the character of those around me my fathers views in ecclesiastical and civil policy are as dear to him as the life which he cherishes only to advance them they have been with little alteration his companions through life they brought him at one period into prosperity and when they suited not the times he suffered for having held them they have become not only a part but the very dearest part of his existence if he shows them not to you at first in the flexible strength which they have acquired over his mind do not believe that they are the less powerful he who desires to make converts must begin by degrees but that he should sacrifice to an inexperienced young man whose ruling motive he will term a childish passion any part of those treasured principles which he has maintained through good repute and bad reputeoh do not dream of such an impossibility if you meet at all you must be the wax he the sealyou must receive he must bestow an absolute impression  that said peveril were unreasonable i will frankly avow to you alice that i am not a sworn bigot to the opinions entertained by my father much as i respect his person i could wish that our cavaliers or whatsoever they are pleased to call themselves would have some more charity towards those who differ from them in church and state but to hope that i would surrender the principles in which i have lived were to suppose me capable of deserting my benefactress and breaking the hearts of my parents  even so i judged of you answered alice and therefore i asked this interview to conjure that you will break off all intercourse with our familyreturn to your parentsor what will be much safer visit the continent once more and abide till god send better days to england for these are black with many a storm  and can you bid me go alice said the young man taking her unresisting hand can you bid me go and yet own an interest in my fatecan you bid me for fear of dangers which as a man as a gentleman and a loyal one i am bound to show my face to meanly abandon my parents my friends my countrysuffer the existence of evils which i might aid to preventforego the prospect of doing such little good as might be in my powerfall from an active and honourable station into the condition of a fugitive and timeservercan you bid me do all this alice can you bid me do all this and in the same breath bid farewell for ever to you and happinessit is impossiblei cannot surrender at once my love and my honour  there is no remedy said alice but she could not suppress a sigh while she said sothere is no remedynone whatever what we might have been to each other placed in more favourable circumstances it avails not to think of now and circumstanced as we are with open war about to break out betwixt our parents and friends we can be but wellwisherscold and distant wellwishers who must part on this spot and at this hour never meet again  no by heaven said peveril animated at the same time by his own feelings and by the sight of the emotions which his companion in vain endeavoured to suppressno by heaven he exclaimed we part notalice we part not if i am to leave my native land you shall be my companion in my exile what have you to losewhom have you to abandonyour fatherthe good old cause as it is termed is dearer to him than a thousand daughters and setting him aside what tie is there between you and this barren islebetween my alice and any spot of the british dominions where her julian does not sit by her  o julian answered the maiden why make my duty more painful by visionary projects which you ought not to name or i to listen to your parentsmy fatherit cannot be  fear not for my parents alice replied julian and pressing close to his companions side he ventured to throw his arm around her they love me and they will soon learn to love in alice the only being on earth who could have rendered their son happy and for your own father when state and church intrigues allow him to bestow a thought upon you will he not think that your happiness your security is better cared for when you are my wife than were you to continue under the mercenary charge of yonder foolish woman what could his pride desire better for you than the establishment which will one day be mine come then alice and since you condemn me to banishmentsince you deny me a share in those stirring achievements which are about to agitate englandcome do youfor you only cando you reconcile me to exile and inaction and give happiness to one who for your sake is willing to resign honour  it cannotit cannot be said alice faltering as she uttered her negative and yet she said how many in my placeleft alone and unprotected as i ambut i must noti must notfor your sake julian i must not  say not for my sake you must not alice said peveril eagerly this is adding insult to cruelty if you will do aught for my sake you will say yes or you will suffer this dear head to drop on my shoulderthe slightest signthe moving of an eyelid shall signify consent all shall be prepared within an hour within another the priest shall unite us and within a third we leave the isle behind us and seek our fortunes on the continent but while he spoke in joyful anticipation of the consent which he implored alice found means to collect together her resolution which staggered by the eagerness of her lover the impulse of her own affections and the singularity of her situationseeming in her case to justify what would have been most blamable in anotherhad more than half abandoned her  the result of a moments deliberation was fatal to julians proposal she extricated herself from the arm which had pressed her to his sidearose and repelling his attempts to approach or detain her said with a simplicity not unmingled with dignity julian i always knew i risked much in inviting you to this meeting but i did not guess that i could have been so cruel to both to you and to myself as to suffer you to discover what you have today seen too plainlythat i love you better than you love me but since you do know it i will show you that alices love is disinterestedshe will not bring an ignoble name into your ancient house if hereafter in your line there should arise some who may think the claims of the hierarchy too exorbitant the powers of the crown too extensive men shall not say these ideas were derived from alice bridgenorth their whig granddame  can you speak thus alice said her lover can you use such expressions and are you not sensible that they show plainly it is your own pride not regard for me that makes you resist the happiness of both  not so julian not so answered alice with tears in her eyes it is the command of duty to us bothof duty which we cannot transgress without risking our happiness here and hereafter think what i the cause of all should feel when your father frowns your mother weeps your noble friends stand aloof and you even you yourself shall have made the painful discovery that you have incurred the contempt and resentment of all to satisfy a boyish passion and that the poor beauty once sufficient to mislead you is gradually declining under the influence of grief and vexation this i will not risk i see distinctly it is best we should here break off and part and i thank god who gives me light enough to perceive and strength enough to withstand your folly as well as my own farewell then julian but first take the solemn advice which i called you hither to impart to youshun my fatheryou cannot walk in his paths and be true to gratitude and to honour what he doth from pure and honourable motives you cannot aid him in except upon the suggestion of a silly and interested passion at variance with all the engagements you have formed at coming into life  once more alice answered julian i understand you not if a course of action is good it needs no vindication from the actors motivesif bad it can derive none  you cannot blind me with your sophistry julian replied alice bridgenorth any more than you can overpower me with your passion had the patriarch destined his son to death upon any less ground than faith and humble obedience to a divine commandment he had meditated a murder and not a sacrifice in our late bloody and lamentable wars how many drew swords on either side from the purest and most honourable motives how many from the culpable suggestions of ambition selfseeking and love of plunder yet while they marched in the same ranks and spurred their horses at the same trumpetsound the memory of the former is dear to us as patriots or loyaliststhat of those who acted on mean or unworthy promptings is either execrated or forgotten once more i warn you avoid my fatherleave this island which will be soon agitated by strange incidentswhile you stay be on your guarddistrust everythingbe jealous of every one even of those to whom it may seem almost impossible from circumstances to attach a shadow of suspiciontrust not the very stones of the most secret apartment in holmpeel for that which hath wings shall carry the matter  here alice broke off suddenly and with a faint shriek for stepping from behind the stunted copse which had concealed him her father stood unexpectedly before them  the reader cannot have forgotten that this was the second time in which the stolen interviews of the lovers had been interrupted by the unexpected apparition of major bridgenorth on this second occasion his countenance exhibited anger mixed with solemnity like that of the spirit to a ghostseer whom he upbraids with having neglected a charge imposed at their first meeting even his anger however produced no more violent emotion than a cold sternness of manner in his speech and action i thank you alice he said to his daughter for the pains you have taken to traverse my designs towards this young man and towards yourself i thank you for the hints you have thrown out before my appearance the suddenness of which alone has prevented you from carrying your confidence to a pitch which would have placed my life and that of others at the discretion of a boy who when the cause of god and his country is laid before him has not leisure to think of them so much is he occupied with such a babyface as thine alice pale as death continued motionless with her eyes fixed on the ground without attempting the slightest reply to the ironical reproaches of her father  and you continued major bridgenorth turning from his daughter to her loveryou sir have well repaid the liberal confidence which i placed in you with so little reserve you i have to thank also for some lessons which may teach me to rest satisfied with the churls blood which nature has poured into my veins and with the rude nurture which my father allotted to me  i understand you not sir replied julian peveril who feeling the necessity of saying something could not at the moment find anything more fitting to say  yes sir i thank you said major bridgenorth in the same cold sarcastic tone for having shown me that breach of hospitality infringement of good faith and such like peccadilloes are not utterly foreign to the mind and conduct of the heir of a knightly house of twenty descents it is a great lesson to me sir for hitherto i had thought with the vulgar that gentle manners went with gentle blood but perhaps courtesy is too chivalrous a quality to be wasted in intercourse with a roundheaded fanatic like myself  major bridgenorth said julian whatever has happened in this interview which may have displeased you has been the result of feelings suddenly and strongly animated by the crisis of the momentnothing was premeditated  not even your meeting i suppose replied bridgenorth in the same cold tone you sir wandered hither from holmpeelmy daughter strolled forth from the black fort and chance doubtless assigned you a meeting by the stone of goddard crovanyoung man disgrace yourself by no more apologiesthey are worse than uselessand you maiden who in your fear of losing your lover could verge on betraying what might have cost a father his lifebegone to your home i will talk with you at more leisure and teach you practically those duties which you seem to have forgotten  on my honour sir said julian your daughter is guiltless of all that can offend you she resisted every offer which the headstrong violence of my passion urged me to press upon her  and in brief said bridgenorth i am not to believe that you met in this remote place of rendezvous by alices special appointment  peveril knew not what to reply and bridgenorth again signed with his hand to his daughter to withdraw  i obey you father said alice who had by this time recovered from the extremity of her surprisei obey you but heaven is my witness that you do me more than injustice in suspecting me capable of betraying your secrets even had it been necessary to save my own life or that of julian that you are walking in a dangerous path i well know but you do it with your eyes open and are actuated by motives of which you can estimate the worth and value my sole wish was that this young man should not enter blindfold on the same perils and i had a right to warn him since the feelings by which he is hoodwinked had a direct reference to me  tis well minion said bridgenorth you have spoken your say retire and let me complete the conference which you have so considerately commenced  i go sir said alicejulian to you my last words are and i would speak them with my last breathfarewell and caution  she turned from them disappeared among the underwood and was seen no more  a true specimen of womankind said her father looking after her who would give the cause of nations up rather than endanger a hair of her lovers headyou master peveril doubtless hold her opinion that the best love is a safe love  were danger alone in my way said peveril much surprised at the softened tone in which bridgenorth made this observation there are few things which i would not face totodeserve your good opinion  or rather to win my daughters hand said bridgenorth well young man one thing has pleased me in your conduct though of much i have my reasons to complainone thing has pleased me you have surmounted that bounding wall of aristocratical pride in which your father and i suppose his fathers remained imprisoned as in the precincts of a feudal fortressyou have leaped over this barrier and shown yourself not unwilling to ally yourself with a family whom your father spurns as lowborn and ignoble  however favourable this speech sounded towards success in his suit it so broadly stated the consequences of that success so far as his parents were concerned that julian felt it in the last degree difficult to reply at length perceiving that major bridgenorth seemed resolved quietly to await his answer he mustered up courage to say the feelings which i entertain towards your daughter master bridgenorth are of a nature to supersede many other considerations to which in any other case i should feel it my duty to give the most reverential attention i will not disguise from you that my fathers prejudices against such a match would be very strong but i devoutly believe they would disappear when he came to know the merit of alice bridgenorth and to be sensible that she only could make his son happy  in the meanwhile you are desirous to complete the union which you propose without the knowledge of your parents and take the chance of their being hereafter reconciled to it so i understand from the proposal which you made but lately to my daughter  the turns of human nature and of human passion are so irregular and uncertain that although julian had but a few minutes before urged to alice a private marriage and an elopement to the continent as a measure upon which the whole happiness of his life depended the proposal seemed not to him half so delightful when stated by the calm cold dictatorial accents of her father it sounded no longer like the dictates of ardent passion throwing all other considerations aside but as a distinct surrender of the dignity of his house to one who seemed to consider their relative situation as the triumph of bridgenorth over peveril he was mute for a moment in the vain attempt to shape his answer so as at once to intimate acquiescence in what bridgenorth stated and a vindication of his own regard for his parents and for the honour of his house  this delay gave rise to suspicion and bridgenorths eye gleamed and his lip quivered while he gave vent to it hark ye young mandeal openly with me in this matter if you would not have me think you the execrable villain who would have seduced an unhappy girl under promises which he never designed to fulfil let me but suspect this and you shall see on the spot how far your pride and your pedigree will preserve you against the just vengeance of a father  you do me wrong said peverilyou do me infinite wrong major bridgenorth i am incapable of the infamy which you allude to the proposal i made to your daughter was as sincere as ever was offered by man to woman i only hesitated because you think it necessary to examine me so very closely and to possess yourself of all my purposes and sentiments in their fullest extent without explaining to me the tendency of your own  your proposal then shapes itself thus said bridgenorthyou are willing to lead my only child into exile from her native country to give her a claim to kindness and protection from your family which you know will be disregarded on condition i consent to bestow her hand on you with a fortune sufficient to have matched your ancestors when they had most reason to boast of their wealth this young man seems no equal bargain and yet he continued after a momentary pause so little do i value the goods of this world that it might not be utterly beyond thy power to reconcile me to the match which you have proposed to me however unequal it may appear  show me but the means which can propitiate your favour major bridgenorth said peverilfor i will not doubt that they will be consistent with my honour and dutyand you shall soon see how eagerly i will obey your directions or submit to your conditions  they are summed in few words answered bridgenorth be an honest man and the friend of your country  no one has ever doubted replied peveril that i am both  pardon me replied the major no one has as yet seen you show yourself either interrupt me noti question not your will to be both but you have hitherto neither had the light nor the opportunity necessary for the display of your principles or the service of your country you have lived when an apathy of mind succeeding to the agitations of the civil war had made men indifferent to state affairs and more willing to cultivate their own ease than to stand in the gap when the lord was pleading with israel but we are englishmen and with us such unnatural lethargy cannot continue long already many of those who most desired the return of charles stewart regard him as a king whom heaven importuned by our entreaties gave to us in his anger his unlimited licenceand example so readily followed by the young and the gay around himhas disgusted the minds of all sober and thinking men i had not now held conference with you in this intimate fashion were i not aware that you master julian were free from such stain of the times heaven that rendered the kings course of license fruitful had denied issue to his bed of wedlock and in the gloomy and stern character of his bigoted successor we already see what sort of monarch shall succeed to the crown of england this is a critical period at which it necessarily becomes the duty of all men to step forward each in his degree and aid in rescuing the country which gave us birth peveril remembered the warning which he had received from alice and bent his eyes on the ground without returning any reply how is it young man continued bridgenorth after a pauseso young as thou art and bound by no ties of kindred profligacy with the enemies of your country you can be already hardened to the claims she may form on you at this crisis  it were easy to answer you generally major bridgenorth replied peverilit were easy to say that my country cannot make a claim on me which i will not promptly answer at the risk of lands and life but in dealing thus generally we should but deceive each other what is the nature of this call by whom is it to be sounded and what are to be the results for i think you have already seen enough of the evils of civil war to be wary of again awakening its terrors in a peaceful and happy country  they that are drenched with poisonous narcotics said the major must be awakened by their physicians though it were with the sound of the trumpet better that men should die bravely with their arms in their hands like freeborn englishmen than that they should slide into the bloodless but dishonoured grave which slavery opens for its vassalsbut it is not of war that i was about to speak he added assuming a milder tone the evils of which england now complains are such as can be remedied by the wholesome administration of her own laws even in the state in which they are still suffered to exist have these laws not a right to the support of every individual who lives under them have they not a right to yours  as he seemed to pause for an answer peveril replied i have to learn major bridgenorth how the laws of england have become so far weakened as to require such support as mine when that is made plain to me no man will more willingly discharge the duty of a faithful liegeman to the law as well as the king but the laws of england are under the guardianship of upright and learned judges and of a gracious monarch  and of a house of commons interrupted bridgenorth no longer doting upon restored monarchy but awakened as with a peal of thunder to the perilous state of our religion and of our freedom i appeal to your own conscience julian peveril whether this awakening hath not been in time since you yourself know and none better than you the secret but rapid strides which rome has made to erect her dagon of idolatry within our protestant land  here julian seeing or thinking he saw the drift of bridgenorths suspicions hastened to exculpate himself from the thought of favouring the roman catholic religion it is true he said i have been educated in a family where that faith is professed by one honoured individual and that i have since travelled in popish countries but even for these very reasons i have seen popery too closely to be friendly to its tenets the bigotry of the laymenthe persevering arts of the priesthoodthe perpetual intrigue for the extension of the forms without the spirit of religionthe usurpation of that church over the consciences of menand her impious pretensions to infallibility are as inconsistent to my mind as they can seem to yours with commonsense rational liberty freedom of conscience and pure religion  spoken like the son of your excellent mother said bridgenorth grasping his hand for whose sake i have consented to endure so much from your house unrequited even when the means of requital were in my own hand  it was indeed from the instructions of that excellent parent said peveril that i was enabled in my early youth to resist and repel the insidious attacks made upon my religious faith by the catholic priests into whose company i was necessarily thrown like her i trust to live and die in the faith of the reformed church of england  the church of england said bridgenorth dropping his young friends hand but presently resuming italas that church as now constituted usurps scarcely less than rome herself upon mens consciences and liberties yet out of the weakness of this halfreformed church may god be pleased to work out deliverance to england and praise to himself i must not forget that one whose services have been in the cause incalculable wears the garb of an english priest and hath had episcopal ordination it is not for us to challenge the instrument so that our escape is achieved from the net of the fowler enough that i find thee not as yet enlightened with the purer doctrine but prepared to profit by it when the spark shall reach thee enough in especial that i find thee willing to uplift thy testimony to cry aloud and spare not against the errors and arts of the church of rome but remember what thou hast now said thou wilt soon be called upon to justify in a manner the most solemnthe most awful  what i have said replied julian peveril being the unbiassed sentiments of my heart shall upon no proper occasion want the support of my open avowal and i think it strange you should doubt me so far  i doubt thee not my young friend said bridgenorth and i trust to see that name rank high amongst those by whom the prey shall be rent from the mighty at present thy prejudices occupy thy mind like the strong keeper of the house mentioned in scripture but there shall come a stronger than he and make forcible entry displaying on the battlements that sign of faith in which alone there is found salvationwatch hope and pray that the hour may come  there was a pause in the conversation which was first broken by peveril you have spoken to me in riddles major bridgenorth and i have asked you for no explanation listen to a caution on my part given with the most sincere goodwill take a hint from me and believe it though it is darkly expressed you are hereat least are believed to be hereon an errand dangerous to the lord of the island that danger will be retorted on yourself if you make man long your place of residence be warned and depart in time  and leave my daughter to the guardianship of julian peveril runs not your counsel so young man answered bridgenorth trust my safety julian to my own prudence i have been accustomed to guide myself through worse dangers than now environ me but i thank you for your caution which i am willing to believe was at least partly disinterested  we do not then part in anger said peveril  not in anger my son said bridgenorth but in love and strong affection for my daughter thou must forbear every thought of seeing her save through me i accept not thy suit neither do i reject it only this i intimate to you that he who would be my son must first show himself the true and loving child of his oppressed and deluded country farewell do not answer me now thou art yet in the gall of bitterness and it may be that strife which i desire not should fall between us thou shalt hear of me sooner than thou thinkest for  he shook peveril heartily by the hand and again bid him farewell leaving him under the confused and mingled impression of pleasure doubt and wonder not a little surprised to find himself so far in the good graces of alices father that his suit was even favoured with a sort of negative encouragement he could not help suspecting as well from the language of the daughter as of the father that bridgenorth was desirous as the price of his favour that he should adopt some line of conduct inconsistent with the principles in which he had been educated  you need not fear alice he said in his heart not even your hand would i purchase by aught which resembled unworthy or truckling compliance with tenets which my heart disowns and well i know were i mean enough to do so even the authority of thy father were insufficient to compel thee to the ratification of so mean a bargain but let me hope better things bridgenorth though strongminded and sagacious is haunted by the fears of popery which are the bugbears of his sect my residence in the family of the countess of derby is more than enough to inspire him with suspicions of my faith from which thank heaven i can vindicate myself with truth and a good conscience  so thinking he again adjusted the girths of his palfrey replaced the bit which he had slipped out of its mouth that it might feed at liberty and mounting pursued his way back to the castle of holmpeel where he could not help fearing that something extraordinary might have happened in his absence  but the old pile soon rose before him serene and sternly still amid the sleeping ocean the banner which indicated that the lord of man held residence within its ruinous precincts hung motionless by the ensignstaff the sentinels walked to and fro on their posts and hummed or whistled their manx airs leaving his faithful companion fairy in the village as before julian entered the castle and found all within in the same state of quietness and good order which external appearances had announced     chapter xviii                   now rede me rede me brother dear                    throughout merry england                  where will i find a messenger                    betwixt us two to send                                        ballad of king estmere  julians first encounter after reentering the castle was with its young lord who received him with his usual kindness and lightness of humour  thrice welcome sir knight of dames said the earl here you rove gallantly and at free will through our dominions fulfilling of appointments and achieving amorous adventures while we are condemned to sit in our royal halls as dull and as immovable as if our majesty was carved on the stern of some manx smuggling dogger and christened the king arthur of ramsey  nay in that case you would take the sea said julian and so enjoy travel and adventure enough  oh but suppose me windbound or detained in harbour by a revenue pink or ashore if you like it and lying high and dry upon the sand imagine the royal image in the dullest of all predicaments and you have not equalled mine  i am happy to hear at least that you have had no disagreeable employment said julian the mornings alarm has blown over i suppose  in faith it has julian and our close inquiries cannot find any cause for the apprehended insurrection that bridgenorth is in the island seems certain but private affairs of consequence are alleged as the cause of his visit and i am not desirous to have him arrested unless i could prove some malpractices against him and his companions in fact it would seem we had taken the alarm too soon my mother speaks of consulting you on the subject julian and i will not anticipate her solemn communication it will be partly apologetical i suppose for we begin to think our retreat rather unroyal and that like the wicked we have fled when no man pursued this idea afflicts my mother who as a queendowager a queenregent a heroine and a woman in general would be extremely mortified to think that her precipitate retreat hither had exposed her to the ridicule of the islanders and she is disconcerted and out of humour accordingly in the meanwhile my sole amusement has been the grimaces and fantastic gestures of that ape fenella who is more out of humour and more absurd in consequence than you ever saw her morris says it is because you pushed her downstairs julianhow is that  nay morris has misreported me answered julian i did but lift her up stairs to be rid of her importunity for she chose in her way to contest my going abroad in such an obstinate manner that i had no other mode of getting rid of her  she must have supposed your departure at a moment so critical was dangerous to the state of our garrison answered the earl it shows how dearly she esteems my mothers safety how highly she rates your prowess but thank heaven there sounds the dinnerbell i would the philosophers who find a sin and waste of time in good cheer could devise us any pastime half so agreeable  the meal which the young earl had thus longed for as a means of consuming a portion of the time which hung heavy on his hands was soon over as soon at least as the habitual and stately formality of the countesss household permitted she herself accompanied by her gentlewomen and attendants retired early after the tables were drawn and the young gentlemen were left to their own company wine had for the moment no charms for either for the earl was out of spirits from ennui and impatience of his monotonous and solitary course of life and the events of the day had given peveril too much matter for reflection to permit his starting amusing or interesting topics of conversation after having passed the flask in silence betwixt them once or twice they withdrew each to a separate embrasure of the windows of the dining apartment which such was the extreme thickness of the wall were deep enough to afford a solitary recess separated as it were from the chamber itself in one of these sat the earl of derby busied in looking over some of the new publications which had been forwarded from london and at intervals confessing how little power or interest these had for him by yawning fearfully as he looked out on the solitary expanse of waters which save from the flight of a flock of seagulls or a solitary cormorant offered so little of variety to engage his attention  peveril on his part held a pamphlet also in his hand without giving or affecting to give it even his occasional attention his whole soul turned upon the interview which he had had that day with alice bridgenorth and with her father while he in vain endeavoured to form any hypothesis which could explain to him why the daughter to whom he had no reason to think himself indifferent should have been so suddenly desirous of their eternal separation while her father whose opposition he so much dreaded seemed to be at least tolerant of his addresses he could only suppose in explanation that major bridgenorth had some plan in prospect which it was in his own power to farther or to impede while from the demeanour and indeed the language of alice he had but too much reason to apprehend that her fathers favour could only be conciliated by something on his own part approaching to dereliction of principle but by no conjecture which he could form could he make the least guess concerning the nature of that compliance of which bridgenorth seemed desirous he could not imagine notwithstanding alice had spoken of treachery that her father would dare to propose to him uniting in any plan by which the safety of the countess or the security of her little kingdom of man was to be endangered this carried such indelible disgrace in the front that he could not suppose the scheme proposed to him by any who was not prepared to defend with his sword upon the spot so flagrant an insult offered to his honour and such a proceeding was totally inconsistent with the conduct of major bridgenorth in every other respect besides his being too calm and coldblooded to permit of his putting a mortal affront upon the son of his old neighbour to whose mother he confessed so much of obligation  while peveril in vain endeavoured to extract something like a probable theory out of the hints thrown out by the father and by the daughternot without the additional and loverlike labour of endeavouring to reconcile his passion to his honour and consciencehe felt something gently pull him by the cloak he unclasped his arms which in meditation had been folded on his bosom and withdrawing his eyes from the vacant prospect of seacoast and sea which they perused without much consciousness upon what they rested he beheld beside him the little dumb maiden the elfin fenella she was seated on a low cushion or stool with which she had nestled close to peverils side and had remained there for a short space of time expecting no doubt he would become conscious of her presence until tired of remaining unnoticed she at length solicited his attention in the manner which we have described startled out of his reverie by this intimation of her presence he looked down and could not without interest behold this singular and helpless being  her hair was unloosened and streamed over her shoulders in such length that much of it lay upon the ground and in such quantity that it formed a dark veil or shadow not only around her face but over her whole slender and minute form from the profusion of her tresses looked forth her small and dark but wellformed features together with the large and brilliant black eyes and her whole countenance was composed into the imploring look of one who is doubtful of the reception she is about to meet with from a valued friend while she confesses a fault pleads an apology or solicits a reconciliation in short the whole face was so much alive with expression that julian though her aspect was so familiar to him could hardly persuade himself but that her countenance was entirely new the wild fantastic elvish vivacity of the features seemed totally vanished and had given place to a sorrowful tender and pathetic cast of countenance aided by the expression of the large dark eyes which as they were turned up towards julian glistened with moisture that nevertheless did not overflow the eyelids  conceiving that her unwonted manner arose from a recollection of the dispute which had taken place betwixt them in the morning peveril was anxious to restore the little maidens gaiety by making her sensible that there dwelt on his mind no unpleasing recollection of their quarrel he smiled kindly and shook her hand in one of his while with the familiarity of one who had known her from childhood he stroked down her long dark tresses with the other she stooped her head as if ashamed and at the same time gratified with his caressesand he was thus induced to continue them until under the veil of her rich and abundant locks he suddenly felt his other hand which she still held in hers slightly touched with her lips and at the same time moistened with a tear  at once and for the first time in his life the danger of being misinterpreted in his familiarity with a creature to whom the usual modes of explanation were a blank occurred to julians mind and hastily withdrawing his hand and changing his posture he asked her by a sign which custom had rendered familiar whether she brought any message to him from the countess she started up and arranged herself in her seat with the rapidity of lightning and at the same moment with one turn of her hand braided her length of locks into a natural headdress of the most beautiful kind there was indeed when she looked up a blush still visible on her dark features but their melancholy and languid expression had given place to that of wild and restless vivacity which was most common to them her eyes gleamed with more than their wonted fire and her glances were more piercingly wild and unsettled than usual to julians inquiry she answered by laying her hand on her hearta motion by which she always indicated the countessand rising and taking the direction of her apartment she made a sign to julian to follow her  the distance was not great betwixt the dining apartment and that to which peveril now followed his mute guide yet in going thither he had time enough to suffer cruelly from the sudden suspicion that this unhappy girl had misinterpreted the uniform kindness with which he had treated her and hence come to regard him with feelings more tender than those which belong to friendship the misery which such a passion was likely to occasion to a creature in her helpless situation and actuated by such lively feelings was great enough to make him refuse credit to the suspicion which pressed itself upon his mind while at the same time he formed the internal resolution so to conduct himself towards fenella as to check such misplaced sentiments if indeed she unhappily entertained them towards him  when they reached the countesss apartment they found her with writing implements and many sealed letters before her she received julian with her usual kindness and having caused him to be seated beckoned to the mute to resume her needle in an instant fenella was seated at an embroideringframe where but for the movement of her dexterous fingers she might have seemed a statue so little did she move from her work either head or eye as her infirmity rendered her presence no bar to the most confidential conversation the countess proceeded to address peveril as if they had been literally alone together  julian she said i am not now about to complain to you of the sentiments and conduct of derby he is your friendhe is my son he has kindness of heart and vivacity of talent and yet  dearest lady said peveril why will you distress yourself with fixing your eye on deficiencies which arise rather from a change of times and manners than any degeneracy of my noble friend let him be once engaged in his duty whether in peace or war and let me pay the penalty if he acquits not himself becoming his high station  ay replied the countess but when will the call of duty prove superior to that of the most idle or trivial indulgence which can serve to drive over the lazy hour his father was of another mould and how often was it my lot to entreat that he would spare from the rigid discharge of those duties which his high station imposed the relaxation absolutely necessary to recruit his health and his spirits  still my dearest lady said peveril you must allow that the duties to which the times summoned your late honoured lord were of a more stirring as well as a more peremptory cast than those which await your son  i know not that said the countess the wheel appears to be again revolving and the present period is not unlikely to bring back such scenes as my young years witnessedwell be it so they will not find charlotte de la tremouille broken in spirit though depressed by years it was even on this subject i would speak with you my young friend since our first early acquaintancewhen i saw your gallant behaviour as i issued forth to your childish eye like an apparition from my place of concealment in your fathers castleit has pleased me to think you a true son of stanley and peveril i trust your nurture in this family has been ever suited to the esteem in which i hold younay i desire no thanksi have to require of you in return a piece of service not perhaps entirely safe to yourself but which as times are circumstanced no person is so well able to render to my house  you have been ever my good and noble lady answered peveril as well as my kind and i may say maternal protectress you have a right to command the blood of stanley in the veins of every oneyou have a thousand rights to command it in mine   the reader cannot have forgotten that the earl of derby was head     of the great house of stanley  my advices from england said the countess resemble more the dreams of a sick man than the regular information which i might have expected from such correspondents as minetheir expressions are like those of men who walk in their sleep and speak by snatches of what passes in their dreams it is said a plot real or fictitious has been detected among the catholics which has spread far wider and more uncontrollable terror than that of the fifth of november its outlines seem utterly incredible and are only supported by the evidence of wretches the meanest and most worthless in the creation yet it is received by the credulous people of england with the most undoubting belief  this is a singular delusion to rise without some real ground answered julian  i am no bigot cousin though a catholic replied the countess i have long feared that the wellmeant zeal of our priests for increasing converts would draw on them the suspicion of the english nation these efforts have been renewed with double energy since the duke of york conformed to the catholic faith and the same event has doubled the hate and jealousy of the protestants so far i fear there may be just cause of suspicion that the duke is a better catholic than an englishman and that bigotry has involved him as avarice or the needy greed of a prodigal has engaged his brother in relations with france whereof england may have too much reason to complain but the gross thick and palpable fabrications of conspiracy and murder blood and firethe imaginary armiesthe intended massacresform a collection of falsehoods that one would have thought indigestible even by the coarse appetite of the vulgar for the marvellous and horrible but which are nevertheless received as truth by both houses of parliament and questioned by no one who is desirous to escape the odious appellation of friend to the bloody papists and favourer of their infernal schemes of cruelty  but what say those who are most likely to be affected by these wild reports said julian what say the english catholics themselvesa numerous and wealthy body comprising so many noble names  their hearts are dead within them said the countess they are like sheep penned up in the shambles that the butcher may take his choice among them in the obscure and brief communications which i have had by a secure hand they do but anticipate their own utter ruin and oursso general is the depression so universal the despair  but the king said peverilthe king and the protestant royalistswhat say they to this growing tempest  charles replied the countess with his usual selfish prudence truckles to the storm and will let cord and axe do their work on the most innocent men in his dominions rather than lose an hour of pleasure in attempting their rescue and for the royalists either they have caught the general delirium which has seized on protestants in general or they stand aloof and neutral afraid to show any interest in the unhappy catholics lest they be judged altogether such as themselves and abettors of the fearful conspiracy in which they are alleged to be engaged in fact i cannot blame them it is hard to expect that mere compassion for a persecuted sector what is yet more rare an abstract love of justiceshould be powerful enough to engage men to expose themselves to the awakened fury of a whole people for in the present state of general agitation whoever disbelieves the least tittle of the enormous improbabilities which have been accumulated by these wretched reformers is instantly hunted down as one who would smother the discovery of the plot it is indeed an awful tempest and remote as we lie from its sphere we must expect soon to feel its effects  lord derby already told me something of this said julian and that there were agents in this island whose object was to excite insurrection  yes answered the countess and her eye flashed fire as she spoke and had my advice been listened to they had been apprehended in the very fact and so dealt with as to be a warning to all others how they sought this independent principality on such an errand but my son who is generally so culpably negligent of his own affairs was pleased to assume the management of them upon this crisis  i am happy to learn madam answered peveril that the measures of precaution which my kinsman has adopted have had the complete effect of disconcerting the conspiracy  for the present julian but they should have been such as would have made the boldest tremble to think of such infringement of our rights in future but derbys present plan is fraught with greater danger and yet there is something in it of gallantry which has my sympathy  what is it madam inquired julian anxiously and in what can i aid it or avert its dangers  he purposes said the countess instantly to set forth for london he is he says not merely the feudal chief of a small island but one of the noble peers of england who must not remain in the security of an obscure and distant castle when his name or that of his mother is slandered before his prince and people he will take his place he says in the house of lords and publicly demand justice for the insult thrown on his house by perjured and interested witnesses  it is a generous resolution and worthy of my friend said julian peveril i will go with him and share his fate be it what it may  alas foolish boy answered the countess as well may you ask a hungry lion to feel compassion as a prejudiced and furious people to do justice they are like the madman at the height of frenzy who murders without compunction his best and dearest friend and only wonders and wails over his own cruelty when he is recovered from his delirium  pardon me dearest lady said julian this cannot be the noble and generous people of england cannot be thus strangely misled whatever prepossessions may be current among the more vulgar the house of legislature cannot be deeply infected by themthey will remember their own dignity  alas cousin answered the countess when did englishmen even of the highest degree remember anything when hurried away by the violence of party feeling even those who have too much sense to believe in the incredible fictions which gull the multitude will beware how they expose them if their own political party can gain a momentary advantage by their being accredited it is amongst such too that your kinsman has found friends and associates neglecting the old friends of his house as too grave and formal companions for the humour of the times his intercourse has been with the versatile shaftesburythe mercurial buckinghammen who would not hesitate to sacrifice to the popular moloch of the day whatsoever or whomsoever whose ruin could propitiate the deityforgive a mothers tears kinsman but i see the scaffold at bolton again erected if derby goes to london while these bloodhounds are in full cry obnoxious as he is and i have made him by my religious faith and my conduct in this island he dies his fathers death and yet upon what other course to resolve  let me go to london madam said peveril much moved by the distress of his patroness your ladyship was wont to rely something on my judgment i will act for the bestwill communicate with those whom you point out to me and only with them and i trust soon to send you information that this delusion however strong it may now be is in the course of passing away at the worst i can apprise you of the danger should it menace the earl or yourself and may be able also to point out the means by which it may be eluded  the countess listened with a countenance in which the anxiety of maternal affection which prompted her to embrace peverils generous offer struggled with her native disinterested and generous disposition think what you ask of me julian she replied with a sigh would you have me expose the life of my friends son to those perils to which i refuse my ownno never  nay but madam replied julian i do not run the same riskmy person is not known in londonmy situation though not obscure in my own country is too little known to be noticed in that huge assemblage of all that is noble and wealthy no whisper i presume however indirect has connected my name with the alleged conspiracy i am a protestant above all and can be accused of no intercourse direct or indirect with the church of rome my connections also lie amongst those who if they do not or cannot befriend me cannot at least be dangerous to me in a word i run no danger where the earl might incur great peril  alas said the countess of derby all this generous reasoning may be true but it could only be listened to by a widowed mother selfish as i am i cannot but reflect that my kinswoman has in all events the support of an affectionate husbandsuch is the interested reasoning to which we are not ashamed to subject our better feelings  do not call it so madam answered peveril think of me as the younger brother of my kinsman you have ever done by me the duties of a mother and have a right to my filial service were it at a risk ten times greater than a journey to london to inquire into the temper of the times i will instantly go and announce my departure to the earl  stay julian said the countess if you must make this journey in our behalfand alas i have not generosity enough to refuse your noble profferyou must go alone and without communication with derby i know him well his lightness of mind is free from selfish baseness and for the world would he not suffer you to leave man without his company and if he went with you your noble and disinterested kindness would be of no availyou would but share his ruin as the swimmer who attempts to save a drowning man is involved in his fate if he permit the sufferer to grapple with him  it shall be as you please madam said peveril i am ready to depart upon halfanhours notice  this night then said the countess after a moments pausethis night i will arrange the most secret means of carrying your generous project into effect for i would not excite that prejudice against you which will instantly arise were it known you had so lately left this island and its popish lady you will do well perhaps to use a feigned name in london  pardon me madam said julian i will do nothing that can draw on me unnecessary attention but to bear a feigned name or affect any disguise beyond living with extreme privacy would i think be unwise as well as unworthy and what if challenged i might find some difficulty in assigning a reason for consistent with perfect fairness of intentions  i believe you are right answered the countess after a moments consideration and then added you propose doubtless to pass through derbyshire and visit martindale castle  i should wish it madam certainly replied peveril did time permit and circumstances render it advisable  of that said the countess you must yourself judge despatch is doubtless desirable on the other hand arriving from your own familyseat you will be less an object of doubt and suspicion than if you posted up from hence without even visiting your parents you must be guided in thisin allby your own prudence go my dearest sonfor to me you should be dear as a songo and prepare for your journey i will get ready some despatches and a supply of moneynay do not object am i not your mother and are you not discharging a sons duty dispute not my right of defraying your expenses nor is this all for as i must trust your zeal and prudence to act in our behalf when occasion shall demand i will furnish you with effectual recommendations to our friends and kindred entreating and enjoining them to render whatever aid you may require either for your own protection or the advancement of what you may propose in our favour  peveril made no farther opposition to an arrangement which in truth the moderate state of his own finances rendered almost indispensable unless with his fathers assistance and the countess put into his hand bills of exchange to the amount of two hundred pounds upon a merchant in the city she then dismissed julian for the space of an hour after which she said she must again require his presence  the preparations for his journey were not of a nature to divert the thoughts which speedily pressed on him he found that halfanhours conversation had once more completely changed his immediate prospects and plans for the future he had offered to the countess of derby a service which her uniform kindness had well deserved at his hand but by her accepting it he was upon the point of being separated from alice bridgenorth at a time when she was become dearer to him than ever by her avowal of mutual passion her image rose before him such as he had that day pressed her to his bosomher voice was in his ear and seemed to ask whether he could desert her in the crisis which everything seemed to announce as impending but julian peveril his youth considered was strict in judging his duty and severely resolved in executing it he trusted not his imagination to pursue the vision which presented itself but resolutely seizing his pen wrote to alice the following letter explaining his situation as far as justice to the countess permitted him to do so    i leave you dearest alice thus ran the letteri leave you   and though in doing so i but obey the command you have laid on   me yet i can claim little merit for my compliance since without   additional and most forcible reasons in aid of your orders i fear   i should have been unable to comply with them but family affairs   of importance compel me to absent myself from this island for i   fear more than one week my thoughts hopes and wishes will be   on the moment that shall restore me to the black fort and its   lovely valley let me hope that yours will sometimes rest on the   lonely exile whom nothing could render such but the command of   honour and duty do not fear that i mean to involve you in a   private correspondence and let not your father fear it i could   not love you so much but for the openness and candour of your   nature and i would not that you concealed from major bridgenorth   one syllable of what i now avow respecting other matters he   himself cannot desire the welfare of our common country with more   zeal than i do differences may occur concerning the mode in which   that is to be obtained but in the principle i am convinced   there can be only one mind between us nor can i refuse to listen   to his experience and wisdom even where they may ultimately fail   to convince me farewellalice farewell much might be added to   that melancholy word but nothing that could express the   bitterness with which it is written yet i could transcribe it   again and again rather than conclude the last communication which   i can have with you for some time my sole comfort is that my   stay will scarce be so long as to permit you to forget one who   never can forget you   he held the paper in his hand for a minute after he had folded but before he had sealed it while he hurriedly debated in his own mind whether he had not expressed himself towards major bridgenorth in so conciliating a manner as might excite hopes of proselytism which his conscience told him he could not realise with honour yet on the other hand he had no right from what bridgenorth had said to conclude that their principles were diametrically irreconcilable for though the son of a high cavalier and educated in the family of the countess of derby he was himself upon principle an enemy of prerogative and a friend to the liberty of the subject and with such considerations he silenced all internal objections on the point of honour although his conscience secretly whispered that these conciliatory expressions towards the father were chiefly dictated by the fear that during his absence major bridgenorth might be tempted to change the residence of his daughter and perhaps to convey her altogether out of his reach  having sealed his letter julian called his servant and directed him to carry it under cover of one addressed to mrs debbitch to a house in the town of rushin where packets and messages intended for the family at black fort were usually deposited and for that purpose to take horse immediately he thus got rid of an attendant who might have been in some degree a spy on his motions he then exchanged the dress he usually wore for one more suited to travelling and having put a change or two of linen into a small cloakbag selected as arms a strong doubleedged sword and an excellent pair of pistols which last he carefully loaded with double bullets thus appointed and with twenty pieces in his purse and the bills we have mentioned secured in a private pocketbook he was in readiness to depart as soon as he should receive the countesss commands  the buoyant spirit of youth and hope which had for a moment been chilled by the painful and dubious circumstances in which he was placed as well as the deprivation which he was about to undergo now revived in full vigour fancy turning from more painful anticipations suggested to him that he was now entering upon life at a crisis when resolution and talents were almost certain to make the fortune of their possessor how could he make a more honourable entry on the bustling scene than sent by and acting in behalf of one of the noblest houses in england and should he perform what his charge might render incumbent with the resolution and the prudence necessary to secure success how many occurrences might take place to render his mediation necessary to bridgenorth and thus enable him on the most equal and honourable terms to establish a claim to his gratitude and to his daughters hand  whilst he was dwelling on such pleasing though imaginary prospects he could not help exclaiming aloudyes alice i will win thee nobly the words had scarce escaped his lips when he heard at the door of his apartment which the servant had left ajar a sound like a deep sigh which was instantly succeeded by a gentle tapcome in replied julian somewhat ashamed of his exclamation and not a little afraid that it had been caught up by some eavesdroppercome in he again repeated but his command was not obeyed on the contrary the knock was repeated somewhat louder he opened the door and fenella stood before him  with eyes that seemed red with recent tears and with a look of the deepest dejection the little mute first touching her bosom and beckoning with her finger made to him the usual sign that the countess desired to see himthen turned as if to usher him to her apartment as he followed her through the long gloomy vaulted passages which afforded communication betwixt the various apartments of the castle he could not but observe that her usual light trip was exchanged for a tardy and mournful step which she accompanied with low inarticulate moaning which she was probably the less able to suppress because she could not judge how far it was audible and also with wringing of the hands and other marks of extreme affliction  at this moment a thought came across peverils mind which in spite of his better reason made him shudder involuntarily as a peaksman and a long resident in the isle of man he was well acquainted with many a superstitious legend and particularly with a belief which attached to the powerful family of the stanleys for their peculiar demon a banshie or female spirit who was wont to shriek foreboding evil times and who was generally seen weeping and bemoaning herself before the death of any person of distinction belonging to the family for an instant julian could scarcely divest himself of the belief that the wailing jibbering form which glided before him with a lamp in her hand was a genius of his mothers race come to announce to him as an analogous reflection that if the suspicion which had crossed his mind concerning fenella was a just one her illfated attachment to him like that of the prophetic spirit to his family could bode nothing but disaster and lamentation and woe     chapter xix             now hoist the anchor matesand let the sails            give their broad bosom to the buxom wind            like lass that woos a lover                                                anonymous  the presence of the countess dispelled the superstitious feeling which for an instant had encroached on julians imagination and compelled him to give attention to the matters of ordinary life here are your credentials she said giving him a small packet carefully packed up in a sealskin cover you had better not open them till you come to london you must not be surprised to find that there are one or two addressed to men of my own persuasion these for all our sakes you will observe caution in delivering  i go your messenger madam said peveril and whatever you desire me to charge myself with of that i undertake the care yet allow me to doubt whether an intercourse with catholics will at this moment forward the purposes of my mission  you have caught the general suspicion of this wicked sect already said the countess smiling and are the fitter to go amongst englishmen in their present mood but my cautious friend these letters are so addressed and the persons to whom they are addressed so disguised that you will run no danger in conversing with them without their aid indeed you will not be able to obtain the accurate information you go in search of none can tell so exactly how the wind sets as the pilot whose vessel is exposed to the storm besides though you protestants deny our priesthood the harmlessness of the dove you are ready enough to allow us a full share of the wisdom of the serpent in plain terms their means of information are extensive and they are not deficient in the power of applying it i therefore wish you to have the benefit of their intelligence and advice if possible  whatever you impose upon me as a part of my duty madam rely on its being discharged punctually answered peveril and now as there is little use in deferring the execution of a purpose when once fixed let me know your ladyships wishes concerning my departure  it must be sudden and secret said the countess the island is full of spies and i would not wish that any of them should have notice that an envoy of mine was about to leave man for london can you be ready to go on board tomorrow  tonightthis instant if you will said julianmy little preparations are complete  be ready then in your chamber at two hours after midnight i will send one to summon you for our secret must be communicated for the present to as few as possible a foreign sloop is engaged to carry you over then make the best of your way to london by martindale castle or otherwise as you find most advisable when it is necessary to announce your absence i will say you are gone to see your parents but stayyour journey will be on horseback of course from whitehaven you have bills of exchange it is true but are you provided with ready money to furnish yourself with a good horse  i am sufficiently rich madam answered julian and good nags are plenty in cumberland there are those among them who know how to come by them good and cheap  trust not to that said the countess here is what will purchase for you the best horse on the borderscan you be simple enough to refuse it she added as she pressed on him a heavy purse which he saw himself obliged to accept  a good horse julian continued the countess and a good sword next to a good heart and head are the accomplishments of a cavalier  i kiss your hands then madam said peveril and humbly beg you to believe that whatever may fail in my present undertaking my purpose to serve you my noble kinswoman and benefactress can at least never swerve or falter  i know it my son i know it and may god forgive me if my anxiety for your friend has sent you on dangers which should have been his gogomay saints and angels bless you fenella shall acquaint him that you sup in your own apartment so indeed will i for tonight i should be unable to face my sons looks little will he thank me for sending you on his errand and there will be many to ask whether it was like the lady of latham to trust her friends son on the danger which should have been braved by her own but oh julian i am now a forlorn widow whom sorrow has made selfish  tush madam answered peveril it is more unlike the lady of latham to anticipate dangers which may not exist at all and to which if they do indeed occur i am less obnoxious than my noble kinsman farewellall blessings attend you madam commend me to derby and make him my excuses i shall expect a summons at two hours after midnight  they took an affectionate leave of each other the more affectionate indeed on the part of the countess that she could not entirely reconcile her generous mind to exposing peveril to danger on her sons behalf and julian betook himself to his solitary apartment  his servant soon afterwards brought him wine and refreshments to which notwithstanding the various matters he had to occupy his mind he contrived to do reasonable justice but when this needful occupation was finished his thoughts began to stream in upon him like a troubled tideat once recalling the past and anticipating the future it was in vain that he wrapped himself in his riding cloak and lying down on his bed endeavoured to compose himself to sleep the uncertainty of the prospect before himthe doubt how bridgenorth might dispose of his daughter during his absencethe fear that the major himself might fall into the power of the vindictive countess besides a numerous train of vague and halfformed apprehensions agitated his blood and rendered slumber impossible alternately to recline in the old oaken easychair and listen to the dashing of the waves under the windows mingled as the sound was with the scream of the seabirds or traverse the apartment with long and slow steps pausing occasionally to look out on the sea slumbering under the influence of a full moon which tipped each wave with silversuch were the only pastimes he could invent until midnight had passed for one hour the next was wasted in anxious expectation of the summons of departure  at length it arriveda tap at his door was followed by a low murmur which made him suspect that the countess had again employed her mute attendant as the most secure minister of her pleasure on this occasion he felt something like impropriety in this selection and it was with a feeling of impatience alien to the natural generosity of his temper that when he opened the door he beheld the dumb maiden standing before him the lamp which he held in his hand showed his features distinctly and probably made fenella aware of the expression which animated them she cast her large dark eyes mournfully on the ground and without again looking him in the face made him a signal to follow her he delayed no longer than was necessary to secure his pistols in his belt wrap his cloak closer around him and take his small portmanteau under his arm thus accoutred he followed her out of the keep or inhabited part of the castle by a series of obscure passages leading to a postern gate which she unlocked with a key selected from a bundle which she carried at her girdle  they now stood in the castleyard in the open moonlight which glimmered white and ghastly on the variety of strange and ruinous objects to which we have formerly alluded and which gave the scene rather the appearance of some ancient cemetery than of the interior of a fortification the round and elevated towerthe ancient mount with its quadrangular sides facing the ruinous edifices which once boasted the name of cathedralseemed of yet more antique and anomalous form when seen by the pale light which now displayed them to one of these churches fenella took the direct course and was followed by julian although he at once divined and was superstitious enough to dislike the path which she was about to adopt it was by a secret passage through this church that in former times the guardroom of the garrison situated at the lower and external defences communicated with the keep of the castle and through this passage were the keys of the castle every night carried to the governors apartment so soon as the gates were locked and the watch set the custom was given up in james the firsts time and the passage abandoned on account of the wellknown legend of the mauthe doga fiend or demon in the shape of a large shaggy black mastiff by which the church was said to be haunted it was devoutly believed that in former times this spectre became so familiar with mankind as to appear nightly in the guardroom issuing from the passage which we have mentioned at night and retiring to it at daybreak the soldiers became partly familiarised to its presence yet not so much so as to use any licence of language while the apparition was visible until one fellow rendered daring by intoxication swore he would know whether it was dog or devil and with his drawn sword followed the spectre when it retreated by the usual passage the man returned in a few minutes sobered by terror his mouth gaping and his hair standing on end under which horror he died but unhappily for the lovers of the marvellous altogether unable to disclose the horrors which he had seen under the evil repute arising from this tale of wonder the guardroom was abandoned and a new one constructed in like manner the guards after that period held another and more circuitous communication with the governor or seneschal of the castle and that which lay through the ruinous church was entirely abandoned  in defiance of the legendary terrors which tradition had attached to the original communication fenella followed by peveril now boldly traversed the ruinous vaults through which it laysometimes only guided over heaps of ruins by the precarious light of the lamp borne by the dumb maidensometimes having the advantage of a gleam of moonlight darting into the dreary abyss through the shafted windows or through breaches made by time as the path was by no means a straight one peveril could not but admire the intimate acquaintance with the mazes which his singular companion displayed as well as the boldness with which she traversed them he himself was not so utterly void of the prejudices of the times but that he contemplated with some apprehension the possibility of their intruding on the lair of the phantom hound of which he had heard so often and in every remote sight of the breeze among the ruins he thought he heard him baying at the mortal footsteps which disturbed his gloomy realm no such terrors however interrupted their journey and in the course of a few minutes they attained the deserted and now ruinous guardhouse the broken walls of the little edifice served to conceal them from the sentinels one of whom was keeping a drowsy watch at the lower gate of the castle whilst another seated on the stone steps which communicated with the parapet of the bounding and exterior wall was slumbering in full security with his musket peacefully grounded by his side fenella made a sign to peveril to move with silence and caution and then showed him to his surprise from the window of the deserted guardroom a boat for it was now high water with four rowers lurking under the cliff on which the castle was built and made him farther sensible that he was to have access to it by a ladder of considerable height placed at the window of the ruin  julian was both displeased and alarmed by the security and carelessness of the sentinels who had suffered such preparations to be made without observation or alarm given and he hesitated whether he should not call the officer of the guard upbraid him with negligence and show him how easily holmpeel in spite of its natural strength and although reported impregnable might be surprised by a few resolute men fenella seemed to guess his thoughts with that extreme acuteness of observation which her deprivations had occasioned her acquiring she laid one hand on his arm and a finger of the other on her own lips as if to enjoin forbearance and julian knowing that she acted by the direct authority of the countess obeyed her accordingly but with the internal resolution to lose no time in communicating his sentiments to the earl concerning the danger to which the castle was exposed on this point  in the meantime he descended the ladder with some precaution for the steps were unequal broken wet and slippery and having placed himself in the stern of the boat made a signal to the men to push off and turned to take farewell of his guide to his utter astonishment fenella rather slid down than descended regularly the perilous ladder and the boat being already pushed off made a spring from the last step of it with incredible agility and seated herself beside peveril ere he could express either remonstrance or surprise he commanded the men once more to pull in to the precarious landingplace and throwing into his countenance a part of the displeasure which he really felt endeavoured to make her comprehend the necessity of returning to her mistress fenella folded her arms and looked at him with a haughty smile which completely expressed the determination of her purpose peveril was extremely embarrassed he was afraid of offending the countess and interfering with her plan by giving alarm which otherwise he was much tempted to have done on fenella it was evident no species of argument which he could employ was likely to make the least impression and the question remained how if she went on with him he was to rid himself of so singular and inconvenient a companion and provide at the same time sufficiently for her personal security  the boatmen brought the matter to a decision for after lying on their oars for a minute and whispering among themselves in low dutch or german they began to pull stoutly and were soon at some distance from the castle the possibility of the sentinels sending a musketball or even a cannonshot after them was one of the contingencies which gave peveril momentary anxiety but they left the fortress as they must have approached it unnoticed or at least unchallengeda carelessness on the part of the garrison which notwithstanding that the oars were muffled and that the men spoke little and in whispers argued in peverils opinion great negligence on the part of the sentinels when they were a little way from the castle the men began to row briskly towards a small vessel which lay at some distance peveril had in the meantime leisure to remark that the boatmen spoke to each other doubtfully and bent anxious looks on fenella as if uncertain whether they had acted properly in bringing her off  after about a quarter of an hours rowing they reached the little sloop where peveril was received by the skipper or captain on the quarterdeck with an offer of spirits or refreshments a word or two among the seamen withdrew the captain from his hospitable cares and he flew to the ships side apparently to prevent fenella from entering the vessel the men and he talked eagerly in dutch looking anxiously at fenella as they spoke together and peveril hoped the result would be that the poor woman should be sent ashore again but she baffled whatever opposition could be offered to her and when the accommodationladder as it is called was withdrawn she snatched the end of a rope and climbed on board with the dexterity of a sailor leaving them no means of preventing her entrance save by actual violence to which apparently they did not choose to have recourse once on deck she took the captain by the sleeve and led him to the head of the vessel where they seemed to hold intercourse in a manner intelligible to both  peveril soon forgot the presence of the mute as he began to muse upon his own situation and the probability that he was separated for some considerable time from the object of his affections constancy he repeated to himselfconstancy and as if in coincidence with the theme of his reflections he fixed his eyes on the polar star which that night twinkled with more than ordinary brilliancy emblem of pure passion and steady purposethe thoughts which arose as he viewed its clear and unchanging light were disinterested and noble to seek his countrys welfare and secure the blessings of domestic peaceto discharge a bold and perilous duty to his friend and patronto regard his passion for alice bridgenorth as the loadstar which was to guide him to noble deedswere the resolutions which thronged upon his mind and which exalted his spirits to that state of romantic melancholy which perhaps is ill exchanged even for feelings of joyful rapture  he was recalled from those contemplations by something which nestled itself softly and closely to his sidea womans sigh sounded so near him as to disturb his reverie and as he turned his head he saw fenella seated beside him with her eyes fixed on the same star which had just occupied his own his first emotion was that of displeasure but it was impossible to persevere in it towards a being so helpless in many respects so interesting in others whose large dark eyes were filled with dew which glistened in the moonlight and the source of whose emotions seemed to be in a partiality which might well claim indulgence at least from him who was the object of it at the same time julian resolved to seize the present opportunity for such expostulations with fenella on the strangeness of her conduct as the poor maiden might be able to comprehend he took her hand with great kindness but at the same time with much gravity pointed to the boat and to the castle whose towers and extended walls were now scarce visible in the distance and thus intimated to her the necessity of her return to holmpeel she looked down and shook her head as if negativing his proposal with obstinate decision julian renewed his expostulation by look and gesturepointed to his own heart to intimate the countessand bent his brows to show the displeasure which she must entertain to all which the maiden only answered by her tears  at length as if driven to explanation by his continued remonstrances she suddenly seized him by the arm to arrest his attentioncast her eye hastily around as if to see whether she was watched by any onethen drew the other hand edgewise across her slender throatpointed to the boat and to the castle and nodded  on this series of signs peveril could put no interpretation excepting that he was menaced with some personal danger from which fenella seemed to conceive that her presence was a protection whatever was her meaning her purpose seemed unalterably adopted at least it was plain he had no power to shake it he must therefore wait till the end of their short voyage to disembarrass himself of his companion and in the meanwhile acting on the idea of her having harboured a misplaced attachment to him he thought he should best consult her interest and his own character in keeping at as great a distance from her as circumstances admitted with this purpose he made the sign she used for going to sleep by leaning his head on his palm and having thus recommended to her to go to rest he himself desired to be conducted to his berth  the captain readily showed him a hammock in the aftercabin into which he threw himself to seek that repose which the exercise and agitation of the preceding day as well as the lateness of the hour made him now feel desirable sleep deep and heavy sunk down on him in a few minutes but it did not endure long in his sleep he was disturbed by female cries and at length as he thought distinctly heard the voice of alice bridgenorth call on his name  he awoke and starting up to quit his bed became sensible from the motion of the vessel and the swinging of the hammock that his dream had deceived him he was still startled by its extreme vivacity and liveliness julian peveril help julian peveril the sounds still rung in his earsthe accents were those of aliceand he could scarce persuade himself that his imagination had deceived him could she be in the same vessel the thought was not altogether inconsistent with her fathers character and the intrigues in which he was engaged but then if so to what peril was she exposed that she invoked his name so loudly  determined to make instant inquiry he jumped out of his hammock halfdressed as he was and stumbling about the little cabin which was as dark as pitch at length with considerable difficulty reached the door the door however he was altogether unable to open and was obliged to call loudly to the watch upon deck the skipper or captain as he was called being the only person aboard who could speak english answered to the summons and replied to peverils demand what noise that wasthat a boat was going off with the young womanthat she whimpered a little as she left the vesseland dat vaas all  his dream was thus fully explained fancy had caught up the inarticulate and vehement cries with which fenella was wont to express resistance or displeasurehad coined them into language and given them the accents of alice bridgenorth our imagination plays wilder tricks with us almost every night  the captain now undid the door and appeared with a lantern without the aid of which peveril could scarce have regained his couch where he now slumbered secure and sound until day was far advanced and the invitation of the captain called him up to breakfast     chapter xx             now what is this that haunts me like my shadow            frisking and mumming like an elf in moonlight                                                ben jonson  peveril found the master of the vessel rather less rude than those in his station of life usually are and received from him full satisfaction concerning the fate of fenella upon whom the captain bestowed a hearty curse for obliging him to layto until he had sent his boat ashore and had her back again  i hope said peveril no violence was necessary to reconcile her to go ashore i trust she offered no foolish resistance  resist mein gott said the captain she did resist like a troop of horseshe did cry you might hear her at whitehavenshe did go up the rigging like a cat up a chimney but dat vas ein trick of her old trade  what trade do you mean said peveril  oh said the seaman i vas know more about her than you meinheer i vas know that she vas a little very little girl and prentice to one seiltanzer when my lady yonder had the good luck to buy her  a seiltanzer said peveril what do you mean by that  i mean a ropedanzer a mountebank a hans pickelharring i vas know adrian brackel vellhe sell de powders dat empty mens stomach and fill hims own purse not know adrian brackel mein gott i have smoked many a pound of tabak with him  peveril now remembered that fenella had been brought into the family when he and the young earl were in england and while the countess was absent on an expedition to the continent where the countess found her she never communicated to the young men but only intimated that she had received her out of compassion in order to relieve her from a situation of extreme distress  he hinted so much to the communicative seaman who replied that for distress he knew nochts ont only that adrian brackel beat her when she would not dance on the rope and starved her when she did to prevent her growth the bargain between the countess and the mountebank he said he had made himself because the countess had hired his brig upon her expedition to the continent none else knew where she came from the countess had seen her on a public stage at ostendcompassionated her helpless situation and the severe treatment she receivedand had employed him to purchase the poor creature from her master and charged him with silence towards all her retinueand so i do keep silence continued the faithful confidant van i am in the havens of man but when i am on the broad seas den my tongue is mine own you know die foolish beoples in the island they say she is a wechselbalgwhat you call a fairyelf changeling my faith they do not never have seen ein wechselbalg for i saw one myself at cologne and it was twice as big as yonder girl and did break the poor people with eating them up like de great big cuckoo in the sparrows nest but this venella eat no more than other girlsit was no wechselbalg in the world  by a different train of reasoning julian had arrived at the same conclusion in which therefore he heartily acquiesced during the seamans prosing he was reflecting within himself how much of the singular flexibility of her limbs and movements the unfortunate girl must have derived from the discipline and instructions of adrian brackel and also how far the germs of her wilful and capricious passions might have been sown during her wandering and adventurous childhood aristocratic also as his education had been these anecdotes respecting fenellas original situation and education rather increased his pleasure of having shaken off her company and yet he still felt desirous to know any farther particulars which the seaman could communicate on the same subject but he had already told all he knew of her parents he knew nothing except that her father must have been a damned hundsfoot and a schelm for selling his own flesh and blood to adrian brackel for by such a transaction had the mountebank become possessed of his pupil  this conversation tended to remove any passing doubts which might have crept on peverils mind concerning the fidelity of the master of the vessel who appeared from thence to have been a former acquaintance of the countess and to have enjoyed some share of her confidence the threatening motion used by fenella he no longer considered as worthy of any notice excepting as a new mark of the irritability of her temper  he amused himself with walking the deck and musing on his past and future prospects until his attention was forcibly arrested by the wind which began to rise in gusts from the northwest in a manner so unfavourable to the course they intended to hold that the master after many efforts to beat against it declared his bark which was by no means an excellent seaboat was unequal to making whitehaven and that he was compelled to make a fair wind of it and run for liverpool to this course peveril did not object it saved him some land journey in case he visited his fathers castle and the countesss commission would be discharged as effectually the one way as the other  the vessel was put accordingly before the wind and ran with great steadiness and velocity the captain notwithstanding pleading some nautical hazards chose to lie off and did not attempt the mouth of the mersey until morning when peveril had at length the satisfaction of being landed upon the quay of liverpool which even then showed symptoms of the commercial prosperity that has since been carried to such a height  the master who was well acquainted with the port pointed out to julian a decent place of entertainment chiefly frequented by seafaring people for although he had been in the town formerly he did not think it proper to go anywhere at present where he might have been unnecessarily recognised here he took leave of the seaman after pressing upon him with difficulty a small present for his crew as for his passage the captain declined any recompense whatever and they parted upon the most civil terms  the inn to which he was recommended was full of strangers seamen and mercantile people all intent upon their own affairs and discussing them with noise and eagerness peculiar to the business of a thriving seaport but although the general clamour of the public room in which the guests mixed with each other related chiefly to their own commercial dealings there was a general theme mingling with them which was alike common and interesting to all so that amidst disputes about freight tonnage demurrage and such like were heard the emphatic sounds of deep damnable accursed plotbloody papist villainsthe king in dangerthe gallows too good for them and so forth  the fermentation excited in london had plainly reached even this remote seaport and was received by the inhabitants with the peculiar stormy energy which invests men in their situation with the character of the winds and waves with which they are chiefly conversant the commercial and nautical interests of england were indeed particularly anticatholic although it is not perhaps easy to give any distinct reason why they should be so since theological disputes in general could scarce be considered as interesting to them but zeal amongst the lower orders at least is often in an inverse ratio to knowledge and sailors were not probably the less earnest and devoted protestants that they did not understand the controversy between the churches as for the merchants they were almost necessarily inimical to the gentry of lancashire and cheshire many of whom still retained the faith of rome which was rendered ten times more odious to the men of commerce as the badge of their haughty aristocratic neighbours  from the little which peveril heard of the sentiments of the people of liverpool he imagined he should act most prudently in leaving the place as soon as possible and before any suspicion should arise of his having any connection with the party which appeared to have become so obnoxious  in order to accomplish his journey it was first necessary that he should purchase a horse and for this purpose he resolved to have recourse to the stables of a dealer well known at the time and who dwelt in the outskirts of the place and having obtained directions to his dwelling he went thither to provide himself  joe bridlesleys stables exhibited a large choice of good horses for that trade was in former days more active than at present it was an ordinary thing for a stranger to buy a horse for the purpose of a single journey and to sell him as well as he could when he had reached the point of his destination and hence there was a constant demand and a corresponding supply upon both of which bridlesley and those of his trade contrived doubtless to make handsome profits  julian who was no despicable horsejockey selected for his purpose a strong wellmade horse about sixteen hands high and had him led into the yard to see whether the paces corresponded with his appearance as these also gave perfect satisfaction to the customer it remained only to settle the price with bridlesley who of course swore his customer had pitched upon the best horse ever darkened the stabledoor since he had dealt that way that no such horses were to be had nowadays for that the mares were dead that foaled them and having named a corresponding price the usual haggling commenced betwixt the seller and purchaser for adjustment of what the french dealers call le prix juste  the reader if he be at all acquainted with this sort of traffic well knows it is generally a keen encounter of wits and attracts the notice of all the idlers within hearing who are usually very ready to offer their opinions or their evidence amongst these upon the present occasion was a thin man rather less than the ordinary size and meanly dressed but whose interference was in a confident tone and such as showed himself master of the subject on which he spoke the price of the horse being settled to about fifteen pounds which was very high for the period that of the saddle and bridle had next to be adjusted and the thin meanlooking person beforementioned found nearly as much to say on this subject as on the other as his remarks had a conciliating and obliging tendency towards the stranger peveril concluded he was one of those idle persons who unable or unwilling to supply themselves with the means of indulgence at their own cost do not scruple to deserve them at the hands of others by a little officious complaisance and considering that he might acquire some useful information from such a person was just about to offer him the courtesy of a morning draught when he observed he had suddenly left the yard he had scarce remarked this circumstance before a party of customers entered the place whose haughty assumption of importance claimed the instant attention of bridlesley and all his militia of grooms and stableboys  three good horses said the leader of the party a tall bulky man whose breath was drawn full and high under a consciousness of fat and of importancethree good and ablebodied horses for the service of the commons of england  bridlesley said he had some horses which might serve the speaker himself at need but that to speak christian truth he had just sold the best in his stable to that gentleman present who doubtless would give up the bargain if the horse was needed for the service of the state  you speak well friend said the important personage and advancing to julian demanded in a very haughty tone the surrender of the purchase which he had just made  peveril with some difficulty subdued the strong desire which he felt to return a round refusal to so unreasonable a request but fortunately recollecting that the situation in which he at present stood required on his part much circumspection he replied simply that upon showing him any warrant to seize upon horses for the public service he must of course submit to resign his purchase  the man with an air of extreme dignity pulled from his pocket and thrust into peverils hand a warrant subscribed by the speaker of the house of commons empowering charles topham their officer of the black rod to pursue and seize upon the persons of certain individuals named in the warrant and of all other persons who are or should be accused by competent witnesses of being accessory to or favourers of the hellish and damnable popish plot at present carried on within the bowels of the kingdom and charging all men as they loved their allegiance to render the said charles topham their readiest and most effective assistance in execution of the duty entrusted to his care  on perusing a document of such weighty import julian had no hesitation to give up his horse to this formidable functionary whom somebody compared to a lion which as the house of commons was pleased to maintain such an animal they were under the necessity of providing for by frequent commitments until take him topham became a proverb and a formidable one in the mouth of the public  the acquiescence of peveril procured him some grace in the sight of the emissary who before selecting two horses for his attendants gave permission to the stranger to purchase a grey horse much inferior indeed to that which he had resigned both in form and in action but very little lower in price as mr bridlesley immediately on learning the demand for horses upon the part of the commons of england had passed a private resolution in his own mind augmenting the price of his whole stud by an imposition of at least twenty per cent ad valorem  peveril adjusted and paid the price with much less argument than on the former occasion for to be plain with the reader he had noticed in the warrant of mr topham the name of his father sir geoffrey peveril of martindale castle engrossed at full length as one of those subjected to arrest by that officer  when aware of this material fact it became julians business to leave liverpool directly and carry the alarm to derbyshire if indeed mr topham had not already executed his charge in that county which he thought unlikely as it was probable they would commence by securing those who lived nearest to the seaports a word or two which he overheard strengthened his hopes  and hark ye friend said mr topham you will have the horses at the door of mr shortell the mercer in two hours as we shall refresh ourselves there with a cool tankard and learn what folks live in the neighbourhood that may be concerned in my way and you will please to have that saddle padded for i am told the derbyshire roads are roughand you captain dangerfield and master everett you must put on your protestant spectacles and show me where there is the shadow of a priest or of a priests favourer for i am come down with a broom in my cap to sweep this north country of such like cattle  one of the persons he thus addressed who wore the garb of a brokendown citizen only answered ay truly master topham it is time to purge the garner  the other who had a formidable pair of whiskers a red nose and a tarnished laced coat together with a hat of pistols dimensions was more loquacious i take it on my damnation said this zealous protestant witness that i will discover the marks of the beast on every one of them betwixt sixteen and seventy as plainly as if they had crossed themselves with ink instead of holy water since we have a king willing to do justice and a house of commons to uphold prosecutions why damn me the cause must not stand still for lack of evidence  stick to that noble captain answered the officer but prithee reserve thy oaths for the court of justice it is but sheer waste to throw them away as you do in your ordinary conversation  fear you nothing master topham answered dangerfield it is right to keep a mans gifts in use and were i altogether to renounce oaths in my private discourse how should i know how to use one when i needed it but you hear me use none of your papist abjurations i swear not by the mass or before george or by anything that belongs to idolatry but such downright oaths as may serve a poor protestant gentleman who would fain serve heaven and the king  bravely spoken most noble festus said his yokefellow but do not suppose that although i am not in the habit of garnishing my words with oaths out of season i shall be wanting when called upon to declare the height and the depth the width and the length of this hellish plot against the king and the protestant faith  dizzy and almost sick with listening to the undisguised brutality of these fellows peveril having with difficulty prevailed on bridlesley to settle his purchase at length led forth his grey steed but was scarce out of the yard when he heard the following alarming conversation pass of which he seemed himself the object  who is that youth said the slow soft voice of the more precise of the two witnesses methinks i have seen him somewhere before is he from these parts  not that i know of said bridlesley who like all the other inhabitants of england at the time answered the interrogatories of these fellows with the deference which is paid in spain to the questions of an inquisitor a strangerentirely a strangernever saw him beforea wild young colt i warrant him and knows a horses mouth as well as i do  i begin to bethink me i saw such a face as his at the jesuits consult in the white horse tavern answered everett  and i think i recollect said captain dangerfield  come come master and captain said the authoritative voice of topham we will have none of your recollections at present we all know what these are likely to end in but i will have you know you are not to run till the leash is slipped the young man is a welllooking lad and gave up his horse handsomely for the service of the house of commons he knows how to behave himself to his betters i warrant you and i scarce think he has enough in his purse to pay the fees  this speech concluded the dialogue which peveril finding himself so much concerned in the issue thought it best to hear to an end now when it ceased to get out of the town unobserved and take the nearest way to his fathers castle seemed his wisest plan he had settled his reckoning at the inn and brought with him to bridlesleys the small portmanteau which contained his few necessaries so that he had no occasion to return thither he resolved therefore to ride some miles before he stopped even for the purpose of feeding his horse and being pretty well acquainted with the country he hoped to be able to push forward to martindale castle sooner than the worshipful master topham whose saddle was in the first place to be padded and who when mounted would in all probability ride with the precaution of those who require such security against the effects of a hard trot  under the influence of these feelings julian pushed for warrington a place with which he was well acquainted but without halting in the town he crossed the mersey by the bridge built by an ancestor of his friend the earl of derby and continued his route towards dishley on the borders of derbyshire he might have reached this latter village easily had his horse been fitter for a forced march but in the course of the journey he had occasion more than once to curse the official dignity of the person who had robbed him of his better steed while taking the best direction he could through a country with which he was only generally acquainted  at length near altringham a halt became unavoidable and peveril had only to look for some quiet and sequestered place of refreshment this presented itself in the form of a small cluster of cottages the best of which united the characters of an alehouse and a mill where the sign of the cat the landlords faithful ally in defence of his mealsacks booted as high as grimalkin in the fairy tale and playing on the fiddle for the more grace announced that john whitecraft united the two honest occupations of landlord and miller and doubtless took toll from the public in both capacities  such a place promised a traveller who journeyed incognito safer if not better accommodation than he was like to meet with in more frequented inns and at the door of the cat and fiddle julian halted accordingly     chapter xxi             in these distracted times when each man dreads            the bloody stratagems of busy hands                                                        otway  at the door of the cat and fiddle julian received the usual attention paid to the customers of an inferior house of entertainment his horse was carried by a ragged lad who acted as hostler into a paltry stable where however the nag was tolerably supplied with food and litter  having seen the animal on which his comfort perhaps his safety depended properly provided for peveril entered the kitchen which indeed was also the parlour and hall of the little hostelry to try what refreshment he could obtain for himself much to his satisfaction he found there was only one guest in the house besides himself but he was less pleased when he found that he must either go without dinner or share with that single guest the only provisions which chanced to be in the house namely a dish of trouts and eels which their host the miller had brought in from his millstream  at the particular request of julian the landlady undertook to add a substantial dish of eggs and bacon which perhaps she would not have undertaken for had not the sharp eye of peveril discovered the flitch hanging in its smoky retreat when as its presence could not be denied the hostess was compelled to bring it forward as a part of her supplies  she was a buxom dame about thirty whose comely and cheerful countenance did honour to the choice of the jolly miller her loving mate and was now stationed under the shade of an oldfashioned huge projecting chimney within which it was her province to work i the fire and provide for the wearied wayfaring man the good things which were to send him rejoicing on his course although at first the honest woman seemed little disposed to give herself much additional trouble on julians account yet the good looks handsome figure and easy civility of her new guest soon bespoke the principal part of her attention and while busy in his service she regarded him from time to time with looks where something like pity mingled with complacency the rich smoke of the rasher and the eggs with which it was flanked already spread itself through the apartment and the hissing of these savoury viands bore chorus to the simmering of the pan in which the fish were undergoing a slower decoction the table was covered with a clean huckaback napkin and all was in preparation for the meal which julian began to expect with a good deal of impatience when the companion who was destined to share it with him entered the apartment  at the first glance julian recognised to his surprise the same indifferently dressed thinlooking person who during the first bargain which he had made with bridlesley had officiously interfered with his advice and opinion displeased at having the company of any stranger forced upon him peveril was still less satisfied to find one who might make some claim of acquaintance with him however slender since the circumstances in which he stood compelled him to be as reserved as possible he therefore turned his back upon his destined messmate and pretended to amuse himself by looking out of the window determined to avoid all intercourse until it should be inevitably forced upon him  in the meanwhile the other stranger went straight up to the landlady where she toiled on household cares intent and demanded of her what she meant by preparing bacon and eggs when he had positively charged her to get nothing ready but the fish  the good woman important as every cook in the discharge of her duty deigned not for some time so much as to acknowledge that she heard the reproof of her guest and when she did so it was only to repel it in a magisterial and authoritative toneif he did not like baconbacon from their own hutch well fed on pease and branif he did not like bacon and eggsnewlaid eggs which she had brought in from the henroost with her own handswhy so put caseit was the worse for his honour and the better for those who did  the better for those who like them answered the guest that is as much as to say i am to have a companion good woman  do not good woman me sir replied the millers wife till i call you good man and i promise you many would scruple to do that to one who does not love eggs and bacon of a friday  nay my good lady said her guest do not fix any misconstruction upon mei dare say the eggs and the bacon are excellent only they are rather a dish too heavy for my stomach  ay or your conscience perhaps sir answered the hostess and now i bethink me you must needs have your fish fried with oil instead of the good drippings i was going to put to them i would i could spell the meaning of all this now but i warrant john bigstaff the constable could conjure something out of it  there was a pause here but julian somewhat alarmed at the tone which the conversation assumed became interested in watching the dumb show which succeeded by bringing his head a little towards the left but without turning round or quitting the projecting latticed window where he had taken his station he could observe that the stranger secured as he seemed to think himself from observation had sidled close up to the landlady and as he conceived had put a piece of money into her hand the altered tone of the millers moiety corresponded very much with this supposition  nay indeed and forsooth she said her house was liberty hall and so should every publicans be what was it to her what gentlefolks ate or drank providing they paid for it honestly there were many honest gentlemen whose stomachs could not abide bacon grease or dripping especially on a friday and what was that to her or any one in her line so gentlefolks paid honestly for the trouble only she would say that her bacon and eggs could not be mended betwixt this and liverpool and that she would live and die upon  i shall hardly dispute it said the stranger and turning towards julian he added i wish this gentleman who i suppose is my trenchercompanion much joy of the dainties which i cannot assist him in consuming  i assure you sir answered peveril who now felt himself compelled to turn about and reply with civility that it was with difficulty i could prevail on my landlady to add my cover to yours though she seems now such a zealot for the consumption of eggs and bacon  i am zealous for nothing said the landlady save that men would eat their victuals and pay their score and if there be enough in one dish to serve two guests i see little purpose in dressing them two however they are ready now and done to a nicetyhere alice alice  the sound of that wellknown name made julian start but the alice who replied to the call ill resembled the vision which his imagination connected with the accents being a dowdy slipshod wench the drudge of the low inn which afforded him shelter she assisted her mistress in putting on the table the dishes which the latter had prepared and a foaming jug of homebrewed ale being placed betwixt them was warranted by dame whitecraft as excellent for said she we know by practice that too much water drowns the miller and we spare it on our malt as we would in our milldam  i drink to your health in it dame said the elder stranger and a cup of thanks for these excellent fish and to the drowning of all unkindness between us  i thank you sir said the dame and wish you the like but i dare not pledge you for our gaffer says that ale is brewed too strong for women so i only drink a glass of canary at a time with a gossip or any gentleman guest that is so minded  you shall drink one with me then dame said peveril so you will let me have a flagon  that you shall sir and as good as ever was broached but i must to the mill to get the key from the goodman  so saying and tucking her clean gown through the pocketholes that her steps might be the more alert and her dress escape dust off she tripped to the mill which lay close adjoining  a dainty dame and dangerous is the millers wife said the stranger looking at peveril is not that old chaucers phrase  ii believe so said peveril not much read in chaucer who was then even more neglected than at present and much surprised at a literary quotation from one of the mean appearance exhibited by the person before him  yes answered the stranger i see that you like other young gentlemen of the time are better acquainted with cowley and waller than with the well of english undefiled i cannot help differing there are touches of nature about the old bard of woodstock that to me are worth all the turns of laborious wit in cowley and all the ornate and artificial simplicity of his courtly competitor the description for instance of his country coquette   wincing she was as is a wanton colt   sweet as a flower and upright as a bolt  then again for pathos where will you mend the dying scene of arcite   alas my hearts queen alas my wife   giver at once and ender of my life   what is this worldwhat axen men to have   now with his lovenow in his cold grave   alone withouten other company  but i tire you sir and do injustice to the poet whom i remember but by halves  on the contrary sir replied peveril you make him more intelligible to me in your recitation than i have found him when i have tried to peruse him myself  you were only frightened by the antiquated spelling and the letters black said his companion it is many a scholars case who mistakes a nut which he could crack with a little exertion for a bullet which he must needs break his teeth on but yours are better employedshall i offer you some of this fish  not so sir replied julian willing to show himself a man of reading in his turn i hold with old caius and profess to fear judgment to fight where i cannot choose and to eat no fish  the stranger cast a startled look around him at this observation which julian had thrown out on purpose to ascertain if possible the quality of his companion whose present language was so different from the character he had assumed at bridlesleys his countenance too although the features were of an ordinary not to say mean cast had that character of intelligence which education gives to the most homely face and his manners were so easy and disembarrassed as plainly showed a complete acquaintance with society as well as the habit of mingling with it in the higher stages the alarm which he had evidently shown at peverils answer was but momentary for he almost instantly replied with a smile i promise you sir that you are in no dangerous company for notwithstanding my fish dinner i am much disposed to trifle with some of your savoury mess if you will indulge me so far  peveril accordingly reinforced the strangers trencher with what remained of the bacon and eggs and saw him swallow a mouthful or two with apparent relish but presently after began to dally with his knife and fork like one whose appetite was satiated and then took a long draught of the black jack and handed his platter to the large mastiff dog who attracted by the smell of the dinner had sat down before him for some time licking his chops and following with his eye every morsel which the guest raised to his head  here my poor fellow said he thou hast had no fish and needest this supernumerary trencherload more than i do i cannot withstand thy mute supplication any longer  the dog answered these courtesies by a civil shake of the tail while he gobbled up what was assigned him by the strangers benevolence in the greater haste that he heard his mistresss voice at the door  here is the canary gentlemen said the landlady and the goodman has set off the mill to come to wait on you himself he always does so when company drink wine  that he may come in for the hosts that is for the lions share said the stranger looking at peveril  the shot is mine said julian and if mine host will share it i will willingly bestow another quart on him and on you sir i never break old customs  these sounds caught the ear of gaffer whitecraft who had entered the room a strapping specimen of his robust trade prepared to play the civil or the surly host as his company should be acceptable or otherwise at julians invitation he doffed his dusty bonnetbrushed from his sleeve the looser particles of his professional dustand sitting down on the end of a bench about a yard from the table filled a glass of canary and drank to his guests and especially to this noble gentleman indicating peveril who had ordered the canary  julian returned the courtesy by drinking his health and asking what news were about in the country  nought sir i hears on nought except this plot as they call it that they are pursuing the papishers about but it brings water to my mill as the saying is between expresses hurrying hither and thither and guards and prisoners riding to and again and the custom of the neighbours that come to speak over the news of an evening nightly i may say instead of once a week why the spigot is in use gentlemen and your land thrives and then i serving as constable and being a known protestant i have tapped i may venture to say it may be ten stands of ale extraordinary besides a reasonable sale of wine for a country corner heaven make us thankful and keep all good protestants from plot and popery  i can easily conceive my friend said julian that curiosity is a passion which runs naturally to the alehouse and that anger and jealousy and fear are all of them thirsty passions and great consumers of homebrewed but i am a perfect stranger in these parts and i would willingly learn from a sensible man like you a little of this same plot of which men speak so much and appear to know so little  learn a little of itwhy it is the most horriblethe most damnable bloodthirsty beast of a plotbut hold hold my good master i hope in the first place you believe there is a plot for otherwise the justice must have a word with you as sure as my name is john whitecraft  it shall not need said peveril for i assure you mine host i believe in the plot as freely and fully as a man can believe in anything he cannot understand  god forbid that anybody should pretend to understand it said the implicit constable for his worship the justice says it is a mile beyond him and he be as deep as most of them but men may believe though they do not understand and that is what the romanists say themselves but this i am sure of it makes a rare stirring time for justices and witnesses and constablesso heres to your health again gentlemen in a cup of neat canary  come come john whitecraft said the wife do not you demean yourself by naming witnesses along with justices and constables all the world knows how they come by their money  ay but all the world knows that they do come by it dame and that is a great comfort they rustle in their canonical silks and swagger in their buff and scarlet who but theyay ay the cursed fox thrivesand not so cursed neither is there not doctor titus oates the saviour of the nationdoes he not live at whitehall and eat off plate and have a pension of thousands a year for what i know and is he not to be bishop of litchfield so soon as dr doddrum dies  then i hope dr doddrums reverence will live these twenty years and i dare say i am the first that ever wished such a wish said the hostess i do not understand these doings not i and if a hundred jesuits came to hold a consult at my house as they did at the white horse tavern i should think it quite out of the line of business to bear witness against them provided they drank well and paid their score  very true dame said her elder guest that is what i call keeping a good publican conscience and so i will pay my score presently and be jogging on my way  peveril on his part also demanded a reckoning and discharged it so liberally that the miller flourished his hat as he bowed and the hostess courtesied down to the ground  the horses of both guests were brought forth and they mounted in order to depart in company the host and hostess stood in the doorway to see them depart the landlord proffered a stirrupcup to the elder guest while the landlady offered peveril a glass from her own peculiar bottle for this purpose she mounted on the horseblock with flask and glass in hand so that it was easy for the departing guest although on horseback to return the courtesy in the most approved manner namely by throwing his arm over his landladys shoulder and saluting her at parting  dame whitecraft did not decline this familiarity for there is no room for traversing upon a horseblock and the hands which might have served her for resistance were occupied with glass and bottlematters too precious to be thrown away in such a struggle apparently however she had something else in her head for as after a brief affectation of reluctance she permitted peverils face to approach hers she whispered in his ear beware of trepansan awful intimation which in those days of distrust suspicion and treachery was as effectual in interdicting free and social intercourse as the advertisement of mantraps and springguns to protect an orchard pressing her hand in intimation that he comprehended her hint she shook his warmly in return and bade god speed him there was a cloud on john whitecrafts brow nor did his final farewell sound half so cordial as that which had been spoken within doors but then peveril reflected that the same guest is not always equally acceptable to landlord and landlady and unconscious of having done anything to excite the millers displeasure he pursued his journey without thinking farther of the matter  julian was a little surprised and not altogether pleased to find that his new acquaintance held the same road with him he had many reasons for wishing to travel alone and the hostesss caution still rung in his ears if this man possessed of so much shrewdness as his countenance and conversation intimated versatile as he had occasion to remark and disguised beneath his condition should prove as was likely to be a concealed jesuit or seminarypriest travelling upon their great task of the conversion of england and rooting out of the northern heresya more dangerous companion for a person in his own circumstances could hardly be imagined since keeping society with him might seem to authorise whatever reports had been spread concerning the attachment of his family to the catholic cause at the same time it was very difficult without actual rudeness to shake off the company of one who seemed so determined whether spoken to or not to remain alongside of him  peveril tried the experiment of riding slow but his companion determined not to drop him slackened his pace so as to keep close by him julian then spurred his horse to a full trot and was soon satisfied that the stranger notwithstanding the meanness of his appearance was so much better mounted than himself as to render vain any thought of outriding him he pulled up his horse to a more reasonable pace therefore in a sort of despair upon his doing so his companion who had been hitherto silent observed that peveril was not so well qualified to try speed upon the road as he would have been had he abode by his first bargain of horseflesh that morning  peveril assented dryly but observed that the animal would serve his immediate purpose though he feared it would render him indifferent company for a person better mounted  by no means answered his civil companion i am one of those who have travelled so much as to be accustomed to make my journey at any rate of motion which may be most agreeable to my company  peveril made no reply to this polite intimation being too sincere to tender the thanks which in courtesy were the proper answera second pause ensued which was broken by julian asking the stranger whether their roads were likely to lie long together in the same direction  i cannot tell said the stranger smiling unless i knew which way you were travelling  i am uncertain how far i shall go tonight said julian willingly misunderstanding the purport of the reply  and so am i replied the stranger but though my horse goes better than yours i think it will be wise to spare him and in case our road continues to lie the same way we are likely to sup as we have dined together  julian made no answer whatever to this round intimation but continued to ride on turning in his own mind whether it would not be wisest to come to a distinct understanding with his pertinacious attendant and to explain in so many words that it was his pleasure to travel alone but besides that the sort of acquaintance which they had formed during dinner rendered him unwilling to be directly uncivil towards a person of gentlemanlike manners he had also to consider that he might very possibly be mistaken in this mans character and purpose in which case the cynically refusing the society of a sound protestant would afford as pregnant matter of suspicion as travelling in company with a disguised jesuit  after brief reflection therefore he resolved to endure the encumbrance of the strangers society until a fair opportunity should occur to rid himself of it and in the meantime to act with as much caution as he possibly could in any communication that might take place between them for dame whitecrafts parting caution still rang anxiously in his ears and the consequences of his own arrest upon suspicion must deprive him of every opportunity of serving his father or the countess or major bridgenorth upon whose interest also he had promised himself to keep an eye  while he revolved these things in his mind they had journeyed several miles without speaking and now entered upon a more waste country and worse roads than they had hitherto found being in fact approaching the more hilly district of derbyshire in travelling on a very stony and uneven lane julians horse repeatedly stumbled and had he not been supported by the riders judicious use of the bridle must at length certainly have fallen under him  these are times which crave wary riding sir said his companion and by your seat in the saddle and your hand on the rein you seem to understand it to be so  i have been long a horseman sir answered peveril  and long a traveller too sir i should suppose since by the great caution you observe you seem to think the human tongue requires a curb as well as the horses jaws  wiser men than i have been of opinion answered peveril that it were a part of prudence to be silent when men have little or nothing to say  i cannot approve of their opinion answered the stranger all knowledge is gained by communication either with the dead through books or more pleasingly through the conversation of the living the deaf and dumb alone are excluded from improvement and surely their situation is not so enviable that we should imitate them  at this illustration which awakened a startling echo in peverils bosom the young man looked hard at his companion but in the composed countenance and calm blue eye he read no consciousness of a farther meaning than the words immediately and directly implied he paused a moment and then answered you seem to be a person sir of shrewd apprehension and i should have thought it might have occurred to you that in the present suspicious times men may without censure avoid communication with strangers you know not me and to me you are totally unknown there is not room for much discourse between us without trespassing on the general topics of the day which carry in them seeds of quarrel between friends much more betwixt strangers at any other time the society of an intelligent companion would have been most acceptable upon my solitary ride but at present  at present said the other interrupting him you are like the old romans who held that hostis meant both a stranger and an enemy i will therefore be no longer a stranger my name is ganlesseby profession i am a roman catholic priesti am travelling here in dread of my lifeand i am very glad to have you for a companion  i thank you for the information with all my heart said peveril and to avail myself of it to the uttermost i must beg you to ride forward or lag behind or take a sidepath at your own pleasure for as i am no catholic and travel upon business of high concernment i am exposed both to risk and delay and even to danger by keeping such suspicious company and so master ganlesse keep your own pace and i will keep the contrary for i beg leave to forbear your company  as peveril spoke thus he pulled up his horse and made a full stop  the stranger burst out alaughing what he said you forbear my company for a trifle of danger saint anthony how the warm blood of the cavaliers is chilled in the young men of the present day this young gallant now has a father i warrant who has endured as many adventures for hunting priests as a knighterrant for distressed damsels  this raillery avails nothing sir said peveril i must request you will keep your own way  my way is yours said the pertinacious master ganlesse as he called himself and we will both travel the safer that we journey in company i have the receipt of fernseed man and walk invisible besides you would not have me quit you in this lane where there is no turn to right or left  peveril moved on desirous to avoid open violencefor which the indifferent tone of the traveller indeed afforded no apt pretextyet highly disliking his company and determined to take the first opportunity to rid himself of it  the stranger proceeded at the same pace with him keeping cautiously on his bridle hand as if to secure that advantage in case of a struggle but his language did not intimate the least apprehension you do me wrong he said to peveril and you equally wrong yourself you are uncertain where to lodge tonighttrust to my guidance here is an ancient hall within four miles with an old knightly pantaloon for its lordan allberuffed dame barbara for the lady gaya jesuit in a butlers habit to say gracean old tale of edgehill and worster fights to relish a cold venison pasty and a flask of claret mantled with cobwebsa bed for you in the priests hidingholeand for aught i know pretty mistress betty the dairymaid to make it ready  this has no charms for me sir said peveril who in spite of himself could not but be amused with the ready sketch which the stranger gave of many an old mansion in cheshire and derbyshire where the owners retained the ancient faith of rome  well i see i cannot charm you in this way continued his companion i must strike another key i am no longer ganlesse the seminary priest but changing his tone and snuffling in the nose simon canter a poor preacher of the word who travels this way to call sinners to repentance and to strengthen and to edify and to fructify among the scattered remnant who hold fast the truthwhat say you to this sir  i admire your versatility sir and could be entertained with it at another time at present sincerity is more in request  sincerity said the strangera childs whistle with but two notes in ityea yea and nay nay why man the very quakers have renounced it and have got in its stead a gallant recorder called hypocrisy that is somewhat like sincerity in form but of much greater compass and combines the whole gamut come be ruledbe a disciple of simon canter for the evening and we will leave the old tumbledown castle of the knight aforesaid on the left hand for a new brickbuilt mansion erected by an eminent saltboiler from namptwich who expects the said simon to make a strong spiritual pickle for the preservation of a soul somewhat corrupted by the evil communications of this wicked world what say you he has two daughtersbrighter eyes never beamed under a pinched hood and for myself i think there is more fire in those who live only to love and to devotion than in your court beauties whose hearts are running on twenty follies besides you know not the pleasure of being consciencekeeper to a pretty precisian who in one breath repeats her foibles and in the next confesses her passion perhaps though you may have known such in your day come sir it grows too dark to see your blushes but i am sure they are burning on your cheek  you take great freedom sir said peveril as they now approached the end of the lane where it opened on a broad common and you seem rather to count more on my forbearance than you have room to do with safety we are now nearly free of the lane which has made us companions for this late half hour to avoid your farther company i will take the turn to the left upon that common and if you follow me it shall be at your peril observe i am well armed and you will fight at odds  not at odds returned the provoking stranger while i have my brown jennet with which i can ride round and round you at pleasure and this text of a handful in length showing a pistol which he drew from his bosom which discharges very convincing doctrine on the pressure of a forefinger and is apt to equalise all odds as you call them of youth and strength let there be no strife between us howeverthe moor lies before uschoose your path on iti take the other  i wish you good night sir said peveril to the stranger i ask your forgiveness if i have misconstrued you in anything but the times are perilous and a mans life may depend on the society in which he travels  true said the stranger but in your case the danger is already undergone and you should seek to counteract it you have travelled in my company long enough to devise a handsome branch of the popish plot how will you look when you see come forth in comely folio form the narrative of simon canter otherwise called richard ganlesse concerning the horrid popish conspiracy for the murder of the king and massacre of all protestants as given on oath to the honourable house of commons setting forth how far julian peveril younger of martindale castle is concerned in carrying on the same  how sir what mean you said peveril much startled  nay sir replied his companion do not interrupt my titlepage now that oates and bedloe have drawn the great prizes the subordinate discoverers get little but by the sale of their narrative and janeway newman simmons and every bookseller of them will tell you that the title is half the narrative mine shall therefore set forth the various schemes you have communicated to me of landing ten thousand soldiers from the isle of man upon the coast of lancashire and marching into wales to join the ten thousand pilgrims who are to be shipped from spain and so completing the destruction of the protestant religion and of the devoted city of london truly i think such a narrative well spiced with a few horrors and published cum privilegio parliamenti might though the market be somewhat overstocked be still worth some twenty or thirty pieces  you seem to know me sir said peveril and if so i think i may fairly ask you your purpose in thus bearing me company and the meaning of all this rhapsody if it be mere banter i can endure it within proper limit although it is uncivil on the part of a stranger if you have any farther purpose speak it out i am not to be trifled with  good now said the stranger laughing into what an unprofitable chafe you have put yourself an italian fuoruscito when he desires a parley with you takes aim from behind a wall with his long gun and prefaces his conference with posso tirare so does your manofwar fire a gun across the bows of a hansmogan indiaman just to bring her to and so do i show master julian peveril that if i were one of the honourable society of witnesses and informers with whom his imagination has associated me for these two hours past he is as much within my danger now as what he is ever likely to be then suddenly changing his tone to serious which was in general ironical he added young man when the pestilence is diffused through the air of a city it is in vain men would avoid the disease by seeking solitude and shunning the company of their fellowsufferers  in what then consists their safety said peveril willing to ascertain if possible the drift of his companions purpose  in following the counsels of wise physicians such was the strangers answer  and as such said peveril you offer me your advice  pardon me young man said the stranger haughtily i see no reason i should do soi am not he added in his former tone your feed physiciani offer no advicei only say it would be wise that you sought it  and from whom or where can i obtain it said peveril i wander in this country like one in a dream so much a few months have changed it men who formerly occupied themselves with their own affairs are now swallowed up in matters of state policy and those tremble under the apprehension of some strange and sudden convulsion of empire who were formerly only occupied by the fear of going to bed supperless and to sum up the matter i meet a stranger apparently well acquainted with my name and concerns who first attaches himself to me whether i will or no and then refuses me an explanation of his business while he menaces me with the strangest accusations  had i meant such infamy said the stranger believe me i had not given you the thread of my intrigue but be wise and come one with me there is hard by a small inn where if you can take a strangers warrant for it we shall sleep in perfect security  yet you yourself said peveril but now were anxious to avoid observation and in that case how can you protect me  pshaw i did but silence that tattling landlady in the way in which such people are most readily hushed and for topham and his brace of night owls they must hawk at other and lesser game than i should prove  peveril could not help admiring the easy and confident indifference with which the stranger seemed to assume a superiority to all the circumstances of danger around him and after hastily considering the matter with himself came to the resolution to keep company with him for this night at least and to learn if possible who he really was and to what party in the estate he was attached the boldness and freedom of his talk seemed almost inconsistent with his following the perilous though at that time the gainful trade of an informer no doubt such persons assumed every appearance which could insinuate them into the confidence of their destined victims but julian thought he discovered in this mans manner a wild and reckless frankness which he could not but connect with the idea of sincerity in the present case he therefore answered after a moments recollection i embrace your proposal sir although by doing so i am reposing a sudden and perhaps an unwary confidence  and what am i then reposing in you said the stranger is not our confidence mutual  no much the contrary i know nothing of you whateveryou have named me and knowing me to be julian peveril know you may travel with me in perfect security  the devil i do answered his companion i travel in the same security as with a lighted petard which i may expect to explode every moment are you not the son of peveril of the peak with whose name prelacy and popery are so closely allied that no old woman of either sex in derbyshire concludes her prayer without a petition to be freed from all three and do you not come from the popish countess of derby bringing for aught i know a whole army of manxmen in your pocket with full complement of arms ammunition baggage and a train of field artillery  it is not very likely i should be so poorly mounted said julian laughing if i had such a weight to carry but lead on sir i see i must wait for your confidence till you think proper to confer it for you are already so well acquainted with my affairs that i have nothing to offer you in exchange for it  allons then said his companion give your horse the spur and raise the curb rein lest he measure the ground with his nose instead of his paces we are not now more than a furlong or two from the place of entertainment  they mended their pace accordingly and soon arrived at the small solitary inn which the traveller had mentioned when its light began to twinkle before them the stranger as if recollecting something he had forgotten by the way you must have a name to pass by for it may be ill travelling under your own as the fellow who keeps this house is an old cromwellian what will you call yourselfmy name isfor the presentganlesse  there is no occasion to assume a name at all answered julian i do not incline to use a borrowed one especially as i may meet with some one who knows my own  i will call you julian then said master ganlesse for peveril will smell in the nostrils of mine host of idolatry conspiracy smithfield faggots fish on fridays the murder of sir edmondsbury godfrey and the fire of purgatory  as he spoke thus they alighted under the great broadbranched oak tree that served to canopy the alebench which at an earlier hour had groaned under the weight of a frequent conclave of rustic politicians ganlesse as he dismounted whistled in a particularly shrill note and was answered from within the house     chapter xxii             he was a fellow in a peasants garb            yet one could censure you a woodcocks carving            like any courtier at the ordinary                                                 the ordinary  the person who appeared at the door of the little inn to receive ganlesse as we mentioned in our last chapter sung as he came forward this scrap of an old ballad   good even to you diccon     and how have you sped   bring you the bonny bride     to banquet and bed  to which ganlesse answered in the same tone and tune   content thee kind robin     he need little care   who brings home a fat buck     instead of a hare  you have missed your blow then said the other in reply  i tell you i have not answered ganlesse but you will think of nought but your own thriving occupationmay the plague that belongs to it stick to it though it hath been the making of thee  a man must live diccon ganlesse said the other  well well said ganlesse bid my friend welcome for my sake hast thou got any supper  reeking like a sacrificechaubert has done his best that fellow is a treasure give him a farthing candle and he will cook a good supper out of itcome in sir my friends friend is welcome as we say in my country  we must have our horses looked to first said peveril who began to be considerably uncertain about the character of his companionsthat done i am for you  ganlesse gave a second whistle a groom appeared who took charge of both their horses and they themselves entered the inn  the ordinary room of a poor inn seemed to have undergone some alterations to render it fit for company of a higher description there were a beaufet a couch and one or two other pieces of furniture of a style inconsistent with the appearance of the place the tablecloth which was already laid was of the finest damask and the spoons forks c were of silver peveril looked at this apparatus with some surprise and again turning his eyes attentively upon his travelling companion ganlesse he could not help discovering by the aid of imagination perhaps that though insignificant in person plain in features and dressed like one in indigence there lurked still about his person and manners that indefinable ease of manner which belongs only to men of birth and quality or to those who are in the constant habit of frequenting the best company his companion whom he called will smith although tall and rather goodlooking besides being much better dressed had not nevertheless exactly the same ease of demeanour and was obliged to make up for the want by an additional proportion of assurance who these two persons could be peveril could not attempt even to form a guess there was nothing for it but to watch their manner and conversation  after speaking a moment in whispers smith said to his companion we must go look after our nags for ten minutes and allow chaubert to do his office  will not he appear and minister before us then said ganlesse  what hehe shift a trencherhe hand a cupno you forget whom you speak of such an order were enough to make him fall on his own swordhe is already on the borders of despair because no crawfish are to be had  alacka day replied ganlesse heaven forbid i should add to such a calamity to stable then and see we how our steeds eat their provender while ours is getting ready  they adjourned to the stable accordingly which though a poor one had been hastily supplied with whatever was necessary for the accommodation of four excellent horses one of which that from which ganlesse was just dismounted the groom we have mentioned was cleaning and dressing by the light of a huge waxcandle  i am still so far catholic said ganlesse laughing as he saw that peveril noticed this piece of extravagance my horse is my saint and i dedicate a candle to him  without asking so great a favour for mine which i see standing behind yonder old hencoop replied peveril i will at least relieve him of his saddle and bridle  leave him to the lad of the inn said smith he is not worthy of any other persons handling and i promise you if you slip a single buckle you will so flavour of that stable duty that you might as well eat roastbeef as ragouts for any relish you will have of them  i love roastbeef as well as ragouts at any time said peveril adjusting himself to a task which every young man should know how to perform when need is and my horse though it be but a sorry jade will champ better on hay and corn than on an iron bit  while he was unsaddling his horse and shaking down some litter for the poor wearied animal he heard smith observe to ganlesseby my faith dick thou hast fallen into poor slenders blunder missed anne page and brought us a great lubberly postmasters boy  hush he will hear thee answered ganlesse there are reasons for all thingsit is well as it is but prithee tell thy fellow to help the youngster  what replied smith dye think i am madask tom beacontom of newmarkettom of ten thousand to touch such a fourlegged brute as thatwhy he would turn me away on the spotdiscard me ifaith it was all he would do to take in hand your own my good friend and if you consider him not the better you are like to stand groom to him yourself tomorrow  well will answered ganlesse i will say that for thee thou hast a set of the most useless scoundrelly insolent vermin about thee that ever ate up a poor gentlemans revenues  useless i deny it replied smith every one of my fellows does something or other so exquisitely that it were sin to make him do anything elseit is your jacksofalltrades who are masters of nonebut hark to chauberts signal the coxcomb is twangling it on the lute to the tune of eveillezvous belle endormiecome master what dye call addressing peverilget ye some water and wash this filthy witness from your hand as betterton says in the play for chauberts cookery is like friar bacons headtime istime wastime will soon be no more  so saying and scarce allowing julian time to dip his hands in a bucket and dry them on a horsecloth he hurried him from the stable back to the supperchamber  here all was prepared for their meal with an epicurean delicacy which rather belonged to the saloon of a palace than the cabin in which it was displayed four dishes of silver with covers of the same metal smoked on the table and three seats were placed for the company beside the lower end of the board was a small sidetable to answer the purpose of what is now called a dumb waiter on which several flasks reared their tall stately and swanlike crests above glasses and rummers clean covers were also placed within reach and a small travellingcase of morocco hooped with silver displayed a number of bottles containing the most approved sauces that culinary ingenuity had then invented  smith who occupied the lower seat and seemed to act as president of the feast motioned the two travellers to take their places and begin i would not stay a gracetime he said to save a whole nation from perdition we could bring no chauffettes with any convenience and even chaubert is nothing unless his dishes are tasted in the very moment of projection come uncover and let us see what he has done for ushumhaaysquabpigeonswildfowlyoung chickensvenison cutletsand a space in the centre wet alas by a gentle tear from chauberts eye where should have been the soupe aux écrevisses the zeal of that poor fellow is ill repaid by his paltry ten louis per month  a mere trifle said ganlesse but like yourself will he serves a generous master  the repast now commenced and julian though he had seen his young friend the earl of derby and other gallants affect a considerable degree of interest and skill in the science of the kitchen and was not himself either an enemy or a stranger to the pleasures of a good table found that on the present occasion he was a mere novice both his companions but smith in especial seemed to consider that they were now engaged in the only true business of life and weighed all its minutiæ with a proportional degree of accuracy to carve the morsel in the most delicate mannerand to apportion the proper seasoning with the accuracy of the chemistto be aware exactly of the order in which one dish should succeed another and to do plentiful justice to allwas a minuteness of science to which julian had hitherto been a stranger smith accordingly treated him as a mere novice in epicurism cautioning him to eat his soup before the bouilli and to forget the manx custom of bolting the boiled meat before the broth as if cutlar macculloch and all his whingers were at the door peveril took the hint in good part and the entertainment proceeded with animation  at length ganlesse paused and declared the supper exquisite but my friend smith he added are your wines curious when you brought all that trash of plates and trumpery into derbyshire i hope you did not leave us at the mercy of the strong ale of the shire as thick and muddy as the squires who drink it  did i not know that you were to meet me dick ganlesse answered their host and can you suspect me of such an omission it is true you must make champagne and claret serve for my burgundy would not bear travelling but if you have a fancy for sherry or vin de cahors i have a notion chaubert and tom beacon have brought some for their own drinking  perhaps the gentlemen would not care to impart said ganlesse  oh fieanything in the way of civility replied smith they are in truth the bestnatured lads alive when treated respectfully so that if you would prefer  by no means said ganlessea glass of champagne will serve in a scarcity of better   the cork shall start obsequious to my thumb  said smith and as he spoke he untwisted the wire and the cork struck the roof of the cabin each guest took a large rummer glass of the sparkling beverage which peveril had judgment and experience enough to pronounce exquisite  give me your hand sir said smith it is the first word of sense you have spoken this evening  wisdom sir replied peveril is like the best ware in the pedlars pack which he never produces till he knows his customer  sharp as mustard returned the bon vivant but be wise most noble pedlar and take another rummer of this same flask which you see i have held in an oblique position for your servicenot permitting it to retrograde to the perpendicular nay take it off before the bubble bursts on the rim and the zest is gone  you do me honour sir said peveril taking the second glass i wish you a better office than that of my cupbearer  you cannot wish will smith one more congenial to his nature said ganlesse others have a selfish delight in the objects of sense will thrives and is happy by imparting them to his friends  better help men to pleasures than to pains master ganlesse answered smith somewhat angrily  nay wrath thee not will said ganlesse and speak no words in haste lest you may have cause to repent at leisure do i blame thy social concern for the pleasures of others why man thou dost therein most philosophically multiply thine own a man has but one throat and can but eat with his best efforts some five or six times a day but thou dinest with every friend that cuts a capon and art quaffing wine in other mens gullets from morning to nightet sic de cæteris  friend ganlesse returned smith i prithee bewarethou knowest i can cut gullets as well as tickle them  ay will answered ganlesse carelessly i think i have seen thee wave thy whinyard at the throat of a hoganmogana netherlandish weasand which expanded only on thy natural and mortal objects of aversiondutch cheese ryebread pickled herring onion and geneva  for pitys sake forbear the description said smith thy words overpower the perfumes and flavour the apartment like a dish of salmagundi  but for an epiglottis like mine continued ganlesse down which the most delicate morsels are washed by such claret as thou art now pouring out thou couldst not in thy bitterest mood wish a worse fate than to be necklaced somewhat tight by a pair of white arms  by a tenpenny cord answered smith but not till you were dead that thereafter you be presently embowelled you being yet alive that your head be then severed from your body and your body divided into quarters to be disposed of at his majestys pleasurehow like you that master richard ganlesse  een as you like the thoughts of dining on branbread and milkporridgean extremity which you trust never to be reduced to but all this shall not prevent me from pledging you in a cup of sound claret  as the claret circulated the glee of the company increased and smith placing the dishes which had been made use of upon the sidetable stamped with his foot on the floor and the table sinking down a trap again rose loaded with olives sliced neats tongue caviare and other provocatives for the circulation of the bottle  why will said ganlesse thou art a more complete mechanist than i suspected thou hast brought thy sceneshifting inventions to derbyshire in marvellously short time  a rope and pullies can be easily come by answered will and with a saw and a plane i can manage that business in half a day i love the knack of clean and secret conveyancethou knowest it was the foundation of my fortunes  it may be the wreck of them too will replied his friend  true diccon answered will but dum vivimus vivamusthat is my motto and therewith i present you a brimmer to the health of the fair lady you wot of  let it come will replied his friend and the flask circulated briskly from hand to hand  julian did not think it prudent to seem a check on their festivity as he hoped in its progress something might occur to enable him to judge of the character and purposes of his companions but he watched them in vain their conversation was animated and lively and often bore reference to the literature of the period in which the elder seemed particularly well skilled they also talked freely of the court and of that numerous class of gallants who were then described as men of wit and pleasure about town and to which it seemed probable they themselves appertained  at length the universal topic of the popish plot was started upon which ganlesse and smith seemed to entertain the most opposite opinions ganlesse if he did not maintain the authority of oates in its utmost extent contended that at least it was confirmed in a great measure by the murder of sir edmondsbury godfrey and the letters written by coleman to the confessor of the french king  with much more noise and less power of reasoning will smith hesitated not to ridicule and run down the whole discovery as one of the wildest and most causeless alarms which had ever been sounded in the ears of a credulous public i shall never forget he said sir godfreys most original funeral two bouncing parsons well armed with sword and pistol mounted the pulpit to secure the third fellow who preached from being murdered in the face of the congregation three parsons in one pulpitthree suns in one hemisphereno wonder men stood aghast at such a prodigy  what then will answered his companion you are one of those who think the good knight murdered himself in order to give credit to the plot  by my faith not i said the other but some true blue protestant might do the job for him in order to give the thing a better colouri will be judged by our silent friend whether that be not the most feasible solution of the whole  i pray you pardon me gentlemen said julian i am but just landed in england and am a stranger to the particular circumstances which have thrown the nation into such a ferment it would be the highest degree of assurance in me to give my opinion betwixt gentlemen who argue the matter so ably besides to say truth i confess wearinessyour wine is more potent than i expected or i have drunk more of it than i meant to do  nay if an hours nap will refresh you said the elder of the strangers make no ceremony with us your bedall we can offer as suchis that oldfashioned dutchbuilt sofa as the last new phrase calls it we shall be early stirrers tomorrow morning  and that we may be so said smith i propose that we do sit up all this nighti hate lying rough and detest a palletbed so have at another flask and the newest lampoon to help it out   now a plague of their votes   upon papists and plots   and be dd doctor oates                   tol de rol  nay but our puritanic host said ganlesse  i have him in my pocket manhis eyes ears nose and tongue answered his boon companion are all in my possession  in that case when you give him back his eyes and nose i pray you keep his ears and tongue answered ganlesse seeing and smelling are organs sufficient for such a knaveto hear and tell are things he should have no manner of pretensions to  i grant you it were well done answered smith but it were a robbing of the hangman and the pillory and i am an honest fellow who would give dun and the devil his due so   all joy to great cæsar   long life love and pleasure   may the king live for ever                   tis no matter for us boys   dun was the hangman of the day at tyburn he was successor of     gregory brunden who was by many believed to be the same who     dropped the axe upon charles i though others were suspected of     being the actual regicide  while this bacchanalian scene proceeded julian had wrapt himself closely in his cloak and stretched himself on the couch which they had shown him he looked towards the table he had leftthe tapers seemed to become hazy and dim as he gazedhe heard the sound of voices but they ceased to convey any impression to his understanding and in a few minutes he was faster asleep than he had ever been in the whole course of his life     chapter xxiii                   the gordon then his bugle blew                    and said awa awa                  the house of rhodes is all on flame                    i hauld it time to ga                                            old ballad  when julian awaked the next morning all was still and vacant in the apartment the rising sun which shone through the halfclosed shutters showed some relics of the last nights banquet which his confused and throbbing head assured him had been carried into a debauch  without being much of a boon companion julian like other young men of the time was not in the habit of shunning wine which was then used in considerable quantities and he could not help being surprised that the few cups he had drunk over night had produced on his frame the effects of excess he rose up adjusted his dress and sought in the apartment for water to perform his morning ablutions but without success wine there was on the table and beside it one stool stood and another lay as if thrown down in the heedless riot of the evening surely he thought to himself the wine must have been very powerful which rendered me insensible to the noise my companions must have made ere they finished their carouse  with momentary suspicion he examined his weapons and the packet which he had received from the countess and kept in a secret pocket of his upper coat bound close about his person all was safe and the very operation reminded him of the duties which lay before him he left the apartment where they had supped and went into another wretched enough where in a trucklebed were stretched two bodies covered with a rug the heads belonging to which were amicably deposited upon the same truss of hay the one was the black shockhead of the groom the other graced with a long thrum nightcap showed a grizzled pate and a grave caricatured countenance which the hooknose and lanternjaws proclaimed to belong to the gallic minister of good cheer whose praises he had heard sung forth on the preceding evening these worthies seemed to have slumbered in the arms of bacchus as well as of morpheus for there were broken flasks on the floor and their deep snoring alone showed that they were alive  bent upon resuming his journey as duty and expedience alike dictated julian next descended the trapstair and essayed a door at the bottom of the steps it was fastened within he calledno answer was returned it must be he thought the apartment of the revellers now probably sleeping as soundly as their dependants still slumbered and as he himself had done a few minutes before should he awake themto what purpose they were men with whom accident had involved him against his own will and situated as he was he thought it wise to take the earliest opportunity of breaking off from society which was suspicious and might be perilous ruminating thus he essayed another door which admitted him to a bedroom where lay another harmonious slumberer the mean utensils pewter measures empty cans and casks with which this room was lumbered proclaimed it that of the host who slept surrounded by his professional implements of hospitality and stockintrade  this discovery relieved peveril from some delicate embarrassment which he had formerly entertained he put upon the table a piece of money sufficient as he judged to pay his share of the preceding nights reckoning not caring to be indebted for his entertainment to the strangers whom he was leaving without the formality of an adieu  his conscience cleared of this gentlemanlike scruple peveril proceeded with a light heart though somewhat a dizzy head to the stable which he easily recognised among a few other paltry outhouses his horse refreshed with rest and perhaps not unmindful of his services the evening before neighed as his master entered the stable and peveril accepted the sound as an omen of a prosperous journey he paid the augury with a sieveful of corn and while his palfrey profited by his attention walked into the fresh air to cool his heated blood and consider what course he should pursue in order to reach the castle of martindale before sunset his acquaintance with the country in general gave him confidence that he could not have greatly deviated from the nearest road and with his horse in good condition he conceived he might easily reach martindale before nightfall  having adjusted his route in his mind he returned into the stable to prepare his steed for the journey and soon led him into the ruinous courtyard of the inn bridled saddled and ready to be mounted but as peverils hand was upon the mane and his left foot in the stirrup a hand touched his cloak and the voice of ganlesse said what master peveril is this your foreign breeding or have you learned in france to take french leave of your friends  julian started like a guilty thing although a moments reflection assured him that he was neither wrong nor in danger i cared not to disturb you he said although i did come as far as the door of your chamber i supposed your friend and you might require after our last nights revel rather sleep than ceremony i left my own bed though a rough one with more reluctance than usual and as my occasions oblige me to be an early traveller i thought it best to depart without leavetaking i have left a token for mine host on the table of his apartment  it was unnecessary said ganlesse the rascal is already overpaidbut are you not rather premature in your purpose of departing my mind tells me that master julian peveril had better proceed with me to london than turn aside for any purpose whatever you may see already that i am no ordinary person but a masterspirit of the time for the cuckoo i travel with and whom i indulge in his prodigal follies he also has his uses but you are a different cast and i not only would serve you but even wish you to be my own  julian gazed on this singular person when he spoke we have already said his figure was mean and slight with very ordinary and unmarked features unless we were to distinguish the lightnings of a keen grey eye which corresponded in its careless and prideful glance with the haughty superiority which the stranger assumed in his conversation it was not till after a momentary pause that julian replied can you wonder sir that in my circumstancesif they are indeed known to you so well as they seemi should decline unnecessary confidence on the affairs of moment which have called me hither or refuse the company of a stranger who assigns no reason for desiring mine  be it as you list young man answered ganlesse only remember hereafter you had a fair offerit is not every one to whom i would have made it if we should meet hereafter on other and on worse terms impute it to yourself and not to me  i understand not your threat answered peveril if a threat be indeed implied i have done no evili feel no apprehensionand i cannot in common sense conceive why i should suffer for refusing my confidence to a stranger who seems to require that i should submit me blindfold to his guidance  farewell then sir julian of the peakthat may soon be said the stranger removing the hand which he had as yet left carelessly on the horses bridle  how mean you by that phrase said julian and why apply such a title to me  the stranger smiled and only answered here our conference ends the way is before you you will find it longer and rougher than that by which i would have guided you  so saying ganlesse turned his back and walked toward the house on the threshold he turned about once more and seeing that peveril had not yet moved from the spot he again smiled and beckoned to him but julian recalled by that sign to recollection spurred his horse and set forward on his journey  it was not long ere his local acquaintance with the country enabled him to regain the road to martindale from which he had diverged on the preceding evening for about two miles but the roads or rather the paths of this wild country so much satirised by their native poet cotton were so complicated in some places so difficult to be traced in others and so unfit for hasty travelling in almost all that in spite of julians utmost exertions and though he made no longer delay upon the journey than was necessary to bait his horse at a small hamlet through which he passed at noon it was nightfall ere he reached an eminence from which an hour sooner the battlements of martindale castle would have been visible and where when they were hid in night their situation was indicated by a light constantly maintained in a lofty tower called the warders turret and which domestic beacon had acquired through all the neighbourhood the name of peverils polestar  this was regularly kindled at curfew toll and supplied with as much wood and charcoal as maintained the light till sunrise and at no period was the ceremonial omitted saving during the space intervening between the death of a lord of the castle and his interment when this last event had taken place the nightly beacon was rekindled with some ceremony and continued till fate called the successor to sleep with his fathers it is not known from which circumstance the practice of maintaining this light originally sprung tradition spoke of it doubtfully some thought it was the signal of general hospitality which in ancient times guided the wandering knight or the weary pilgrim to rest and refreshment others spoke of it as a lovelighted watchfire by which the provident anxiety of a former lady of martindale guided her husband homeward through the terrors of a midnight storm the less favourable construction of unfriendly neighbours of the dissenting persuasion ascribed the origin and continuance of this practice to the assuming pride of the family of peveril who thereby chose to intimate their ancient suzerainté over the whole country in the manner of the admiral who carries the lantern in the poop for the guidance of the fleet and in the former times our old friend master solsgrace dealt from the pulpit many a hard hit against sir geoffrey as he that had raised his horn and set up his candlestick on high certain it is that all the peverils from father to son had been especially attentive to the maintenance of this custom as something intimately connected with the dignity of their family and in the hands of sir geoffrey the observance was not likely to be omitted  accordingly the polarstar of peveril had continued to beam more or less brightly during all the vicissitudes of the civil war and glimmered however faintly during the subsequent period of sir geoffreys depression but he was often heard to say and sometimes to swear that while there was a perch of woodland left to the estate the old beacongrate should not lack replenishing all this his son julian well knew and therefore it was with no ordinary feelings of surprise and anxiety that looking in the direction of the castle he perceived that the light was not visible he haltedrubbed his eyesshifted his positionand endeavoured in vain to persuade himself that he had mistaken the point from which the polarstar of his house was visible or that some newly intervening obstacle the growth of a plantation perhaps or the erection of some building intercepted the light of the beacon but a moments reflection assured him that from the high and free situation which martindale castle bore in reference to the surrounding country this could not have taken place and the inference necessarily forced itself upon his mind that sir geoffrey his father was either deceased or that the family must have been disturbed by some strange calamity under the pressure of which their wonted custom and solemn usage had been neglected  under the influence of undefinable apprehension young peveril now struck the spurs into his jaded steed and forcing him down the broken and steep path at a pace which set safety at defiance he arrived at the village of martindalemoultrassie eagerly desirous to ascertain the cause of this ominous eclipse the street through which his tired horse paced slow and reluctantly was now deserted and empty and scarcely a candle twinkled from a casement except from the latticed window of the little inn called the peveril arms from which a broad light shone and several voices were heard in rude festivity  before the door of this inn the jaded palfrey guided by the instinct or experience which makes a hackney well acquainted with the outside of a house of entertainment made so sudden and determined a pause that notwithstanding his haste the rider thought it best to dismount expecting to be readily supplied with a fresh horse by roger raine the landlord the ancient dependant of his family he also wished to relive his anxiety by inquiring concerning the state of things at the castle when he was surprised to hear bursting from the taproom of the loyal old host a wellknown song of the commonwealth time which some puritanical wag had written in reprehension of the cavaliers and their dissolute courses and in which his father came in for a lash of the satirist   ye thought in the world there was no power to tame ye   so you tippled and drabbd till the saints overcame ye   forsooth and neer stir sir have vanquishd g dn me                                       which nobody can deny    there was bluff old sir geoffrey loved brandy and mum well   and to see a beerglass turned over the thumb well   but he fled like the wind before fairfax and cromwell                                       which nobody can deny  some strange revolution julian was aware must have taken place both in the village and in the castle ere these sounds of unseemly insult could have been poured forth in the very inn which was decorated with the armorial bearings of his family and not knowing how far it might be advisable to intrude on these unfriendly revellers without the power of repelling or chastising their insolence he led his horse to a backdoor which as he recollected communicated with the landlords apartment having determined to make private inquiry of him concerning the state of matters at the castle he knocked repeatedly and as often called on roger raine with an earnest but stifled voice at length a female voice replied by the usual inquiry who is there  it is i dame rainei julian peveriltell your husband to come to me presently  alack and a welladay master julian if it be really youyou are to know my poor goodman has gone where he can come to no one but doubtless we shall all go to him as matthew chamberlain says  he is dead then said julian i am extremely sorry  dead six months and more master julian and let me tell you it is a long time for a lone woman as matt chamberlain says  well do you or your chamberlain undo the door i want a fresh horse and i want to know how things are at the castle  the castlelackadaychamberlainmatthew chamberlaini say matt  matt chamberlain apparently was at no great distance for he presently answered her call and peveril as he stood close to the door could hear them whispering to each other and distinguish in a great measure what they said and here it may be noticed that dame raine accustomed to submit to the authority of old roger who vindicated as well the husbands domestic prerogative as that of the monarch in the state had when left a buxom widow been so far incommoded by the exercise of her newly acquired independence that she had recourse upon all occasions to the advice of matt chamberlain and as matt began no longer to go slipshod and in a red nightcap but wore spanish shoes and a highcrowned beaver at least of a sunday and moreover was called master matthew by his fellowservants the neighbours in the village argued a speedy change of the name of the signpost nay perhaps of the very sign itself for matthew was a bit of a puritan and no friend to peveril of the peak  now counsel me an you be a man matt chamberlain said widow raine for never stir if here be not master julians own self and he wants a horse and what not and all as if things were as they wont to be  why dame an ye will walk by my counsel said the chamberlain een shake him offlet him be jogging while his boots are green this is no world for folks to scald their fingers in other folks broth  and that is well spoken truly answered dame raine but then look you matt we have eaten their bread and as my poor goodman used to say  nay nay dame they that walk by the counsel of the dead shall have none of the living and so you may do as you list but if you will walk by mine drop latch and draw bolt and bid him seek quarters fartherthat is my counsel  i desire nothing of you sirrah said peveril save but to know how sir geoffrey and his lady do  lackadaylackaday in a tone of sympathy was the only answer he received from the landlady and the conversation betwixt her and her chamberlain was resumed but in a tone too low to be overheard  at length matt chamberlain spoke aloud and with a tone of authority we undo no doors at this time of night for it is against the justices orders and might cost us our licence and for the castle the road up to it lies before you and i think you know it as well as we do  and i know you said peveril remounting his wearied horse for an ungrateful churl whom on the first opportunity i will assuredly cudgel to a mummy  to this menace matthew made no reply and peveril presently heard him leave the apartment after a few earnest words betwixt him and his mistress  impatient at this delay and at the evil omen implied in these peoples conversation and deportment peveril after some vain spurring of his horse which positively refused to move a step farther dismounted once more and was about to pursue his journey on foot notwithstanding the extreme disadvantage under which the high ridingboots of the period laid those who attempted to walk with such encumbrances when he was stopped by a gentle call from the window  her counsellor was no sooner gone than the goodnature and habitual veneration of the dame for the house of peveril and perhaps some fear for her counsellors bones induced her to open the casement and cry but in a low and timid tone hist hist master julianbe you gone  not yet dame said julian though it seems my stay is unwelcome  nay but good young master it is because men counsel so differently for here was my poor old roger raine would have thought the chimney corner too cold for you and here is matt chamberlain thinks the cold courtyard is warm enough  never mind that dame said julian do but only tell me what has happened at martindale castle i see the beacon is extinguished  is it in trothay like enoughthen good sir geoffrey has gone to heaven with my old roger raine  sacred heaven exclaimed peveril when was my father taken ill  never as i knows of said the dame but about three hours since arrived a party at the castle with buffcoats and bandoleers and one of the parliaments folks like in olivers time my old roger raine would have shut the gates of the inn against them but he is in the churchyard and matt says it is against law and so they came in and refreshed men and horses and sent for master bridgenorth that is at moultrassie hall even now and so they went up to the castle and there was a fray it is like as the old knight was no man to take napping as poor roger raine used to say always the officers had the best ont and reason there is since they had the law of their side as our matthew says but since the polestar of the castle is out as your honour says why doubtless the old gentleman is dead  gracious heavendear dame for love or gold let me have a horse to make for the castle  the castle said the dame the roundheads as my poor roger called them will kill you as they have killed your father better creep into the woodhouse and i will send bett with a blanket and some supperor staymy old dobbin stands in the little stable beside the hencoopeen take him and make the best of your way out of the country for there is no safety here for you hear what songs some of them are singing at the tapso take dobbin and do not forget to leave your own horse instead  peveril waited to hear no farther only that just as he turned to go off to the stable the compassionate female was heard to exclaimo lord what will matthew chamberlain say but instantly added let him say what he will i may dispose of whats my own  with the haste of a doublefeed hostler did julian exchange the equipments of his jaded brute with poor dobbin who stood quietly tugging at his rackful of hay without dreaming of the business which was that night destined for him notwithstanding the darkness of the place julian succeeded marvellous quickly in preparing for his journey and leaving his own horse to find its way to dobbins rack by instinct he leaped upon his new acquisition and spurred him sharply against the hill which rises steeply from the village to the castle dobbin little accustomed to such exertions snorted panted and trotted as briskly as he could until at length he brought his rider before the entrancegate of his fathers ancient seat  the moon was now rising but the portal was hidden from its beams being situated as we have mentioned elsewhere in a deep recess betwixt two large flanking towers peveril dismounted turned his horse loose and advanced to the gate which contrary to his expectation he found open he entered the large courtyard and could then perceive that lights yet twinkled in the lower part of the building although he had not before observed them owing to the height of the outward walls the main door or great hallgate as it was called was since the partially decayed state of the family seldom opened save on occasions of particular ceremony a smaller postern door served the purpose of ordinary entrance and to that julian now repaired this also was opena circumstance which would of itself have alarmed him had he not already had so many causes for apprehension his heart sunk within him as he turned to the left through a small outward hall towards the great parlour which the family usually occupied as a sitting apartment and his alarm became still greater when on a nearer approach he heard proceeding from thence the murmur of several voices he threw the door of the apartment wide and the sight which was thus displayed warranted all the evil bodings which he had entertained  in front of him stood the old knight whose arms were strongly secured over the elbows by a leathern belt drawn tight round them and made fast behind two ruffianlylooking men apparently his guards had hold of his doublet the scabbardless sword which lay on the floor and the empty sheath which hung by sir geoffreys side showed the stout old cavalier had not been reduced to this state of bondage without an attempt at resistance two or three persons having their backs turned towards julian sat round a table and appeared engaged in writingthe voices which he had heard were theirs as they murmured to each other lady peverilthe emblem of death so pallid was her countenancestood at the distance of a yard or two from her husband upon whom her eyes were fixed with an intenseness of gaze like that of one who looks her last on the object which she loves the best she was the first to perceive julian and she exclaimed merciful heavenmy sonthe misery of our house is complete  my son echoed sir geoffrey starting from the sullen state of dejection and swearing a deep oaththou art come in the right time julian strike me one good blowcleave me that traitorous thief from the crown to the brisket and that done i care not what comes next  the sight of his fathers situation made the son forget the inequality of the contest which he was about to provoke  villains he said unhand him and rushing on the guards with his drawn sword compelled them to let go sir geoffrey and stand on their own defence  sir geoffrey thus far liberated shouted to his lady undo the belt dame and we will have three good blows for it yetthey must fight well that beat both father and son  but one of those men who had started up from the writingtable when the fray commenced prevented lady peveril from rendering her husband this assistance while another easily mastered the hampered knight though not without receiving several severe kicks from his heavy bootshis condition permitting him no other mode of defence a third who saw that julian young active and animated with the fury of a son who fights for his parents was compelling the two guards to give ground seized on his collar and attempted to master his sword suddenly dropping that weapon and snatching one of his pistols julian fired it at the head of the person by whom he was thus assailed he did not drop but staggering back as if he had received a severe blow showed peveril as he sunk into a chair the features of old bridgenorth blackened with the explosion which had even set fire to a part of his grey hair a cry of astonishment escaped from julian and in the alarm and horror of the moment he was easily secured and disarmed by those with whom he had been at first engaged  heed it not julian said sir geoffrey heed it not my brave boythat shot has balanced all accountsbut howwhat the devilhe liveswas your pistol loaded with chaff or has the foul fiend given him proof against lead  there was some reason for sir geoffreys surprise since as he spoke major bridgenorth collected himselfsat up in the chair as one who recovers from a stunning blowthen rose and wiping with his handkerchief the marks of the explosion from his face he approached julian and said in the same cold unaltered tone in which he usually expressed himself young man you have reason to bless god who has this day saved you from the commission of a great crime  bless the devil ye cropeared knave exclaimed sir geoffrey for nothing less than the father of all fanatics saved your brains from being blown about like the rinsings of beelzebubs porridge pot  sir geoffrey said major bridgenorth i have already told you that with you i will hold no argument for to you i am not accountable for any of my actions  master bridgenorth said the lady making a strong effort to speak and to speak with calmness whatever revenge your christian state of conscience may permit you to take on my husbandii who have some right to experience compassion at your hand for most sincerely did i compassionate you when the hand of heaven was heavy on youi implore you not to involve my son in our common ruinlet the destruction of the father and mother with the ruin of our ancient house satisfy your resentment for any wrong which you have ever received at my husbands hand  hold your peace housewife said the knight you speak like a fool and meddle with what concerns you notwrong at my hand the cowardly knave has ever had but even too much right had i cudgelled the cur soundly when he first bayed at me the cowardly mongrel had been now crouching at my feet instead of flying at my throat but if i get through this action as i have got through worse weather i will pay off old scores as far as tough crabtree and cold iron will bear me out  sir geoffrey replied bridgenorth if the birth you boast of has made you blind to better principles it might have at least taught you civility what do you complain of i am a magistrate and i execute a warrant addressed to me by the first authority in that state i am a creditor also of yours and law arms me with powers to recover my own property from the hands of an improvident debtor  you a magistrate said the knight much such a magistrate as noll was a monarch your heart is up i warrant because you have the kings pardon and are replaced on the bench forsooth to persecute the poor papist there was never turmoil in the state but knaves had their vantage by itnever pot boiled but the scum was cast uppermost  for gods sake my dearest husband said lady peveril cease this wild talk it can but incense master bridgenorth who might otherwise consider that in common charity  incense him said sir geoffrey impatiently interrupting her godsdeath madam you will drive me mad have you lived so long in this world and yet expect consideration and charity from an old starved wolf like that and if he had it do you think that i or you madam as my wife are subjects for his charityjulian my poor fellow i am sorry thou hast come so unluckily since thy petronel was not better loadedbut thy credit is lost for ever as a marksman  this angry colloquy passed so rapidly on all sides that julian scarce recovered from the extremity of astonishment with which he was overwhelmed at finding himself suddenly plunged into a situation of such extremity had no time to consider in what way he could most effectually act for the succour of his parents to speak to bridgenorth fair seemed the more prudent course but to this his pride could hardly stoop yet he forced himself to say with as much calmness as he could assume  master bridgenorth since you act as a magistrate i desire to be treated according to the laws of england and demand to know of what we are accused and by whose authority we are arrested  here is another howlet for ye exclaimed the impetuous old knight his mother speaks to a puritan of charity and thou must talk of law to a roundheaded rebel with a wannion to you what warrant hath he think ye beyond the parliaments or the devils  who speaks of the parliament said a person entering whom peveril recognised as the official person whom he had before seen at the horsedealers and who now bustled in with all the conscious dignity of plenary authoritywho talks of the parliament he exclaimed i promise you enough has been found in this house to convict twenty plottershere be arms and that good store bring them in captain  the very same exclaimed the captain approaching which i mention in my printed narrative of information lodged before the honourable house of commons they were commissioned from old vander huys of rotterdam by orders of don john of austria for the service of the jesuits  now by this light said sir geoffrey they are the pikes musketoons and pistols that have been hidden in the garret ever since naseby fight  and here said the captains yokefellow everett are proper priests trappingsantiphoners and missals and copes i warrant youay and proper pictures too for papists to mutter and bow over  now plague on thy snuffling whine said sir geoffrey here is a rascal will swear my grandmothers old farthingale to be priests vestments and the story book of owlenspiegel a popish missal  but hows this master bridgenorth said topham addressing the magistrate your honour has been as busy as we have and you have caught another knave while we recovered these toys  i think sir said julian if you look into your warrant which if i mistake not names the persons whom you are directed to arrest you will find you have not title to apprehend me  sir said the officer puffing with importance i do not know who you are but i would you were the best man in england that i might teach you the respect due to the warrant of the house sir there steps not the man within the british seas but i will arrest him on authority of this bit of parchment and i do arrest you accordinglywhat do you accuse him of gentlemen  dangerfield swaggered forward and peeping under julians hat stop my vital breath he exclaimed but i have seen you before my friend an i could but think where but my memory is not worth a bean since i have been obliged to use it so much of late in the behalf of the poor state but i do know the fellow and i have seen him amongst the papists ill take that on my assured damnation  why captain dangerfield said the captains smoother but more dangerous associateverily it is the same youth whom we saw at the horsemerchants yesterday and we had matter against him then only master topham did not desire us to bring it out  ye may bring out what ye will against him now said topham for he hath blasphemed the warrant of the house i think ye said ye saw him somewhere  ay verily said everett i have seen him amongst the seminary pupils at saint omershe was who but he with the regents there  nay master everett collect yourself said topham for as i think you said you saw him at a consult of the jesuits in london  it was i said so master topham said the undaunted dangerfield and mine is the tongue that will swear it  good master topham said bridgenorth you may suspend farther inquiry at present as it doth but fatigue and perplex the memory of the kings witnesses  you are wrong master bridgenorthclearly wrong it doth but keep them in windonly breathes them like greyhounds before a coursing match  be it so said bridgenorth with his usual indifference of manner but at present this youth must stand committed upon a warrant which i will presently sign of having assaulted me while in discharge of my duty as a magistrate for the rescue of a person legally attached did you not hear the report of a pistol  i will swear to it said everett  and i said dangerfield while we were making search in the cellar i heard something very like a pistolshot but i conceived it to be the drawing of a longcorked bottle of sack to see whether there were any popish relics in the inside ont  a pistolshot exclaimed topham here might have been a second sir edmondsbury godfreys matteroh thou real spawn of the red old dragon for he too would have resisted the houses warrant had we not taken him something at unawaresmaster bridgenorth you are a judicious magistrate and a worthy servant of the statei would we had many such sound protestant justices shall i have this young fellow away with his parentswhat think youor will you keep him for reexamination  master bridgenorth said lady peveril in spite of her husbands efforts to interrupt her for gods sake if ever you knew what it was to love one of the many children you have lost or her who is now left to you do not pursue your vengeance to the blood of my poor boy i will forgive you all the restall the distress you have wroughtall the yet greater misery with which you threaten us but do not be extreme with one who never can have offended you believe that if your ears are shut against the cry of a despairing mother those which are open to the complaint of all who sorrow will hear my petition and your answer  the agony of mind and of voice with which lady peveril uttered these words seemed to thrill through all present though most of them were but too much inured to such scenes every one was silent when ceasing to speak she fixed on bridgenorth her eyes glistening with tears with the eager anxiety of one whose life or death seemed to depend upon the answer to be returned even bridgenorths inflexibility seemed to be shaken and his voice was tremulous as he answered madam i would to god i had the present means of relieving your great distress otherwise than by recommending to you a reliance upon providence and that you take heed to your spirit that it murmur not under this crook in your lot for me i am but as a rod in the hand of the strong man which smites not of itself but because it is wielded by the arm of him who holds the same  even as i and my black rod are guided by the commons of england said master topham who seemed marvellously pleased with the illustration  julian now thought it time to say something in his own behalf and he endeavoured to temper it with as much composure as it was possible for him to assume master bridgenorth he said i neither dispute your authority nor this gentlemans warrant  you do not said topham oh ho master youngster i thought we should bring you to your senses presently  then if you so will it master topham said bridgenorth thus it shall be you shall set out with early day taking you towards london the persons of sir geoffrey and lady peveril and that they may travel according to their quality you will allow them their coach sufficiently guarded  i will travel with them myself said topham for these rough derbyshire roads are no easy riding and my very eyes are weary with looking on these bleak hills in the coach i can sleep as sound as if i were in the house and master bodderbrains on his legs  it will become you so to take your ease master topham answered bridgenorth for this youth i will take him under my charge and bring him up myself  i may not be answerable for that worthy master bridgenorth said topham since he comes within the warrant of the house  nay but said bridgenorth he is only under custody for an assault with the purpose of a rescue and i counsel you against meddling with him unless you have stronger guard sir geoffrey is now old and broken but this young fellow is in the flower of his youth and hath at his beck all the debauched young cavaliers of the neighbourhoodyou will scarce cross the country without a rescue  topham eyed julian wistfully as a spider may be supposed to look upon a stray wasp which has got into his web and which he longs to secure though he fears the consequences of attempting him  julian himself replied i know not if this separation be well or ill meant on your part master bridgenorth but on mine i am only desirous to share the fate of my parents and therefore i will give my word of honour to attempt neither rescue nor escape on condition you do not separate me from them  do not say so julian said his mother abide with master bridgenorthmy mind tells me he cannot mean so ill by us as his rough conduct would now lead us to infer  and i said sir geoffrey know that between the doors of my fathers house and the gates of hell there steps not such a villain on the ground and if i wish my hands ever to be unbound again it is because i hope for one downright blow at a grey head that has hatched more treason than the whole long parliament  away with thee said the zealous officer is parliament a word for so foul a mouth as thinegentlemen he added turning to everett and dangerfield you will bear witness to this  to his having reviled the house of commonsby gd that i will said dangerfield i will take it on my damnation  and verily said everett as he spoke of parliament generally he hath contemned the house of lords also  why ye poor insignificant wretches said sir geoffrey whose very life is a lieand whose bread is perjurywould you pervert my innocent words almost as soon as they have quitted my lips i tell you the country is well weary of you and should englishmen come to their senses the jail the pillory the whippingpost and the gibbet will be too good preferment for such base bloodsuckersand now master bridgenorth you and they may do your worst for i will not open my mouth to utter a single word while i am in the company of such knaves  perhaps sir geoffrey answered bridgenorth you would better have consulted your own safety in adopting that resolution a little soonerthe tongue is a little member but it causes much strifeyou master julian will please to follow me and without remonstrance or resistance for you must be aware that i have the means of compelling  julian was indeed but too sensible that he had no other course but that of submission to superior force but ere he left the apartment he kneeled down to receive his fathers blessing which the old man bestowed not without a tear in his eye and in the emphatic words god bless thee my boy and keep thee good and true to church and king whatever wind shall bring foul weather  his mother was only able to pass her hand over his head and to implore him in a low tone of voice not to be rash or violent in any attempt to render them assistance we are innocent she said my sonwe are innocentand we are in gods hands be the thought our best comfort and protection  bridgenorth now signed to julian to follow him which he did accompanied or rather conducted by the two guards who had first disarmed him when they had passed from the apartment and were at the door of the outward hall bridgenorth asked julian whether he should consider him as under parole in which case he said he would dispense with all other security but his own promise  peveril who could not help hoping somewhat from the favourable and unresentful manner in which he was treated by one whose life he had so recently attempted replied without hesitation that he would give his parole for twentyfour hours neither to attempt to escape by force nor by flight  it is wisely said replied bridgenorth for though you might cause bloodshed be assured that your utmost efforts could do no service to your parentshorses therehorses to the courtyard  the trampling of horses was soon heard and in obedience to bridgenorths signal and in compliance with his promise julian mounted one which was presented to him and prepared to leave the house of his fathers in which his parents were now prisoners and to go he knew not whither under the custody of one known to be the ancient enemy of his family he was rather surprised at observing that bridgenorth and he were about to travel without any other attendants  when they were mounted and as they rode slowly towards the outer gate of the courtyard bridgenorth said to him it is not every one who would thus unreservedly commit his safety by travelling at night and unaided with the hotbrained youth who so lately attempted his life  master bridgenorth said julian i might tell you truly that i knew you not at the time when i directed my weapon against you but i must also add that the cause in which i used it might have rendered me even had i known you a slight respecter of your person at present i do know you and have neither malice against your person nor the liberty of a parent to fight for besides you have my word and when was a peveril known to break it  ay replied his companion a peverila peveril of the peaka name which has long sounded like a wartrumpet in the land but which has now perhaps sounded its last loud note look back young man on the darksome turrets of your fathers house which uplift themselves above the sons of their people think upon your father a captiveyourself in some sort a fugitiveyour light quenchedyour glory abasedyour estate wrecked and impoverished think that providence has subjected the destinies of the race of peveril to one whom in their aristocratic pride they held as a plebeian upstart think of this and when you again boast of your ancestry remember that he who raiseth the lowly can also abase the high in heart  julian did indeed gaze for an instant with a swelling heart upon the dimly seen turrets of his paternal mansion on which poured the moonlight mixed with long shadows of the towers and trees but while he sadly acknowledged the truth of bridgenorths observation he felt indignant at his illtimed triumph if fortune had followed worth he said the castle of martindale and the name of peveril had afforded no room for their enemys vainglorious boast but those who have stood high on fortunes wheel must abide by the consequence of its revolutions this much i will at least say for my fathers house that it has not stood unhonoured nor will it fallif it is to fallunlamented forbear then if you are indeed the christian you call yourself to exult in the misfortunes of others or to confide in your own prosperity if the light of our house be now quenched god can rekindle it in his own good time  peveril broke off in extreme surprise for as he spake the last words the bright red beams of the family beacon began again to glimmer from its wonted watchtower checkering the pale moonbeam with a ruddier glow bridgenorth also gazed on this unexpected illumination with surprise and not as it seemed without disquietude young man he resumed it can scarcely be but that heaven intends to work great things by your hand so singularly has that augury followed on your words  so saying he put his horse once more in motion and looking back from time to time as if to assure himself that the beacon of the castle was actually rekindled he led the way through the wellknown paths and alleys to his own house of moultrassie followed by peveril who although sensible that the light might be altogether accidental could not but receive as a good omen an event so intimately connected with the traditions and usages of his family  they alighted at the halldoor which was hastily opened by a female and while the deep tone of bridgenorth called on the groom to take their horses the wellknown voice of his daughter alice was heard to exclaim in thanksgiving to god who had restored her father in safety     chapter xxiv          we meet as men see phantoms in a dream         which glide and sigh and sign and move their lips         but make no sound or if they utter voice         tis but a low and undistinguishd moaning         which has nor word nor sense of utterd sound                                                the chieftain  we said at the conclusion of the last chapter that a female form appeared at the door of moultrassie hall and that the wellknown accents of alice bridgenorth were heard to hail the return of her father from what she naturally dreaded as a perilous visit to the castle of martindale  julian who followed his conductor with a throbbing heart into the lighted hall was therefore prepared to see her whom he best loved with her arms thrown around her father the instant she had quitted his paternal embrace she was aware of the unexpected guest who had returned in his company a deep blush rapidly succeeded by a deadly paleness and again by a slighter suffusion showed plainly to her lover that his sudden appearance was anything but indifferent to her he bowed profoundlya courtesy which she returned with equal formality but did not venture to approach more nearly feeling at once the delicacy of his own situation and of hers  major bridgenorth turned his cold fixed grey melancholy glance first on the one of them and then on the other some he said gravely would in my case have avoided this meeting but i have confidence in you both although you are young and beset with the snares incidental to your age there are those within who should not know that ye have been acquainted wherefore be wise and be as strangers to each other  julian and alice exchanged glances as her father turned from them and lifting a lamp which stood in the entrancehall led the way to the interior apartment there was little of consolation in this exchange of looks for the sadness of alices glance was mingled with fear and that of julian clouded by an anxious sense of doubt the look also was but momentary for alice springing to her father took the light out of his hand and stepping before him acted as the usher of both into the large oaken parlour which has been already mentioned as the apartment in which bridgenorth had spent the hours of dejection which followed the death of his consort and family it was now lighted up as for the reception of company and five or six persons sat in it in the plain black stiff dress which was affected by the formal puritans of the time in evidence of their contempt of the manners of the luxurious court of charles the second amongst whom excess of extravagance in apparel like excess of every other kind was highly fashionable  julian at first glanced his eyes but slightly along the range of grave and severe faces which composed this societymen sincere perhaps in their pretensions to a superior purity of conduct and morals but in whom that high praise was somewhat chastened by an affected austerity in dress and manners allied to those pharisees of old who made broad their phylacteries and would be seen of man to fast and to discharge with rigid punctuality the observances of the law their dress was almost uniformly a black cloak and doublet cut straight and close and undecorated with lace or embroidery of any kind black flemish breeches and hose squaretoed shoes with large roses made of serge ribbon two or three had large loose boots of calfleather and almost every one was begirt with a long rapier which was suspended by leathern thongs to a plain belt of buff or of black leather one or two of the elder guests whose hair had been thinned by time had their heads covered with a skullcap of black silk or velvet which being drawn down betwixt the ears and the skull and permitting no hair to escape occasioned the former to project in the ungraceful manner which may be remarked in old pictures and which procured for the puritans the term of prickeared roundheads so unceremoniously applied to them by their contemporaries  these worthies were ranged against the wall each in his ancient highbacked longlegged chair neither looking towards nor apparently discoursing with each other but plunged in their own reflections or awaiting like an assembly of quakers the quickening power of divine inspiration  major bridgenorth glided along this formal society with noiseless step and a composed severity of manner resembling their own he paused before each in succession and apparently communicated as he passed the transactions of the evening and the circumstances under which the heir of martindale castle was now a guest at moultrassie hall each seemed to stir at his brief detail like a range of statues in an enchanted hall starting into something like life as a talisman is applied to them successively most of them as they heard the narrative of their host cast upon julian a look of curiosity blended with haughty scorn and the consciousness of spiritual superiority though in one or two instances the milder influences of compassion were sufficiently visiblepeveril would have undergone this gantlet of eyes with more impatience had not his own been for the time engaged in following the motions of alice who glided through the apartment and only speaking very briefly and in whispers to one or two of the company who addressed her took her place beside a treblehooded old lady the only female of the party and addressed herself to her in such earnest conversation as might dispense with her raising her head or looking at any others in the company  her father put a question to which she was obliged to return an answerwhere was mistress debbitch  she has gone out alice replied early after sunset to visit some old acquaintances in the neighbourhood and she was not yet returned  major bridgenorth made a gesture indicative of displeasure and not content with that expressed his determined resolution that dame deborah should no longer remain a member of his family i will have those he said aloud and without regarding the presence of his guests and those only around me who know to keep within the sober and modest bounds of a christian family who pretends to more freedom must go out from among us as not being of us  a deep and emphatic humming noise which was at that time the mode in which the puritans signified their applause as well of the doctrines expressed by a favourite divine in the pulpit as of those delivered in private society ratified the approbation of the assessors and seemed to secure the dismission of the unfortunate governante who stood thus detected of having strayed out of bounds even peveril although he had reaped considerable advantages in his early acquaintance with alice from the mercenary and gossiping disposition of her governess could not hear of her dismissal without approbation so much was he desirous that in the hour of difficulty which might soon approach alice might have the benefit of countenance and advice from one of her own sex of better manners and less suspicious probity than mistress debbitch  almost immediately after this communication had taken place a servant in mourning showed his thin pinched and wrinkled visage in the apartment announcing with a voice more like a passing bell than the herald of a banquet that refreshments were provided in an adjoining apartment gravely leading the way with his daughter on one side and the puritanical female whom we have distinguished on the other bridgenorth himself ushered his company who followed with little attention to order or ceremony into the eatingroom where a substantial supper was provided  in this manner peveril although entitled according to ordinary ceremonial to some degree of precedencea matter at that time considered of much importance although now little regardedwas left among the last of those who quitted the parlour and might indeed have brought up the rear of all had not one of the company who was himself late in the retreat bowed and resigned to julian the rank in the company which had been usurped by others  this act of politeness naturally induced julian to examine the features of the person who had offered him this civility and he started to observe under the pinched velvet cap and above the short bandstrings the countenance of ganlesse as he called himselfhis companion on the preceding evening he looked again and again especially when all were placed at the supper board and when consequently he had frequent opportunities of observing this person fixedly without any breach of good manners at first he wavered in his belief and was much inclined to doubt the reality of his recollection for the difference of dress was such as to effect a considerable change of appearance and the countenance itself far from exhibiting anything marked or memorable was one of those ordinary visages which we see almost without remarking them and which leave our memory so soon as the object is withdrawn from our eyes but the impression upon his mind returned and became stronger until it induced him to watch with peculiar attention the manners of the individual who had thus attracted his notice  during the time of a very prolonged grace before meat which was delivered by one of the companywho from his geneva band and serge doublet presided as julian supposed over some dissenting congregationhe noticed that this man kept the same demure and severe cast of countenance usually affected by the puritans and which rather caricatured the reverence unquestionably due upon such occasions his eyes were turned upward and his huge penthouse hat with a high crown and broad brim held in both hands before him rose and fell with the cadences of the speakers voice thus marking time as it were to the periods of the benediction yet when the slight bustle took place which attends the adjusting of chairs c as men sit down to table julians eye encountered that of the stranger and as their looks met there glanced from those of the latter an expression of satirical humour and scorn which seemed to intimate internal ridicule of the gravity of his present demeanour  julian again sought to fix his eye in order to ascertain that he had not mistaken the tendency of this transient expression but the stranger did not allow him another opportunity he might have been discovered by the tone of his voice but the individual in question spoke little and in whispers which was indeed the fashion of the whole company whose demeanour at table resembled that of mourners at a funeral feast  the entertainment itself was coarse though plentiful and must according to julians opinion be distasteful to one so exquisitely skilled in good cheer and so capable of enjoying critically and scientifically the genial preparations of his companion smith as ganlesse had shown himself on the preceding evening accordingly upon close observation he remarked that the food which he took upon his plate remained there unconsumed and that his actual supper consisted only of a crust of bread with a glass of wine  the repast was hurried over with the haste of those who think it shame if not sin to make mere animal enjoyments the means of consuming time or of receiving pleasure and when men wiped their mouths and moustaches julian remarked that the object of his curiosity used a handkerchief of the finest cambrican article rather inconsistent with the exterior plainness not to say coarseness of his appearance he used also several of the more minute refinements then only observed at tables of the higher rank and julian thought he could discern at every turn something of courtly manners and gestures under the precise and rustic simplicity of the character which he had assumed   a scottish gentleman in hiding as it was emphatically termed     for some concern in a jacobite insurrection or plot was     discovered among a number of ordinary persons by the use of his     toothpick  but if this were indeed that same ganlesse with whom julian had met on the preceding evening and who had boasted the facility with which he could assume any character which he pleased to represent for the time what could be the purpose of this present disguise he was if his own words could be credited a person of some importance who dared to defy the danger of those officers and informers before whom all ranks at that time trembled nor was he likely as julian conceived without some strong purpose to subject himself to such a masquerade as the present which could not be otherwise than irksome to one whose conversation proclaimed him of light life and free opinions was his appearance here for good or for evil did it respect his fathers house or his own person or the family of bridgenorth was the real character of ganlesse known to the master of the house inflexible as he was in all which concerned morals as well as religion if not might not the machinations of a brain so subtile affect the peace and happiness of alice bridgenorth  these were questions which no reflection could enable peveril to answer his eyes glanced from alice to the stranger and new fears and undefined suspicions in which the safety of that beloved and lovely girl was implicated mingled with the deep anxiety which already occupied his mind on account of his father and his fathers house  he was in this tumult of mind when after a thanksgiving as long as the grace the company arose from table and were instantly summoned to the exercise of family worship a train of domestics grave sad and melancholy as their superiors glided in to assist at this act of devotion and ranged themselves at the lower end of the apartment most of these men were armed with long tucks as the straight stabbing swords much used by cromwells soldiery were then called several had large pistols also and the corselets or cuirasses of some were heard to clank as they seated themselves to partake in this act of devotion the ministry of him whom julian had supposed a preacher was not used on this occasion major bridgenorth himself read and expounded a chapter of scripture with much strength and manliness of expression although so as not to escape the charge of fanaticism the nineteenth chapter of jeremiah was the portion of scripture which he selected in which under the type of breaking a potters vessel the prophet presages the desolation of the jews the lecturer was not naturally eloquent but a strong deep and sincere conviction of the truth of what he said supplied him with language of energy and fire as he drew parallel between the abominations of the worship of baal and the corruptions of the church of romeso favourite a topic with the puritans of that period and denounced against the catholics and those who favoured them that hissing and desolation which the prophet directed against the city of jerusalem his hearers made a yet closer application than the lecturer himself suggested and many a dark proud eye intimated by a glance on julian that on his fathers house were already in some part realised those dreadful maledictions  the lecture finished bridgenorth summoned them to unite with him in prayer and on a slight change of arrangements amongst the company which took place as they were about to kneel down julian found his place next to the singleminded and beautiful object of his affection as she knelt in her loveliness to adore her creator a short time was permitted for mental devotion during which peveril could hear her halfbreathed petition for the promised blessings of peace on earth and goodwill towards the children of men  the prayer which ensued was in a different tone it was poured forth by the same person who had officiated as chaplain at the table and was in the tone of a boanerges or son of thundera denouncer of crimesan invoker of judgmentsalmost a prophet of evil and of destruction the testimonies and the sins of the day were not forgottenthe mysterious murder of sir edmondsbury godfrey was insisted uponand thanks and praise were offered that the very night on which they were assembled had not seen another offering of a protestant magistrate to the bloodthirsty fury of revengeful catholics  never had julian found it more difficult during an act of devotion to maintain his mind in a frame befitting the posture and the occasion and when he heard the speaker return thanks for the downfall and devastation of his family he was strongly tempted to have started upon his feet and charged him with offering a tribute stained with falsehood and calumny at the throne of truth itself he resisted however an impulse which it would have been insanity to have yielded to and his patience was not without its reward for when his fair neighbour arose from her knees the lengthened and prolonged prayer being at last concluded he observed that her eyes were streaming with tears and one glance with which she looked at him in that moment showed more of affectionate interest for him in his fallen fortunes and precarious condition than he had been able to obtain from her when his worldly estate seemed so much the more exalted of the two  cheered and fortified with the conviction that one bosom in the company and that in which he most eagerly longed to secure an interest sympathised with his distress he felt strong to endure whatever was to follow and shrunk not from the stern still smile with which one by one the meeting regarded him as gliding to their several places of repose they indulged themselves at parting with a look of triumph on one whom they considered as their captive enemy  alice also passed by her lover her eyes fixed on the ground and answered his low obeisance without raising them the room was now empty but for bridgenorth and his guest or prisoner for it is difficult to say in which capacity peveril ought to regard himself he took an old brazen lamp from the table and leading the way said at the same time i must be the uncourtly chamberlain who am to usher you to a place of repose more rude perhaps than you have been accustomed to occupy  julian followed him in silence up an oldfashioned winding staircase within a turret at the landingplace on the top was a small apartment where an ordinary pallet bed two chairs and a small stone table were the only furniture your bed continued bridgenorth as if desirous to prolong their interview is not of the softest but innocence sleeps as sound upon straw as on down  sorrow major bridgenorth finds little rest on either replied julian tell me for you seem to await some question from me what is to be the fate of my parents and why you separate me from them  bridgenorth for answer indicated with his finger the mark which his countenance still showed from the explosion of julians pistol  that replied julian is not the real cause of your proceedings against me it cannot be that you who have been a soldier and are a man can be surprised or displeased by my interference in the defence of my father above all you cannot and i must needs say you do not believe that i would have raised my hand against you personally had there been a moments time for recognition  i may grant all this said bridgenorth but what the better are you for my good opinion or for the ease with which i can forgive you the injury which you aimed at me you are in my custody as a magistrate accused of abetting the foul bloody and heathenish plot for the establishment of popery the murder of the king and the general massacre of all true protestants  and on what grounds either of fact or suspicion dare any one accuse me of such a crime said julian i have hardly heard of the plot save by the mouth of common rumour which while it speaks of nothing else takes care to say nothing distinctly even on that subject  it may be enough for me to tell you replied bridgenorth and perhaps it is a word too muchthat you are a discovered intriguera spied spywho carries tokens and messages betwixt the popish countess of derby and the catholic party in london you have not conducted your matters with such discretion but that this is well known and can be sufficiently proved to this charge which you are well aware you cannot deny these men everett and dangerfield are not unwilling to add from the recollection of your face other passages which will certainly cost you your life when you come before a protestant jury  they lie like villains said peveril who hold me accessory to any plot either against the king the nation or the state of religion and for the countess her loyalty has been too long and too highly proved to permit her being implicated in such injurious suspicions  what she has already done said bridgenorth his face darkening as he spoke against the faithful champions of pure religion hath sufficiently shown of what she is capable she hath betaken herself to her rock and sits as she thinks in security like the eagle reposing after his bloody banquet but the arrow of the fowler may yet reach herthe shaft is whettedthe bow is bendedand it will be soon seen whether amalek or israel shall prevail but for thee julian peverilwhy should i conceal it from theemy heart yearns for thee as a womans for her firstborn to thee i will give at the expense of my own reputationperhaps at the risk of personal suspicionfor who in these days of doubt shall be exempted from itto thee i say i will give means of escape which else were impossible to thee the staircase of this turret descends to the gardensthe posterngate is unlatchedon the right hand lie the stables where you will find your own horsetake it and make for liverpooli will give you credit with a friend under the name of simon simonson one persecuted by the prelates and he will expedite your passage from the kingdom  major bridgenorth said julian i will not deceive you were i to accept your offer of freedom it would be to attend to a higher call than that of mere selfpreservation my father is in dangermy mother in sorrowthe voices of religion and nature call me to their side i am their only childtheir only hopei will aid them or perish with them  thou art mad said bridgenorthaid them thou canst notperish with them thou mayst and even accelerate their ruin for in addition to the charges with which thy unhappy father is loaded it would be no slight aggravation that while he meditated arming and calling together the catholics and high churchmen of cheshire and derbyshire his son should prove to be the confidential agent of the countess of derby who aided her in making good her stronghold against the protestant commissioners and was despatched by her to open secret communication with the popish interest in london  you have twice stated me as such an agent said peveril resolved that his silence should not be construed into an admission of the charge though he felt it was in some degree well foundedwhat reason have you for such an allegation  will it suffice for a proof of my intimate acquaintance with your mystery replied bridgenorth if i should repeat to you the last words which the countess used to you when you left the castle of that amalekitish woman thus she spoke i am now a forlorn widow she said whom sorrow has made selfish  peveril started for these were the very words the countess had used but he instantly recovered himself and replied be your information of what nature it will i deny and i defy it so far as it attaches aught like guilt to me there lives not a man more innocent of a disloyal thought or of a traitorous purpose what i say for myself i will to the best of my knowledge say and maintain on account of the noble countess to whom i am indebted for nurture  perish then in thy obstinacy said bridgenorth and turning hastily from him he left the room and julian heard him hasten down the narrow staircase as if distrusting his own resolution  with a heavy heart yet with that confidence in an overruling providence which never forsakes a good and brave man peveril betook himself to his lowly place of repose     chapter xxv          the course of human life is changeful still         as is the fickle wind and wandering rill         or like the light dance which the wildbreeze weaves         amidst the fated race of fallen leaves         which now its breath bears down now tosses high         beats to the earth or wafts to middle sky         such and so varied the precarious play         of fate with man frail tenant of a day                                                    anonymous  whilst overcome with fatigue and worn out by anxiety julian peveril slumbered as a prisoner in the house of his hereditary enemy fortune was preparing his release by one of those sudden frolics with which she loves to confound the calculations and expectancies of humanity and as she fixes on strange agents for such purposes she condescended to employ on the present occasion no less a personage than mistress deborah debbitch  instigated doubtless by the pristine reminiscences of former times no sooner had that most prudent and considerate dame found herself in the vicinity of the scenes of her earlier days than she bethought herself of a visit to the ancient housekeeper of martindale castle dame ellesmere by name who long retired from active service resided at the keepers lodge in the west thicket with her nephew lance outram subsisting upon the savings of her better days and on a small pension allowed by sir geoffrey to her age and faithful services  now dame ellesmere and mistress deborah had not by any means been formerly on so friendly a footing as this haste to visit her might be supposed to intimate but years had taught deborah to forget and forgive or perhaps she had no special objection under cover of a visit to dame ellesmere to take the chance of seeing what changes time had made on her old admirer the keeper both inhabitants were in the cottage when after having seen her master set forth on his expedition to the castle mistress debbitch dressed in her very best gown footed it through gutter and over stile and by pathway green to knock at their door and to lift the hatch at the hospitable invitation which bade her come in  dame ellesmeres eyes were so often dim that even with the aid of spectacles she failed to recognise in the portly and mature personage who entered their cottage the tight wellmade lass who presuming on her good looks and flippant tongue had so often provoked her by insubordination and her former lover the redoubted lance not being conscious that ale had given rotundity to his own figure which was formerly so slight and active and that brandy had transferred to his nose the colour which had once occupied his cheeks was unable to discover that deborahs french cap composed of sarsenet and brussels lace shaded the features which had so often procured him a rebuke from dr dummerar for suffering his eyes during the time of prayers to wander to the maidservants bench  in brief the blushing visitor was compelled to make herself known and when known was received by aunt and nephew with the most sincere cordiality  the homebrewed was produced and in lieu of more vulgar food a few slices of venison presently hissed in the frying pan giving strong room for inference that lance outram in his capacity of keeper neglected not his own cottage when he supplied the larder at the castle a modest sip of the excellent derbyshire ale and a taste of the highlyseasoned hash soon placed deborah entirely at home with her old acquaintance  having put all necessary questions and received all suitable answers respecting the state of the neighbourhood and such of her own friends as continued to reside there the conversation began rather to flag until deborah found the art of again renewing its interest by communicating to her friends the dismal intelligence that they must soon look for deadly bad news from the castle for that her present master major bridgenorth had been summoned by some great people from london to assist in taking her old master sir geoffrey and that all master bridgenorths servants and several other persons whom she named friends and adherents of the same interest had assembled a force to surprise the castle and that as sir geoffrey was now so old and gouty withal it could not be expected he should make the defence he was wont and then he was known to be so stouthearted that it was not to be supposed that he would yield up without stroke of sword and then if he was killed as he was like to be amongst them that liked never a bone of his body and now had him at their mercy why in that case she dame deborah would look upon lady peveril as little better than a dead woman and undoubtedly there would be a general mourning through all that country where they had such great kin and silks were likely to rise on it as master lutestring the mercer of chesterfield was like to feel in his purse bottom but for her part let matters wag how they would an if master julian peveril was to come to his own she could give as near a guess as eer another who was likely to be lady at martindale  the text of this lecture or in other words the fact that bridgenorth was gone with a party to attack sir geoffrey peveril in his own castle of martindale sounded so stunningly strange in the ears of those old retainers of his family that they had no power either to attend to mistress deborahs inferences or to interrupt the velocity of speech with which she poured them forth and when at length she made a breathless pause all that poor dame ellesmere could reply was the emphatic question bridgenorth brave peveril of the peakis the woman mad  come come dame said deborah woman me no more than i woman you i have not been called mistress at the head of the table for so many years to be womand here by you and for the news it is as true as that you are sitting there in a white hood who will wear a black one ere long  lance outram said the old woman make out if thou best a man and listen about if aught stirs up at the castle  if there should said outram i am even too long here and he caught up his crossbow and one or two arrows and rushed out of the cottage  welladay said mistress deborah see if my news have not frightened away lance outram too whom they used to say nothing could start but do not take on so dame for i dare say if the castle and the lands pass to my new master major bridgenorth as it is like they willfor i have heard that he has powerful debts over the estateyou shall have my good word with him and i promise you he is no bad man something precise about preaching and praying and about the dress which one should wear which i must own beseems not a gentleman as to be sure every woman knows best what becomes her but for you dame that wear a prayerbook at your girdle with your housewifecase and never change the fashion of your white hood i dare say he will not grudge you the little matter you need and are not able to win  out sordid jade exclaimed dame ellesmere her very flesh quivering betwixt apprehension and anger and hold your peace this instant or i will find those that shall flay the very hide from thee with dogwhips hast thou ate thy noble masters bread not only to betray his trust and fly from his service but wouldst thou come here like an illomened bird as thou art to triumph over his downfall  nay dame said deborah over whom the violence of the old woman had obtained a certain predominance it is not i that say itonly the warrant of the parliament folks  i thought we had done with their warrants ever since the blessed twentyninth of may said the old housekeeper of martindale castle but this i tell thee sweetheart that i have seen such warrants crammed at the swords point down the throats of them that brought them and so shall this be if there is one true man left to drink of the dove  as she spoke lance outram reentered the cottage naunt he said in dismay i doubt it is true what she says the beacon tower is as black as my belt no polestar of peveril what does that betoken  death ruin and captivity exclaimed old ellesmere make for the castle thou knave thrust in thy great body strike for the house that bred thee and fed thee and if thou art buried under the ruins thou diest a mans death  nay naunt i shall not be slack answered outram but here come folks that i warrant can tell us more ont  one or two of the female servants who had fled from the castle during the alarm now rushed in with various reports of the case but all agreeing that a body of armed men were in possession of the castle and that major bridgenorth had taken young master julian prisoner and conveyed him down to moultrassie hall with his feet tied under the belly of the naga shameful sight to be seenand he so well born and so handsome  lance scratched his head and though feeling the duty incumbent upon him as a faithful servant which was indeed specially dinned into him by the cries and exclamations of his aunt he seemed not a little dubious how to conduct himself i would to god naunt he said at last that old whitaker were alive now with his long stories about marston moor and edge hill that made us all yawn our jaws off their hinges in spite of broiled rashers and double beer when a man is missed he is moaned as they say and i would rather than a broad piece he had been here to have sorted this matter for it is clean out of my way as a woodsman that have no skill of war but dang it if old sir geoffrey go to the wall without a knock for ithere you nellspeaking to one of the fugitive maidens from the castlebut noyou have not the heart of a cat and are afraid of your own shadow by moonlightbut cis you are a stouthearted wench and know a buck from a bullfinch hark thee cis as you would wish to be married get

ready for good or bad let her send orders down to me or do you come yourself your legs are long enough  whether they are or not master lance and you know nothing of the matter they shall do your errand tonight for love of the old knight and his lady  so cisly sellok a kind of derbyshire camilla who had won the smock at the footrace at ashbourne sprung forward towards the castle with a speed which few could have equalled  there goes a mettled wench said lance and now naunt give me the old broadswordit is above the bedheadand my woodknife and i shall do well enough  and what is to become of me bleated the unfortunate mistress deborah debbitch  you must remain here with my aunt mistress deb and for old acquaintance sake she will take care no harm befalls you but take heed how you attempt to break bounds  so saying and pondering in his own mind the task which he had undertaken the hardy forester strode down the moonlight glade scarcely hearing the blessings and cautions which dame ellesmere kept showering after him his thoughts were not altogether warlike what a tight ankle the jade hathshe trips it like a doe in summer over dew well but here are the hutslet us to this gearare ye all asleep you dammers sinkers and driftdrivers turn out ye subterranean badgers here is your master sir geoffrey dead for aught ye know or care do not you see the beacon is unlit and you sit there like so many asses  why answered one of the miners who now began to come out of their huts   an he be dead   he will eat no more bread  and you are like to eat none neither said lance for the works will be presently stopped and all of you turned off  well and what of it master lance as good play for nought as work for nought here is four weeks we have scarce seen the colour of sir geoffreys coin and you ask us to care whether he be dead or in life for you that goes about trotting upon your horse and doing for work what all men do for pleasure it may be well enough but it is another matter to be leaving gods light and burrowing all day and night in darkness like a toad in a holethats not to be done for nought i trow and if sir geoffrey is dead his soul will suffer fort and if hes alive well have him in the barmoot court  hark ye gaffer said lance and take notice my mates all of you for a considerable number of these rude and subterranean people had now assembled to hear the discussionhas sir geoffrey think you ever put a penny in his pouch out of this same bonadventure mine  i cannot say as i think he has answered old ditchley the party who maintained the controversy  answer on your conscience though it be but a leaden one do not you know that he hath lost a good penny  why i believe he may said gaffer ditchley what thenlose today win tomorrowthe miner must eat in the meantime  true but what will you eat when master bridgenorth gets the land that will not hear of a mine being wrought on his own ground will he work on at dead loss think ye demanded trusty lance  bridgenorthhe of moultrassie hall that stopped the great felicity work on which his father laid out some say ten thousand pounds and never got in a penny why what has he to do with sir geoffreys property down here at bonadventure it was never his i trow  nay what do i know answered lance who saw the impression he had made law and debt will give him half derbyshire i think unless you stand by old sir geoffrey  but if sir geoffrey be dead said ditchley cautiously what good will our standing by do to him  i did not say he was dead but only as bad as dead in the hands of the roundheadsa prisoner up yonder at his own castle said lance and will have his head cut off like the good earl of derbys at boltonlemoors  nay then comrades said gaffer ditchley an it be as master lance says i think we should bear a hand for stout old sir geoffrey against a lowborn meanspirited fellow like bridgenorth who shut up a shaft had cost thousands without getting a penny profit ont so hurra for sir geoffrey and down with the rump but hold ye a blinkholdand the waving of his hand stopped the commencing cheerhark ye master lance it must be all over for the beacon is as black as night and you know yourself that marks the lords death  it will kindle again in an instant said lance internally adding i pray to god it mayit will kindle in an instantlack of fuel and the confusion of the family  ay like enow like enow said ditchley but i winna budge till i see it blazing  why then there agoes said lance thank thee cisthank thee my good wenchbelieve your own eyes my lads if you will not believe me and now hurra for peveril of the peakthe king and his friendsand down with rumps and roundheads  the sudden rekindling of the beacon had all the effect which lance could have desired upon the minds of his rude and ignorant hearers who in their superstitious humour had strongly associated the polarstar of peveril with the fortunes of the family once moved according to the national character of their countrymen they soon became enthusiastic and lance found himself at the head of thirty stout fellows and upwards armed with their pickaxes and ready to execute whatever task he should impose on them  trusting to enter the castle by the postern which had served to accommodate himself and other domestics upon an emergency his only anxiety was to keep his march silent and he earnestly recommended to his followers to reserve their shouts for the moment of the attack they had not advanced far on their road to the castle when cisly sellok met them so breathless with haste that the poor girl was obliged to throw herself into master lances arms  stand up my mettled wench said he giving her a sly kiss at the same time and let us know what is going on up at the castle  my lady bids you as you would serve god and your master not to come up to the castle which can but make bloodshed for she says sir geoffrey is lawfully in hand and that he must bide the issue and that he is innocent of what he is charged with and is going up to speak for himself before king and council and she goes up with him and besides they have found out the postern the roundhead rogues for two of them saw me when i went out of door and chased me but i showed them a fair pair of heels  as ever dashed dew from the cowslip said lance but what the foul fiend is to be done for if they have secured the postern i know not how the dickens we can get in  all is fastened with bolt and staple and guarded with gun and pistol at the castle quoth cisly and so sharp are they that they nigh caught me coming with my ladys message as i told you but my lady says if you could deliver her son master julian from bridgenorth that she would hold it good service  what said lance is young master at the castle i taught him to shoot his first shaft but how to get in  he was at the castle in the midst of the ruffle but old bridgenorth has carried him down prisoner to the hall answered cisly there was never faith nor courtesy in an old puritan who never had pipe and tabor in his house since it was built  or who stopped a promising mine said ditchley to save a few thousand pounds when he might have made himself as rich as lord of chatsworth and fed a hundred good fellows all the whilst  why then said lance since you are all of a mind we will go draw the cover for the old badger and i promise you that the hall is not like one of your real houses of quality where the walls are as thick as whinstonedikes but foolish brickwork that your pickaxes will work through as if it were cheese huzza once more for peveril of the peak down with bridgenorth and all upstart cuckoldly roundheads  having indulged the throats of his followers with one buxom huzza lance commanded them to cease their clamours and proceeded to conduct them by such paths as seemed the least likely to be watched to the courtyard of moultrassie hall on the road they were joined by several stout yeoman farmers either followers of the peveril family or friends to the high church and cavalier party most of whom alarmed by the news which began to fly fast through the neighbourhood were armed with sword and pistol  lance outram halted his party at the distance as he himself described it of a flightshot from the house and advanced alone and in silence to reconnoitre and having previously commanded ditchley and his subterranean allies to come to his assistance whenever he should whistle he crept cautiously forward and soon found that those whom he came to surprise true to the discipline which had gained their party such decided superiority during the civil war had posted a sentinel who paced through the courtyard piously chanting a psalmtune while his arms crossed on his bosom supported a gun of formidable length  now a true solder said lance outram to himself would put a stop to thy snivelling ditty by making a broad arrow quiver in your heart and no great alarm given but dang it i have not the right spirit for a soldieri cannot fight a man till my bloods up and for shooting him from behind a wall it is cruelly like to stalking a deer ill een face him and try what to make of him  with this doughty resolution and taking no farther care to conceal himself he entered the courtyard boldly and was making forward to the front door of the hall as a matter of course but the old cromwellian who was on guard had not so learned his duty who goes therestand friendstand or verily i will shoot thee to death were challenges which followed each other quick the last being enforced by the levelling and presenting the said longbarrelled gun with which he was armed  why what a murrain answered lance is it your fashion to go ashooting at this time o night why this is but a time for batfowling  nay but hark thee friend said the experienced sentinel i am none of those who do this work negligently thou canst not snare me with thy crafty speech though thou wouldst make it to sound simple in mine ear of a verity i will shoot unless thou tell thy name and business  name said lance why what a dickens should it be but robin roundhonest robin of redham and for business an you must needs know i come on a message from some parliament man up yonder at the castle with letters for worshipful master bridgenorth of moultrassie hall and this be the place as i think though why ye be marching up and down at his door like the sign of a red man with your old firelock there i cannot so well guess  give me the letters my friend said the sentinel to whom this explanation seemed very natural and probable and i will cause them forthwith to be delivered into his worships own hand  rummaging in his pockets as if to pull out the letters which never existed master lance approached within the sentinels piece and before he was aware suddenly seized him by the collar whistled sharp and shrill and exerting his skill as a wrestler for which he had been distinguished in his youth he stretched his antagonist on his backthe musket for which they struggled going off in the fall  the miners rushed into the courtyard at lances signal and hopeless any longer of prosecuting his design in silence lance commanded two of them to secure the prisoner and the rest to cheer loudly and attack the door of the house instantly the courtyard of the mansion rang with the cry of peveril of the peak for ever with all the abuse which the royalists had invented to cast upon the roundheads during so many years of contention and at the same time while some assailed the door with their mining implements others directed their attack against the angle where a kind of porch joined to the main front of the building and there in some degree protected by the projection of the wall and of a balcony which overhung the porch wrought in more security as well as with more effect than the others for the doors being of oak thickly studded with nails offered a more effectual resistance to violence than the brickwork  the noise of this hubbub on the outside soon excited wild alarm and tumult within lights flew from window to window and voices were heard demanding the cause of the attack to which the party cries of those who were in the courtyard afforded a sufficient or at least the only answer which was vouchsafed at length the window of a projecting staircase opened and the voice of bridgenorth himself demanded authoritatively what the tumult meant and commanded the rioters to desist upon their own proper and immediate peril  we want our young master you canting old thief was the reply and if we have him not instantly the topmost stone of your house shall lie as low as the foundation  we shall try that presently said bridgenorth for if there is another blow struck against the walls of my peaceful house i will fire my carabine among you and your blood be upon your own head i have a score of friends well armed with musket and pistol to defend my house and we have both the means and heart with heavens assistance to repay any violence you can offer  master bridgenorth replied lance who though no soldier was sportsman enough to comprehend the advantage which those under cover and using firearms must necessarily have over his party exposed to their aim in a great measure and without means of answering their firemaster bridgenorth let us crave parley with you and fair conditions we desire to do you no evil but will have back our young master it is enough that you have got our old one and his lady it is foul chasing to kill hart hind and fawn and we will give you some light on the subject in an instant  this speech was followed by a great crash amongst the lower windows of the house according to a new species of attack which had been suggested by some of the assailants  i would take the honest fellows word and let young peveril go said one of the garrison who carelessly yawning approached on the inside of the post at which bridgenorth had stationed himself  are you mad said bridgenorth or do you think me poor enough in spirit to give up the advantages i now possess over the family of peveril for the awe of a parcel of boors whom the first discharge will scatter like chaff before the whirlwind  nay answered the speaker who was the same individual that had struck julian by his resemblance to the man who called himself ganlesse i love a dire revenge but we shall buy it somewhat too dear if these rascals set the house on fire as they are like to do while you are parleying from the window they have thrown torches or firebrands into the hall and it is all our friends can do to keep the flame from catching the wainscoting which is old and dry  now may heaven judge thee for thy lightness of spirit answered bridgenorth one would think mischief was so properly thy element that to thee it was indifferent whether friend or foe was the sufferer  so saying he ran hastily downstairs towards the hall into which through broken casements and betwixt the iron bars which prevented human entrance the assailants had thrust lighted straw sufficient to excite much smoke and some fire and to throw the defenders of the house into great confusion insomuch that of several shots fired hastily from the windows little or no damage followed to the besiegers who getting warm on the onset answered the hostile charges with loud shouts of peveril for ever and had already made a practicable breach through the brickwall of the tenement through which lance ditchley and several of the most adventurous among their followers made their way into the hall  the complete capture of the house remained however as far off as ever the defenders mixed with much coolness and skill that solemn and deep spirit of enthusiasm which sets life at less than nothing in comparison to real or supposed duty from the halfopen doors which led into the hall they maintained a fire which began to grow fatal one miner was shot dead three or four were wounded and lance scarce knew whether he should draw his forces from the house and leave it a prey to the flames or making a desperate attack on the posts occupied by the defenders try to obtain unmolested possession of the place at this moment his course of conduct was determined by an unexpected occurrence of which it is necessary to trace the cause  julian peveril had been like other inhabitants of moultrassie hall on that momentous night awakened by the report of the sentinels musket followed by the shouts of his fathers vassals and followers of which he collected enough to guess that bridgenorths house was attacked with a view to his liberation very doubtful of the issue of such an attempt dizzy with the slumber from which he had been so suddenly awakened and confounded with the rapid succession of events to which he had been lately a witness he speedily put on a part of his clothes and hastened to the window of his apartment from this he could see nothing to relieve his anxiety for it looked towards a quarter different from that on which the attack was made he attempted his door it was locked on the outside and his perplexity and anxiety became extreme when suddenly the lock was turned and in an underdress hastily assumed in the moment of alarm her hair streaming on her shoulders her eyes gleaming betwixt fear and resolution alice bridgenorth rushed into his apartment and seized his hand with the fervent exclamation julian save my father  the light which she bore in her hand served to show those features which could rarely have been viewed by any one without emotion but which bore an expression irresistible to a lover  alice he said what means this what is the danger where is your father  do not stay to question she answered but if you would save him follow me  at the same time she led the way with great speed halfway down the turret stair case which led to his room thence turning through a side door along a long gallery to a larger and wider stair at the bottom of which stood her father surrounded by four or five of his friends scarce discernible through the smoke of the fire which began to take hold in the hall as well as that which arose from the repeated discharge of their own firearms  julian saw there was not a moment to be lost if he meant to be a successful mediator he rushed through bridgenorths party ere they were aware of his approach and throwing himself amongst the assailants who occupied the hall in considerable numbers he assured them of his personal safety and conjured them to depart  not without a few more slices at the rump master answered lance i am principally glad to see you safe and well but here is joe rimegap shot as dead as a buck in season and more of us are hurt and well have revenge and roast the puritans like apples for lambswool  then you shall roast me along with them said julian for i vow to god i will not leave the hall being bound by parole of honour to abide with major bridgenorth till lawfully dismissed  now out on you an you were ten times a peveril said ditchley to give so many honest fellows loss and labour on your behalf and to show them no kinder countenancei say beat up the fire and burn all together  nay nay but peace my masters and hearken to reason said julian we are all here in evil condition and you will only make it worse by contention do you help to put out this same fire which will else cost us all dear keep yourselves under arms let master bridgenorth and me settle some grounds of accommodation and i trust all will be favourably made up on both sides and if not you shall have my consent and countenance to fight it out and come on it what will i will never forget this nights good service  he then drew ditchley and lance outram aside while the rest stood suspended at his appearance and words and expressing the utmost thanks and gratitude for what they had already done urged them as the greatest favour which they could do towards him and his fathers house to permit him to negotiate the terms of his emancipation from thraldom at the same time forcing on ditchley five or six gold pieces that the brave lads of bonadventure might drink his health whilst to lance he expressed the warmest sense of his active kindness but protested he could only consider it as good service to his house if he was allowed to manage the matter after his own fashion  why answered lance i am well out on it master julian for it is matter beyond my mastery all that i stand to is that i will see you safe out of this same moultrassie hall for our old naunt ellesmere will else give me but cold comfort when i come home truth is i began unwillingly but when i saw the poor fellow joe shot beside me why i thought we should have some amends but i put it all in your honours hands  during this colloquy both parties had been amicably employed in extinguishing the fire which might otherwise have been fatal to all it required a general effort to get it under and both parties agreed on the necessary labour with as much unanimity as if the water they brought in leathern buckets from the well to throw upon the fire had some effect in slaking their mutual hostility     chapter xxvi                necessitythou best of peacemakers               as well as surest prompter of invention               help us to composition                                                anonymous  while the fire continued the two parties laboured in active union like the jarring factions of the jews during the siege of jerusalem when compelled to unite in resisting an assault of the besiegers but when the last bucket of water had hissed on the few embers that continued to glimmerwhen the sense of mutual hostility hitherto suspended by a feeling of common danger was in its turn rekindledthe parties mingled as they had hitherto been in one common exertion drew off from each other and began to arrange themselves at opposite sides of the hall and handle their weapons as if for a renewal of the fight  bridgenorth interrupted any farther progress of this menaced hostility julian peveril he said thou art free to walk thine own path since thou wilt not walk with me that road which is more safe as well as more honourable but if you do by my counsel you will get soon beyond the british seas  ralph bridgenorth said one of his friends this is but evil and feeble conduct on thine own part wilt thou withhold thy hand from the battle to defend from these sons of belial the captive of thy bow and of thy spear surely we are enow to deal with them in the security of the old serpent until we essay whether the lord will not give us victory therein  a hum of stern assent followed and had not ganlesse now interfered the combat would probably have been renewed he took the advocate for war apart into one of the window recesses and apparently satisfied his objections for as he returned to his companions he said to them our friend hath so well argued this matter that verily since he is of the same mind with the worthy major bridgenorth i think the youth may be set at liberty  as no farther objection was offered it only remained with julian to thank and reward those who had been active in his assistance having first obtained from bridgenorth a promise of indemnity to them for the riot they had committed a few kind words conveyed his sense of their services and some broad pieces thrust into the hand of lance outram furnished the means for affording them a holiday they would have remained to protect him but fearful of farther disorder and relying entirely on the good faith of major bridgenorth he dismissed them all except lance whom he detained to attend upon him for a few minutes till he should depart from moultrassie but ere leaving the hall he could not repress his desire to speak with bridgenorth in secret and advancing towards him he expressed such a desire  tacitly granting what was asked of him bridgenorth led the way to a small summer saloon adjoining to the hall where with his usual gravity and indifference of manner he seemed to await in silence what peveril had to communicate  julian found it difficult where so little opening was afforded him to find a tone in which to open the subjects he had at heart that should be at once dignified and conciliating major bridgenorth he said at length you have been a son and an affectionate oneyou may conceive my present anxietymy fatherwhat has been designed for him  what the law will answered bridgenorth had he walked by the counsels which i procured to be given to him he might have dwelt safely in the house of his ancestors his fate is now beyond my controlfar beyond yours it must be with him as his country decide  and my mother said peveril  will consult as she has ever done her own duty and create her own happiness by doing so replied bridgenorth believe my designs towards your family are better than they may seem through the mist which adversity has spread around your house i may triumph as a man but as a man i must also remember in my hour that mine enemies have had theirshave you aught else to say he added after a momentary pause you have rejected once yea and again the hand i stretched out to you methinks little more remains between us  these words which seemed to cut short farther discussion were calmly spoken so that though they appeared to discourage farther question they could not interrupt that which still trembled on julians tongue he made a step or two towards the door then suddenly returned your daughter he saidmajor bridgenorthi should aski do ask forgiveness for mentioning her namebut may i not inquire after hermay i not express my wishes for her future happiness  your interest in her is but too flattering said bridgenorth but you have already chosen your part and you must be in future strangers to each other i may have wished it otherwise but the hour of grace is passed during which your compliance with my advice mighti will speak it plainlyhave led to your union for her happinessif such a word belongs to mortal pilgrimagei shall care for it sufficiently she leaves this place today under the guardianship of a sure friend  not of exclaimed peveril and stopped short for he felt he had no right to pronounce the name which came to his lips  why do you pause said bridgenorth a sudden thought is often a wise almost always an honest one with whom did you suppose i meant to entrust my child that the idea called forth so anxious an expression  again i should ask your forgiveness said julian for meddling where i have little right to interfere but i saw a face here that is known to methe person calls himself ganlesseis it with him that you mean to entrust your daughter  even to the person who call himself ganlesse said bridgenorth without expressing either anger or surprise  and do you know to whom you commit a charge so precious to all who know her and so dear to yourself said julian  do you know who ask me the question answered bridgenorth  i own i do not answered julian but i have seen him in a character so different from that he now wears that i feel it my duty to warn you how you entrust the charge of your child to one who can alternately play the profligate or the hypocrite as it suits his own interest or humour  bridgenorth smiled contemptuously i might be angry he said with the officious zeal which supposes that its green conceptions can instruct my grey hairs but good julian i do but only ask from you the liberal construction that i who have had much converse with mankind know with whom i trust what is dearest to me he of whom thou speakest hath one visage to his friends though he may have others to the world living amongst those before whom honest features should be concealed under a grotesque vizard even as in the sinful sports of the day called maskings and mummeries where the wise if he show himself at all must be contented to play the apish and fantastic fool  i would only pray your wisdom to beware said julian of one who as he has a vizard for others may also have one which can disguise his real features from you yourself  this is being over careful young man replied bridgenorth more shortly than he had hitherto spoken if you would walk by my counsel you will attend to your own affairs which credit me deserve all your care and leave others to the management of theirs  this was too plain to be misunderstood and peveril was compelled to take his leave of bridgenorth and of moultrassie hall without farther parley or explanation the reader may imagine how oft he looked back and tried to guess amongst the lights which continued to twinkle in various parts of the building which sparkle it was that gleamed from the bower of alice when the road turned into another direction he sunk into deep reverie from which he was at length roused by the voice of lance who demanded where he intended to quarter for the night he was unprepared to answer the question but the honest keeper himself prompted a solution of the problem by requesting that he would occupy a spare bed in the lodge to which julian willingly agreed the rest of the inhabitants had retired to rest when they entered but dame ellesmere apprised by a messenger of her nephews hospitable intent had everything in the best readiness she could for the son of her ancient patron peveril betook himself to rest and notwithstanding so many subjects of anxiety slept soundly till the morning was far advanced  his slumbers were first broken by lance who had been long up and already active in his service he informed him that his horse arms and small cloakbag had been sent from the castle by one of major bridgenorths servants who brought a letter discharging from the majors service the unfortunate deborah debbitch and prohibiting her return to the hall the officer of the house of commons escorted by a strong guard had left martindale castle that morning early travelling in sir geoffreys carriagehis lady being also permitted to attend on him to this he had to add that the property at the castle was taken possession of by master winthefight the attorney from chesterfield with other officers of law in name of major bridgenorth a large creditor of the unfortunate knight  having told these jobs tidings lance paused and after a moments hesitation declared he was resolved to quit the country and go up to london along with his young master julian argued the point with him and insisted he had better stay to take charge of his aunt in case she should be disturbed by these strangers lance replied she would have one with her who would protect her well enough for there was wherewithal to buy protection amongst them but for himself he was resolved to follow master julian to the death  julian heartily thanked him for his love  nay it is not altogether out of love neither said lance though i am as loving as another but it is as it were partly out of fear lest i be called over the coals for last nights matter for as for the miners they will never trouble them as the creatures only act after their kind  i will write in your behalf to major bridgenorth who is bound to afford you protection if you have such fear said julian  nay for that matter it is not altogether fear more than altogether love answered the enigmatical keeper although it hath a tasting of both in it and to speak plain truth thus it isdame debbitch and naunt ellesmere have resolved to set up their horses together and have made up all their quarrels and of all ghosts in the world the worst is when an old truelove comes back to haunt a poor fellow like me mistress deborah though distressed enow for the loss of her place has been already speaking of a broken sixpence or some such token as if a man could remember such things for so many years even if she had not gone over seas like woodcock in the meanwhile  julian could scarce forbear laughing i thought you too much of a man lance to fear a woman marrying you whether you would or no  it has been many an honest mans luck for all that said lance and a woman in the very house has so many deuced opportunities and then there would be two upon one for naunt though high enough when any of your folks are concerned hath some look to the main chance and it seems mistress deb is as rich as a jew  and you lance said julian have no mind to marry for cake and pudding  no truly master answered lance unless i knew of what dough they were baked how the devil do i know how the jade came by so much and then if she speaks of tokens and lovepassages let her be the same tight lass i broke the sixpence with and i will be the same true lad to her but i never heard of true love lasting ten years and hers if it lives at all must be nearer twenty  well then lance said julian since you are resolved on the thing we will go to london together where if i cannot retain you in my service and if my father recovers not these misfortunes i will endeavour to promote you elsewhere  nay nay said lance i trust to be back to bonny martindale before it is long and to keep the greenwood as i have been wont to do for as to dame debbitch when they have not me for their common butt naunt and she will soon bend bows on each other so here comes old dame ellesmere with your breakfast i will but give some directions about the deer to rough ralph my helper and saddle my forest pony and your honours horse which is no prime one and we will be ready to trot  julian was not sorry for this addition to his establishment for lance had shown himself on the preceding evening a shrewd and bold fellow and attached to his master he therefore set himself to reconcile his aunt to parting with her nephew for some time her unlimited devotion for the family readily induced the old lady to acquiesce in his proposal though not without a gentle sigh over the ruins of a castle in the air which was founded on the wellsaved purse of mistress deborah debbitch at any rate she thought it was as well that lance should be out of the way of that bold longlegged beggarly trollop cis sellok but to poor deb herself the expatriation of lance whom she had looked to as a sailor to a port under his lee for which he can run if weather becomes foul was a second severe blow following close on her dismissal from the profitable service of major bridgenorth  julian visited the disconsolate damsel in hopes of gaining some light upon bridgenorths projects regarding his daughterthe character of this ganlesseand other matters with which her residence in the family might have made her acquainted but he found her by far too much troubled in mind to afford him the least information the name of ganlesse she did not seem to recollectthat of alice rendered her hystericalthat of bridgenorth furious she numbered up the various services she had rendered in the familyand denounced the plague of swartness to the linenof leanness to the poultryof dearth and dishonour to the housekeepingand of lingering sickness and early death to aliceall which evils she averred had only been kept off by her continued watchful and incessant caresthen again turning to the subject of the fugitive lance she expressed such a total contempt of that meanspirited fellow in a tone between laughing and crying as satisfied julian it was not a topic likely to act as a sedative and that therefore unless he made a longer stay than the urgent state of his affairs permitted he was not likely to find mistress deborah in such a state of composure as might enable him to obtain from her any rational or useful information  lance who goodnaturedly took upon himself the whole burden of dame debbitchs mental alienation or taking on as such fits of passio hysterica are usually termed in the country had too much feeling to present himself before the victim of her own sensibility and of his obduracy he therefore intimated to julian by his assistant ralph that the horses stood saddled behind the lodge and that all was ready for their departure  julian took the hint and they were soon mounted and clearing the road at a rapid trot in the direction of london but not by the most usual route julian calculated that the carriage in which his father was transported would travel slowly and it was his purpose if possible to get to london before it should arrive there in order to have time to consult with the friends of his family what measures should be taken in his fathers behalf  in this manner they advanced a days journey towards london at the conclusion of which julian found his restingplace in a small inn upon the road no one came at the first call to attend upon the guests and their horses although the house was well lighted up and there was a prodigious chattering in the kitchen such as can only be produced by a french cook when his mystery is in the very moment of projection it instantly occurred to julianso rare was the ministry of these gallic artists at that timethat the clamour he heard must necessarily be produced by the sieur chaubert on whose plats he had lately feasted along with smith and ganlesse  one or both of these were therefore probably in the little inn and if so he might have some opportunity to discover their real purpose and character how to avail himself of such a meeting he knew not but chance favoured him more than he could have expected  i can scarce receive you gentlefolks said the landlord who at length appeared at the door here be a sort of quality in my house tonight whom less than all will not satisfy nor all neither for that matter  we are but plain fellows landlord said julian we are bound for moseleymarket and can get no farther tonight any hole will serve us no matter what  why said the honest host if that be the case i must een put one of you behind the bar though the gentlemen have desired to be private the other must take heart of grace and help me at the tap  the tap for me said lance without waiting his masters decision it is an element which i could live and die in  the bar then for me said peveril and stepping back whispered to lance to exchange cloaks with him desirous if possible to avoid being recognised  the exchange was made in an instant and presently afterwards the landlord brought a light and as he guided julian into his hostelry cautioned him to sit quiet in the place where he should stow him and if he was discovered to say that he was one of the house and leave him to make it good you will hear what the gallants say he added but i think thou wilt carry away but little on it for when it is not french it is court gibberish and that is as hard to construe  the bar into which our hero was inducted on these conditions seemed formed with respect to the public room upon the principle of a citadel intended to observe and bridle a rebellious capital here sat the host on the saturday evenings screened from the observation of his guests yet with the power of observing both their wants and their behaviour and also that of overhearing their conversationa practice which he was much addicted to being one of that numerous class of philanthropists to whom their neighbours business is of as much consequence or rather more than their own  here he planted his new guest with a repeated caution not to disturb the gentlemen by speech or motion and a promise that he should be speedily accommodated with a cold buttock of beef and a tankard of homebrewed and here he left him with no other light than that which glimmered from the wellilluminated apartment within through a sort of shuttle which accommodated the landlord with a view into it  this situation inconvenient enough in itself was on the present occasion precisely what julian would have selected he wrapped himself in the weatherbeaten cloak of lance outram which had been stained by age and weather into a thousand variations from its original lincoln green and with as little noise as he could set himself to observe the two inmates who had engrossed to themselves the whole of the apartment which was usually open to the public they sat by a table well covered with such costly rarities as could only have been procured by much forecast and prepared by the exquisite mons chaubert to which both seemed to do much justice  julian had little difficulty in ascertaining that one of the travellers was as he had anticipated the master of the said chaubert or as he was called by ganlesse smith the other who faced him he had never seen before this last was dressed like a gallant of the first order his periwig indeed as he travelled on horseback did not much exceed in size the barwig of a modern lawyer but then the essence which he shook from it with every motion impregnated a whole apartment which was usually only perfumed by that vulgar herb tobacco his ridingcoat was laced in the newest and most courtly style and grammont himself might have envied the embroidery of his waistcoat and the peculiar cut of his breeches which buttoned above the knee permitting the shape of a very handsome leg to be completely seen this by the proprietor thereof had been stretched out upon a stool and he contemplated its proportions from time to time with infinite satisfaction  the conversation between these worthies was so interesting that we propose to assign to it another chapter     chapter xxvii           this is some creature of the elements          most like your seagull he can wheel and whistle          his screaming song een when the storm is loudest          take for his sheeted couch the restless foam          of the wild wavecrestslumber in the calm          and daily with the storm yet tis a gull          an arrant gull with all this                                                the champion  and here is to thee said the fashionable gallant whom we have described honest tom and a cup of welcome to thee out of loobyland why thou hast been so long in the country that thou hast got a bumpkinly clodcompelling sort of look thyself that greasy doublet fits thee as if it were thy reserved sundays apparel and the points seem as if they were staylaces bought for thy truelove marjory i marvel thou canst still relish a ragout methinks now to a stomach bound in such a jacket eggs and bacon were a diet more conforming  rally away my good lord while wit lasts answered his companion yours is not the sort of ammunition which will bear much expenditure or rather tell me news from court since we have met so opportunely  you would have asked me these an hour ago said the lord had not your very soul been under chauberts covered dishes you remembered kings affairs will keep cool and entremets must be eaten hot  not so my lord i only kept common talk whilst that eavesdropping rascal of a landlord was in the room so that now the coast is clear once more i pray you for news from court  the plot is nonsuited answered the courtiersir george wakeman acquittedthe witnesses discredited by the juryscroggs who ranted on one side is now ranting on tother  rat the plot wakeman witnesses papists and protestants all together do you think i care for such trash as thattill the plot comes up the palace backstair and gets possession of old rowleys own imagination i care not a farthing who believes or disbelieves i hang by him will bear me out  well then said the lord the next news is rochesters disgrace  disgracedhow and for what the morning i came off he stood as fair as any one  thats overthe epitaph has broken his neckand now he may write one for his own court favour for it is dead and buried   the epitaph alluded to is the celebrated epigram made by rochester     on charles ii it was composed at the kings request who     nevertheless resented its poignancy      the lines are well known       here lies our sovereign lord the king         whose word no man relies on       who never said a foolish thing         and never did a wise one  the epitaph exclaimed tom why i was by when it was made and it passed for an excellent good jest with him whom it was made upon  ay so it did amongst ourselves answered his companion but it got abroad and had a run like a millrace it was in every coffeehouse and in half the diurnals grammont translated it into french too and there is no laughing at so sharp a jest when it is dinned into your ears on all sides so disgraced is the author and but for his grace of buckingham the court would be as dull as my lord chancellors wig  or as the head it coverswell my lord the fewer at court there is the more room for those that can bustle there but there are two mainstrings of shaftesburys fiddle brokenthe popish plot fallen into discreditand rochester disgraced changeful timesbut here is to the little man who shall mend them  i apprehend you replied his lordship and meet your health with my love trust me my lord loves you and longs for younay i have done you reasonby your leave the cup is with me here is to his buxom grace of bucks  as blithe a peer said smith as ever turned night to day nay it shall be an overflowing bumper an you will and i will drink it super naculumand how stands the great madam   the duchess of portsmouth charles iis favourite mistress very     unpopular at the time of the popish plot as well from her     religion as her country being a frenchwoman and a catholic  stoutly against all change answered the lordlittle anthony can make nought of her   anthony ashley cooper earl of shaftesbury the politician and     intriguer of the period  then he shall bring her influence to nought hark in thine ear thou knowest here he whispered so low that julian could not catch the sound  know him answered the otherknow ned of the islandto be sure i do  he is the man that shall knot the great fiddlestrings that have snapped say i told you so and thereupon i give thee his health  and thereupon i pledge thee said the young nobleman which on any other argument i were loath to dothinking of ned as somewhat the cut of a villain  granted mangranted said the othera very thoroughpaced rascal but able my lord able and necessary and in this plan indispensablepshawthis champagne turns stronger as it gets older i think  hark mine honest fellow said the courtier i would thou wouldst give me some item of all this mystery thou hast it i know for whom do men entrust but trusty chiffinch  it is your pleasure to say so my lord answered smith whom we shall hereafter call by his real name of chiffinch with such drunken gravity for his speech had become a little altered by his copious libations in the course of the eveningfew men know more or say less than i do and it well becomes my station conticuere omnes as the grammar hath itall men should learn to hold their tongue  except with a friend tomexcept with a friend thou wilt never be such a dogbolt as to refuse a hint to a friend come you get too wise and statesmanlike for your officethe ligatures of thy most peasantly jacket there are like to burst with thy secret come undo a button man it is for the health of thy constitutionlet out a reef and let thy chosen friend know what is meditating thou knowest i am as true as thyself to little anthony if he can but get uppermost  if thou lordly infidel said chiffinchtalkst thou to me of ifsthere is neither if nor and in the matter the great madam shall be pulled a peg downthe great plot screwed a peg or two up thou knowest nedhonest ned had a brothers death to revenge  i have heard so said the nobleman and that his persevering resentment of that injury was one of the few points which seemed to be a sort of heathenish virtue in him  well continued chiffinch in manoeuvring to bring about this revenge which he hath laboured at many a day he hath discovered a treasure  whatin the isle of man said his companion  assure yourself of itshe is a creature so lovely that she needs but be seen to put down every one of the favourites from portsmouth and cleveland down to that threepenny baggage mistress nelly  by my word chiffinch said my lord that is a reinforcement after the fashion of thine own best tactics but bethink thee man to make such a conquest there wants more than a cherrycheek and a bright eyethere must be witwit man and manners and a little sense besides to keep influence when it is gotten  pshaw will you tell me what goes to this vocation said chiffinch here pledge me her health in a brimmernay you shall do it on knees toonever such a triumphant beauty was seeni went to church on purpose for the first time these ten yearsyet i lie it was not to church neitherit was to chapel  to chapelwhat the devil is she a puritan exclaimed the other courtier  to be sure she is do you think i would be accessory to bringing a papist into favour in these times when as my good lord said in the house there should not be a popish manservant nor a popish maidservant not so much as dog or cat left to bark or mew about the king   such was the extravagance of shaftesburys eloquence  but consider chiffie the dislikelihood of her pleasing said the noble courtierwhat old rowley with his wit and love of withis wildness and love of wildnesshe form a league with a silly scrupulous unidead puritannot if she were venus  thou knowest nought of the matter answered chiffinch i tell thee the fine contrast between the seeming saint and falling sinner will give zest to the old gentlemans inclination if i do not know him who doesher health my lord on your bare knee as you would live to be of the bedchamber  i pledge you most devoutly answered his friend but you have not told me how the acquaintance is to be made for you cannot i think carry her to whitehall  aha my dear lord you would have the whole secret but that i cannot affordi can spare a friend a peep at my ends but no one must look on the means by which they are achievedso saying he shook his drunken head most wisely  the villainous design which this discourse implied and which his heart told him was designed against alice bridgenorth stirred julian so extremely that he involuntarily shifted his posture and laid his hand on his sword hilt  chiffinch heard a rustling and broke off exclaiming harkzounds something movedi trust i have told the tale to no ears but thine  i will cut off any which have drunk in but a syllable of thy words said the nobleman and raising a candle he took a hasty survey of the apartment seeing nothing that could incur his menaced resentment he replaced the light and continuedwell suppose the belle louise de querouaille shoots from her high station in the firmament how will you rear up the downfallen plot againfor without that same plot think of it as thou wilt we have no change of handsand matters remain as they were with a protestant courtezan instead of a papistlittle anthony can but little speed without that plot of hisi believe in my conscience he begot it himself   charless principal mistress en titre she was created duchess     of portsmouth   shaftesbury himself is supposed to have said that he knew not who     was the inventor of the plot but that he himself had all the     advantage of the discovery  whoever begot it said chiffinch he hath adopted it and a thriving babe it has been to him well then though it lies out of my way i will play saint peter againup with tother key and unlock tother mystery  now thou speakest like a good fellow and i will with my own hands unwire this fresh flask to begin a brimmer to the success of thy achievement  well then continued the communicative chiffinch thou knowest that they have long had a nibbling at the old countess of derbyso ned was sent downhe owes her an old accompt thou knowestwith private instructions to possess himself of the island if he could by help of some of his old friends he hath ever kept up spies upon her and happy man was he to think his hour of vengeance was come so nigh but he missed his blow and the old girl being placed on her guard was soon in a condition to make ned smoke for it out of the island he came with little advantage for having entered it when by some meansfor the devil i think stands ever his friendhe obtained information concerning a messenger whom her old majesty of man had sent to london to make party in her behalf ned stuck himself to this fellowa raw halfbred lad son of an old blundering cavalier of the old stamp down in derbyshireand so managed the swain that he brought him to the place where i was waiting in anxious expectation of the pretty one i told you of by saint anthony for i will swear by no meaner oath i stared when i saw this great loutnot that the fellow is so illlooked neitheri stared likelikegood now help me to a simile  like saint anthonys pig an it were sleek said the young lord your eyes chiffie have the very blink of one but what hath all this to do with the plot hold i have had wine enough  you shall not balk me said chiffinch and a jingling was heard as if he were filling his comrades glass with a very unsteady hand heywhat the devil is the matteri used to carry my glass steadyvery steady  well but this stranger  why he swept at game and ragout as he would at spring beef or summer mutton never saw so unnurtured a cubknew no more what he ate than an infideli cursed him by my gods when i saw chauberts chefd oeuvres glutted down so indifferent a throat we took the freedom to spice his goblet a little and ease him of his packet of letters and the fool went on his way the next morning with a budget artificially filled with grey paper ned would have kept him in hopes to have made a witness of him but the boy was not of that mettle  how will you prove your letters said the courtier  la you there my lord said chiffinch one may see with half an eye for all your laced doublet that you have been of the family of furnivals before your brothers death sent you to court how prove the letterswhy we have but let the sparrow fly with a string round his footwe have him again so soon as we list  why thou art turned a very machiavel chiffinch said his friend but how if the youth proved restivei have heard these peak men have hot heads and hard hands  trouble not yourselfthat was cared for my lord said chiffinchhis pistols might bark but they could not bite  most exquisite chiffinch thou art turned micher as well as paddercanst both rob a man and kidnap him  micher and padderwhat terms be these said chiffinch methinks these are sounds to lug out upon you will have me angry to the degree of falling foulrobber and kidnapper  you mistake verb for nounsubstantive replied his lordship i said rob and kidnapa man may do either once and away without being professional  but not without spilling a little foolish noble blood or some such redcoloured gear said chiffinch starting up  oh yes said his lordship all this may be without these dire consequences and as you will find tomorrow when you return to england for at present you are in the land of champagne chiffie and that you may continue so i drink thee this parting cup to line thy nightcap  i do not refuse your pledge said chiffinch but i drink to thee in dudgeon and in hostilityit is cup of wrath and a gage of battle tomorrow by dawn i will have thee at point of fox wert thou the last of the savilleswhat the devil think you i fear you because you are a lord  not so chiffinch answered his companion i know thou fearest nothing but beans and bacon washed down with bumpkinlike beeradieu sweet chiffinchto bedchiffinchto bed  so saying he lifted a candle and left the apartment and chiffinch whom the last draught had nearly overpowered had just strength enough left to do the same muttering as he staggered out yes he shall answer itdawn of day dn meit is come alreadyyonders the dawnno dn me tis the fire glancing on the cursed red latticeit is the smell of the brandy in this cursed roomit could not be the winewell old rowley shall send me no more errands to the country againsteady steady  so saying he reeled out of the apartment leaving peveril to think over the extraordinary conversation he had just heard  the name of chiffinch the wellknown minister of charless pleasures was nearly allied to the part which he seemed about to play in the present intrigue but that christian whom he had always supposed a puritan as strict as his brotherinlaw bridgenorth should be associated with him in a plot so infamous seemed alike unnatural and monstrous the near relationship might blind bridgenorth and warrant him in confiding his daughter to such a mans charge but what a wretch he must be that could coolly meditate such an ignominious abuse of his trust in doubt whether he could credit for a moment the tale which chiffinch had revealed he hastily examined his packet and found that the sealskin case in which it had been wrapt up now only contained an equal quantity of waste paper if he had wanted farther confirmation the failure of the shot which he fired at bridgenorth and of which the wadding only struck him showed that his arms had been tampered with he examined the pistol which still remained charged and found that the ball had been drawn may i perish said he to himself amid these villainous intrigues but thou shalt be more surely loaded and to better purpose the contents of these papers may undo my benefactresstheir having been found on me may ruin my fatherthat i have been the bearer of them may cost in these fiery times my own lifethat i care least forthey form a branch of the scheme laid against the honour and happiness of a creature so innocent that it is almost sin to think of her within the neighbourhood of such infamous knaves i will recover the letters at all risksbut howthat is to be thought onlance is stout and trusty and when a bold deed is once resolved upon there never yet lacked the means of executing it  his host now entered with an apology for his long absence and after providing peveril with some refreshments invited him to accept for his nightquarters the accommodation of a remote hayloft which he was to share with his comrade professing at the same time he could hardly have afforded them this courtesy but out of deference to the exquisite talents of lance outram as assistant at the tap where indeed it seems probable that he as well as the admiring landlord did that evening contrive to drink nearly as much liquor as they drew  but lance was a seasoned vessel on whom liquor made no lasting impression so that when peveril awaked that trusty follower at dawn he found him cool enough to comprehend and enter into the design which he expressed of recovering the letters which had been abstracted from his person  having considered the whole matter with much attention lance shrugged grinned and scratched his head and at length manfully expressed his resolution well my naunt speaks truth in her old saw   he that serves peveril maunna be slack   neither for weather nor yet for wrack  and then again my good dame was wont to say that whenever peveril was in a broil outram was in a stew so i will never bear a base mind but even hold a part with you as my fathers have done with yours for four generations whatever more  spoken like a most gallant outram said julian and were we but rid of that puppy lord and his retinue we two could easily deal with the other three  two londoners and a frenchman said lancei would take them in mine own hand and as for my lord saville as they call him i heard word last night that he and all his men of gilded gingerbreadthat looked at an honest fellow like me as if they were the ore and i the drossare all to be off this morning to some races or suchlike junketings about tutbury it was that brought him down here where he met this other civetcat by accident  in truth even as lance spoke a trampling was heard of horses in the yard and from the hatch of their hayloft they beheld lord savilles attendants mustered and ready to set out as soon as he could make his appearance  so ho master jeremy said one of the fellows to a sort of principal attendant who just came out of the house methinks the wine has proved a sleeping cup to my lord this morning  no answered jeremy he hath been up before light writing letters for london and to punish thy irreverence thou jonathan shalt be the man to ride back with them  and so to miss the race said jonathan sulkily i thank you for this good turn good master jeremy and hang me if i forget it  farther discussion was cut short by the appearance of the young nobleman who as he came out of the inn said to jeremy these be the letters let one of the knaves ride to london for life and death and deliver them as directed and the rest of them get to horse and follow me  jeremy gave jonathan the packet with a malicious smile and the disappointed groom turned his horses head sullenly towards london while lord saville and the rest of his retinue rode briskly off in an opposite direction pursued by the benedictions of the host and his family who stood bowing and courtesying at the door in gratitude doubtless for the receipt of an unconscionable reckoning  it was full three hours after their departure that chiffinch lounged into the room in which they had supped in a brocade nightgown and green velvet cap turned up with the most costly brussels lace he seemed but half awake and it was with drowsy voice that he called for a cup of cold small beer his manner and appearance were those of a man who had wrestled hard with bacchus on the preceding evening and had scarce recovered the effects of his contest with the jolly god lance instructed by his master to watch the motions of the courtier officiously attended with the cooling beverage he called for pleading as an excuse to the landlord his wish to see a londoner in his morninggown and cap  no sooner had chiffinch taken his morning draught than he inquired after lord saville  his lordship was mounted and away by peep of dawn was lances reply  what the devil exclaimed chiffinch why this is scarce civilwhat off for the races with his whole retinue  all but one replied lance whom his lordship sent back to london with letters  to london with letters said chiffinch why i am for london and could have saved his express a labourbut stopholdi begin to recollectdn can i have blabbedi havei havei remember it all nowi have blabbed and to the very weasel of the court who sucks the yelk out of every mans secret furies and firethat my afternoons should ruin my mornings thusi must turn boon companion and good fellow in my cupsand have my confidences and my quarrelsmy friends and my enemies with a plague to me as if any one could do a man much good or harm but his own self his messenger must be stopped thoughi will put a spoke in his wheelhark ye drawerfellowcall my groom hithercall tom beacon  lance obeyed but failed not when he had introduced the domestic to remain in the apartment in order to hear what should pass betwixt him and his master  hark ye tom said chiffinch here are five pieces for you  whats to be done now i trow said tom without even the ceremony of returning thanks which he was probably well aware would not be received even in part payment of the debt he was incurring  mount your fleet nag tomride like the devilovertake the groom whom lord saville despatched to london this morninglame his horsebreak his bonesfill him as drunk as the baltic sea or do whatever may best and most effectively stop his journeywhy does the lout stand there without answering me dost understand me  why ay master chiffinch said tom and so i am thinking doth this honest man here who need not have heard quite so much of your counsel an it had been your will  i am bewitched this morning said chiffinch to himself or else the champagne runs in my head still my brain has become the very lowlands of hollanda gillcup would inundate ithark thee fellow he added addressing lance keep my counselthere is a wager betwixt lord saville and me which of us shall first have a letter in london here is to drink my health and bring luck on my side say nothing of it but help tom to his nagtom ere thou startest come for thy credentialsi will give thee a letter to the duke of bucks that may be evidence thou wert first in town  tom beacon ducked and exited and lance after having made some show of helping him to horse ran back to tell his master the joyful intelligence that a lucky accident had abated chiffinchs party to their own number  peveril immediately ordered his horses to be got ready and so soon as tom beacon was despatched towards london on a rapid trot had the satisfaction to observe chiffinch with his favourite chaubert mount to pursue the same journey though at a more moderate rate he permitted them to attain such a distance that they might be dogged without suspicion then paid his reckoning mounted his horse and followed keeping his men carefully in view until he should come to a place proper for the enterprise which he meditated  it had been peverils intention that when they came to some solitary part of the road they should gradually mend their pace until they overtook chaubertthat lance outram should then drop behind in order to assail the man of spits and stoves while he himself spurring onwards should grapple with chiffinch but this scheme presupposed that the master and servant should travel in the usual mannerthe latter riding a few yards behind the former whereas such and so interesting were the subjects of discussion betwixt chiffinch and the french cook that without heeding the rules of etiquette they rode on together amicably abreast carrying on a conversation on the mysteries of the table which the ancient comus or a modern gastronome might have listened to with pleasure it was therefore necessary to venture on them both at once  for this purpose when they saw a long tract of road before them unvaried by the least appearance of man beast or human habitation they began to mend their pace that they might come up to chiffinch without giving him any alarm by a sudden and suspicious increase of haste in this manner they lessened the distance which separated them till they were within about twenty yards when peveril afraid that chiffinch might recognise him at a nearer approach and so trust to his horses heels made lance the signal to charge  at the sudden increase of their speed and the noise with which it was necessarily attended chiffinch looked around but had time to do no more for lance who had pricked his pony which was much more speedy than julians horse into full gallop pushed without ceremony betwixt the courtier and his attendant and ere chaubert had time for more than one exclamation he upset both horse and frenchmanmorbleu thrilling from his tongue as he rolled on the ground amongst the various articles of his occupation which escaping from the budget in which he bore them lay tumbled upon the highway in strange disorder while lance springing from his palfrey commanded his foeman to be still under no less a penalty than that of death if he attempted to rise  before chiffinch could avenge his trusty followers downfall his own bridle was seized by julian who presented a pistol with the other hand and commanded him to stand or die  chiffinch though effeminate was no coward he stood still as commanded and said with firmness rogue you have taken me at surprise if you are highwaymen there is my purse do us no bodily harm and spare the budget of spices and sauces  look you master chiffinch said peveril this is no time for dallying i am no highwayman but a man of honour give me back that packet which you stole from me the other night or by all that is good i will send a brace of balls through you and search for it at leisure  what nightwhat packet answered chiffinch confused yet willing to protract the time for the chance of assistance or to put peveril off his guard i know nothing of what you mean if you are a man of honour let me draw my sword and i will do you right as a gentleman should do to another  dishonourable rascal said peveril you escape not in this manner you plundered me when you had me at odds and i am not the fool to let my advantage escape now that my turn is come yield up the packet and then if you will i will fight you on equal terms but first he reiterated yield up the packet or i will instantly send you where the tenor of your life will be hard to answer for  the tone of peverils voice the fierceness of his eye and the manner in which he held the loaded weapon within a handsbreadth of chiffinchs head convinced the last there was neither room for compromise nor time for trifling he thrust his hand into a side pocket of his cloak and with visible reluctance produced those papers and despatches with which julian had been entrusted by the countess of derby  they are five in number said julian and you have given me only four your life depends on full restitution  it escaped from my hand said chiffinch producing the missing documentthere it is now sir your pleasure is fulfilled unless he added sulkily you design either murder or farther robbery  base wretch said peveril withdrawing his pistol yet keeping a watchful eye on chiffinchs motions thou art unworthy any honest mans sword and yet if you dare draw your own as you proposed but now i am willing to give you a chance upon fair equality of terms  equality said chiffinch sneeringly yes a proper equalitysword and pistol against single rapier and two men upon one for chaubert is no fighter no sir i shall seek amends upon some more fitting occasion and with more equal weapons  by backbiting or by poison base pander said julian these are thy means of vengeance but mark mei know your vile purpose respecting a lady who is too worthy that her name should be uttered in such a worthless ear thou hast done me one injury and thou seest i have repaid it but prosecute this farther villainy and be assured i will put thee to death like a foul reptile whose very slaver is fatal to humanity rely upon this as if machiavel had sworn it for so surely as you keep your purpose so surely will i prosecute my revengefollow me lance and leave him to think on what i have told him  lance had after the first shock sustained a very easy part in this recontre for all he had to do was to point the butt of his whip in the manner of a gun at the intimidated frenchman who lying on his back and gazing at random on the skies had as little the power or purpose of resistance as any pig which had ever come under his own slaughterknife  summoned by his master from the easy duty of guarding such an unresisting prisoner lance remounted his horse and they both rode off leaving their discomfited antagonists to console themselves for their misadventure as they best could but consolation was hard to come by in the circumstances the french artist had to lament the dispersion of his spices and the destruction of his magazine of saucesan enchanter despoiled of his magic wand and talisman could scarce have been in more desperate extremity chiffinch had to mourn the downfall of his intrigue and its premature discovery to this fellow at least he thought i can have bragged nonehere my evil genius alone has betrayed me with this infernal discovery which may cost me so dear on all hands champagne had nought to do if there be a flask left unbroken i will drink it after dinner and try if it may not even yet suggest some scheme of redemption and of revenge  with this manly resolution he prosecuted his journey to london     chapter xxviii            a man so various that he seemd to be           not one but all mankinds epitome           stiff in opinionsalways in the wrong           was everything by starts but nothing long           who in the course of one revolving moon           was chemist fiddler statesman and buffoon           then all for women painting fiddling drinking           besides a thousand freaks that died in thinking                                                        dryden  we must now transport the reader to the magnificent hotel in street inhabited at this time by the celebrated george villiers duke of buckingham whom dryden has doomed to a painful immortality by the few lines which we have prefixed to this chapter amid the gay and licentious of the laughing court of charles the duke was the most licentious and most gay yet while expending a princely fortune a strong constitution and excellent talents in pursuit of frivolous pleasures he nevertheless nourished deeper and more extensive designs in which he only failed from want of that fixed purpose and regulated perseverance essential to all important enterprises but particularly in politics  it was long past noon and the usual hour of the dukes leveeif anything could be termed usual where all was irregularhad been long past his hall was filled with lackeys and footmen in the most splendid liveries the interior apartments with the gentlemen and pages of his household arrayed as persons of the first quality and in that respect rather exceeding than falling short of the duke in personal splendour but his antechamber in particular might be compared to a gathering of eagles to the slaughter were not the simile too dignified to express that vile race who by a hundred devices all tending to one common end live upon the wants of needy greatness or administer to the pleasures of summerteeming luxury or stimulate the wild wishes of lavish and wasteful extravagance by devising new modes and fresh motives of profusion there stood the projector with his mysterious brow promising unbounded wealth to whomsoever might choose to furnish the small preliminary sum necessary to change eggshells into the great arcanum there was captain seagull undertaker for a foreign settlement with the map under his arm of indian or american kingdoms beautiful as the primitive eden waiting the bold occupants for whom a generous patron should equip two brigantines and a flyboat thither came fast and frequent the gamesters in their different forms and calling this light young gay in appearance the thoughtless youth of wit and pleasurethe pigeon rather than the rookbut at heart the same sly shrewd coldblooded calculator as yonder old hardfeatured professor of the same science whose eyes are grown dim with watching of the dice at midnight and whose fingers are even now assisting his mental computation of chances and of odds the fine arts tooi would it were otherwisehave their professors amongst this sordid train the poor poet half ashamed in spite of habit of the part which he is about to perform and abashed by consciousness at once of his base motive and his shabby black coat lurks in yonder corner for the favourable moment to offer his dedication much better attired the architect presents his splendid vision of front and wings and designs a palace the expense of which may transfer his employer to a jail but uppermost of all the favourite musician or singer who waits on my lord to receive in solid gold the value of the dulcet sounds which solaced the banquet of the preceding evening  such and many such like were the morning attendants of the duke of buckinghamall genuine descendants of the daughter of the horseleech whose cry is give give  but the levee of his grace contained other and very different characters and was indeed as various as his own opinions and pursuits besides many of the young nobility and wealthy gentry of england who made his grace the glass at which they dressed themselves for the day and who learned from him how to travel with the newest and best grace the general road to ruin there were others of a graver characterdiscarded statesmen political spies opposition orators servile tools of administration men who met not elsewhere but who regarded the dukes mansion as a sort of neutral ground sure that if he was not of their opinion today this very circumstance rendered it most likely he should think with them tomorrow the puritans themselves did not shun intercourse with a man whose talents must have rendered him formidable even if they had not been united with high rank and an immense fortune several grave personages with black suits short cloaks and bandstrings of a formal cut were mingled as we see their portraits in a gallery of paintings among the gallants who ruffled in silk and embroidery it is true they escaped the scandal of being thought intimates of the duke by their business being supposed to refer to money matters whether these grave and professing citizens mixed politics with money lending was not known but it had been long observed that the jews who in general confine themselves to the latter department had become for some time faithful attendants at the dukes levee  it was hightide in the antechamber and had been so for more than an hour ere the dukes gentlemaninordinary ventured into his bedchamber carefully darkened so as to make midnight at noonday to know his graces pleasure his soft and serene whisper in which he asked whether it were his graces pleasure to rise was briefly and sharply answered by the counter questions who waitswhats oclock  it is jerningham your grace said the attendant it is one afternoon and your grace appointed some of the people without at eleven  who are theywhat do they want  a message from whitehall your grace  pshaw it will keep cold those who make all others wait will be the better of waiting in their turn were i to be guilty of illbreeding it should rather be to a king than a beggar  the gentlemen from the city  i am tired of themtired of their all cant and no religionall protestantism and no charity tell them to go to shaftesburyto aldersgate street with themthats the best market for their wares  jockey my lord from newmarket  let him ride to the devilhe has horse of mine and spurs of his own any more  the whole antechamber is full my lordknights and squires doctors and dicers  the dicers with their doctors in their pockets i presume        doctor a cant name for false dice  counts captains and clergymen  you are alliterative jerningham said the duke and that is a proof you are poetical hand me my writing things  getting half out of bedthrusting one arm into a brocade nightgown deeply furred with sables and one foot into a velvet slipper while the other pressed in primitive nudity the rich carpethis grace without thinking farther on the assembly without began to pen a few lines of a satirical poem then suddenly stoppedthrew the pen into the chimneyexclaimed that the humour was pastand asked his attendant if there were any letters jerningham produced a huge packet  what the devil said his grace do you think i will read all these i am like clarence who asked a cup of wine and was soused into a butt of sack i mean is there anything which presses  this letter your grace said jerningham concerning the yorkshire mortgage  did i not bid thee carry it to old gatheral my steward  i did my lord answered the other but gatheral says there are difficulties  let the usurers foreclose thenthere is no difficulty in that and out of a hundred manors i shall scarce miss one answered the duke and hark ye bring me my chocolate  nay my lord gatheral does not say it is impossibleonly difficult  and what is the use of him if he cannot make it easy but you are all born to make difficulties replied the duke  nay if your grace approves the terms in this schedule and pleases to sign it gatheral will undertake for the matter answered jerningham  and could you not have said so at first you blockhead said the duke signing the paper without looking at the contentswhat other letters and remember i must be plagued with no more business  billetsdoux my lordfive or six of them this left at the porters

appear to wear the livery of the muses  poetical once more jerningham he i mean who wrote the last lampoon said the duke  to whom your grace said you owed five pieces and a beating replied jerningham

oakaramintas wrath alone would overburden one pair of mortal shoulders  but my lord duke said his attendant this settle is so dull a rascal that nothing he can write will take   elkana settle the unworthy scribbler whom the envy of rochester     and others tried to raise to public estimation as a rival to     dryden a circumstance which has been the means of elevating him     to a very painful species of immortality  then as we have given him steel to head the arrow said the duke we will give him wings to waft it withwood he has enough of his own to make a shaft or bolt of hand me my own unfinished lampoongive it to him with the letterslet him make what he can of them all  my lord dukei crave pardonbut your graces style will be discovered and though the ladies names are not at the letters yet they will be traced  i would have it so you blockhead have you lived with me so long and cannot discover that the éclat of an intrigue is with me worth all the rest of it  but the danger my lord duke replied jerningham there are husbands brothers friends whose revenge may be awakened  and beaten to sleep again said buckingham haughtily i have black will and his cudgel for plebeian grumblers and those of quality i can deal with myself i lack breathing and exercise of late  but yet your grace  hold your peace fool i tell you that your poor dwarfish spirit cannot measure the scope of mine i tell thee i would have the course of my life a torrenti am weary of easy achievements and wish for obstacles that i can sweep before my irresistible course  another gentleman now entered the apartment i humbly crave your graces pardon he said but master christian is so importunate for admission instantly that i am obliged to take your graces pleasure  tell him to call three hours hence damn his politic pate that would make all men dance after his pipe  i thank thee for the compliment my lord duke said christian entering the apartment in somewhat a more courtly garb but with the same unpretending and undistinguished mien and in the same placid and indifferent manner with which he had accosted julian peveril upon different occasions during his journey to london it is precisely my present object to pipe to you and you may dance to your own profit if you will  on my word master christian said the duke haughtily the affair should be weighty that removes ceremony so entirely from betwixt us if it relates to the subject of our last conversation i must request our interview be postponed to some farther opportunity i am engaged in an affair of some weight then turning his back on christian he went on with his conversation with jerningham find the person you wot of and give him the papers and hark ye give him this gold to pay for the shaft of his arrowthe steelhead and peacocks wing we have already provided  this is all well my lord said christian calmly and taking his seat at the same time in an easychair at some distance but your graces levity is no match for my equanimity it is necessary i should speak with you and i will await your graces leisure in the apartment  very well sir said the duke peevishly if an evil is to be undergone the sooner it is over the betteri can take measures to prevent its being renewed so let me hear your errand without farther delay  i will wait till your graces toilette is completed said christian with the indifferent tone which was natural to him what i have to say must be between ourselves  begone jerningham and remain without till i call leave my doublet on the couchhow now i have worn this cloth of silver a hundred times  only twice if it please your grace replied jerningham  as well twenty timeskeep it for yourself or give it to my valet if you are too proud of your gentility  your grace has made better men than me wear your cast clothes said jerningham submissively  thou art sharp jerningham said the dukein one sense i have and i may again so now that pearlcoloured will do with the ribbon and george get away with theeand now that he is gone master christian may i once more crave your pleasure  my lord duke said christian you are a worshipper of difficulties in state affairs as in love matters  i trust you have been no eavesdropper master christian replied the duke it scarce argues the respect due to me or to my roof  i know not what you mean my lord replied christian  nay i care not if the whole world heard what i said but now to jerningham but to the matter replied the duke of buckingham  your grace is so much occupied with conquests over the fair and over the witty that you have perhaps forgotten what a stake you have in the little island of man  not a whit master christian i remember well enough that my roundheaded fatherinlaw fairfax had the island from the long parliament and was ass enough to quit hold of it at the restoration when if he had closed his clutches and held fast like a true bird of prey as he should have done he might have kept it for him and his it had been a rare thing to have had a little kingdommade laws of my ownhad my chamberlain with his white staffi would have taught jerningham in half a day to look as wise walk as stiffly and speak as silly as harry bennet  you might have done this and more if it had pleased your grace  ay and if it had pleased my grace thou ned christian shouldst have been the jack ketch of my dominions  i your jack ketch my lord said christian more in a tone of surprise than of displeasure  why ay thou hast been perpetually intriguing against the life of yonder poor old woman it were a kingdom to thee to gratify thy spleen with thy own hands  i only seek justice against the countess said christian  and the end of justice is always a gibbet said the duke  be it so answered christian well the countess is in the plot  the devil confound the plot as i believe he first invented it said the duke of buckingham i have heard of nothing else for months if one must go to hell i would it were by some new road and in gentlemens company i should not like to travel with oates bedloe and the rest of that famous cloud of witnesses  your grace is then resolved to forego all the advantages which may arise if the house of derby fall under forfeiture the grant to fairfax now worthily represented by your duchess revives and you become the lord and sovereign of man  in right of a woman said the duke but in troth my godly dame owes me some advantage for having lived the first year of our marriage with her and old black tom her grim fighting puritanic father a man might as well have married the devils daughter and set up housekeeping with his fatherinlaw   mary daughter of thomas lord fairfax was wedded to the duke of     buckingham whose versatility made him capable of rendering     himself for a time as agreeable to his fatherinlaw though a     rigid presbyterian as to the gay charles ii  i understand you are willing then to join your interest for a heave at the house of derby my lord duke  as they are unlawfully possessed of my wifes kingdom they certainly can expect no favour at my hand but thou knowest there is an interest at whitehall predominant over mine  that is only by your graces sufferance said christian  no no i tell thee a hundred times no said the duke rousing himself to anger at the recollection i tell thee that base courtezan the duchess of portsmouth hath impudently set herself to thwart and contradict me and charles has given me both cloudy looks and hard words before the court i would he could but guess what is the offence between her and me i would he knew but that but i will have her plumes picked or my name is not villiers a worthless french filledejoie to brave me thuschristian thou art right there is no passion so spiritstirring as revenge i will patronise the plot if it be but to spite her and make it impossible for the king to uphold her  as the duke spoke he gradually wrought himself into a passion and traversed the apartment with as much vehemence as if the only object he had on earth was to deprive the duchess of her power and favour with the king christian smiled internally to see him approach the state of mind in which he was most easily worked upon and judiciously kept silence until the duke called out to him in a pet well sir oracle you that have laid so many schemes to supplant this shewolf of gaul where are all your contrivances nowwhere is the exquisite beauty who was to catch the sovereigns eye at the first glancechiffinch hath he seen herand what does he say that exquisite critic in beauty and blankmange women and wine  he has seen and approves but has not yet heard her and her speech answers to all the rest we came here yesterday and today i intend to introduce chiffinch to her the instant he arrives from the country and i expect him every hour i am but afraid of the damsels peevish virtue for she hath been brought up after the fashion of our grandmothersour mothers had better sense  what so fair so young so quickwitted and so difficult said the duke by your leave you shall introduce me as well as chiffinch  that your grace may cure her of her intractable modesty said christian  why replied the duke it will but teach her to stand in her own light kings do not love to court and sue they should have their game run down for them  under your graces favour said christian this cannot benon omnibus dormioyour grace knows the classic allusion if this maiden become a princes favourite rank gilds the shame and the sin but to any under majesty she must not vail topsail  why thou suspicious fool i was but in jest said the duke do you think i would interfere to spoil a plan so much to my own advantage as that which you have laid before me  christian smiled and shook his head my lord he said i know your grace as well or better perhaps than you know yourself to spoil a wellconcerted intrigue by some cross stroke of your own would give you more pleasure than to bring it to a successful termination according to the plans of others but shaftesbury and all concerned have determined that our scheme shall at least have fair play we reckon therefore on your help andforgive me when i say sowe will not permit ourselves to be impeded by your levity and fickleness of purpose  whoi light and fickle of purpose said the duke you see me here as resolved as any of you to dispossess the mistress and to carry on the plot these are the only two things i live for in this world no one can play the man of business like me when i please to the very filing and labelling of my letters i am regular as a scrivener  you have chiffinchs letter from the country he told me he had written to you about some passages betwixt him and the young lord saville  he did sohe did so said the duke looking among his letters but i see not his letter just nowi scarcely noted the contentsi was busy when it camebut i have it safely  you should have acted on it answered christian the fool suffered himself to be choused out of his secret and prayed you to see that my lords messenger got not to the duchess with some despatches which he sent up from derbyshire betraying our mystery  the duke was now alarmed and rang the bell hastily jerningham appeared where is the letter i had from master chiffinch some hours since  if it be not amongst those your grace has before you i know nothing of it said jerningham i saw none such arrive  you lie you rascal said buckingham have you a right to remember better than i do  if your grace will forgive me reminding you you have scarce opened a letter this week said his gentleman  did you ever hear such a provoking rascal said the duke he might be a witness in the plot he has knocked my character for regularity entirely on the head with his damned counterevidence  your graces talent and capacity will at least remain unimpeached said christian and it is those that must serve yourself and your friends if i might advise you will hasten to court and lay some foundation for the impression we wish to make if your grace can take the first word and throw out a hint to crossbite saville it will be well but above all keep the kings ear employed which no one can do so well as you leave chiffinch to fill his heart with a proper object another thing is there is a blockhead of an old cavalier who must needs be a bustler in the countess of derbys behalfhe is fast in hold with the whole tribe of witnesses at his haunches  nay then take him topham  topham has taken him already my lord said christian and there is besides a young gallant a son of the said knight who was bred in the household of the countess of derby and who has brought letters from her to the provincial of the jesuits and others in london  what are their names said the duke dryly  sir geoffrey peveril of martindale castle in derbyshire and his son julian  what peveril of the peak said the dukea stout old cavalier as ever swore an oatha worcesterman tooand in truth a man of all work when blows were going i will not consent to his ruin christian these fellows must be flogged of such false scentsflogged in every sense they must and will be when the nation comes to its eyesight again  it is of more than the last importance in the meantime to the furtherance of our plan said christian that your grace should stand for a space between them and the kings favour the youth hath influence with the maiden which we should find scarce favourable to our views besides her father holds him as high as he can any one who is no such puritanic fool as himself  well most christian christian said the duke i have heard your commands at length i will endeavour to stop the earths under the throne that neither the lord knight nor squire in question shall find it possible to burrow there for the fair one i must leave chiffinch and you to manage her introduction to her high destinies since i am not to be trusted adieu most christian christian  he fixed his eyes on him and then exclaimed as he shut the door of the apartmentmost profligate and damnable villain and what provokes me most of all is the knaves composed insolence your grace will do thisand your grace will condescend to do thata pretty puppet i should be to play the second part or rather the third in such a scheme no they shall all walk according to my purpose or i will cross them i will find this girl out in spite of them and judge if their scheme is likely to be successful if so she shall be minemine entirely before she becomes the kings and i will command her who is to guide charlesjerningham his gentleman entered cause christian to be dogged whereever he goes for the next fourandtwenty hours and find out where he visits a female newly come to townyou smile you knave  i did but suspect a fresh rival to araminta and the little countess said jerningham  away to your business knave said the duke and let me think of mineto subdue a puritan in essea kings favourite in possethe very muster of western beautiesthat is point first the impudence of this manx mongrel to be correctedthe pride of madame la duchesse to be pulled downand important state intrigue to be farthered or baffled as circumstances render most to my own honour and gloryi wished for business but now and i have got enough of it but buckingham will keep his own steerageway through shoal and through weather     chapter xxix              mark you this bassanio             the devil can quote scripture for his purpose                                        merchant of venice  after leaving the proud mansion of the duke of buckingham christian full of the deep and treacherous schemes which he meditated hastened to the city where in a decent inn kept by a person of his own persuasion he had been unexpectedly summoned to meet with ralph bridgenorth of moultrassie he was not disappointedthe major had arrived that morning and anxiously expected him the usual gloom of his countenance was darkened into a yet deeper shade of anxiety which was scarcely relieved even while in answer to his inquiry after his daughter christian gave the most favourable account of her health and spirits naturally and unaffectedly intermingled with such praises of her beauty and her disposition as were likely to be most grateful to a fathers ear  but christian had too much cunning to expatiate on this theme however soothing he stopped short exactly at the point where as an affectionate relative he might be supposed to have said enough the lady he said with whom he had placed alice was delighted with her aspect and manners and undertook to be responsible for her health and happiness he had not he said deserved so little confidence at the hand of his brother bridgenorth as that the major should contrary to his purpose and to the plan which they had adjusted together have hurried up from the country as if his own presence were necessary for alices protection  brother christian said bridgenorth in reply i must see my childi must see this person with whom she is entrusted  to what purpose answered christian have you not often confessed that the over excess of the carnal affection which you have entertained for your daughter hath been a snare to youhave you not more than once been on the point of resigning those great designs which should place righteousness as a counsellor beside the throne because you desired to gratify your daughters girlish passion for this descendant of your old persecutorthis julian peveril  i own it said bridgenorth and worlds would i have given and would yet give to clasp that youth to my bosom and call him my son the spirit of his mother looks from his eye and his stately step is as that of his father when he daily spoke comfort to me in my distress and said the child liveth  but the youth walks said christian after his own lights and mistakes the meteor of the marsh for the polar star ralph bridgenorth i will speak to thee in friendly sincerity thou must not think to serve both the good cause and baal obey if thou wilt thine own carnal affections summon this julian peveril to thy house and let him wed thy daughterbut mark the reception she will meet with from the proud old knight whose spirit is now even now as little broken with his chains as after the sword of the saints had prevailed at worcester thou wilt see thy daughter spurned from his feet like an outcast  christian said bridgenorth interrupting him thou dost urge me hard but thou dost it in love my brother and i forgive theealice shall never be spurnedbut this friend of thinethis ladythou art my childs uncle and after me thou art next to her in love and affectionstill thou art not her fatherhast not her fathers fears art thou sure of the character of this woman to whom my child is entrusted  am i sure of my ownam i sure that my name is christianyours bridgenorthis it a thing i am likely to be insecure inhave i not dwelt for many years in this citydo i not know this courtand am i likely to be imposed upon for i will not think you can fear my imposing upon you  thou art my brother said bridgenorththe blood and bone of my departed saintand i am determined that i will trust thee in this matter  thou dost well said christian and who knows what reward may be in store for theei cannot look upon alice but it is strongly borne in on my mind that there will be work for a creature so excellent beyond ordinary women courageous judith freed bethulia by her valour and the comely features of esther made her a safeguard and a defence to her people in the land of captivity when she found favour in the sight of king ahasuerus  be it with her as heaven wills said bridgenorth and now tell me what progress there is in the great work  the people are weary of the iniquity of this court said christian and if this man will continue to reign it must be by calling to his councils men of another stamp the alarm excited by the damnable practices of the papists has called up mens souls and awakened their eyes to the dangers of their statehe himselffor he will give up brother and wife to save himselfis not averse to a change of measures and though we cannot at first see the court purged as with a winnowing fan yet there will be enough of the good to control the badenough of the sober party to compel the grant of that universal toleration for which we have sighed so long as a maiden for her beloved time and opportunity will lead the way to more thorough reformation and that will be done without stroke of sword which our friends failed to establish on a sure foundation even when their victorious blades were in their hands  may god grant it said bridgenorth for i fear me i should scruple to do aught which should once more unsheath the civil sword but welcome all that comes in a peaceful and parliamentary way  ay said christian and which will bring with it the bitter amends which our enemies have so long merited at our hands how long hath our brothers blood cried for vengeance from the altarnow shall that cruel frenchwoman find that neither lapse of years nor her powerful friends nor the name of stanley nor the sovereignty of man shall stop the stern course of the pursuer of blood her name shall be struck from the noble and her heritage shall another take  nay but brother christian said bridgenorth art thou not over eager in pursuing this thingit is thy duty as a christian to forgive thine enemies  ay but not the enemies of heavennot those who shed the blood of the saints said christian his eyes kindling that vehement and fiery expression which at times gave to his uninteresting countenance the only character of passion which it ever exhibited no bridgenorth he continued i esteem this purpose of revenge holyi account it a propitiatory sacrifice for what may have been evil in my life i have submitted to be spurned by the haughtyi have humbled myself to be as a servant but in my breast was the proud thought i who do thisdo it that i may avenge my brothers blood  still my brother said bridgenorth although i participate thy purpose and have aided thee against this moabitish woman i cannot but think thy revenge is more after the law of moses than after the law of love  this comes well from thee ralph bridgenorth answered christian from thee who has just smiled over the downfall of thine own enemy  if you mean sir geoffrey peveril said bridgenorth i smile not on his ruin it is well he is abased but if it lies with me i may humble his pride but will never ruin his house  you know your purpose best said christian and i do justice brother bridgenorth to the purity of your principles but men who see with but worldly eyes would discern little purpose of mercy in the strict magistrate and severe creditorand such have you been to peveril  and brother christian said bridgenorth his colour rising as he spoke neither do i doubt your purpose nor deny the surprising address with which you have procured such perfect information concerning the purposes of yonder woman of ammon but it is free to me to think that in your intercourse with the court and with courtiers you may in your carnal and worldly policy sink the value of those spiritual gifts for which you were once so much celebrated among the brethren  do not apprehend it said christian recovering his temper which had been a little ruffled by the previous discussion let us but work together as heretofore and i trust each of us shall be found doing the work of a faithful servant to that good old cause for which we have heretofore drawn the sword  so saying he took his hat and bidding bridgenorth farewell declared his intention of returning in the evening  fare thee well said bridgenorth to that cause wilt thou find me ever a true and devoted adherent i will act by that counsel of thine and will not even ask theethough it may grieve my heart as a parentwith whom or where thou hast entrusted my child i will try to cut off and cast from me even my right hand and my right eye but for thee christian if thou dost deal otherwise than prudently and honestly in this matter it is what god and man will require at thy hand  fear not me said christian hastily and left the place agitated by reflections of no pleasant kind  i ought to have persuaded him to return he said as he stepped out into the street even his hovering in this neighbourhood may spoil the plan on which depends the rise of my fortunesay and of his childs will men say i have ruined her when i shall have raised her to the dazzling height of the duchess of portsmouth and perhaps made her a mother to a long line of princes chiffinch hath vouched for opportunity and the voluptuarys fortune depends upon his gratifying the taste of his master for variety if she makes an impression it must be a deep one and once seated in his affections i fear not her being supplantedwhat will her father say will he like a prudent man put his shame in his pocket because it is well gilded or will he think it fitting to make a display of moral wrath and parental frenzy i fear the latterhe has ever kept too strict a course to admit his conniving at such licence but what will his anger availi need not be seen in the matterthose who are will care little for the resentment of a country puritan and after all what i am labouring to bring about is best for himself the wench and above all for me edward christian  with such base opiates did this unhappy wretch stifle his own conscience while anticipating the disgrace of his friends family and the ruin of a near relative committed in confidence to his charge the character of this man was of no common description nor was it by an ordinary road that he had arrived at the present climax of unfeeling and infamous selfishness  edward christian as the reader is aware was the brother of that william christian who was the principal instrument in delivering up the isle of man to the republic and who became the victim of the countess of derbys revenge on that account both had been educated as puritans but william was a soldier which somewhat modified the strictness of his religious opinions edward a civilian seemed to entertain these principles in the utmost rigour but it was only seeming the exactness of deportment which procured him great honour and influence among the sober party as they were wont to term themselves covered a voluptuous disposition the gratification of which was sweet to him as stolen waters and pleasant as bread eaten in secret while therefore his seeming godliness brought him worldly gain his secret pleasures compensated for his outward austerity until the restoration and the countesss violent proceedings against his brother interrupted the course of both he then fled from his native island burning with the desire of revenging his brothers deaththe only passion foreign to his own gratification which he was ever known to cherish and which was also at least partly selfish since it concerned the restoration of his own fortunes  he found easy access to villiers duke of buckingham who in right of his duchess claimed such of the derby estate as had been bestowed by the parliament on his celebrated fatherinlaw lord fairfax his influence at the court of charles where a jest was a better plea than a long claim of faithful service was so successfully exerted as to contribute greatly to the depression of that loyal and illrewarded family but buckingham was incapable even for his own interest of pursuing the steady course which christian suggested to him and his vacillation probably saved the remnant of the large estates of the earl of derby  meantime christian was too useful a follower to be dismissed from buckingham and others of that stamp he did not affect to conceal the laxity of his morals but towards the numerous and powerful party to which he belonged he was able to disguise them by a seeming gravity of exterior which he never laid aside indeed so wide and absolute was then the distinction betwixt the court and the city that a man might have for some time played two several parts as in two different spheres without its being discovered in the one that he exhibited himself in a different light in the other besides when a man of talent shows himself an able and useful partisan his party will continue to protect and accredit him in spite of conduct the most contradictory to their own principles some facts are in such cases deniedsome are glossed overand party zeal is permitted to cover at least as many defects as ever doth charity  edward christian had often need of the partial indulgence of his friends but he experienced it for he was eminently useful buckingham and other courtiers of the same class however dissolute in their lives were desirous of keeping some connection with the dissenting or puritanic party as it was termed thereby to strengthen themselves against their opponents at court in such intrigues christian was a notable agent and at one time had nearly procured an absolute union between a class which professed the most rigid principles of religion and morality and the latitudinarian courtiers who set all principle at defiance  amidst the vicissitudes of a life of intrigue during which buckinghams ambitious schemes and his own repeatedly sent him across the atlantic it was edward christians boast that he never lost sight of his principal objectrevenge on the countess of derby he maintained a close and intimate correspondence with his native island so as to be perfectly informed of whatever took place there and he stimulated on every favourable opportunity the cupidity of buckingham to possess himself of this petty kingdom by procuring the forfeiture of its present lord it was not difficult to keep his patrons wild wishes alive on this topic for his own mercurial imagination attached particular charms to the idea of becoming a sort of sovereign even in this little island and he was like catiline as covetous of the property of others as he was profuse of his own  but it was not until the pretended discovery of the papist plot that the schemes of christian could be brought to ripen and then so odious were the catholics in the eyes of the credulous people of england that upon the accusation of the most infamous of mankind common informers the scourings of jails and the refuse of the whippingpost the most atrocious charges against persons of the highest rank and fairest character were readily received and credited  this was a period which christian did not fail to improve he drew close his intimacy with bridgenorth which had indeed never been interrupted and readily engaged him in his schemes which in the eyes of his brotherinlaw were alike honourable and patriotic but while he flattered bridgenorth with the achieving a complete reformation in the statechecking the profligacy of the courtrelieving the consciences of the dissenters from the pressures of the penal lawsamending in fine the crying grievances of the timewhile he showed him also in prospect revenge upon the countess of derby and a humbling dispensation on the house of peveril from whom bridgenorth had suffered such indignity christian did not neglect in the meanwhile to consider how he could best benefit himself by the confidence reposed in him by his unsuspicious relation  the extreme beauty of alice bridgenorththe great wealth which time and economy had accumulated on her fatherpointed her out as a most desirable match to repair the wasted fortunes of some of the followers of the court and he flattered himself that he could conduct such a negotiation so as to be in a high degree conducive to his own advantage he found there would be little difficulty in prevailing on major bridgenorth to entrust him with the guardianship of his daughter that unfortunate gentleman had accustomed himself from the very period of her birth to regard the presence of his child as a worldly indulgence too great to be allowed to him and christian had little trouble in convincing him that the strong inclination which he felt to bestow her on julian peveril provided he could be brought over to his own political opinions was a blameable compromise with his more severe principles late circumstances had taught him the incapacity and unfitness of dame debbitch for the sole charge of so dear a pledge and he readily and thankfully embraced the kind offer of her maternal uncle christian to place alice under the protection of a lady of rank in london whilst he himself was to be engaged in the scenes of bustle and blood which in common with all good protestants he expected was speedily to take place on a general rising of the papists unless prevented by the active and energetic measures of the good people of england he even confessed his fears that his partial regard for alices happiness might enervate his efforts in behalf of his country and christian had little trouble in eliciting from him a promise that he would forbear to inquire after her for some time  thus certain of being the temporary guardian of his niece for a space long enough he flattered himself for the execution of his purpose christian endeavoured to pave the way by consulting chiffinch whose known skill in court policy qualified him best as an adviser on this occasion but this worthy person being in fact a purveyor for his majestys pleasures and on that account high in his good graces thought it fell within the line of his duty to suggest another scheme than that on which christian consulted him a woman of such exquisite beauty as alice was described he deemed more worthy to be a partaker of the affections of the merry monarch whose taste in female beauty was so exquisite than to be made the wife of some wornout prodigal of quality and then doing perfect justice to his own character he felt it would not be one whit impaired while his fortune would be in every respect greatly amended if after sharing the short reign of the gwyns the davises the robertses and so forth alice bridgenorth should retire from the state of a royal favourite into the humble condition of mrs chiffinch  after cautiously sounding christian and finding that the near prospect of interest to himself effectually prevented his starting at this iniquitous scheme chiffinch detailed it to him fully carefully keeping the final termination out of sight and talking of the favour to be acquired by the fair alice as no passing caprice but the commencement of a reign as long and absolute as that of the duchess of portsmouth of whose avarice and domineering temper charles was now understood to be much tired though the force of habit rendered him unequal to free himself of her yoke  thus chalked out the scene prepared was no longer the intrigue of a court pander and a villainous resolution for the ruin of an innocent girl but became a state intrigue for the removal of an obnoxious favourite and the subsequent change of the kings sentiments upon various material points in which he was at present influenced by the duchess of portsmouth in this light it was exhibited to the duke of buckingham who either to sustain his character for daring gallantry or in order to gratify some capricious fancy had at one time made love to the reigning favourite and experienced a repulse which he had never forgiven  but one scheme was too little to occupy the active and enterprising spirit of the duke an appendix of the popish plot was easily so contrived as to involve the countess of derby who from character and religion was precisely the person whom the credulous part of the public were inclined to suppose the likely accomplice of such a conspiracy christian and bridgenorth undertook the perilous commission of attacking her even in her own little kingdom of man and had commissions for this purpose which were only to be produced in case of their scheme taking effect  it miscarried as the reader is aware from the countesss alert preparations for defence and neither christian nor bridgenorth held it sound policy to practise openly even under parliamentary authority against a lady so little liable to hesitate upon the measures most likely to secure her feudal sovereignty wisely considering that even the omnipotence as it has been somewhat too largely styled of parliament might fail to relieve them from the personal consequences of a failure  on the continent of britain however no opposition was to be feared and so well was christian acquainted with all the motions in the interior of the countesss little court or household that peveril would have been arrested the instant he set foot on shore but for the gale of wind which obliged the vessel in which he was a passenger to run for liverpool here christian under the name of ganlesse unexpectedly met with him and preserved him from the fangs of the wellbreathed witnesses of the plot with the purpose of securing his despatches or if necessary his person also in such a manner as to place him at his own discretiona narrow and perilous game which he thought it better however to undertake than to permit these subordinate agents who were always ready to mutiny against all in league with them to obtain the credit which they must have done by the seizure of the countess of derbys despatches it was besides essential to buckinghams schemes that these should not pass into the hands of a public officer like topham who however pompous and stupid was upright and wellintentioned until they had undergone the revisal of a private committee where something might have probably been suppressed even supposing that nothing had been added in short christian in carrying on his own separate and peculiar intrigue by the agency of the great popish plot as it was called acted just like an engineer who derives the principle of motion which turns his machinery by means of a steamengine or large waterwheel constructed to drive a separate and larger engine accordingly he was determined that while he took all the advantage he could from their supposed discoveries no one should be admitted to tamper or interfere with his own plans of profit and revenge  chiffinch who desirous of satisfying himself with his own eyes of that excellent beauty which had been so highly extolled had gone down to derbyshire on purpose was infinitely delighted when during the course of a two hours sermon at the dissenting chapel in liverpool which afforded him ample leisure for a deliberate survey he arrived at the conclusion that he had never seen a form or face more captivating his eyes having confirmed what was told him he hurried back to the little inn which formed their place of rendezvous and there awaited christian and his niece with a degree of confidence in the success of their project which he had not before entertained and with an apparatus of luxury calculated as he thought to make a favourable impression on the mind of a rustic girl he was somewhat surprised when instead of alice bridgenorth to whom he expected that night to have been introduced he found that christian was accompanied by julian peveril it was indeed a severe disappointment for he had prevailed on his own indolence to venture this far from the court in order that he might judge with his own paramount taste whether alice was really the prodigy which her uncles praises had bespoken her and as such a victim worthy of the fate to which she was destined  a few words betwixt the worthy confederates determined them on the plan of stripping peveril of the countesss despatches chiffinch absolutely refusing to take any share in arresting him as a matter of which his masters approbation might be very uncertain  christian had also his own reasons for abstaining from so decisive a step it was by no means likely to be agreeable to bridgenorth whom it was necessary to keep in good humourit was not necessary for the countesss despatches were of far more importance than the person of julian lastly it was superfluous in this respect also that julian was on the road to his fathers castle where it was likely he would be seized as a matter of course along with the other suspicious persons who fell under tophams warrant and the denunciations of his infamous companions he therefore far from using any violence to peveril assumed towards him such a friendly tone as might seem to warn him against receiving damage from others and vindicate himself from having any share in depriving him of his charge this last manoeuvre was achieved by an infusion of a strong narcotic into julians wine under the influence of which he slumbered so soundly that the confederates were easily able to accomplish their inhospitable purpose  the events of the succeeding days are already known to the reader chiffinch set forward to return to london with the packet which it was desirable should be in buckinghams hands as soon as possible while christian went to moultrassie to receive alice from her father and convey her safely to londonhis accomplice agreeing to defer his curiosity to see more of her until they should have arrived in that city  before parting with bridgenorth christian had exerted his utmost address to prevail on him to remain at moultrassie he had even overstepped the bounds of prudence and by his urgency awakened some suspicions of an indefinite nature which he found it difficult to allay bridgenorth therefore followed his brotherinlaw to london and the reader has already been made acquainted with the arts which christian used to prevent his farther interference with the destinies of his daughter or the unhallowed schemes of her illchosen guardian still christian as he strode along the street in profound reflection saw that his undertaking was attended with a thousand perils and the drops stood like beads on his brow when he thought of the presumptuous levity and fickle temper of buckinghamthe frivolity and intemperance of chiffinchthe suspicions of the melancholy and bigoted yet sagacious and honest bridgenorth had i he thought but tools fitted each to their portion of the work how easily could i heave asunder and disjoint the strength that opposes me but with these frail and insufficient implements i am in daily hourly momentary danger that one lever or other gives way and that the whole ruin recoils on my own head and yet were it not for those failings i complain of how were it possible for me to have acquired that power over them all which constitutes them my passive tools even when they seem most to exert their own free will yes the bigots have some right when they affirm that all is for the best  it may seem strange that amidst the various subjects of christians apprehension he was never visited by any long or permanent doubt that the virtue of his niece might prove the shoal on which his voyage should be wrecked but he was an arrant rogue as well as a hardened libertine and in both characters a professed disbeliever in the virtue of the fair sex     chapter xxx              as for john drydens charles i own that king             was never any very mighty thing             and yet he was a devilish honest fellow             enjoyd his friend and bottle and got mellow                                                dr woloot  london the grand central point of intrigues of every description had now attracted within its dark and shadowy region the greater number of the personages whom we have had occasion to mention  julian peveril amongst others of the dramatis personæ had arrived and taken up his abode in a remote inn in the suburbs his business he conceived was to remain incognito until he should have communicated in private with the friends who were most likely to lend assistance to his parents as well as to his patroness in their present situation of doubt and danger amongst these the most powerful was the duke of ormond whose faithful services high rank and acknowledged worth and virtue still preserved an ascendancy in that very court where in general he was regarded as out of favour indeed so much consciousness did charles display in his demeanour towards that celebrated noble and servant of his father that buckingham once took the freedom to ask the king whether the duke of ormond had lost his majestys favour or his majesty the dukes since whenever they chanced to meet the king appeared the more embarrassed of the two but it was not peverils good fortune to obtain the advice or countenance of this distinguished person his grace of ormond was not at that time in london  the letter about the delivery of which the countess had seemed most anxious after that to the duke of ormond was addressed to captain barstow a jesuit whose real name was fenwicke to be found or at least to be heard of in the house of one martin christal in the savoy to this place hastened peveril upon learning the absence of the duke of ormond he was not ignorant of the danger which he personally incurred by thus becoming a medium of communication betwixt a popish priest and a suspected catholic but when he undertook the perilous commission of his patroness he had done so frankly and with the unreserved resolution of serving her in the manner in which she most desired her affairs to be conducted yet he could not forbear some secret apprehension when he felt himself engaged in the labyrinth of passages and galleries which led to different obscure sets of apartments in the ancient building termed the savoy  this antiquated and almost ruinous pile occupied a part of the site of the public offices in the strand commonly called somerset house the savoy had been formerly a palace and took its name from an earl of savoy by whom it was founded it had been the habitation of john of gaunt and various persons of distinctionhad become a convent an hospital and finally in charles iis time a waste of dilapidated buildings and ruinous apartments inhabited chiefly by those who had some connection with or dependence upon the neighbouring palace of somerset house which more fortunate than the savoy had still retained its royal title and was the abode of a part of the court and occasionally of the king himself who had apartments there  it was not without several inquiries and more than one mistake that at the end of a long and dusky passage composed of boards so wasted by time that they threatened to give way under his feet julian at length found the name of martin christal broker and appraiser upon a shattered door he was about to knock when some one pulled his cloak and looking round to his great astonishment which indeed almost amounted to fear he saw the little mute damsel who had accompanied him for a part of the way on his voyage from the isle of man  fenella he exclaimed forgetting that she could neither hear nor replyfenella can this be you  fenella assuming the air of warning and authority which she had heretofore endeavoured to adopt towards him interposed betwixt julian and the door at which he was about to knockpointed with her finger towards it in a prohibiting manner and at the same time bent her brows and shook her head sternly  after a moments consideration julian could place but one interpretation upon fenellas appearance and conduct and that was by supposing her lady had come up to london and had despatched this mute attendant as a confidential person to apprise him of some change of her intended operations which might render the delivery of her letters to barstow alias fenwicke superfluous or perhaps dangerous he made signs to fenella demanding to know whether she had any commission from the countess she nodded had she any letter he continued by the same mode of inquiry she shook her head impatiently and walking hastily along the passage made a signal to him to follow he did so having little doubt that he was about to be conducted into the countesss presence but his surprise at first excited by fenellas appearance was increased by the rapidity and ease with which she seemed to track the dusky and decayed mazes of the dilapidated savoy equal to that with which he had seen her formerly lead the way through the gloomy vaults of castle rushin in the isle of man  when he recollected however that fenella had accompanied the countess on a long visit to london it appeared not improbable that she might then have acquired this local knowledge which seemed so accurate many foreigners dependent on queen or queen dowager had apartments in the savoy many catholic priests also found refuge in its recesses under various disguises and in defiance of the severity of the laws against popery what was more likely than that the countess of derby a catholic and a frenchwoman should have had secret commissions amongst such people and that the execution of such should be entrusted at least occasionally to fenella  thus reflecting julian continued to follow her light and active footsteps as she glided from the strand to springgarden and thence into the park  it was still early in the morning and the mall was untenanted save by a few walkers who frequented these shades for the wholesome purposes of air and exercise splendour gaiety and display did not come forth at that period until noon was approaching all readers have heard that the whole space where the horse guards are now built made in the time of charles ii a part of st jamess park and that the old building now called the treasury was a part of the ancient palace of whitehall which was thus immediately connected with the park the canal had been constructed by the celebrated le notre for the purpose of draining the park and it communicated with the thames by a decoy stocked with a quantity of the rarer waterfowl it was towards this decoy that fenella bent her way with unabated speed and they were approaching a group of two or three gentlemen who sauntered by its banks when on looking closely at him who appeared to be the chief of the party julian felt his heart beat uncommonly thick as if conscious of approaching some one of the highest consequence  the person whom he looked upon was past the middle age of life of a dark complexion corresponding with the long black fullbottomed periwig which he wore instead of his own hair his dress was plain black velvet with a diamond star however on his cloak which hung carelessly over one shoulder his features strongly lined even to harshness had yet an expression of dignified goodhumour he was well and strongly built walked upright and yet easily and had upon the whole the air of a person of the highest consideration he kept rather in advance of his companions but turned and spoke to them from time to time with much affability and probably with some liveliness judging by the smiles and sometimes the scarce restrained laughter by which some of his sallies were received by his attendants they also wore only morning dresses but their looks and manner were those of men of rank in presence of one in station still more elevated they shared the attention of their principal in common with seven or eight little black curlyhaired spaniels or rather as they are now called cockers which attended their master as closely and perhaps with as deep sentiments of attachment as the bipeds of the group and whose gambols which seemed to afford him much amusement he sometimes checked and sometimes encouraged in addition to this pastime a lackey or groom was also in attendance with one or two little baskets and bags from which the gentleman we have described took from time to time a handful of seeds and amused himself with throwing them to the waterfowl  this the kings favourite occupation together with his remarkable countenance and the deportment of the rest of the company towards him satisfied julian peveril that he was approaching perhaps indecorously near the person of charles stewart the second of that unhappy name  while he hesitated to follow his dumb guide any nearer and felt the embarrassment of being unable to communicate to her his repugnance to further intrusion a person in the royal retinue touched a light and lively air on the flageolet at a signal from the king who desired to have some tune repeated which had struck him in the theatre on the preceding evening while the goodnatured monarch marked time with his foot and with the motion of his hand fenella continued to approach him and threw into her manner the appearance of one who was attracted as it were in spite of herself by the sounds of the instrument  anxious to know how this was to end and astonished to see the dumb girl imitate so accurately the manner of one who actually heard the musical notes peveril also drew near though at somewhat greater distance  the king looked goodhumouredly at both as if he admitted their musical enthusiasm as an excuse for their intrusion but his eyes became riveted on fenella whose face and appearance although rather singular than beautiful had something in them wild fantastic and as being so even captivating to an eye which had been gratified perhaps to satiety with the ordinary forms of female beauty she did not appear to notice how closely she was observed but as if acting under an irresistible impulse derived from the sounds to which she seemed to listen she undid the bodkin round which her long tresses were winded and flinging them suddenly over her slender person as if using them as a natural veil she began to dance with infinite grace and agility to the tune which the flageolet played  peveril lost almost his sense of the kings presence when he observed with what wonderful grace and agility fenella kept time to notes which could only be known to her by the motions of the musicians fingers he had heard indeed among other prodigies of a person in fenellas unhappy situation acquiring by some unaccountable and mysterious tact the power of acting as an instrumental musician nay becoming so accurate a performer as to be capable of leading a musical band and he also heard of deaf and dumb persons dancing with sufficient accuracy by observing the motions of their partner but fenellas performance seemed more wonderful than either since the musician was guided by his written notes and the dancer by the motions of the others whereas fenella had no intimation save what she seemed to gather with infinite accuracy by observing the motion of the artists fingers on his small instrument  as for the king who was ignorant of the particular circumstances which rendered fenellas performance almost marvellous he was contented at her first commencement to authorise what seemed to him the frolic of this singularlooking damsel by a goodnatured smile but when he perceived the exquisite truth and justice as well as the wonderful combination of grace and agility with which she executed to this favourite air a dance which was perfectly new to him charles turned his mere acquiescence into something like enthusiastic applause he bore time to her motions with the movement of his footapplauded with head and with handand seemed like herself carried away by the enthusiasm of the gestic art  after a rapid yet graceful succession of entrechats fenella introduced a slow movement which terminated the dance then dropping a profound courtesy she continued to stand motionless before the king her arms folded on her bosom her head stooped and her eyes cast down after the manner of an oriental slave while through the misty veil of her shadowy locks it might be observed that the colour which exercise had called to her cheeks was dying fast away and resigning them to their native dusky hue  by my honour exclaimed the king she is like a fairy who trips it in moonlight there must be more of air and fire than of earth in her composition it is well poor nelly gwyn saw her not or she would have died of grief and envy come gentlemen which of you contrived this pretty piece of morning pastime  the courtiers looked at each other but none of them felt authorised to claim the merit of a service so agreeable  we must ask the quickeyed nymph herself then said the king and looking at fenella he added tell us my pretty one to whom we owe the pleasure of seeing youi suspect the duke of buckingham for this is exactly a tour de son métier  fenella on observing that the king addressed her bowed low and shook her head in signal that she did not understand what he said oddsfish that is true said the king she must perforce be a foreignerher complexion and agility speak it france or italy has had the moulding of those elastic limbs dark cheek and eye of fire he then put to her in french and again in italian the question by whom she had been sent hither  at the second repetition fenella threw back her veiling tresses so as to show the melancholy which sat on her brow while she sadly shook her head and intimated by imperfect muttering but of the softest and most plaintive kind her organic deficiency  is it possible nature can have made such a fault said charles can she have left so curious a piece as thou art without the melody of voice whilst she has made thee so exquisitely sensible to the beauty of soundstay what means this and what young fellow are you bringing up there oh the master of the show i supposefriend he added addressing himself to peveril who on the signal of fenella stepped forward almost instinctively and kneeled down we thank thee for the pleasure of this morningmy lord marquis you rooked me at piquet last night for which disloyal deed thou shalt now atone by giving a couple of pieces to this honest youth and five to the girl  as the nobleman drew out his purse and came forward to perform the kings generous commission julian felt some embarrassment ere he was able to explain that he had not title to be benefited by the young persons performance and that his majesty had mistaken his character  and who art thou then my friend said charles but above all and particularly who is this dancing nymph whom thou standest waiting on like an attendant fawn  the young person is a retainer of the countessdowager of derby so please your majesty said peveril in a low tone of voice and i am  hold hold said the king this is a dance to another tune and not fit for a place so public hark thee friend do thou and the young woman follow empson where he will conduct theeempson carry themhark in thy ear  may it please your majesty i ought to say said peveril that i am guiltless of any purpose of intrusion  now a plague on him who can take no hint said the king cutting short his apology oddsfish man there are times when civility is the greatest impertinence in the world do thou follow empson and amuse thyself for a halfhours space with the fairys company till we shall send for you  charles spoke this not without casting an anxious eye around and in a tone which intimated apprehension of being overheard julian could only bow obedience and follow empson who was the same person that played so rarely on the flageolet  when they were out of sight of the king and his party the musician wished to enter into conversation with his companions and addressed himself first to fenella with a broad compliment of by the mass ye dance rarelyneer a slut on the boards shows such a shank i would be content to play to you till my throat were as dry as my whistle come be a little freeold rowley will not quit the park till nine i will carry you to springgarden and bestow sweetcakes and a quart of rhenish on both of you and well be cameradoeswhat the devil no answerhows this brotheris this neat wench of yours deaf or dumb or both i should laugh at that and she trip it so well to the flageolet  to rid himself of this fellows discourse peveril answered him in french that he was a foreigner and spoke no english glad to escape though at the expense of a fiction from the additional embarrassment of a fool who was likely to ask more questions than his own wisdom might have enabled him to answer  Étrangerthat means stranger muttered their guide more french dogs and jades come to lick the good english butter of our bread or perhaps an italian puppetshow well if it were not that they have a mortal enmity to the whole gamut this were enough to make any honest fellow turn puritan but if i am to play to her at the duchesss ill be dd but i put her out in the tune just to teach her to have the impudence to come to england and to speak no english  having muttered to himself this truly british resolution the musician walked briskly on towards a large house near the bottom of st jamess street and entered the court by a grated door from the park of which the mansion commanded an extensive prospect  peveril finding himself in front of a handsome portico under which opened a stately pair of foldingdoors was about to ascend the steps that led to the main entrance when his guide seized him by the arm exclaiming hold mounseer what youll lose nothing i see for want of courage but you must keep the back way for all your fine doublet here it is not knock and it shall be opened but may be instead knock and you shall be knocked  suffering himself to be guided by empson julian deviated from the principal door to one which opened with less ostentation in an angle of the courtyard on a modest tap from the fluteplayer admittance was afforded him and his companions by a footman who conducted them through a variety of stone passages to a very handsome summer parlour where a lady or something resembling one dressed in a style of extra elegance was trifling with a playbook while she finished her chocolate it would not be easy to describe her but by weighing her natural good qualities against the affectations which counterbalanced them she would have been handsome but for rouge and minauderiewould have been civil but for overstrained airs of patronage and condescensionwould have had an agreeable voice had she spoken in her natural toneand fine eyes had she not made such desperate hard use of them she could only spoil a pretty ankle by too liberal display but her shape though she could not yet be thirty years old had the embonpoint which might have suited better with ten years more advanced she pointed empson to a seat with the air of a duchess and asked him languidly how he did this age that she had not seen him and what folks these were he had brought with him  foreigners madam dd foreigners answered empson starving beggars that our old friend has picked up in the park this morningthe wench dances and the fellow plays on the jews trump i believe on my life madam i begin to be ashamed of old rowley i must discard him unless he keeps better company in future  fie empson said the lady consider it is our duty to countenance him and keep him afloat and indeed i always make a principle of it hark ye he comes not hither this morning  he will be here answered empson in the walking of a minuet  my god exclaimed the lady with unaffected alarm and starting up with utter neglect of her usual and graceful languor she tripped as swiftly as a milkmaid into an adjoining apartment where they heard presently a few words of eager and animated discussion  something to be put out of the way i suppose said empson well for madam i gave her the hint there he goes the happy swain  julian was so situated that he could from the same casement through which empson was peeping observe a man in a laced roquelaure and carrying his rapier under his arm glide from the door by which he had himself entered and out of the court keeping as much as possible under the shade of the buildings  the lady reentered at this moment and observing how empsons eyes were directed said with a slight appearance of hurry a gentleman of the duchess of portsmouths with a billet and so tiresomely pressing for an answer that i was obliged to write without my diamond pen i have daubed my fingers i dare say she added looking at a very pretty hand and presently after dipping her fingers in a little silver vase of rosewater but that little exotic monster of yours empson i hope she really understands no englishon my life she colouredis she such a rare danceri must see her dance and hear him play on the jews harp  dance replied empson she danced well enough when i played to her i can make anything dance old counsellor clubfoot danced when he had a fit of the gout you have seen no such pas seul in the theatre i would engage to make the archbishop of canterbury dance the hays like a frenchman there is nothing in dancing it all lies in the music rowley does not know that now he saw this poor wench dance and thought so much ont when it was all along of me i would have defied her to sit still and rowley gives her the credit of it and five pieces to boot and i have only two for my mornings work  true master empson said the lady but you are of the family though in a lower station and you ought to consider  by g madam answered empson all i consider is that i play the best flageolet in england and that they can no more supply my place if they were to discard me than they could fill thames from fleetditch  well master empson i do not dispute but you are a man of talents replied the lady still i say mind the main chanceyou please the ear todayanother has the advantage of you tomorrow  never mistress while ears have the heavenly power of distinguishing one note from another  heavenly power say you master empson said the lady  ay madam heavenly for some very neat verses which we had at our festival say   what know we of the blest above   but that they sing and that they love  it is master waller wrote them as i think who upon my word ought to be encouraged  and so should you my dear empson said the dame yawning were it only for the honour you do to your own profession but in the meantime will you ask these people to have some refreshmentand will you take some yourselfthe chocolate is that which the ambassador portuguese fellow brought over to the queen  if it be genuine said the musician  how sir said the fair one half rising from her pile of cushionsnot genuine and in this houselet me understand you master empsoni think when i first saw you you scarce knew chocolate from coffee  by g madam answered the flageoletplayer you are perfectly right and how can i show better how much i have profited by your ladyships excellent cheer except by being critical  you stand excused master empson said the petite maitresse sinking gently back on the downy couch from which a momentary irritation had startled heri think the chocolate will please you though scarce equal to what we had from the spanish resident mendozabut we must offer these strange people something will you ask them if they would have coffee and chocolate or cold wildfowl fruit and wine they must be treated so as to show them where they are since here they are  unquestionably madam said empson but i have just at this instant forgot the french for chocolate hot bread coffee game and drinkables  it is odd said the lady and i have forgot my french and italian at the same moment but it signifies littlei will order the things to be brought and they will remember the names of them themselves  empson laughed loudly at this jest and pawned his soul that the cold sirloin which entered immediately after was the best emblem of roastbeef all the world over plentiful refreshments were offered to all the party of which both fenella and peveril partook  in the meanwhile the flageoletplayer drew closer to the side of the lady of the mansiontheir intimacy was cemented and their spirits set afloat by a glass of liqueur which gave them additional confidence in discussing the characters as well of the superior attendants of the court as of the inferior rank to which they themselves might be supposed to belong  the lady indeed during this conversation frequently exerted her complete and absolute superiority over master empson in which that musical gentleman humbly acquiesced whenever the circumstance was recalled to his attention whether in the way of blunt contradiction sarcastic insinuation downright assumption of higher importance or in any of the other various modes by which such superiority is usually asserted and maintained but the ladys obvious love of scandal was the lure which very soon brought her again down from the dignified part which for a moment she assumed and placed her once more on a gossiping level with her companion  their conversation was too trivial and too much allied to petty court intrigues with which he was totally unacquainted to be in the least interesting to julian as it continued for more than an hour he soon ceased to pay the least attention to a discourse consisting of nicknames patchwork and innuendo and employed himself in reflecting on his own complicated affairs and the probable issue of his approaching audience with the king which had been brought about by so singular an agent and by means so unexpected he often looked to his guide fenella and observed that she was for the greater part of the time drowned in deep and abstracted meditation but three or four timesand it was when the assumed airs and affected importance of the musician and their hostess rose to the most extravagant excesshe observed that fenella dealt askance on them some of those bitter and almost blighting elfin looks which in the isle of man were held to imply contemptuous execration there was something in all her manner so extraordinary joined to her sudden appearance and her demeanour in the kings presence so oddly yet so well contrived to procure him a private audiencewhich he might by graver means have sought in vainthat it almost justified the idea though he smiled at it internally that the little mute agent was aided in her machinations by the kindred imps to whom according to manx superstition her genealogy was to be traced  another idea sometimes occurred to julian though he rejected the question as being equally wild with those doubts which referred fenella to a race different from that of mortalswas she really afflicted with those organical imperfections which had always seemed to sever her from humanityif not what could be the motives of so young a creature practising so dreadful a penance for such an unremitted term of years and how formidable must be the strength of mind which could condemn itself to so terrific a sacrificehow deep and strong the purpose for which it was undertaken  but a brief recollection of past events enabled him to dismiss this conjecture as altogether wild and visionary he had but to call to memory the various stratagems practised by his lighthearted companion the young earl of derby upon this forlorn girlthe conversations held in her presence in which the character of a creature so irritable and sensitive upon all occasions was freely and sometimes satirically discussed without her expressing the least acquaintance with what was going forward to convince him that so deep a deception could never have been practised for so many years by a being of a turn of mind so peculiarly jealous and irascible  he renounced therefore the idea and turned his thoughts to his own affairs and his approaching interview with his sovereign in which meditation we propose to leave him until we briefly review the changes which had taken place in the situation of alice bridgenorth     chapter xxxi              i fear the devil worst when gown and cassock             or in the lack of them old calvins cloak             conceals his cloven hoof                                                anonymous  julian peveril had scarce set sail for whitehaven when alice bridgenorth and her governante at the hasty command of her father were embarked with equal speed and secrecy on board of a bark bound for liverpool christian accompanied them on their voyage as the friend to whose guardianship alice was to be consigned during any future separation from her father and whose amusing conversation joined to his pleasing though cold manners as well as his near relationship induced alice in her forlorn situation to consider her fate as fortunate in having such a guardian  at liverpool as the reader already knows christian took the first overt step in the villainy which he had contrived against the innocent girl by exposing her at a meetinghouse to the unhallowed gaze of chiffinch in order to convince him she was possessed of such uncommon beauty as might well deserve the infamous promotion to which they meditated to raise her  highly satisfied with her personal appearance chiffinch was no less so with the sense and delicacy of her conversation when he met her in company with her uncle afterwards in london the simplicity and at the same time the spirit of her remarks made him regard her as his scientific attendant the cook might have done a newly invented sauce sufficiently piquante in its qualities to awaken the jaded appetite of a cloyed and gorged epicure she was he said and swore the very cornerstone on which with proper management and with his instruction a few honest fellows might build a court fortune  that the necessary introduction might take place the confederates judged fit she should be put under the charge of an experienced lady whom some called mistress chiffinch and others chiffinchs mistressone of those obliging creatures who are willing to discharge all the duties of a wife without the inconvenient and indissoluble ceremony  it was one and not perhaps the least prejudicial consequence of the license of that illgoverned time that the bounds betwixt virtue and vice were so far smoothed down and levelled that the frail wife or the tender friend who was no wife did not necessarily lose their place in society but on the contrary if they moved in the higher circles were permitted and encouraged to mingle with women whose rank was certain and whose reputation was untainted  a regular liaison like that of chiffinch and his fair one inferred little scandal and such was his influence as prime minister of his masters pleasures that as charles himself expressed it the lady whom we introduced to our readers in the last chapter had obtained a brevet commission to rank as a married woman and to do the gentle dame justice no wife could have been more attentive to forward his plans or more liberal in disposing of his income  she inhabited a set of apartments called chiffinchsthe scene of many an intrigue both of love and politics and where charles often held his private parties for the evening when as frequently happened the illhumour of the duchess of portsmouth his reigning sultana prevented his supping with her the hold which such an arrangement gave a man like chiffinch used as he well knew how to use it made him of too much consequence to be slighted even by the first persons in the state unless they stood aloof from all manner of politics and court intrigue  in the charge of mistress chiffinch and of him whose name she bore edward christian placed the daughter of his sister and of his confiding friend calmly contemplating her ruin as an event certain to follow and hoping to ground upon it his own chance of a more assured fortune than a life spent in intrigue had hitherto been able to procure for him  the innocent alice without being able to discover what was wrong either in the scenes of unusual luxury with which she was surrounded or in the manners of her hostess which both from nature and policy were kind and caressingfelt nevertheless an instinctive apprehension that all was not righta feeling in the human mind allied perhaps to that sense of danger which animals exhibit when placed in the vicinity of the natural enemies of their race and which makes birds cower when the hawk is in the air and beasts tremble when the tiger is abroad in the desert there was a heaviness at her heart which she could not dispel and the few hours which she had already spent at chiffinchs were like those passed in prison by one unconscious of the cause or event of his captivity it was the third morning after her arrival in london that the scene took place which we now recur to  the impertinence and vulgarity of empson which was permitted to him as an unrivalled performer upon his instrument were exhausting themselves at the expense of all other musical professors and mrs chiffinch was listening with careless indifference when some one was heard speaking loudly and with animation in the inner apartment  oh gemini and gilliflower water exclaimed the damsel startled out of her fine airs into her natural vulgarity of exclamation and running to the door of communicationif he has not come back again after alland if old rowley  a tap at the farther and opposite door here arrested her attentionshe quitted the handle of that which she was about to open as speedily as if it had burnt her fingers and moving back towards her couch asked who is there  old rowley himself madam said the king entering the apartment with his usual air of easy composure  o criminiyour majestyi thought  that i was out of hearing doubtless said the king and spoke of me as folk speak of absent friends make no apology i think i have heard ladies say of their lace that a rent is better than a darnnay be seatedwhere is chiffinch  he is down at york house your majesty said the dame recovering though with no small difficulty the calm affectation of her usual demeanour shall i send your majestys commands  i will wait his return said the kingpermit me to taste your chocolate  there is some fresh frothed in the office said the lady and using a little silver call or whistle a black boy superbly dressed like an oriental page with gold bracelets on his naked arms and a gold collar around his equally bare neck attended with the favourite beverage of the morning in an apparatus of the richest china  while he sipped his cup of chocolate the king looked round the apartment and observing fenella peveril and the musician who remained standing beside a large indian screen he continued addressing mistress chiffinch though with polite indifference i sent you the fiddles this morningor rather the fluteempson and a fairy elf whom i met in the park who dances divinely she has brought us the very newest saraband from the court of queen mab and i sent her here that you may see it at leisure  your majesty does me by far too much honour said chiffinch her eyes properly cast down and her accents minced into becoming humility  nay little chiffinch answered the king in a tone of as contemptuous familiarity as was consistent with his goodbreeding it was not altogether for thine own private ear though quite deserving of all sweet sounds but i thought nelly had been with thee this morning  i can send bajazet for her your majesty answered the lady  nay i will not trouble your little heathen sultan to go so far still it strikes me that chiffinch said you had companysome country cousin or such a matteris there not such a person  there is a young person from the country said mistress chiffinch striving to conceal a considerable portion of embarrassment but she is unprepared for such an honour as to be admitted into your majestys presence and  and therefore the fitter to receive it chiffinch there is nothing in nature so beautiful as the first blush of a little rustic between joy and fear and wonder and curiosity it is the down on the peachpity it decays so soonthe fruit remains but the first high colouring and exquisite flavour are gonenever put up thy lip for the matter chiffinch for it is as i tell you so pray let us have la belle cousine  mistress chiffinch more embarrassed than ever again advanced towards the door of communication which she had been in the act of opening when his majesty entered but just as she coughed pretty loudly perhaps as a signal to some one within voices were again heard in a raised tone of altercationthe door was flung open and alice rushed out of the inner apartment followed to the door of it by the enterprising duke of buckingham who stood fixed with astonishment on finding his pursuit of the flying fair one had hurried him into the presence of the king  alice bridgenorth appeared too much transported with anger to permit her to pay attention to the rank or character of the company into which she had thus suddenly entered i remain no longer here madam she said to mrs chiffinch in a tone of uncontrollable resolution i leave instantly a house where i am exposed to company which i detest and to solicitations which i despise  the dismayed mrs chiffinch could only implore her in broken whispers to be silent adding while she pointed to charles who stood with his eyes fixed rather on his audacious courtier than on the game which he pursued the kingthe king  if i am in the kings presence said alice aloud and in the same torrent of passionate feeling while her eye sparkled through tears of resentment and insulted modesty it is the betterit is his majestys duty to protect me and on his protection i throw myself  these words which were spoken aloud and boldly at once recalled julian to himself who had hitherto stood as it were bewildered he approached alice and whispering in her ear that she had beside her one who would defend her with his life implored her to trust to his guardianship in this emergency  clinging to his arm in all the ecstasy of gratitude and joy the spirit which had so lately invigorated alice in her own defence gave way in a flood of tears when she saw herself supported by him whom perhaps she most wished to recognise as her protector she permitted peveril gently to draw her back towards the screen before which he had been standing where holding by his arm but at the same time endeavouring to conceal herself behind him they waited the conclusion of a scene so singular  the king seemed at first so much surprised at the unexpected apparition of the duke of buckingham as to pay little or no attention to alice who had been the means of thus unceremoniously introducing his grace into the presence at a most unsuitable moment in that intriguing court it had not been the first time that the duke had ventured to enter the lists of gallantry in rivalry of his sovereign which made the present insult the more intolerable his purpose of lying concealed in those private apartments was explained by the exclamations of alice and charles notwithstanding the placidity of his disposition and his habitual guard over his passions resented the attempt to seduce his destined mistress as an eastern sultan would have done the insolence of a vizier who anticipated his intended purchases of captive beauty in the slavemarket the swarthy features of charles reddened and the strong lines on his dark visage seemed to become inflated as he said in a voice which faltered with passion buckingham you dared not have thus insulted your equal to your master you may securely offer any affront since his rank glues his sword to the scabbard  the haughty duke did not brook this taunt unanswered my sword he said with emphasis was never in the scabbard when your majestys service required it should be unsheathed  your grace means when its service was required for its masters interest said the king for you could only gain the coronet of a duke by fighting for the royal crown but it is overi have treated you as a frienda companionalmost an equalyou have repaid me with insolence and ingratitude  sire answered the duke firmly but respectfully i am unhappy in your displeasure yet thus far fortunate that while your words can confer honour they cannot impair or take it awayit is hard he added lowering his voice so as only to be heard by the kingit is hard that the squall of a peevish wench should cancel the services of so many years  it is harder said the king in the same subdued tone which both preserved through the rest of the conversation that a wenchs bright eyes can make a nobleman forget the decencies due to his sovereigns privacy  may i presume to ask your majesty what decencies are those said the duke  charles bit his lip to keep himself from smiling buckingham he said this is a foolish business and we must not forget as we have nearly done that we have an audience to witness this scene and should walk the stage with dignity i will show you your fault in private  it is enough that your majesty has been displeased and that i have unhappily been the occasion said the duke kneeling although quite ignorant of any purpose beyond a few words of gallantry and i sue thus low for your majestys pardon  so saying he kneeled gracefully down thou hast it george said the placable prince i believe thou wilt be sooner tired of offending than i of forgiving  long may your majesty live to give the offence with which it is your royal pleasure at present to charge my innocence said the duke  what mean you by that my lord said charles the angry shade returning to his brow for a moment  my liege replied the duke you are too honourable to deny your custom of shooting with cupids birdbolts in other mens warrens you have taen the royal right of freeforestry over every mans park it is hard that you should be so much displeased at hearing a chance arrow whizz near your own pales  no more ont said the king but let us see where the dove has harboured  the helen has found a paris while we were quarrelling replied the duke  rather an orpheus said the king and what is worse one that is already provided with a eurydiceshe is clinging to the fiddler  it is mere fright said buckingham like rochesters when he crept into the bassviol to hide himself from sir dermot ocleaver  we must make the people show their talents said the king and stop their mouths with money and civility or we shall have this foolish encounter over half the town  the king then approached julian and desired him to take his instrument and cause his female companion to perform a saraband  i had already the honour to inform your majesty said julian that i cannot contribute to your pleasure in the way you command me and that this young person is  a retainer of the lady powis said the king upon whose mind things not connected with his pleasures made a very slight impression poor lady she is in trouble about the lords in the tower  pardon me sir said julian she is a dependant of the countess of derby  true true answered charles it is indeed of lady derby who hath also her own distresses in these times do you know who taught the young person to dance some of her steps mightily resemble le jeunes of paris  i presume she was taught abroad sir said julian for myself i am charged with some weighty business by the countess which i would willingly communicate to your majesty  we will send you to our secretary of state said the king but this dancing envoy will oblige us once more will she notempson now that i remember it was to your pipe that she dancedstrike up man and put mettle into her feet  empson began to play a wellknown measure and as he had threatened made more than one false note until the king whose ear was very accurate rebuked him with sirrah art thou drunk at this early hour or must thou too be playing thy slippery tricks with me thou thinkest thou art born to beat time but i will have time beat into thee  the hint was sufficient and empson took good care so to perform his air as to merit his high and deserved reputation but on fenella it made not the slightest impression she rather leant than stood against the wall of the apartment her countenance as pale as death her arms and hands hanging down as if stiffened and her existence only testified by the sobs which agitated her bosom and the tears which flowed from her halfclosed eyes  a plague on it said the king some evil spirit is abroad this morning and the wenches are all bewitched i think cheer up my girl what in the devils name has changed thee at once from a nymph to a niobe if thou standest there longer thou wilt grow to the very marble walloroddsfish george have you been birdbolting in this quarter also  ere buckingham could answer to this charge julian again kneeled down to the king and prayed to be heard were it only for five minutes the young woman he said had been long in attendance of the countess of derby she was bereaved of the faculties of speech and hearing  oddsfish man and dances so well said the king nay all gresham college shall never make me believe that  i would have thought it equally impossible but for what i today witnessed said julian but only permit me sir to deliver the petition of my lady the countess  and who art thou thyself man said the sovereign for though everything which wears bodice and breastknot has a right to speak to a king and be answered i know not that they have a title to audience through an envoy extraordinary  i am julian peveril of derbyshire answered the supplicant the son of sir geoffrey peveril of martindale castle who  body of methe old worcester man said the king oddsfish i remember him wellsome harm has happened to him i thinkis he not dead or very sick at least  ill at ease and it please your majesty but not ill in health he has been imprisoned on account of an alleged accession to this plot  look you there said the king i knew he was in trouble and yet how to help the stout old knight i can hardly tell i can scarce escape suspicion of the plot myself though the principal object of it is to take away my own life were i to stir to save a plotter i should certainly be brought in as an accessorybuckingham thou hast some interest with those who built this fine state engine or at least who have driven it onbe goodnatured for once though it is scarcely thy wont and interfere to shelter our old worcester friend sir godfrey you have not forgot him  no sir answered the duke for i never heard the name  it is sir geoffrey his majesty would say said julian  and if his majesty did say sir geoffrey master peveril i cannot see of what use i can be to your father replied the duke coldly he is accused of a heavy crime and a british subject so accused can have no shelter either from prince or peer but must stand to the award and deliverance of god and his country  now heaven forgive thee thy hypocrisy george said the king hastily i would rather hear the devil preach religion than thee teach patriotism thou knowest as well as i that the nation is in a scarlet fever for fear of the poor catholics who are not two men to five hundred and that the public mind is so harassed with new narrations of conspiracy and fresh horrors every day that people have as little real sense of what is just or unjust as men who talk in their sleep of what is sense or nonsense i have borne and borne with iti have seen blood flow on the scaffold fearing to thwart the nation in its furyand i pray to god that i or mine be not called on to answer for it i will no longer swim with the torrent which honour and conscience call upon me to stemi will act the part of a sovereign and save my people from doing injustice even in their own despite  charles walked hastily up and down the room as he expressed these unwonted sentiments with energy equally unwonted after a momentary pause the duke answered him gravely spoken like a royal king sir butpardon menot like a king of england  charles paused as the duke spoke beside a window which looked full on whitehall and his eye was involuntarily attracted by the fatal window of the banqueting house out of which his unhappy father was conducted to execution charles was naturally or more purposely constitutionally brave but a life of pleasure together with the habit of governing his course rather by what was expedient than by what was right rendered him unapt to dare the same scene of danger or of martyrdom which had closed his fathers life and reign and the thought came over his halfformed resolution like the rain upon a kindling beacon in another man his perplexity would have seemed almost ludicrous but charles would not lose even under these circumstances the dignity and grace which were as natural to him as his indifference and good humour our council must decide in this matter he said looking to the duke and be assured young man he added addressing julian your father shall not want an intercessor in his king so far as the laws will permit my interference in his behalf  julian was about to retire when fenella with a marked look put into his hand a slip of paper on which she had hastily written the packetgive him the packet  after a moments hesitation during which he reflected that fenella was the organ of the countesss pleasure julian resolved to obey permit me then sire he said to place in your royal hands this packet entrusted to me by the countess of derby the letters have already been once taken from me and i have little hope that i can now deliver them as they are addressed i place them therefore in your royal hands certain that they will evince the innocence of the writer  the king shook his head as he took the packet reluctantly it is no safe office you have undertaken young man a messenger has sometimes his throat cut for the sake of his despatchesbut give them to me and chiffinch give me wax and a taper he employed himself in folding the countesss packet in another envelope buckingham he said you are evidence that i do not read them till the council shall see them  buckingham approached and offered his services in folding the parcel but charles rejected his assistance and having finished his task he sealed the packet with his own signetring the duke bit his lip and retired  and now young man said the king your errand is sped so far as it can at present be forwarded  julian bowed deeply as to take leave at these words which he rightly interpreted as a signal for his departure alice bridgenorth still clung to his arm and motioned to withdraw along with him the king and buckingham looked at each other in conscious astonishment and yet not without a desire to smile so strange did it seem to them that a prize for which an instant before they had been mutually contending should thus glide out of their grasp or rather be borne off by a third and very inferior competitor  mistress chiffinch said the king with a hesitation which he could not disguise i hope your fair charge is not about to leave you  certainly not your majesty answered chiffinch alice my loveyou mistakethat opposite door leads to your apartments  pardon me madam answered alice i have indeed mistaken my road but it was when i came hither  the errant damosel said buckingham looking at charles with as much intelligence as etiquette permitted him to throw into his eye and then turning it towards alice as she still held by julians arm is resolved not to mistake her road a second time she has chosen a sufficient guide  and yet stories tell that such guides have led maidens astray said the king  alice blushed deeply but instantly recovered her composure so soon as she saw that her liberty was likely to depend upon the immediate exercise of resolution she quitted from a sense of insulted delicacy the arm of julian to which she had hitherto clung but as she spoke she continued to retain a slight grasp of his cloak i have indeed mistaken my way she repeated still addressing mrs chiffinch but it was when i crossed this threshold the usage to which i have been exposed in your house has determined me to quit it instantly  i will not permit that my young mistress answered mrs chiffinch until your uncle who placed you under my care shall relieve me of the charge of you  i will answer for my conduct both to my uncle and what is of more importance to my father said alice you must permit me to depart madam i am freeborn and you have no right to detain me  pardon me my young madam said mistress chiffinch i have a right and i will maintain it too  i will know that before quitting this presence said alice firmly and advancing a step or two she dropped on her knee before the king your majesty said she if indeed i kneel before king charles is the father of your subjects  of a good many of them said the duke of buckingham apart  i demand protection of you in the name of god and of the oath your majesty swore when you placed on your head the crown of this kingdom  you have my protection said the king a little confused by an appeal so unexpected and so solemn do but remain quiet with this lady with whom your parents have placed you neither buckingham nor any one else shall intrude on you  his majesty added buckingham in the same tone and speaking from the restless and mischiefmaking spirit of contradiction which he never could restrain even when indulging it was most contrary not only to propriety but to his own interesthis majesty will protect you fair lady from all intrusion save what must not be termed such  alice darted a keen look on the duke as if to read his meaning another on charles to know whether she had guessed it rightly there was a guilty confession on the kings brow which confirmed alices determination to depart your majesty will forgive me she said it is not here that i can enjoy the advantage of your royal protection i am resolved to leave this house if i am detained it must be by violence which i trust no one dare offer to me in your majestys presence this gentleman whom i have long known will conduct me to my friends  we make but an indifferent figure in this scene methinks said the king addressing the duke of buckingham and speaking in a whisper but she must goi neither will nor dare stop her from returning to her father  and if she does swore the duke internally i would as sir andrew smith saith i might never touch fair ladys hand and stepping back he spoke a few words with empson the musician who left the apartment for a few minutes and presently returned  the king seemed irresolute concerning the part he should act under circumstances so peculiar to be foiled in a gallant intrigue was to subject himself to the ridicule of his gay court to persist in it by any means which approached to constraint would have been tyrannical and what perhaps he might judge as severe an imputation it would have been unbecoming a gentleman upon my honour young lady he said with an emphasis you have nothing to fear in this house but it is improper for your own sake that you should leave it in this abrupt manner if you will have the goodness to wait but a quarter of an hour mistress chiffinchs coach will be placed at your command to transport you where you will spare yourself the ridicule and me the pain of seeing you leave the house of one of my servants as if you were escaping from a prison  the king spoke in goodnatured sincerity and alice was inclined for an instant to listen to his advice but recollecting that she had to search for her father and uncle or failing them for some suitable place of secure residence it rushed on her mind that the attendants of mistress chiffinch were not likely to prove trusty guides or assistants in such a purpose firmly and respectfully she announced her purpose of instant departure she needed no other escort she said than what this gentleman master julian peveril who was well known to her father would willingly afford her nor did she need that farther than until she had reached her fathers residence  farewell then lady a gods name said the king i am sorry so much beauty should be wedded to so many shrewish suspicionsfor you master peveril i should have thought you had enough to do with your own affairs without interfering with the humours of the fair sex the duty of conducting all strayed damsels into the right path is as matters go in this good city rather too weighty an undertaking for your youth and inexperience  julian eager to conduct alice from a place of which he began fully to appreciate the perils answered nothing to this taunt but bowing reverently led her from the apartment her sudden appearance and the animated scene which followed had entirely absorbed for the moment the recollection of his father and of the countess of derby and while the dumb attendant of the latter remained in the room a silent and as it were stunned spectator of all that had happened peveril had become in the predominating interest of alices critical situation totally forgetful of her presence but no sooner had he left the room without noticing or attending to her than fenella starting as from a trance drew herself up and looked wildly around like one waking from a dream as if to assure herself that her companion was gone and gone without paying the slightest attention to her she folded her hands together and cast her eyes upwards with an expression of such agony as explained to charles as he thought what painful ideas were passing in her mind this peveril is a perfect pattern of successful perfidy carrying off this queen of the amazons but he has left us i think a disconsolate ariadne in her placebut weep not my princess of pretty movements he said addressing himself to fenella if we cannot call in bacchus to console you we will commit you to the care of empson who shall drink with liber pater for a thousand pounds and i will say done first  as the king spoke these words fenella rushed past him with her wonted rapidity of step and with much less courtesy than was due to the royal presence hurried downstairs and out of the house without attempting to open any communication with the monarch he saw her abrupt departure with more surprise than displeasure and presently afterwards bursting into a fit of laughter he said to the duke oddsfish george this young spark might teach the best of us how to manage the wenches i have had my own experience but i could never yet contrive either to win or lose them with so little ceremony  experience sir replied the duke cannot be acquired without years  true george and you would i suppose insinuate said charles that the gallant who acquires it loses as much in youth as he gains in art i defy your insinuation george you cannot overreach your master old as you think him either in love or politics you have not the secret plumer la poule sans la faire crier witness this mornings work i will give you odds at all gamesay and at the mall too if thou darest accept my challengechiffinch what for dost thou convulse thy pretty throat and face with sobbing and hatching tears which seem rather unwilling to make their appearance  it is for fear whined chiffinch that your majesty should thinkthat you should expect  that i should expect gratitude from a courtier or faith from a woman answered the king patting her at the same time under the chin to make her raise her facetush chicken i am not so superfluous  there it is now said chiffinch continuing to sob the more bitterly as she felt herself unable to produce any tears i see your majesty is determined to lay all the blame on me when i am innocent as an unborn babei will be judged by his grace  no doubt no doubt chiffie said the king his grace and you will be excellent judges in each others cause and as good witnesses in each others favour but to investigate the matter impartially we must examine our evidence apartmy lord duke we meet at the mall at noon if your grace dare accept my challenge  his grace of buckingham bowed and retired     chapter xxxii          but when the bully with assuming pace         cocks his broad hat edged round with tarnishd lace         yield not the waydefy his strutting pride         and thrust him to the muddy kennels side         yet rather bear the shower and toils of mud         than in the doubtful quarrel risk thy blood                                            gays trivia  julian peveril halfleading halfsupporting alice bridgenorth had reached the middle of saint james street ere the doubt occurred to him which way they should bend their course he then asked alice whither he should conduct her and learned to his surprise and embarrassment that far from knowing where her father was to be found she had no certain knowledge that he was in london and only hoped that he had arrived from the expressions which he had used at parting she mentioned her uncle christians address but it was with doubt and hesitation arising from the hands in which he had already placed her and her reluctance to go again under his protection was strongly confirmed by her youthful guide when a few words had established to his conviction the identity of ganlesse and christianwhat then was to be done  alice said julian after a moments reflection you must seek your earliest and best friendi mean my mother she has now no castle in which to receive youshe has but a miserable lodging so near the jail in which my father is confined that it seems almost a cell of the same prison i have not seen her since my coming hither but thus much have i learned by inquiry we will now go to her apartment such as it is i know she will share it with one so innocent and so unprotected as you are  gracious heaven said the poor girl am i then so totally deserted that i must throw myself on the mercy of her who of all the world has most reason to spurn me from herjulian can you advise me to thisis there none else who will afford me a few hours refuge till i can hear from my fatherno other protectress but her whose ruin has i fear been accelerated byjulian i dare not appear before your mother she must hate me for my family and despise me for my meanness to be a second time cast on her protection when the first has been so evil repaidjulian i dare not go with you  she has never ceased to love you alice said her conductor whose steps she continued to attend even while declaring her resolution not to go with him she never felt anything but kindness towards you nay towards your father for though his dealings with us have been harsh she can allow much for the provocation which he has received believe me with her you will be safe as with a motherperhaps it may be the means of reconciling the divisions by which we have suffered so much  might god grant it said alice yet how shall i face your mother and will she be able to protect me against these powerful menagainst my uncle christian alas that i must call him my worst enemy  she has the ascendancy which honour hath over infamy and virtue over vice said julian and to no human power but your fathers will she resign you if you consent to choose her for your protectress come then with me alice and  julian was interrupted by some one who laying an unceremonious hold of his cloak pulled it with so much force as compelled him to stop and lay his hand on his sword he turned at the same time and when he turned beheld fenella the cheek of the mute glowed like fire her eyes sparkled and her lips were forcibly drawn together as if she had difficulty to repress those wild screams which usually attended her agonies of passion and which uttered in the open street must instantly have collected a crowd as it was her appearance was so singular and her emotion so evident that men gazed as they came on and looked back after they had passed at the singular vivacity of her gestures while holding peverils cloak with one hand she made with the other the most eager and imperious signs that he should leave alice bridgenorth and follow her she touched the plume in her bonnet to remind him of the earlpointed to her heart to imitate the countessraised her closed hand as if to command him in their nameand next moment folded both as if to supplicate him in her own while pointing to alice with an expression at once of angry and scornful derision she waved her hand repeatedly and disdainfully to intimate that peveril ought to cast her off as something undeserving his protection  frightened she knew not why at these wild gestures alice clung closer to julians arm than she had at first dared to do and this mark of confidence in his protection seemed to increase the passion of fenella  julian was dreadfully embarrassed his situation was sufficiently precarious even before fenellas ungovernable passions threatened to ruin the only plan which he had been able to suggest what she wanted with himhow far the fate of the earl and countess might depend on his following her he could not even conjecture but be the call how peremptory soever he resolved not to comply with it until he had seen alice placed in safety in the meantime he determined not to lose sight of fenella and disregarding her repeated disdainful and impetuous rejection of the hand which he offered her he at length seemed so far to have soothed her that she seized upon his right arm and as if despairing of his following her path appeared reconciled to attend him on that which he himself should choose  thus with a youthful female clinging to each arm and both remarkably calculated to attract the public eye though from very different reasons julian resolved to make the shortest road to the waterside and there to take boat for blackfriars as the nearest point of landing to newgate where he concluded that lance had already announced his arrival in london to sir geoffrey then inhabiting that dismal region and to his lady who so far as the jailers rigour permitted shared and softened his imprisonment  julians embarrassment in passing charing cross and northumberland house was so great as to excite the attention of the passengers for he had to compose his steps so as to moderate the unequal and rapid pace of fenella to the timid and faint progress of his lefthand companion and while it would have been needless to address himself to the former who could not comprehend him he dared not speak himself to alice for fear of awakening into frenzy the jealousy or at least the impatience of fenella  many passengers looked at them with wonder and some with smiles but julian remarked that there were two who never lost sight of them and to whom his situation and the demeanour of his companions seemed to afford matter of undisguised merriment these were young men such as may be seen in the same precincts in the present day allowing for the difference in the fashion of their apparel they abounded in periwig and fluttered with many hundred yards of ribbon disposed in bowknots upon their sleeves their breeches and their waistcoats in the very extremity of the existing mode a quantity of lace and embroidery made their habits rather fine than tasteful in a word they were dressed in that caricature of the fashion which sometimes denotes a harebrained man of quality who has a mind to be distinguished as a fop of the first order but is much more frequently in the disguise of those who desire to be esteemed men of rank on account of their dress having no other pretension to the distinction  these two gallants passed peveril more than once linked arm in arm then sauntered so as to oblige him to pass them in turn laughing and whispering during these manoeuvresstaring broadly at peveril and his female companionsand affording them as they came into contact none of those facilities of giving place which are required on such occasions by the ordinary rules of the pavé  peveril did not immediately observe their impertinence but when it was too gross to escape his notice his gall began to arise and in addition to all the other embarrassments of his situation he had to combat the longing desire which he felt to cudgel handsomely the two coxcombs who seemed thus determined on insulting him patience and sufferance were indeed strongly imposed on him by circumstances but at length it became scarcely possible to observe their dictates any longer  when for the third time julian found himself obliged with his companions to pass this troublesome brace of fops they kept walking close behind him speaking so loud as to be heard and in a tone of perfect indifference whether he listened to them or not  this is bumpkins best luck said the taller of the two who was indeed a man of remarkable size alluding to the plainness of peverils dress which was scarce fit for the streets of londontwo such fine wenches and under guard of a grey frock and an oaken ridingrod  nay puritans luck rather and more than enough of it said his companion you may read puritan in his pace and in his patience  right as a pint bumper tom said his friendisschar is an ass that stoopeth between two burdens  i have a mind to ease longeared laurence of one of his encumbrances said the shorter fellow that blackeyed sparkler looks as if she had a mind to run away from him  ay answered the taller and the blueeyed trembler looks as if she would fall behind into my loving arms  at these words alice holding still closer by peverils arm than formerly mended her pace almost to running in order to escape from men whose language was so alarming and fenella walked hastily forward in the same manner having perhaps caught from the mens gestures and demeanour that apprehension which alice had taken from their language  fearful of the consequences of a fray in the streets which must necessarily separate him from these unprotected females peveril endeavoured to compound betwixt the prudence necessary for their protection and his own rising resentment and as this troublesome pair of attendants endeavoured again to pass them close to hungerford stairs he said to them with constrained calmness gentlemen i owe you something for the attention you have bestowed on the affairs of a stranger if you have any pretension to the name i have given you you will tell me where you are to be found  and with what purpose said the taller of the two sneeringly does your most rustic gravity or your most grave rusticity require of us such information  so saying they both faced about in such a manner as to make it impossible for julian to advance any farther  make for the stairs alice he said i will be with you in an instant then freeing himself with difficulty from the grasp of his companions he cast his cloak hastily round his left arm and said sternly to his opponents will you give me your names sirs or will you be pleased to make way  not till we know for whom we are to give place said one of them  for one who will else teach you what you wantgood manners said peveril and advanced as if to push between them  they separated but one of them stretched forth his foot before peveril as if he meant to trip him the blood of his ancestors was already boiling within him he struck the man on the face with the oaken rod which he had just sneered at and throwing it from him instantly unsheathed his sword both the others drew and pushed at once but he caught the point of the one rapier in his cloak and parried the other thrust with his own weapon he must have been less lucky in the second close but a cry arose among the watermen of shame shame two upon one  they are men of the duke of buckinghams said one fellowtheres no safe meddling with them  they may be the devils men if they will said an ancient triton flourishing his stretcher but i say fair play and old england for ever and i say knock the goldlaced puppies down unless they will fight turn about with grey jerkin like honest fellows one downtother come on  the lower orders of london have in all times been remarkable for the delight which they have taken in clublaw or fistlaw and for the equity and impartiality with which they see it administered the noble science of defence was then so generally known that a bout at single rapier excited at that time as much interest and as little wonder as a boxingmatch in our own days the bystanders experienced in such affrays presently formed a ring within which peveril and the taller and more forward of his antagonists were soon engaged in close combat with their swords whilst the other overawed by the spectators was prevented from interfering  well done the tall fellowwell thrust longlegshuzza for two ells and a quarter were the sounds with which the fray was at first cheered for peverils opponent not only showed great activity and skill in fence but had also a decided advantage from the anxiety with which julian looked out for alice bridgenorth the care for whose safety diverted him in the beginning of the onset from that which he ought to have exclusively bestowed on the defence of his own life a slight fleshwound in the side at once punished and warned him of his inadvertence when turning his whole thoughts on the business in which he was engaged and animated with anger against his impertinent intruder the rencontre speedily began to assume another face amidst cries of well done grey jerkintry the metal of his gold doubletfinely thrustcuriously parriedthere went another eyelethole to his broidered jerkinfairly pinked by gd in applause accompanying a successful and conclusive lunge by which peveril ran his gigantic antagonist through the body he looked at his prostrate foe for a moment then recovering himself called loudly to know what had become of the lady  never mind the lady if you be wise said one of the watermen the constable will be here in an instant ill give your honour a cast across the water in a moment it may be as much as your necks worth shall only charge a jacobus  you be dd said one of his rivals in profession as your father was before you for a jacobus ill set the gentleman into alsatia where neither bailiff nor constable dare trespass  the lady you scoundrels the lady exclaimed peverilwhere is the lady  ill carry your honour where you shall have enough of ladies if that be your want said the old triton and as he spoke the clamour amongst the watermen was renewed each hoping to cut his own profit out of the emergency of julians situation  a sculler will be least suspected your honour said one fellow  a pair of oars will carry you through the water like a wildduck said another  but you have got never a tilt brother said a third now i can put the gentleman as snug as if he were under hatches  in the midst of the oaths and clamour attending this aquatic controversy for his custom peveril at length made them understand that he would bestow a jacobus not on him whose boat was first oars but on whomsoever should inform him of the fate of the lady  of which lady said a sharp fellow for to my thought there was a pair of them  of both of both answered peveril but first of the fairhaired lady  ay ay that was she that shrieked so when goldjackets companion handed her into no 20  whowhatwho dared to hand her exclaimed peveril  nay master you have heard enough of my tale without a fee said the waterman  sordid rascal said peveril giving him a gold piece speak out or ill run my sword through you  for the matter of that master answered the fellow not while i can handle this trunnionbut a bargains a bargain and so ill tell you for your gold piece that the comrade of the fellow forced one of your wenches her with the fair hair will she nill she into tickling toms wherry and they are far enough up thames by this time with wind and tide  sacred heaven and i stand here exclaimed julian  why that is because your honour will not take a boat  you are right my frienda boata boat instantly  follow me then squirehere tom bear a handthe gentleman is our fare  a volley of water language was exchanged betwixt the successful candidate for peverils custom and his disappointed brethren which concluded by the ancient tritons bellowing out in a tone above them all that the gentleman was in a fair way to make a voyage to the isle of gulls for that sly jack was only bantering himno 20 had rowed for york buildings  to the isle of gallows cried another for here comes one who will mar his trip up thames and carry him down to execution dock  in fact as he spoke the word a constable with three or four of his assistants armed with the oldfashioned brown bills which were still used for arming those guardians of the peace cut off our heros farther progress to the waters edge by arresting him in the kings name to attempt resistance would have been madness as he was surrounded on all sides so peveril was disarmed and carried before the nearest justice of the peace for examination and committal  the legal sage before whom julian was taken was a man very honest in his intentions very bounded in his talents and rather timid in his disposition before the general alarm given to england and to the city of london in particular by the notable discovery of the popish plot master maulstatute had taken serene and undisturbed pride and pleasure in the discharge of his duties as a justice of the peace with the exercise of all its honorary privileges and awful authority but the murder of sir edmondsbury godfrey had made a strong nay an indelible impression on his mind and he walked the courts of themis with fear and trembling after that memorable and melancholy event  having a high idea of his official importance and rather an exalted notion of his personal consequence his honour saw nothing from that time but cords and daggers before his eyes and never stepped out of his own house which he fortified and in some measure garrisoned with halfadozen tall watchmen and constables without seeing himself watched by a papist in disguise with a drawn sword under his cloak it was even whispered that in the agonies of his fears the worshipful master maulstatute mistook the kitchenwench with a tinderbox for a jesuit with a pistol but if any one dared to laugh at such an error he would have done well to conceal his mirth lest he fell under the heavy inculpation of being a banterer and stifler of the plota crime almost as deep as that of being himself a plotter in fact the fears of the honest justice however ridiculously exorbitant were kept so much in countenance by the outcry of the day and the general nervous fever which afflicted every good protestant that master maulstatute was accounted the bolder man and the better magistrate while under the terror of the airdrawn dagger which fancy placed continually before his eyes he continued to dole forth justice in the recesses of his private chamber nay occasionally to attend quartersessions when the hall was guarded by a sufficient body of the militia such was the wight at whose door well chained and doubly bolted the constable who had julian in custody now gave his important and wellknown knock  notwithstanding this official signal the party was not admitted until the clerk who acted the part of highwarder had reconnoitred them through a grated wicket for who could say whether the papists might not have made themselves master of master constables sign and have prepared a pseudo watch to burst in and murder the justice under pretence of bringing in a criminal before himless hopeful projects had figured in the narrative of the popish plot  all being found right the key was turned the bolts were drawn and the chain unhooked so as to permit entrance to the constable the prisoner and the assistants and the door was then a suddenly shut against the witnesses who as less trustworthy persons were requested through the wicket to remain in the yard until they should be called in their respective turns  had julian been inclined for mirth as was far from being the case he must have smiled at the incongruity of the clerks apparel who had belted over his black buckram suit a buff baldric sustaining a broadsword and a pair of huge horsepistols and instead of the low flat hat which coming in place of the city cap completed the dress of a scrivener had placed on his greasy locks a rusted steelcap which had seen marstonmoor across which projected his wellused quill in the guise of a plumethe shape of the morion not admitting of its being stuck as usual behind his ear  this whimsical figure conducted the constable his assistants and the prisoner into the low hall where his principal dealt forth justice who presented an appearance still more singular than that of his dependant  sundry good protestants who thought so highly of themselves as to suppose they were worthy to be distinguished as objects of catholic cruelty had taken to defensive arms on the occasion but it was quickly found that a breastplate and backplate of proof fastened together with iron clasps was no convenient enclosure for a man who meant to eat venison and custard and that a buffcoat or shirt of mail was scarcely more accommodating to the exertions necessary on such active occasions besides there were other objections as the alarming and menacing aspects which such warlike habiliments gave to the exchange and other places where merchants most do congregate and excoriations were bitterly complained of by many who not belonging to the artillery company or trained bands had no experience in bearing defensive armour  to obviate these objections and at the same time to secure the persons of all true protestant citizens against open force or privy assassinations on the part of the papists some ingenious artist belonging we may presume to the worshipful mercers company had contrived a species of armour of which neither the horsearmory in the tower nor gwynnaps gothic hall no nor dr meyricks invaluable collection of ancient arms has preserved any specimen it was called silkarmour being composed of a doublet and breeches of quilted silk so closely stitched and of such thickness as to be proof against either bullet or steel while a thick bonnet of the same materials with earflaps attached to it and on the whole much resembling a nightcap completed the equipment and ascertained the security of the wearer from the head to the knee  master maulstatute among other worthy citizens had adopted this singular panoply which had the advantage of being soft and warm and flexible as well as safe and he now sat in his judicial elbowchaira short rotund figure hung round as it were with cushions for such was the appearance of the quilted garments and with a nose protruded from under the silken casque the size of which together with the unwieldiness of the whole figure gave his worship no indifferent resemblance to the sign of the hog in armour which was considerably improved by the defensive garment being of dusty orange colour not altogether unlike the hue of those halfwild swine which are to be found in the forest of hampshire  secure in these invulnerable envelopments his worship had rested content although severed from his own deathdoing weapons of rapier poniard and pistols which were placed nevertheless at no great distance from his chair one offensive implement indeed he thought it prudent to keep on the table beside his huge coke upon lyttleton this was a sort of pocket flail consisting of a piece of strong ash about eighteen inches long to which was attached a swinging club of lignumvitæ nearly twice as long as the handle but jointed so as to be easily folded up this instrument which bore at that time the singular name of the protestant flail might be concealed under the coat until circumstances demanded its public appearance a better precaution against surprise than his arms whether offensive or defensive was a strong iron grating which crossing the room in front of the justices table and communicating by a grated door which was usually kept locked effectually separated the accused party from his judge  justice maulstatute such as we have described him chose to hear the accusation of the witnesses before calling on peveril for his defence the detail of the affray was briefly given by the bystanders and seemed deeply to touch the spirit of the examinator he shook his silken casque emphatically when he understood that after some language betwixt the parties which the witnesses did not quite understand the young man in custody struck the first blow and drew his sword before the wounded party had unsheathed his weapon again he shook his crested head yet more solemnly when the result of the conflict was known and yet again when one of the witnesses declared that to the best of his knowledge the sufferer in the fray was a gentleman belonging to the household of his grace the duke of buckingham  a worthy peer quoth the armed magistratea true protestant and a friend to his country mercy on us to what a height of audacity hath this age arisen we see well and could were we as blind as a mole out of what quiver this shaft hath been drawn  he then put on his spectacles and having desired julian to be brought forward he glared upon him awfully with those glazen eyes from under the shade of his quilted turban  so young he said and so hardenedlackadayand a papist ill warrant  peveril had time enough to recollect the necessity of his being at large if he could possibly obtain his freedom and interposed here a civil contradiction of his worships gracious supposition he was no catholic he said but an unworthy member of the church of england  perhaps but a lukewarm protestant notwithstanding said the sage justice there are those amongst us who ride tantivy to rome and have already made out half the journeyahem  peveril disowned his being any such  and who art thou then said the justice for friend to tell you plainly i like not your visageahem  these short and emphatic coughs were accompanied each by a succinct nod intimating the perfect conviction of the speaker that he had made the best the wisest and the most acute observation of which the premises admitted  julian irritated by the whole circumstances of his detention answered the justices interrogation in rather a lofty tone my name is julian peveril  now heaven be around us said the terrified justicethe son of that blackhearted papist and traitor sir geoffrey peveril now in hands and on the verge of trial  how sir exclaimed julian forgetting his situation and stepping forward to the grating with a violence which made the bars clatter he so startled the appalled justice that snatching his protestant flail master maulstatute aimed a blow at his prisoner to repel what he apprehended was a premeditated attack but whether it was owing to the justices hurry of mind or inexperience in managing the weapon he not only missed his aim but brought the swinging part of the machine round his own skull with such a severe counterbuff as completely to try the efficacy of his cushioned helmet and in spite of its defence to convey a stunning sensation which he rather hastily imputed to the consequence of a blow received from peveril  his assistants did not directly confirm the opinion which the justice had so unwarrantably adopted but all with one voice agreed that but for their own active and instantaneous interference there was no knowing what mischief might have been done by a person so dangerous as the prisoner the general opinion that he meant to proceed in the matter of his own rescue par voie du fait was indeed so deeply impressed on all present that julian saw it would be in vain to offer any defence especially being but too conscious that the alarming and probably the fatal consequences of his rencontre with the bully rendered his commitment inevitable he contented himself with asking into what prison he was to be thrown and when the formidable word newgate was returned as full answer he had at least the satisfaction to reflect that stern and dangerous as was the shelter of that roof he should at least enjoy it in company with his father and that by some means or other they might perhaps obtain the satisfaction of a melancholy meeting under the circumstances of mutual calamity which seemed impending over their house  assuming the virtue of more patience than he actually possessed julian gave the magistrate to whom all the mildness of his demeanour could not however reconcile him the direction to the house where he lodged together with a request that his servant lance outram might be permitted to send him his money and wearing apparel adding that all which might be in his possession either of arms or writingsthe former amounting to a pair of travelling pistols and the last to a few memoranda of little consequence he willingly consented to place at the disposal of the magistrate it was in that moment that he entertained with sincere satisfaction the comforting reflection that the important papers of lady derby were already in the possession of the sovereign  the justice promised attention to his requests but reminded him with great dignity that his present complacent and submissive behaviour ought for his own sake to have been adopted from the beginning instead of disturbing the presence of magistracy with such atrocious marks of the malignant rebellious and murderous spirit of popery as he had at first exhibited yet he said as he was a goodly young man and of honourable quality he would not suffer him to be dragged through the streets as a felon but had ordered a coach for his accommodation  his honour master maulstatute uttered the word coach with the importance of one who as dr johnson saith of later date is conscious of the dignity of putting horses to his chariot the worshipful master maulstatute did not however on this occasion do julian the honour of yoking to his huge family caroche the two frampal jades to use the term of the period which were wont to drag that ark to the meeting house of pure and precious master howlaglass on a thursdays evening for lecture and on a sunday for a fourhours sermon he had recourse to a leathern convenience then more rare but just introduced with every prospect of the great facility which has since been afforded by hackney coaches to all manner of communication honest and dishonest legal and illegal our friend julian hitherto much more accustomed to the saddle than to any other conveyance soon found himself in a hackney carriage with the constable and two assistants for his companions armed up to the teeththe port of destination being as they had already intimated the ancient fortress of newgate     chapter xxxiii          tis the black bandog of our jailpray look on him         but at a wary distancerouse him not         he bays not till he worries                                        the black dog of newgate  the coach stopped before those tremendous gates which resemble those of tartarus save only that they rather more frequently permit safe and honourable egress although at the price of the same anxiety and labour with which hercules and one or two of the demigods extricated themselves from the hell of the ancient mythology and sometimes it is said by the assistance of the golden boughs  julian stepped out of the vehicle carefully supported on either side by his companions and also by one or two turnkeys whom the first summons of the deep bell at the gate had called to their assistance that attention it may be guessed was not bestowed lest he should make a false step so much as for fear of his attempting an escape of which he had no intentions a few prentices and straggling boys of the neighbouring market which derived considerable advantage from increase of custom in consequence of the numerous committals on account of the popish plot and who therefore were zealous of protestants saluted him on his descent with jubilee shouts of whoop papist whoop papist dn to the pope and all his adherents  under such auspices peveril was ushered in beneath that gloomy gateway where so many bid adieu on their entrance at once to honour and to life the dark and dismal arch under which he soon found himself opened upon a large courtyard where a number of debtors were employed in playing at handball pitchandtoss hustlecap and other games for which relaxations the rigour of their creditors afforded them full leisure while it debarred them the means of pursuing the honest labour by which they might have redeemed their affairs and maintained their starving and beggared families  but with this careless and desperate group julian was not to be numbered being led or rather forced by his conductors into a low arched door which carefully secured by bolts and bars opened for his reception on one side of the archway and closed with all its fastenings the moment after his hasty entrance he was then conducted along two or three gloomy passages which where they intersected each other were guarded by as many strong wickets one of iron gates and the others of stout oak clinched with plates and studded with nails of the same metal he was not allowed to pause until he found himself hurried into a little round vaulted room which several of these passages opened into and which seemed with respect to the labyrinth through part of which he had passed to resemble the central point of a spiders web in which the main lines of that reptiles curious maze are always found to terminate  the resemblance did not end here for in this small vaulted apartment the walls of which were hung round with musketoons pistols cutlasses and other weapons as well as with many sets of fetters and irons of different construction all disposed in great order and ready for employment a person sat who might not unaptly be compared to a huge bloated and bottled spider placed there to secure the prey which had fallen into his toils  this official had originally been a very strong and squarebuilt man of large size but was now so overgrown from overfeeding perhaps and want of exercise as to bear the same resemblance to his former self which a stallfed ox still retains to a wild bull the look of no man is so inauspicious as a fat man upon whose features illnature has marked an habitual stamp he seems to have reversed the old proverb of laugh and be fat and to have thriven under the influence of the worst affections of the mind passionate we can allow a jolly mortal to be but it seems unnatural to his goodly case to be sulky and brutal now this mans features surly and tallowcoloured his limbs swelled and disproportioned his huge paunch and unwieldy carcass suggested the idea that having once found his way into this central recess he had there fattened like the weasel in the fable and fed largely and foully until he had become incapable of retreating through any of the narrow paths that terminated at his cell and was thus compelled to remain like a toad under the cold stone fattening amid the squalid airs of the dungeons by which he was surrounded which would have proved pestiferous to any other than such a congenial inhabitant huge ironclasped books lay before this ominous specimen of pinguitudethe records of the realm of misery in which office he officiated as prime minister and had peveril come thither as an unconcerned visitor his heart would have sunk within him at considering the mass of human wretchedness which must needs be registered in these fatal volumes but his own distresses sat too heavy on his mind to permit any general reflections of this nature  the constable and this bulky official whispered together after the former had delivered to the latter the warrant of julians commitment the word whispered is not quite accurate for their communication was carried on less by words than by looks and expressive signs by which in all such situations men learn to supply the use of language and to add mystery to what is in itself sufficiently terrible to the captive the only words which could be heard were those of the warden or as he was called then the captain of the jail another bird to the cage  who will whistle pretty pope of rome with any starling in your knights ward answered the constable with a facetious air checked however by the due respect to the supreme presence in which he stood  the grim feature relaxed into something like a smile as he heard the officers observation but instantly composing himself into the stern solemnity which for an instant had been disturbed he looked fiercely at his new guest and pronounced with an awful and emphatic yet rather an undervoice the single and impressive word garnish  julian peveril replied with assumed composure for he had heard of the customs of such places and was resolved to comply with them so as if possible to obtain the favour of seeing his father which he shrewdly guessed must depend on his gratifying the avarice of the keeper i am quite ready he said to accede to the customs of the place in which i unhappily find myself you have but to name your demands and i will satisfy them  so saying he drew out his purse thinking himself at the same time fortunate that he had retained about him a considerable sum of gold the captain remarked its width depth its extension and depression with an involuntary smile which had scarce contorted his hanging underlip and the wiry and greasy moustache which thatched the upper when it was checked by the recollection that there were regulations which set bounds to his rapacity and prevented him from pouncing on his prey like a kite and swooping it all off at once  this chilling reflection produced the following sullen reply to peverilthere were sundry rates gentlemen must choose for themselves he asked nothing but his fees but civility he muttered must be paid for  and shall if i can have it for payment said peveril but the price my good sir the price  he spoke with some degree of scorn which he was the less anxious to repress that he saw even in this jail his purse gave him an indirect but powerful influence over his jailer  the captain seemed to feel the same for as he spoke he plucked from his head almost involuntarily a sort of scalded furcap which served it for covering but his fingers revolting from so unusual an act of complaisance began to indemnify themselves by scratching his grizzly shockhead as he muttered in a tone resembling the softened growling of a mastiff when he has ceased to bay the intruder who shows no fear of himthere are different rates there is the little ease for common fees of the crownrather dark and the common sewer runs below it and some gentlemen object to the company who are chiefly padders and michers then the masters sidethe garnish came to one pieceand none lay stowed there but who were in for murder at the least  name your highest price sir and take it was julians concise reply  three pieces for the knights ward answered the governor of this terrestrial tartarus  take five and place me with sir geoffrey was again julians answer throwing down the money upon the desk before him  sir geoffreyhumay sir geoffrey said the jailer as if meditating what he ought to do well many a man has paid money to see sir geoffreyscarce so much as you have though but then you are like to see the last of himha ha ha  these broken muttered exclamations which terminated somewhat like the joyous growl of a tiger over his meal julian could not comprehend and only replied to by repeating his request to be placed in the same cell with sir geoffrey  ay master said the jailer never fear ill keep word with you as you seem to know something of what belongs to your station and mine and hark ye jem clink will fetch you the darbies  derby interrupted julianhas the earl or countess  earl or countessha ha ha again laughed or rather growled the warden what is your head running on you are a high fellow belike but all is one here the darbies are the fetlocksthe fastkeepers my boythe bail for good behaviour my darling and if you are not the more conforming i can add you a steel nightcap and a curious bosomfriend to keep you warm of a winter night but dont be disheartened you have behaved genteel and you shall not be put upon and as for this here matter ten to one it will turn out chancemedley or manslaughter at the worst on it and then it is but a singed thumb instead of a twisted neckalways if there be no papistry about it for then i warrant nothingtake the gentlemans worship away clink  a turnkey who was one of the party that had ushered peveril into the presence of this cerberus now conveyed him out in silence and under his guidance the prisoner was carried through a second labyrinth of passages with cells opening on each side to that which was destined for his reception  on the road through this sad region the turnkey more than once ejaculated why the gentleman must be starkmad could have had the best crown cell to himself for less than half the garnish and must pay double to pig in with sir geoffrey ha hais sir geoffrey akin to you if any one may make free to ask  i am his son answered peveril sternly in hopes to impose some curb on the fellows impertinence but the man only laughed louder than before  his sonwhy thats best of allwhy you are a strapping youthfive feet ten if you be an inchand sir geoffreys sonha ha ha  truce with your impertinence said julian my situation gives you no title to insult me  no more i do said the turnkey smothering his mirth at the recollection perhaps that the prisoners purse was not exhausted i only laughed because you said you were sir geoffreys son but no mattertis a wise child that knows his own father and here is sir geoffreys cell so you and he may settle the fatherhood between you  so saying he ushered his prisoner into a cell or rather a strong room of the better order in which there were four chairs a trucklebed and one or two other articles of furniture  julian looked eagerly around for his father but to his surprise the room appeared totally empty he turned with anger on the turnkey and charged him with misleading him but the fellow answered no no master i have kept faith with you your father if you call him so is only tappiced in some corner a small hole will hide him but ill rouse him out presently for youhere hoicksturn out sir geoffreyhere isha ha hayour sonor your wifes sonfor i think you have but little share in himcome to wait on you  peveril knew not how to resent the mans insolence and indeed his anxiety and apprehension of some strange mistake mingled with and in some degree neutralised his anger he looked again and again around and around the room until at length he became aware of something rolled up in a dark corner which rather resembled a small bundle of crimson cloth than any living creature at the vociferation of the turnkey however the object seemed to acquire life and motion uncoiled itself in some degree and after an effort or two gained an erect posture still covered from top to toe with the crimson drapery in which it was at first wrapped julian at the first glance imagined from the size that he saw a child of five years old but a shrill and peculiar tone of voice soon assured him of his mistake  warder said this unearthly sound what is the meaning of this disturbance have you more insults to heap on the head of one who hath ever been the butt of fortunes malice but i have a soul that can wrestle with all my misfortunes it is as large as any of your bodies  nay sir geoffrey if this be the way you welcome your own son said the turnkey but you quality folks know your own ways best  my son exclaimed the little figure audacious  here is some strange mistake said peveril in the same breath i sought sir geoffrey  and you have him before you young man said the pigmy tenant of the cell with an air of dignity at the same time casting on the floor his crimson cloak and standing before them in his full dignity of three feet six inches of height i who was the favoured servant of three successive sovereigns of the crown of england am now the tenant of this dungeon and the sport of its brutal keepers i am sir geoffrey hudson  julian though he had never before seen this important personage had no difficulty in recognising from description the celebrated dwarf of henrietta maria who had survived the dangers of civil war and private quarrelthe murder of his royal master charles i and the exile of his widowto fall upon evil tongues and evil days amidst the unsparing accusations connected with the popish plot he bowed to the unhappy old man and hastened to explain to him and to the turnkey that it was sir geoffrey peveril of martindale castle in derbyshire whose prison he desired to share  you should have said that before you parted with the golddust my master answered the turnkey for tother sir geoffrey that is the big tall greyhaired man was sent to the tower last night and the captain will think he has kept his word well enow with you by lodging you with this here sir geoffrey hudson who is the better show of the two  i pray you go to your master said peveril explain the mistake and say to him i beg to be sent to the tower  the towerha ha ha exclaimed the fellow the tower is for lords and knights and not for squires of low degreefor high treason and not for ruffing on the streets with rapier and dagger and there must go a secretarys warrant to send you there  at least let me not be a burden on this gentleman said julian there can be no use in quartering us together since we are not even acquainted go tell your master of the mistake  why so i should said clink still grinning if i were not sure that he knew it already you paid to be sent to sir geoffrey and he sent you to sir geoffrey you are so put down in the register and he will blot it for no man come come be comfortable and you shall have light and easy ironsthats all i can do for you  resistance and expostulation being out of the question peveril submitted to have a light pair of fetters secured on his ankles which allowed him nevertheless the power of traversing the apartment  during this operation he reflected that the jailer who had taken the advantage of the equivoque betwixt the two sir geoffreys must have acted as his assistant had hinted and cheated him from malice prepense since the warrant of committal described him as the son of sir geoffrey peveril it was therefore in vain as well as degrading to make farther application to such a man on the subject julian determined to submit to his fate as what could not be averted by any effort of his own  even the turnkey was moved in some degree by his youth good mien and the patience with which after the first effervescence of disappointment the new prisoner resigned himself to his situation you seem a brave young gentleman he said and shall at least have a good dinner and as good a pallet to sleep on as is within the walls of newgateand master sir geoffrey you ought to make much of him since you do not like tall fellows for i can tell you that master peveril is in for pinking long jack jenkins that was the master of defenceas tall a man as in london always excepting the kings porter master evans that carried you about in his pocket sir geoffrey as all the world heard tell  begone fellow answered the dwarf fellow i scorn you  the turnkey sneered withdrew and locked the door behind him     chapter xxxiv                degenerate youth and not of tydeus kind               whose little body lodged a mighty mind                                                     iliad  left quiet at least if not alone for the first time after the events of this troubled and varied day julian threw himself on an old oaken seat beside the embers of a seacoal fire and began to muse on the miserable situation of anxiety and danger in which he was placed where whether he contemplated the interests of his love his family affections or his friendships all seemed such a prospect as that of a sailor who looks upon breakers on every hand from the deck of a vessel which no longer obeys the helm  as peveril sat sunk in despondency his companion in misfortune drew a chair to the opposite side of the chimneycorner and began to gaze at him with a sort of solemn earnestness which at length compelled him though almost in spite of himself to pay some attention to the singular figure who seemed so much engrossed with contemplating him  geoffrey hudson we drop occasionally the title of knighthood which the king had bestowed on him in a frolic but which might introduce some confusion into our history although a dwarf of the least possible size had nothing positively ugly in his countenance or actually distorted in his limbs his head hands and feet were indeed large and disproportioned to the height of his body and his body itself much thicker than was consistent with symmetry but in a degree which was rather ludicrous than disagreeable to look upon his countenance in particular had he been a little taller would have been accounted in youth handsome and now in age striking and expressive it was but the uncommon disproportion betwixt the head and the trunk which made the features seem whimsical and bizarrean effect which was considerably increased by the dwarfs moustaches which it was his pleasure to wear so large that they almost twisted back amongst and mingled with his grizzled hair  the dress of this singular wight announced that he was not entirely free from the unhappy taste which frequently induces those whom nature has marked by personal deformity to distinguish and at the same time to render themselves ridiculous by the use of showy colours and garments fantastically and extraordinarily fashioned but poor geoffrey hudsons laces embroideries and the rest of his finery were sorely worn and tarnished by the time which he had spent in jail under the vague and malicious accusation that he was somehow or other an accomplice in this allinvolving alldevouring whirlpool of a popish conspiracyan impeachment which if pronounced by a mouth the foulest and most malicious was at that time sufficiently predominant to sully the fairest reputation it will presently appear that in the poor mans manner of thinking and tone of conversation there was something analogous to his absurd fashion of apparel for as in the latter good stuff and valuable decorations were rendered ludicrous by the fantastic fashion in which they were made up so such glimmerings of good sense and honourable feeling as the little man often evinced were made ridiculous by a restless desire to assume certain airs of importance and a great jealousy of being despised on account of the peculiarity of his outward form  after the fellowprisoners had looked at each other for some time in silence the dwarf conscious of his dignity as first owner of their joint apartment thought it necessary to do the honours of it to the newcomer sir he said modifying the alternate harsh and squeaking tones of his voice into accents as harmonious as they could attain i understand you to be the son of my worthy namesake and ancient acquaintance the stout sir geoffrey peveril of the peak i promise you i have seen your father where blows have been going more plenty than gold pieces and for a tall heavy man who lacked as we martialists thought some of the lightness and activity of our more slightly made cavaliers he performed his duty as a man might desire i am happy to see you his son and though by a mistake i am glad we are to share this comfortless cabin together  julian bowed and thanked his courtesy and geoffrey hudson having broken the ice preceded to question him without further ceremony you are no courtier i presume young gentleman  julian replied in the negative  i thought so continued the dwarf for although i have now no official duty at court the region in which my early years were spent and where i once held a considerable office yet i still when i had my liberty visited the presence from time to time as in duty bound for former service and am wont from old habit to take some note of the courtly gallants those choice spirits of the age among whom i was once enrolled you are not to compliment you a marked figure master peverilthough something of the tallest as was your fathers case i think i could scarce have seen you anywhere without remembering you  peveril thought he might with great justice have returned the compliment but contented himself with saying he had scarce seen the british court  tis pity said hudson a gallant can hardly be formed without frequenting it but you have been perhaps in a rougher school you have served doubtless  my maker i hope said julian  fie on it you mistake i meant said hudson á la françoisyou have served in the army  no i have not yet had that honour said julian  what neither courtier nor soldier master peveril said the important little man your father is to blame by cock and pie he is master peveril how shall a man be known or distinguished unless by his bearing in peace and war i tell you sir that at newberry where i charged with my troop abreast with prince rupert and when as you may have heard we were both beaten off by those cuckoldly hinds the trained bands of londonwe did what men could and i think it was a matter of three or four minutes after most of our gentlemen had been driven off that his highness and i continued to cut at their long pikes with our swords and i think might have broken in but that i had a tall longlegged brute of a horse and my sword was somewhat shortin fine at last we were obliged to make volteface and then as i was going to say the fellows were so glad to get rid of us that they set up a great jubilee cry of there goes prince robin and cock robinay ay every scoundrel among them knew me well but those days are overand where were you educated young gentleman  peveril named the household of the countess of derby  a most honourable lady upon my word as a gentleman said hudsoni knew the noble countess well when i was about the person of my royal mistress henrietta maria she was then the very muster of all that was noble loyal and lovely she was indeed one of the fifteen fair ones of the court whom i permitted to call me piccoluominia foolish jest on my somewhat diminutive figure which always distinguished me from ordinary beings even when i was youngi have now lost much stature by stooping but always the ladies had their jest at meperhaps young man i had my own amends of some of them somewhere and somehow or otheri say nothing if i had or no far less do i insinuate disrespect to the noble countess she was daughter of the duc de la tremouille or more correctly des thouars but certainly to serve the ladies and condescend to their humours even when somewhat too free or too fantastic is the true decorum of gentle blood  depressed as his spirits were peveril could scarce forbear smiling when he looked at the pigmy creature who told these stories with infinite complacency and appeared disposed to proclaim as his own herald that he had been a very model of valour and gallantry though love and arms seemed to be pursuits totally irreconcilable to his shrivelled weatherbeaten countenance and wasted limbs julian was however so careful to avoid giving his companion pain that he endeavoured to humour him by saying that unquestionably one bred up like sir geoffrey hudson in court and camps knew exactly when to suffer personal freedoms and when to control them  the little knight with great vivacity though with some difficulty began to drag his seat from the side of the fire opposite to that where julian was seated and at length succeeded in bringing it near him in token of increasing cordiality  you say well master peveril said the dwarf and i have given proofs both of bearing and forbearing yes sir there was not that thing which my most royal mistress henrietta maria could have required of me that i would not have complied with sir i was her sworn servant both in war and in festival in battle and pageant sir at her majestys particular request i once condescended to becomeladies you know have strange fanciesto become the tenant for a time of the interior of a pie  of a pie said julian somewhat amazed  yes sir of a pie i hope you find nothing risible in my complaisance replied his companion something jealously  not i sir said peveril i have other matters than laughter in my head at present  so had i said the dwarfish champion when i found myself imprisoned in a huge platter of no ordinary dimensions you may be assured since i could lie at length in it and when i was entombed as it were in walls of standing crust and a huge cover of pastry the whole constituting a sort of sarcophagus of size enough to have recorded the epitaph of a general officer or an archbishop on the lid sir notwithstanding the conveniences which were made to give me air it was more like being buried alive than aught else which i could think of  i conceive it sir said julian  moreover sir continued the dwarf there were few in the secret which was contrived for the queens divertisement for advancing of which i would have crept into a filbert nut had it been possible and few as i said being private in the scheme there was a risk of accidents i doubted while in my darksome abode whether some awkward attendant might not have let me fall as i have seen happen to a venison pasty or whether some hungry guest might not anticipate the moment of my resurrection by sticking his knife into my upper crust and though i had my weapons about me young man as has been my custom in every case of peril yet if such a rash person had plunged deep into the bowels of the supposed pasty my sword and dagger could barely have served me to avenge assuredly not to prevent either of these catastrophes  certainly i do so understand it said julian who began however to feel that the company of little hudson talkative as he showed himself was likely rather to aggravate than to alleviate the inconveniences of a prison  nay continued the little man enlarging on his former topic i had other subjects of apprehension for it pleased my lord of buckingham his graces father who now bears the title in his plenitude of court favour to command the pasty to be carried down to the office and committed anew to the oven alleging preposterously that it was better to be eaten warm than cold  and did this sir not disturb your equanimity said julian  my young friend said geoffrey hudson i cannot deny itnature will claim her rights from the best and boldest of usi thought of nebuchadnezzar and his fiery furnace and i waxed warm with apprehensionbut i thank heaven i also thought of my sworn duty to my royal mistress and was thereby obliged and enabled to resist all temptations to make myself prematurely known nevertheless the dukeif of malice may heaven forgive himfollowed down into the office himself and urged the mastercook very hard that the pasty should be heated were it but for five minutes but the mastercook being privy to the very different intentions of my royal mistress did most manfully resist the order and i was again reconveyed in safety to the royal table  and in due time liberated from your confinement i doubt not said peveril  yes sir that happy and i may say glorious moment at length arrived continued the dwarf the upper crust was removedi started up to the sound of trumpet and clarion like the soul of a warrior when the last summons shall soundor rather if that simile be over audacious like a spellbound champion relieved from his enchanted state it was then that with my buckler on my arm and my trusty bilboa in my hand i executed a sort of warlike dance in which my skill and agility then rendered me preeminent displaying at the same time my postures both of defence and offence in a manner so totally inimitable that i was almost deafened with the applause of all around me and halfdrowned by the scented waters with which the ladies of the court deluged me from their casting bottles i had amends of his grace of buckingham also for as i tripped a hasty morris hither and thither upon the diningtable now offering my blade now recovering it i made a blow at his nosea sort of estramaçonthe dexterity of which consists in coming mighty near to the object you seem to aim at yet not attaining it you may have seen a barber make such a flourish with his razor i promise you his grace sprung back a halfyard at least he was pleased to threaten to brain me with a chickenbone as he disdainfully expressed it but the king said george you have but a rowland for an oliver and so i tripped on showing a bold heedlessness of his displeasure which few dared to have done at that time albeit countenanced to the utmost like me by the smiles of the brave and the fair but welladay sir youth its fashions its follies its frolics and all its pomp and pride are as idle and transitory as the crackling of thorns under a pot  the flower that is cast into the oven were a better simile thought peveril good god that a man should live to regret not being young enough to be still treated as baked meat and served up in a pie  his companion whose tongue had for many days been as closely imprisoned as his person seemed resolved to indemnify his loquacity by continuing to indulge it on the present occasion at his companions expense he proceeded therefore in a solemn tone to moralise on the adventure which he had narrated  young men will no doubt think one to be envied he said who was thus enabled to be the darling and admiration of the courtjulian internally stood selfexculpated from the suspicionand yet it is better to possess fewer means of distinction and remain free from the backbiting the slander and the odium which are always the share of court favour men who had no other cause cast reflections upon me because my size varied somewhat from the common proportion and jests were sometimes unthinkingly passed upon me by those i was bound to who did not in that case peradventure sufficiently consider that the wren is made by the same hand which formed the bustard and that the diamond though small in size outvalues ten thousandfold the rude granite nevertheless they proceeded in the vein of humour and as i could not in duty or gratitude retort upon nobles and princes i was compelled to cast about in my mind how to vindicate my honour towards those who being in the same rank with myself as servants and courtiers nevertheless bore themselves towards me as if they were of a superior class in the rank of honour as well as in the accidental circumstance of stature and as a lesson to my own pride and that of others it so happened that the pageant which i have but just narratedwhich i justly reckon the most honourable moment of my life excepting perhaps my distinguished share in the battle of roundwaydownbecame the cause of a most tragic event in which i acknowledge the greatest misfortune of my existence  the dwarf here paused fetched a sigh big at once with regret and with the importance becoming the subject of a tragic history then proceeded as follows  you would have thought in your simplicity young gentleman that the pretty pageant i have mentioned could only have been quoted to my advantage as a rare masking frolic prettily devised and not less deftly executed and yet the malice of the courtiers who maligned and envied me made them strain their wit and exhaust their ingenuity in putting false and ridiculous constructions upon it in short my ears were so much offended with allusions to pies puffpaste ovens and the like that i was compelled to prohibit such subject of mirth under penalty of my instant and severe displeasure but it happd there was then a gallant about the court a man of good quality son to a knight baronet and in high esteem with the best in that sphere also a familiar friend of mine own from whom therefore i had no reason to expect any of that species of gibing which i had intimated my purpose to treat as offensive howbeit it pleased the honourable mr crofts so was this youth called and designed one night at the groom porters being full of wine and waggery to introduce this threadbare subject and to say something concerning a goosepie which i could not but consider as levelled at me nevertheless i did but calmly and solidly pray him to choose a different subject failing which i let him know i should be sudden in my resentment notwithstanding he continued in the same tone and even aggravated the offence by speaking of a tomtit and other unnecessary and obnoxious comparisons whereupon i was compelled to send him a cartel and we met accordingly now as i really loved the youth it was my intention only to correct him by a flesh wound or two and i would willingly that he had named the sword for his weapon nevertheless he made pistols his election and being on horseback he produced by way of his own weapon a foolish engine which children are wont in their roguery to use for spouting water aain short i forget the name  a squirt doubtless said peveril who began to recollect having heard something of this adventure  you are right said the dwarf you have indeed the name of the little engine of which i have had experience in passing the yards at westminsterwell sir this token of slight regard compelled me to give the gentleman such language as soon rendered it necessary for him to make more serious arms we fought on horsebackbreaking ground and advancing by signal and as i never miss aim i had the misadventure to kill the honourable master crofts at the first shot i would not wish my worst foe the pain which i felt when i saw him reel on his saddle and so fall down to the earthand when i perceived that the lifeblood was pouring fast i could not but wish to heaven that it had been my own instead of his thus fell youth hopes and bravery a sacrifice to a silly and thoughtless jest yet alas wherein had i choice seeing that honour is as it were the very breath in our nostrils and that in no sense can we be said to live if we permit ourselves to be deprived of it  the tone of feeling in which the dwarfish hero concluded his story gave julian a better opinion of his heart and even of his understanding than he had been able to form of one who gloried in having upon a grand occasion formed the contents of a pasty he was indeed enabled to conjecture that the little champion was seduced into such exhibitions by the necessity attached to his condition by his own vanity and by the flattery bestowed on him by those who sought pleasure in practical jokes the fate of the unlucky master crofts however as well as various exploits of this diminutive person during the civil wars in which he actually and with great gallantry commanded a troop of horse rendered most men cautious of openly rallying him which was indeed the less necessary as when left alone he seldom failed voluntarily to show himself on the ludicrous side  at one hour after noon the turnkey true to his word supplied the prisoners with a very tolerable dinner and a flask of wellflavoured though light claret which the old man who was something of a bonvivant regretted to observe was nearly as diminutive as himself the evening also passed away but not without continued symptoms of garrulity on the part of geoffrey hudson  it is true these were of a graver character than he had hitherto exhibited for when the flask was empty he repeated a long latin prayer but the religious act in which he had been engaged only gave his discourse a more serious turn than belonged to his former themes of war ladys love and courtly splendour  the little knight harangued at first on polemical points of divinity and diverged from this thorny path into the neighbouring and twilight walk of mysticism he talked of secret warningsof the predictions of sadeyed prophetsof the visits of monitory spirits and the rosicrucian secrets of the cabala all which topics he treated of with such apparent conviction nay with so many appeals to personal experience that one would have supposed him a member of the fraternity of gnomes or fairies whom he resembled so much in point of size  in short he persevered for a stricken hour in such a torrent of unnecessary tattle as determined peveril at all events to endeavour to procure a separate lodging having repeated his evening prayers in latin as formerly for the old gentleman was a catholic which was the sole cause of his falling under suspicion he set off on a new score as they were undressing and continued to prattle until he had fairly talked both himself and his companion to sleep     chapter xxxv                of airy tongues that syllable mens names                                                    comus  julian had fallen asleep with his brain rather filled with his own sad reflections than with the mystical lore of the little knight and yet it seemed as if in his visions the latter had been more present to his mind than the former  he dreamed of gliding spirits gibbering phantoms bloody hands which dimly seen by twilight seemed to beckon him forward like errantknight on sad adventure bound more than once he started from his sleep so lively was the influence of these visions on his imagination and he always awaked under the impression that some one stood by his bedside the chillness of his ankles the weight and clatter of the fetters as he turned himself on his pallet reminded him on these occasions where he was and under what circumstances the extremity to which he saw all that was dear to him at present reduced struck a deeper cold on his heart than the iron upon his limbs nor could he compose himself again to rest without a mental prayer to heaven for protection but when he had been for a third time awakened from repose by these thickstirring fancies his distress of mind vented itself in speech and he was unable to suppress the almost despairing ejaculation god have mercy upon us  amen answered a voice as sweet and soft as honey dew which sounded as if the words were spoken close by his bedside  the natural inference was that geoffrey hudson his companion in calamity had echoed the prayer which was so proper to the situation of both but the tone of voice was so different from the harsh and dissonant sounds of the dwarfs enunciation that peveril was impressed with the certainty it could not proceed from hudson he was struck with involuntary terror for which he could give no sufficient reason and it was not without an effort that he was able to utter the question sir geoffrey did you speak  no answer was returned he repeated the question louder and the same silvertoned voice which had formerly said amen to his prayers answered to his interrogatory your companion will not awake while i am here  and who are youwhat seek youhow came you into this place said peveril huddling eagerly question upon question  i am a wretched being but one who loves you welli come for your goodconcern yourself no farther  it now rushed on julians mind that he had heard of persons possessed of the wonderful talent of counterfeiting sounds to such accuracy that they could impose on their hearers the belief that they proceeded from a point of the apartment entirely opposite to that which the real speaker occupied persuaded that he had now gained the depth of the mystery he replied this trifling sir geoffrey is unseasonable say what you have to say in your own voice and manner these apish pleasantries do not become midnight in a newgate dungeon  but the being who speaks with you answered the voice is fitted for the darkest hour and the most melancholy haunts  impatient of suspense and determined to satisfy his curiosity julian jumped at once from his pallet hoping to secure the speaker whose voice indicated he was so near but he altogether failed in his attempt and grasped nothing save thin air  for a turn or two peveril shuffled at random about the room with his arms extended and then at last recollected that with the impediment of his shackles and the noise which necessarily accompanied his motions and announced where he was it would be impossible for him to lay hands on any one who might be disposed to keep out of his reach he therefore endeavoured to return to his bed but in groping for his way lighted first on that of his fellowprisoner the little captive slept deep and heavy as was evinced from his breathing and upon listening a moment julian became again certain either that his companion was the most artful of ventriloquists and of dissemblers or that there was actually within the precincts of that guarded chamber some third being whose very presence there seemed to intimate that it belonged not to the ordinary line of humanity  julian was no ready believer in the supernatural but that age was very far from being so incredulous concerning ghostly occurrences as our own and it was no way derogatory to his good sense that he shared the prejudices of his time his hair began to bristle and the moisture to stand on his brow as he called on his companion to awake for heavens sake  the dwarf answeredbut he spoke without awakingthe day may dawn and be dd tell the master of the horse i will not go to the hunting unless i have the little black jennet  i tell you said julian there is some one in the apartment have you not a tinderbox to strike a light  i care not how slight my horse be replied the slumberer pursuing his own train of ideas which doubtless carried him back to the green woods of windsor and the royal deerhunts which he had witnessed there i am not overweighti will not ride that great holstein brute that i must climb up to by a ladder and then sit on his back like a pincushion on an elephant  julian at length put his hand to the sleepers shoulder and shook him so as to awake him from his dream when after two or three snorts and groans the dwarf asked peevishly what the devil ailed him  the devil himself for what i know said peveril is at this very moment in the room here beside us  the dwarf on this information started up crossed himself and began to hammer a flint and steel with all despatch until he had lighted a little piece of candle which he said was consecrated to saint bridget and as powerful as the herb called fuga dæmonum or the liver of the fish burnt by tobit in the house of raguel for chasing all goblins and evil or dubious spirits from the place of its radiance if indeed as the dwarf carefully guarded his proposition they existed anywhere save in the imagination of his fellowprisoner  accordingly the apartment was no sooner enlightened by this holy candles end than julian began to doubt the evidence of his own ears for not only was there no one in the room save sir geoffrey hudson and himself but all the fastenings of the door were so secure that it seemed impossible that they could have been opened and again fixed without a great deal of noise which on the last occasion at least could not possibly have escaped his ears seeing that he must have been on his feet and employed in searching the chamber when the unknown if an earthly being was in the act of retreating from it  julian gazed for a moment with great earnestness and no little perplexity first on the bolted door then on the grated window and began to accuse his own imagination of having played him an unpleasant trick he answered little to the questions of hudson and returning to his bed heard in silence a long studied oration on the merits of saint bridget which comprehended the greater part of her longwinded legend and concluded with the assurance that from all accounts preserved of her that holy saint was the least of all possible women except those of the pigmy kind  by the time the dwarf had ceased to speak julians desire of sleep had returned and after a few glances around the apartment which was still illuminated by the expiring beams of the holy taper his eyes were again closed in forgetfulness and his repose was not again disturbed in the course of that night  morning dawns on newgate as well as on the freest mountainturf which welshman or wildgoat ever trode but in so different a fashion that the very beams of heavens precious sun when they penetrate into the recesses of the prisonhouse have the air of being committed to jail still with the light of day around him peveril easily persuaded himself of the vanity of his preceding nights visions and smiled when he reflected that fancies similar to those to which his ear was often exposed in the isle of man had been able to arrange themselves in a manner so impressive when he heard them from the mouth of so singular a character as hudson and in the solitude of a prison  before julian had awaked the dwarf had already quitted his bed and was seated in the chimneycorner of the apartment where with his own hands he had arranged a morsel of fire partly attending to the simmering of a small pot which he had placed on the flame partly occupied with a huge folio volume which lay on the table before him and seemed wellnigh as tall and bulky as himself he was wrapped up in the dusky crimson cloak already mentioned which served him for a morninggown as well as a mantle against the cold and which corresponded with a large monterocap that enveloped his head the singularity of his features and of the eyes armed with spectacles which were now cast on the subject of his studies now directed towards his little cauldron would have tempted rembrandt to exhibit him on canvas either in the character of an alchymist or of a necromancer engaged in some strange experiment under the direction of one of the huge manuals which treat of the theory of these mystic arts  the attention of the dwarf was bent however upon a more domestic object he was only preparing soup of no unsavoury quality for breakfast which he invited peveril to partake with him i am an old soldier he said and i must add an old prisoner and understand how to shift for myself better than you can do young manconfusion to the scoundrel clink he has put the spicebox out of my reachwill you hand it me from the mantelpiecei will teach you as the french have it faire la cuisine and then if you please we will divide like brethren the labours of our prison house  julian readily assented to the little mans friendly proposal without interposing any doubt as to his continuing an inmate of the same cell truth is that although upon the whole he was inclined to regard the whispering voice of the preceding evening as the impression of his own excited fancy he felt nevertheless curiosity to see how a second night was to pass over in the same cell and the tone of the invisible intruder which at midnight had been heard by him with terror now excited on recollection a gentle and not unpleasing species of agitationthe combined effect of awe and of awakened curiosity  days of captivity have little to mark them as they glide away that which followed the night which we have described afforded no circumstance of note the dwarf imparted to his youthful companion a volume similar to that which formed his own studies and which proved to be a tome of one of scuderis now forgotten romances of which geoffrey hudson was a great admirer and which were then very fashionable both at the french and english courts although they contrive to unite in their immense folios all the improbabilities and absurdities of the old romances of chivalry without that tone of imagination which pervades them and all the metaphysical absurdities which cowley and the poets of the age had heaped upon the passion of love like so many load of small coal upon a slender fire which it smothers instead of aiding  but julian had no alternative saving only to muse over the sorrows of artamenes and mandane or on the complicated distresses of his own situation and in these disagreeable divertisements the morning crept through as it could  noon first and thereafter nightfall were successively marked by a brief visit from their stern turnkey who with noiseless step and sullen demeanour did in silence the necessary offices about the meals of the prisoners exchanging with them as few words as an official in the spanish inquisition might have permitted himself upon a similar occasion with the same taciturn gravity very different from the laughing humour into which he had been surprised on a former occasion he struck their fetters with a small hammer to ascertain by the sound thus produced whether they had been tampered with by file or otherwise he next mounted on a table to make the same experiment on the windowgrating  julians heart throbbed for might not one of those grates have been so tampered with as to give entrance to the nocturnal visitant but they returned to the experienced ear of master clink when he struck them in turn with the hammer a clear and ringing sound which assured him of their security  it would be difficult for any one to get in through these defences said julian giving vent in words to his own feelings  few wish that answered the surly groom misconstruing what was passing in peverils mind and let me tell you master folks will find it quite as difficult to get out he retired and night came on  the dwarf who took upon himself for the day the whole duties of the apartment trundled about the room making a most important clatter as he extinguished their fire and put aside various matters which had been in use in the course of the day talking to himself all the while in a tone of no little consequence occasionally grounded on the dexterity with which an old soldier could turn his hand to anything then came the repetition of his accustomed prayers but his disposition to converse did not as on the former occasion revive after his devotions on the contrary long before julian had closed an eye the heavy breathing from sir geoffrey hudsons pallet declared that the dwarf was already in the arms of morpheus  amid the total darkness of the apartment and with a longing desire and at the same time no small fear for the recurrence of the mysterious address of the preceding evening julian lay long awake without his thoughts receiving any interruption save when the clock told the passing hour from the neighbouring steeple of st sepulchre at length he sunk into slumber but had not slept to his judgment above an hour when he was roused by the sound which his waking ear had so long expected in vain  can you sleepwill you sleepdare you sleep were the questions impressed on his ear in the same clear soft and melodious voice which had addressed him on the preceding night  who is it asks me the question answered julian but be the questioner good or evil i reply that i am a guiltless prisoner and that innocence may wish and dare to sleep soundly  ask no questions of me said the voice neither attempt to discover who speaks to you and be assured that folly alone can sleep with fraud around and danger before him  can you who tell me of dangers counsel me how to combat or how to avoid them said julian  my power is limited said the voice yet something i can do as the glowworm can show a precipice but you must confide in me  confidence must beget confidence answered julian i cannot repose trust in i know not what or whom  speak not so loud replied the voice sinking almost into a whisper  last night you said my companion would not awake said julian  tonight i warrant not that he shall sleep said the voice and as it spoke the hoarse snatching discordant tones of the dwarf were heard demanding of julian why he talked in his sleepwherefore he did not rest himself and let other people restand finally whether his visions of last night were returned upon him again  say yes said the voice in a whisper so low yet so distinct that julian almost doubted whether it was not an echo of his own thoughtsay but yesand i part to return no more  in desperate circumstances men look to strange and unusual remedies and although unable to calculate the chances of advantage which this singular communication opened to him julian did not feel inclined to let them at once escape from him he answered the dwarf that he had been troubled by an alarming dream  i could have sworn it from the sound of your voice said hudson it is strange now that you overgrown men never possess the extreme firmness of nerves proper to us who are cast in a more compact mould my own voice retains its masculine sounds on all occasions dr cockerel was of opinion that there was the same allowance of nerve and sinew to men of every size and that nature spun the stock out thinner or stronger according to the extent of surface which they were to cover hence the least creatures are oftentimes the strongest place a beetle under a tall candlestick and the insect will move it by its efforts to get out which is in point of comparative strength as if one of us should shake his majestys prison of newgate by similar struggles cats also and weasels are creatures of greater exertion or endurance than dogs or sheep and in general you may remark that little men dance better and are more unwearied under exertion of every kind than those to whom their own weight must necessarily be burdensome i respect you master peveril because i am told you have killed one of those gigantic fellows who go about swaggering as if their souls were taller than ours because their noses are nearer to the clouds by a cubit or two but do not value yourself on this as anything very unusual i would have you to know it hath been always thus and that in the history of all ages the clean tight dapper little fellow hath proved an overmatch for his bulky antagonist i need only instance out of holy writ the celebrated downfall of goliah and of another lubbard who had more fingers to his hand and more inches to his stature than ought to belong to an honest man and who was slain by a nephew of good king david and of many others whom i do not remember nevertheless they were all philistines of gigantic stature in the classics also you have tydeus and other tight compact heroes whose diminutive bodies were the abode of large minds and indeed you may observe in sacred as well as profane history that your giants are ever heretics and blasphemers robbers and oppressors outragers of the female sex and scoffers at regular authority such were gog and magog whom our authentic chronicles vouch to have been slain near to plymouth by the good little knight corineus who gave name to cornwall ascaparte also was subdued by bevis and colbrand by guy as southampton and warwick can testify like unto these was the giant hoel slain in bretagne by king arthur and if ryence king of north wales who was done to death by the same worthy champion of christendom be not actually termed a giant it is plain he was little better since he required twentyfour kings beards which were then worn full and long to fur his gown whereby computing each beard at eighteen inches and you cannot allow less for a beardroyal and supposing only the front of the gown trimmed therewith as we use ermine and that the back was mounted and lined instead of catskins and squirrels fur with the beards of earls and dukes and other inferior dignitariesmay amount tobut i will work the question tomorrow  nothing is more soporific to any save a philosopher or moneyed man than the operation of figures and when in bed the effect is irresistible sir geoffrey fell asleep in the act of calculating king ryences height from the supposed length of his mantle indeed had he not stumbled on this abstruse subject of calculation there is no guessing how long he might have held forth upon the superiority of men of little stature which was so great a favourite with him that numerous as such narratives are the dwarf had collected almost all the instances of their victories over giants which history or romance afforded  no sooner had unequivocal signs of the dwarfs sound slumbers reached julians ears than he began to listen eagerly for the renewal of that mysterious communication which was at once interesting and awful even whilst hudson was speaking he had instead of bestowing his attention upon his eulogy on persons of low statue kept his ears on watchful guard to mark if possible the lightest sounds of any sort which might occur in the apartment so that he thought it scarce possible that even a fly should have left it withouts its motion being overheard if therefore his invisible monitor was indeed a creature of this worldan opinion which julians sound sense rendered him unwilling to renouncethat being could not have left the apartment and he waited impatiently for a renewal of their communication he was disappointed not the slightest sound reached his ear and the nocturnal visitor if still in the room appeared determined on silence  it was in vain that peveril coughed hemmed and gave other symptoms of being awake at length such became his impatience that he resolved at any risk to speak first in hopes of renewing the communication betwixt them whoever thou art he said in a voice loud enough to be heard by a waking person but not so high as to disturb his sleeping companionwhoever or whatever thou art thou hast shown some interest in the fate of such a castaway as julian peveril speak once more i conjure thee and be your communication for good or evil believe me i am equally prepared to abide the issue  no answer of any kind was returned to this invocation nor did the least sound intimate the presence of the being to whom it was so solemnly addressed  i speak in vain said julian and perhaps i am but invoking that which is insensible of human feeling or which takes a malign pleasure in human suffering  there was a gentle and halfbroken sigh from a corner of the apartment which answering to this exclamation seemed to contradict the imputation which it conveyed  julian naturally courageous and familiarised by this time to his situation raised himself in bed and stretched out his arm to repeat his adjuration when the voice as if alarmed at his action and energy whispered in a tone more hurried than that which it had hitherto used be stillmove notor i am mute for ever  it is then a mortal being who is present with me was the natural inference of julian and one who is probably afraid of being detected i have then some power over my visitor though i must be cautious how i use itif your intents are friendly he proceeded there was never a time in which i lacked friends more or would be more grateful for kindness the fate of all who are dear to me is weighed in the balance and with worlds would i buy the tidings of their safety  i have said my power is limited replied the voice you i may be able to preservethe fate of your friends is beyond my control  let me at least know it said julian and be it as it may i will not shun to share it  for whom would you inquire said the soft sweet voice not without a tremulousness of accent as if the question was put with diffident reluctance  my parents said julian after a moments hesitation how fare theywhat will be their fate  they fare as the fort under which the enemy has dug a deadly mine the work may have cost the labour of years such were the impediments to the engineers but time brings opportunity upon its wings  and what will be the event said peveril  can i read the future answered the voice save by comparison with pastwho has been hunted on these stern and unmitigable accusations but has been at last brought to bay did high and noble birth honoured age and approved benevolence save the unfortunate lord stafford did learning capacity of intrigue or high court favour redeem coleman although the confidential servant of the heir presumptive of the crown of englanddid subtilty and genius and exertions of a numerous sect save fenwicke or whitbread or any other of the accused priestswere groves pickering or the other humble wretches who have suffered safe in their obscurity there is no condition in life no degree of talent no form of principle which affords protection against an accusation which levels conditions confounds characters renders mens virtues their sins and rates them as dangerous in proportion as they have influence though attained in the noblest manner and used for the best purposes call such a one but an accessory to the plotlet him be mouthed in the evidence of oates or dugdaleand the blindest shall foresee the issue of their trial  prophet of evil said julian my father has a shield invulnerable to protect him he is innocent  let him plead his innocence at the bar of heaven said the voice it will serve him little where scroggs presides  still i fear not said julian counterfeiting more confidence than he really possessed my fathers cause will be pleaded before twelve englishmen  better before twelve wild beasts answered the invisible than before englishmen influenced with party prejudice passion and epidemic terror of an imaginary danger they are bold in guilt in proportion to the number amongst whom the crime is divided  illomened speaker said julian thine is indeed a voice fitted only to sound with the midnight bell and the screeching owl yet speak again tell me if thou cansthe would have said of alice bridgenorth but the word would not leave his tonguetell me he said if the noble house of derby  let them keep their rock like the seafowl in the tempest and it may so fall out answered the voice that their rock may be a safe refuge but there is blood on their ermine and revenge has dogged them for many a year like a bloodhound that hath been distanced in the morning chase but may yet grapple the quarry ere the sun shall set at present however they are safeam i now to speak farther on your own affairs which involve little short of your life and honour  there is said julian one from whom i was violently parted yesterday if i knew but of her safety i were little anxious for my own  one returned the voice only one from whom you were parted yesterday  but in parting from whom said julian i felt separated from all happiness which the world can give me  you mean alice bridgenorth said the invisible with some bitterness of accent but her you will never see more your own life and hers depend on your forgetting each other  i cannot purchase my own life at that price replied julian  then die in your obstinacy returned the invisible nor to all the entreaties which he used was he able obtain another word in the course of that remarkable night     chapter xxxvi                 a short houghd man but full of pride                                            allan ramsay  the blood of julian peveril was so much fevered by the state in which his invisible visitor left him that he was unable for a length of time to find repose he swore to himself that he would discover and expose the nocturnal demon which stole on his hours of rest only to add gall to bitterness and to pour poison into those wounds which already smarted so severely there was nothing which his power extended to that in his rage he did not threaten he proposed a closer and a more rigorous survey of his cell so that he might discover the mode by which his tormentor entered were it as unnoticeable as an augerhole if his diligence should prove unavailing he determined to inform the jailers to whom it could not be indifferent to know that their prison was open to such intrusions he proposed to himself to discover from their looks whether they were already privy to these visits and if so to denounce them to the magistrates to the judges to the house of commons was the least that his resentment proposed sleep surprised his wornout frame in the midst of his projects of discovery and vengeance and as frequently happens the light of the ensuing day proved favourable to calmer resolutions  he now reflected that he had no ground to consider the motives of his visitor as positively malevolent although he had afforded him little encouragement to hope for assistance on the points he had most at heart towards himself there had been expressed a decided feeling both of sympathy and interest if through means of these he could acquire his liberty he might when possessed of freedom turn it to the benefit of those for whom he was more interested than for his own welfare i have behaved like a fool he said i ought to have temporised with this singular being learned the motives of its interference and availed myself of its succour provided i could do so without any dishonourable conditions it would have been always time enough to reject such when they should have been proposed to me  so saying he was forming projects for regulating his intercourse with the stranger more prudently in case their communication should be renewed when his meditations were interrupted by the peremptory summons of sir geoffrey hudson that he would in his turn be pleased to perform those domestic duties of their common habitation which the dwarf had yesterday taken upon himself  there was no resisting a request so reasonable and peveril accordingly rose and betook himself to the arrangement of their prison while sir hudson perched upon a stool from which his legs did not by halfway reach the ground sat in a posture of elegant languor twangling upon an old brokenwinded guitar and singing songs in spanish moorish and lingua franca most detestably out of tune he failed not at the conclusion of each ditty to favour julian with some account of what he had sung either in the way of translation or historical anecdote or as the lay was connected with some peculiar part of his own eventful history in the course of which the poor little man had chanced to have been taken by a sallee rover and carried captive into morocco  this part of his life hudson used to make the era of many strange adventures and if he could himself be believed he had made wild work among the affections of the emperors seraglio but although few were in a situation to crossexamine him on gallantries and intrigues of which the scene was so remote the officers of the garrison of tangier had a report current amongst them that the only use to which the tyrannical moors could convert a slave of such slender corporeal strength was to employ him to lie abed all day and hatch turkeys eggs the least allusion to this rumour used to drive him wellnigh frantic and the fatal termination of his duel with young crofts which began in wanton mirth and ended in bloodshed made men more coy than they had formerly been of making the fiery little hero the subject of their raillery  while peveril did the drudgery of the apartment the dwarf remained much at his ease carolling in the manner we have described but when he beheld julian attempting the task of the cook sir geoffrey hudson sprang from the stool on which he sat en signor at the risk of breaking both his guitar and his neck exclaiming that he would rather prepare breakfast every morning betwixt this and the day of judgment than commit a task of such consequence to an inexperienced bungler like his companion  the young man gladly resigned his task to the splenetic little knight and only smiled at his resentment when he added that to be but a mortal of middle stature julian was as stupid as a giant leaving the dwarf to prepare the meal after his own pleasure peveril employed himself in measuring the room with his eyes on every side and in endeavouring to discover some private entrance such as might admit his midnight visitant and perhaps could be employed in case of need for effecting his own escape the floor next engaged a scrutiny equally minute but more successful  close by his own pallet and dropped in such a manner that he must have seen it sooner but for the hurry with which he obeyed the summons of the impatient dwarf lay a slip of paper sealed and directed with the initial letters jp which seemed to ascertain that it was addressed to himself he took the opportunity of opening it while the soup was in the very moment of projection and the full attention of his companion was occupied by what he in common with wiser and taller men considered as one of the principal occupations of life so that without incurring his observation or awaking his curiosity julian had the opportunity to read as follows    rash and infatuated as you are there is one who would forfeit   much to stand betwixt you and your fate you are tomorrow to be   removed to the tower where your life cannot be assured for a   single day for during the few hours you have been in london you   have provoked a resentment which is not easily slaked there is   but one chance for yourenounce abthink no more of her if   that be impossible think of her but as one whom you can never see   again if your heart can resolve to give up an attachment which it   should never have entertained and which it would be madness to   cherish longer make your acquiescence in this condition known by   putting on your hat a white band or white feather or knot of   ribbon of the same colour whichever you may most easily come by   a boat will in that case run as if by accident on board of   that which is to convey you to the tower do you in the confusion   jump overboard and swim to the southwark side of the thames   friends will attend there to secure your escape and you will find   yourself with one who will rather lose character and life than   that a hair of your head should fall to the ground but who if   you reject the warning can only think of you as of the fool who   perishes in his folly may heaven guide you to a sound judgment of   your condition so prays one who would be your friend if you   pleased                                                    unknown   the towerit was a word of terror even more so than a civil prison for how many passages to death did that dark structure present the severe executions which it had witnessed in preceding reigns were not perhaps more numerous than the secret murders which had taken place within its walls yet peveril did not a moment hesitate on the part which he had to perform i will share my fathers fate he said i thought but of him when they brought me hither i will think of nothing else when they convey me to yonder still more dreadful place of confinement it is his and it is but meet that it should be his sonsand thou alice bridgenorth the day that i renounce thee may i be held alike a traitor and a dastardgo false adviser and share the fate of seducers and heretical teachers  he could not help uttering this last expression aloud as he threw the billet into the fire with a vehemence which made the dwarf start with surprise what say you of burning heretics young man he exclaimed by my faith your zeal must be warmer than mine if you talk on such a subject when the heretics are the prevailing number may i measure six feet without my shoes but the heretics would have the best of it if we came to that work beware of such words  too late to beware of words spoken and heard said the turnkey who opening the door with unusual precautions to avoid noise had stolen unperceived into the room however master peveril has behaved like a gentlemen and i am no talebearer on condition he will consider i have had trouble in his matters  julian had no alternative but to take the fellows hint and administer a bribe with which master clink was so well satisfied that he exclaimed it went to his heart to take leave of such a kindnatured gentleman and that he could have turned the key on him for twenty years with pleasure but the best friends must part  i am to be removed then said julian  ay truly master the warrant is come from the council  to convey me to the tower  whew exclaimed the officer of the lawwho the devil told you that but since you do know it there is no harm to say ay so make yourself ready to move immediately and first hold out your dewbeaters till i take off the darbies  is that usual said peveril stretching out his feet as the fellow directed while his fetters were unlocked  why ay master these fetters belong to the keeper they are not agoing to send them to the lieutenant i trow no no the warders must bring their own gear with them they get none here i promise them nevertheless if your honour hath a fancy to go in fetters as thinking it may move compassion of your case  i have no intention to make my case seem worse than it is said julian whilst at the same time it crossed his mind that his anonymous correspondent must be well acquainted both with his own personal habits since the letter proposed a plan of escape which could only be executed by a bold swimmer and with the fashions of prison since it was foreseen that he would not be ironed on his passage to the tower the turnkeys next speech made him carry conjecture still farther  there is nothing in life i would not do for so brave a guest said clink i would nab one of my wifes ribbons for you if your honour had the fancy to mount the white flag in your beaver  to what good purpose said julian shortly connecting as was natural the mans proposed civility with the advice given and the signal prescribed in the letter  nay to no good purpose i know of said the turnkey only it is the fashion to seem white and harmlessa sort of token of notguiltiness as i may say which folks desire to show the world whether they be truly guilty or not but i cannot say that guiltiness or notguiltiness argufies much saving they be words in the verdict  strange thought peveril although the man seemed to speak quite naturally and without any double meaning strange that all should apparently combine to realise the plan of escape could i but give my consent to it and had i not better consent whoever does so much for me must wish me well and a wellwisher would never enforce the unjust conditions on which i am required to consent to my liberation  but this misgiving of his resolution was but for a moment he speedily recollected that whoever aided him in escaping must be necessarily exposed to great risk and had a right to name the stipulation on which he was willing to incur it he also recollected that falsehood is equally base whether expressed in words or in dumb show and that he should lie as flatly by using the signal agreed upon in evidence of his renouncing alice bridgenorth as he would in direct terms if he made such renunciation without the purpose of abiding by it  if you would oblige me he said to the turnkey let me have a piece of black silk or crape for the purpose you mention  of crape said the fellow what should that signify why the bien morts who bing out to tour at you will think you a chimneysweeper on mayday        the smart girls who turn out to look at you  it will show my settled sorrow said julian as well as my determined resolution  as you will sir answered the fellow ill provide you with a black rag of some kind or other so now let us be moving  julian intimated his readiness to attend him and proceeded to bid farewell to his late companion the stout geoffrey hudson the parting was not without emotion on both sides more particularly on that of the poor little man who had taken a particular liking to the companion of whom he was now about to be deprived fare ye well he said my young friend taking julians hand in both his own uplifted palms in which action he somewhat resembled the attitude of a sailor pulling a rope overheadmany in my situation would think himself wronged as a soldier and servant of the kings chamber in seeing you removed to a more honourable prison than that which i am limited unto but i thank god i grudge you not the tower nor the rocks of scilly nor even carisbrooke castle though the latter was graced with the captivity of my blessed and martyred master go where you will i wish you all the distinction of an honourable prisonhouse and a safe and speedy deliverance in gods own time for myself my race is near a close and that because i fall martyr to the overtenderness of my own heart there is a circumstance good master julian peveril which should have been yours had providence permitted our farther intimacy but it fits not the present hour go then my friend and bear witness in life and death that geoffrey hudson scorns the insults and persecutions of fortune as he would despise and has often despised the mischievous pranks of an overgrown schoolboy  so saying he turned away and hid his face with his little handkerchief while julian felt towards him that tragicomic sensation which makes us pity the object which excites it not the less that we are somewhat inclined to laugh amid our sympathy the jailer made him a signal which peveril obeyed leaving the dwarf to disconsolate solitude  as julian followed the keeper through the various windings of his penal labyrinth the man observed that he was a rum fellow that little sir geoffrey and for gallantry a perfect cock of bantam for as old as he was there was a certain gay wench he said that had hooked him but what she could make of him save she carried him to smithfield and took money for him as for a motion of puppets it was he said hard to gather  encouraged by this opening julian asked if his attendant knew why his prison was changed to teach you to become a kings post without commission answered the fellow  he stopped in his tattle as they approached that formidable central point in which lay couched on his leathern elbowchair the fat commander of the fortress stationed apparently for ever in the midst of his citadel as the huge boa is sometimes said to lie stretched as a guard upon the subterranean treasures of eastern rajas this overgrown man of authority eyed julian wistfully and sullenly as the miser the guinea which he must part with or the hungry mastiff the food which is carried to another kennel he growled to himself as he turned the leaves of his ominous register in order to make the necessary entry respecting the removal of his prisoner to the towerto the toweray ay all must to the towerthats the fashion of itfree britons to a military prison as if we had neither bolts nor chains herei hope parliament will have it up this towering work thats allwell the youngster will take no good by the change and that is one comfort  having finished at once his official act of registration and his soliloquy he made a signal to his assistants to remove julian who was led along the same stern passages which he had traversed upon his entrance to the gate of the prison whence a coach escorted by two officers of justice conveyed him to the waterside  a boat here waited him with four warders of the tower to whose custody he was formally resigned by his late attendants clink however the turnkey with whom he was more especially acquainted did not take leave of him without furnishing him with the piece of black crape which he requested peveril fixed it on his hat amid the whispers of his new guardians the gentleman is in a hurry to go into mourning said one mayhap he had better wait till he has cause  perhaps others may wear mourning for him ere he can mourn for any one answered another of these functionaries  yet notwithstanding the tenor of these whispers their behaviour to their prisoner was more respectful than he had experienced from his former keepers and might be termed a sullen civility the ordinary officers of the law were in general rude as having to do with felons of every description whereas these men were only employed with persons accused of state crimesmen who were from birth and circumstances usually entitled to expect and able to reward decent usage  the change of keepers passed unnoticed by julian as did the gay and busy scene presented by the broad and beautiful river on which he was now launched a hundred boats shot past them bearing parties intent on business or on pleasure julian only viewed them with the stern hope that whoever had endeavoured to bribe him from his fidelity by the hope of freedom might see from the colour of the badge which he had assumed how determined he was to resist the temptation presented to him  it was about highwater and a stout wherry came up the river with sail and oar so directly upon that in which julian was embarked that it seemed as if likely to run her aboard get your carabines ready cried the principal warder to his assistants what the devil can these scoundrels mean  but the crew in the other boat seemed to have perceived their error for they suddenly altered their course and struck off into the middle stream while a torrent of mutual abuse was exchanged betwixt them and the boat whose course they had threatened to impede  the unknown has kept his faith said julian to himself i too have kept mine  it even seemed to him as the boats neared each other that he heard from the other wherry something like a stifled scream or groan and when the momentary bustle was over he asked the warder who sat next him what boat that was  menofwarsmen on a frolic i suppose answered the warder i know no one else would be so impudent as run foul of the kings boat for i am sure the fellow put the helm up on purpose but mayhap you sir know more of the matter than i do  this insinuation effectually prevented julian from putting farther questions and he remained silent until the boat came under the dusky bastions of the tower the tide carried them up under a dark and lowering arch closed at the upper end by the wellknown traitors gate formed like a wicket of huge intersecting bars of wood through which might be seen a dim and imperfect view of soldiers and warders upon duty and of the steep ascending causeway which leads up from the river into the interior of the fortress by this gateand it is the wellknown circumstance which assigned its namethose accused of state crimes were usually committed to the tower the thames afforded a secret and silent mode of conveyance for transporting thither such whose fallen fortunes might move the commiseration or whose popular qualities might excite the sympathy of the public and even where no cause for especial secrecy existed the peace of the city was undisturbed by the tumult attending the passage of the prisoner and his guards through the most frequented streets        see note fortunes of nigel  yet this custom however recommended by state policy must have often struck chill upon the heart of the criminal who thus stolen as it were out of society reached the place of his confinement without encountering even one glance of compassion on the road and as from under the dusky arch he landed on those flinty steps worn by many a footstep anxious as his own against which the tide lapped fitfully with small successive waves and hence looked forward to the steep ascent into a gothic state prison and backward to such part of the river as the lowbrowd vault suffered to become visible he must often have felt that he was leaving daylight hope and life itself behind him  while the warders challenge was made and answered peveril endeavoured to obtain information from his conductors where he was likely to be confined but the answer was brief and generalwhere the lieutenant should direct  could he not be permitted to share the imprisonment of his father sir geoffrey peveril he forgot not on this occasion to add the surname of his house  the warder an old man of respectable appearance stared as if at the extravagance of the demand and said bluntly it is impossible  at least said peveril show me where my father is confined that i may look upon the walls which separate us  young gentleman said the senior warder shaking his grey head i am sorry for you but asking questions will do you no service in this place we know nothing of fathers and sons  yet chance seemed in a few minutes afterwards to offer peveril that satisfaction which the rigour of his keepers was disposed to deny to him as he was conveyed up the steep passage which leads under what is called the wakefield tower a female voice in a tone wherein grief and joy were indescribably mixed exclaimed my sonmy dear son  even those who guarded julian seemed softened by a tone of such acute feeling they slackened their pace they almost paused to permit him to look up towards the casement from which the sounds of maternal agony proceeded but the aperture was so narrow and so closely grated that nothing was visible save a white female hand which grasped one of those rusty barricadoes as if for supporting the person within while another streamed a white handkerchief and then let it fall the casement was instantly deserted  give it me said julian to the officer who lifted the handkerchief it is perhaps a mothers last gift  the old warder lifted the napkin and looked at it with the jealous minuteness of one who is accustomed to detect secret correspondence in the most trifling acts of intercourse  there may be writing on it with invisible ink said one of his comrades  it is wetted but i think it is only with tears answered the senior i cannot keep it from the poor young gentleman  ah master coleby said his comrade in a gentle tone of reproach you would have been wearing a better coat than a yeomans today had it not been for your tender heart  it signifies little said old coleby while my heart is true to my king what i feel in discharging my duty or what coat keeps my old bosom from the cold weather  peveril meanwhile folded in his breast the token of his mothers affection which chance had favoured him with and when placed in the small and solitary chamber which he was told to consider as his own during his residence in the tower he was soothed even to weeping by this trifling circumstance which he could not help considering as an omen that his unfortunate house was not entirely deserted by providence  but the thoughts and occurrences of a prison are too uniform for a narrative and we must now convey our readers into a more bustling scene     chapter xxxvii             henceforth tis donefortune and i are friends            and i must live for buckingham commends                                                        pope  the spacious mansion of the duke of buckingham with the demesne belonging to it originally bore the name of york house and occupied a large portion of the ground adjacent to the savoy  this had been laid out by the munificence of his father the favourite of charles the first in a most splendid manner so as almost to rival whitehall itself but during the increasing rage for building new streets and the creating of almost an additional town in order to connect london and westminster this ground had become of very great value and the second duke of buckingham who was at once fond of scheming and needy of money had agreed to a plan laid before him by some adventurous architect for converting the extensive grounds around his palace into those streets lanes and courts which still perpetuate his name and titles though those who live in buckingham street duke street villiers street or in ofalley for even that connecting particle is locally commemorated probably think seldom of the memory of the witty eccentric and licentious george villiers duke of buckingham whose titles are preserved in the names of their residence and its neighbourhood  this buildingplan the duke had entered upon with all the eagerness which he usually attached to novelty his gardens were destroyedhis pavilions levelledhis splendid stables demolishedthe whole pomp of his suburban demesne laid waste cumbered with ruins and intersected with the foundations of new buildings and cellars and the process of levelling different lines for the intended streets but the undertaking although it proved afterwards both lucrative and successful met with a check at the outset partly from want of the necessary funds partly from the impatient and mercurial temper of the duke which soon carried him off in pursuit of some more new object so that though much was demolished very little in comparison was reared up in the stead and nothing was completed the principal part of the ducal mansion still remained uninjured but the demesne in which it stood bore a strange analogy to the irregular mind of its noble owner here stood a beautiful group of exotic trees and shrubs the remnant of the garden amid yawning commonsewers and heaps of rubbish in one place an old tower threatened to fall upon the spectator and in another he ran the risk of being swallowed up by a modern vault grandeur of conception could be discovered in the undertaking but was almost everywhere marred by poverty or negligence of execution in short the whole place was the true emblem of an understanding and talents run to waste and become more dangerous than advantageous to society by the want of steady principle and the improvidence of the possessor  there were men who took a different view of the dukes purpose in permitting his mansion to be thus surrounded and his demesne occupied by modern buildings which were incomplete and ancient which were but half demolished they alleged that engaged as he was in so many mysteries of love and of politics and having the character of the most daring and dangerous intriguer of his time his grace found it convenient to surround himself with this ruinous arena into which officers of justice could not penetrate without some difficulty and hazard and which might afford upon occasion a safe and secret shelter for such tools as were fit for desperate enterprises and a private and unobserved mode of access to those whom he might have any special reason for receiving in secret  leaving peveril in the tower we must once more convey our readers to the levee of the duke who on the morning of julians transference to that fortress thus addressed his ministerinchief and principal attendant i have been so pleased with your conduct in this matter jerningham that if old nick were to arise in our presence and offer me his best imp as a familiar in thy room i would hold it but a poor compliment  a legion of imps said jerningham bowing could not have been more busy than i in your graces service but if your grace will permit me to say so your whole plan was wellnigh marred by your not returning home till last night or rather this morning  and why i pray you sage master jerningham said his grace should i have returned home an instant sooner than my pleasure and convenience served  nay my lord duke replied the attendant i know not only when you sent us word by empson in chiffinchs apartment to command us to make sure of the girl at any rate and at all risks you said you would be here so soon as you could get freed of the king  freed of the king you rascal what sort of phrase is that demanded the duke  it was empson who used it my lord as coming from your grace  there is much very fit for my grace to say that misbecomes such mouths as empsons or yours to repeat answered the duke haughtily but instantly resumed his tone of familiarity for his humour was as capricious as his pursuits but i know what thou wouldst have first your wisdom would know what became of me since thou hadst my commands at chiffinchs and next your valour would fain sound another flourish of trumpets on thine own most artificial retreat leaving thy comrade in the hands of the philistines  may it please your grace said jerningham i did but retreat for the preservation of the baggage  what do you play at crambo with me said the duke i would have you to know that the common parish fool should be whipt were he to attempt to pass pun or quodlibet as a genuine jest even amongst ticketporters and hackney chairmen  and yet i have heard your grace indulge in the jeu de mots answered the attendant  sirrah jerningham answered the patron discard they memory or keep it under correction else it will hamper thy rise in the world thou mayst perchance have seen me also have a fancy to play at trapball or to kiss a serving wench or to guzzle ale and eat toasted cheese in a porterly whimsy but is it fitting thou shouldst remember such follies no more onthark you how came the long lubberly fool jenkins being a master of the noble science of defence to suffer himself to be run through the body so simply by a rustic swain like this same peveril  please your grace this same corydon is no such novice i saw the onset and except in one hand i never saw a sword managed with such life grace and facility  ay indeed said the duke taking his own sheathed rapier in his hand i could not have thought that i am somewhat rusted and have need of breathing peveril is a name of note as well go to the barnselms or behind montagu house with him as with another his father a rumoured plotter too the public would have noted it in me as becoming a zealous protestant needful i do something to maintain my good name in the city to atone for nonattendance on prayer and preaching but your laertes is fast in the fleet and i suppose his blundering blockhead of an antagonist is dead or dying  recovering my lord on the contrary replied jerningham the blade fortunately avoided his vitals  dn his vitals answered the duke tell him to postpone his recovery or i will put him to death in earnest  i will caution his surgeon said jerningham which will answer equally well  do so and tell him he had better be on his own deathbed as cure his patient till i send him noticethat young fellow must be let loose again at no rate  there is little danger said the attendant i hear some of the witnesses have got their net flung over him on account of some matters down in the north and that he is to be translated to the tower for that and for some letters of the countess of derby as rumour goes  to the tower let him go and get out as he can replied the duke and when you hear he is fast there let the fencing fellow recover as fast as the surgeon and he can mutually settle it  the duke having said this took two or three turns in the apartment and appeared to be in deep thought his attendant waited the issue of his meditations with patience being well aware that such moods during which his mind was strongly directed in one point were never of so long duration with his patron as to prove a severe burden to his own patience  accordingly after the silence of seven or eight minutes the duke broke through it taking from the toilette a large silk purse which seemed full of gold jerningham he said thou art a faithful fellow and it would be sin not to cherish thee i beat the king at mall on his bold defiance the honour is enough for me and thou my boy shalt have the winnings  jerningham pocketed the purse with due acknowledgements  jerningham his grace continued i know you blame me for changing my plans too often and on my soul i have heard you so learned on the subject that i have become of your opinion and have been vexed at myself for two or three hours together for not sticking as constantly to one object as doubtless i shall when age touching his forehead shall make this same weathercock too rusty to turn with the changing breeze but as yet while i have spirit and action let it whirl like the vane at the masthead which teaches the pilot how to steer his course and when i shift mine think i am bound to follow fortune and not to control her  i can understand nothing from all this please your grace replied jerningham save that you have been pleased to change some purposed measures and think that you have profited by doing so  you shall judge yourself replied the duke i have seen the duchess of portsmouthyou start it is true by heaven i have seen her and from sworn enemies we have become sworn friends the treaty between such high and mighty powers had some weighty articles besides i had a french negotiator to deal with so that you will allow a few hours absence was but a necessary interval to make up our matters of diplomacy  your grace astonishes me said jerningham christians plan of supplanting the great lady is then entirely abandoned i thought you had but desired to have the fair successor here in order to carry it on under your own management  i forgot what i meant at the time said the duke unless that i was resolved she should not jilt me as she did the goodnatured man of royalty and so i am still determined since you put me in mind of the fair dowsabelle but i had a contrite note from the duchess while we were at the mall i went to see her and found her a perfect niobeon my soul in spite of red eyes and swelled features and dishevelled hair there are after all jerningham some women who do as the poets say look lovely in affliction out came the cause and with such humility such penitence such throwing herself on my mercy she the proudest devil too in the whole court that i must have had heart of steel to resist it all in short chiffinch in a drunken fit had played the babbler and let young saville into our intrigue saville plays the rogue and informs the duchess by a messenger who luckily came a little late into the market she learned too being a very devil for intelligence that there had been some jarring between the master and me about this new phillis and that i was most likely to catch the birdas any one may see who looks on us both it must have been empson who fluted all this into her graces ear and thinking she saw how her ladyship and i could hunt in couples she entreats me to break christians scheme and keep the wench out of the kings sight especially if she were such a rare piece of perfection as fame has reported her  and your grace has promised her your hand to uphold the influence which you have so often threatened to ruin said jerningham  ay jerningham my turn was as much served when she seemed to own herself in my power and cry me mercyand observe it is all one to me by which ladder i climb into the kings cabinet that of portsmouth is ready fixedbetter ascend by it than fling it down to put up anotheri hate all unnecessary trouble  and christian said jerningham  may go to the devil for a selfconceited ass one pleasure of this twist of intrigue is to revenge me of that villain who thought himself so essential that by heaven he forced himself on my privacy and lectured me like a schoolboy hang the coldblooded hypocritical vermin if he mutters i will have his nose slit as wide as coventryshark ye is the colonel come  i expect him every moment your grace   the illusage of sir john coventry by some of the life guardsmen     in revenge of something said in parliament concerning the kings     theatrical amours gave rise to what was called coventrys act     against cutting and maiming the person  send him up when he arrives said the dukewhy do you stand looking at me what would you have  your graces direction respecting the young lady said jerningham  odd zooks said the duke i had totally forgotten heris she very tearfulexceedingly afflicted  she does not take on so violently as i have seen some do said jerningham but for a strong firm concentrated indignation i have seen none to match her  well we will permit her to cool i will not face the affliction of a second fair one immediately i am tired of snivelling and swelled eyes and blubbered cheeks for some time and moreover must husband my powers of consolation begone and send the colonel  will your grace permit me one other question demanded his confidant  ask what thou wilt jerningham and then begone  your grace has determined to give up christian said the attendant may i ask what becomes of the kingdom of man  forgotten as i have a christian soul said the duke as much forgotten as if i had never nourished that scheme of royal ambitiondn it we must knit up the ravelled skein of that intrigueyet it is but a miserable rock not worth the trouble i have been bestowing on it and for a kingdomit has a sound indeed but in reality i might as well stick a cockchickens feather into my hat and call it a plume besides now i think upon it it would scarce be honourable to sweep that petty royalty out of derbys possession i won a thousand pieces of the young earl when he was last here and suffered him to hang about me at court i question if the whole revenue of his kingdom is worth twice as much easily i could win it of him were he here with less trouble than it would cost me to carry on these troublesome intrigues of christians  if i may be permitted to say so please your grace answered jerningham although your grace is perhaps somewhat liable to change your mind no man in england can afford better reasons for doing so  i think so myself jerningham said the duke and it may be it is one reason for my changing one likes to vindicate his own conduct and to find out fine reasons for doing what one has a mind toand now once again begone or hark yehark yei shall need some loose gold you may leave the purse i gave you and i will give you an order for as much and two years interest on old jacob doublefee  as your grace pleases said jerningham his whole stock of complaisance scarcely able to conceal his mortification at exchanging for a distant order of a kind which of late had not been very regularly honoured the sunny contents of the purse which had actually been in his pocket secretly but solemnly did he make a vow that two years interest alone should not be the compensation for this involuntary exchange in the form of his remuneration  as the discontented dependant left the apartment he met at the head of the grand staircase christian himself who exercising the freedom of an ancient friend of the house was making his way unannounced to the dukes dressing apartment jerningham conjecturing that his visit at this crisis would be anything but well timed or well taken endeavoured to avert his purpose by asserting that the duke was indisposed and in his bedchamber and this he said so loud that his master might hear him and if he pleased realise the apology which he offered in his name by retreating into the bedroom as his last sanctuary and drawing the bolt against intrusion  but far from adopting a stratagem to which he had had recourse on former occasions in order to avoid those who came upon him though at an appointed hour and upon business of importance buckingham called in a loud voice from his dressing apartment commanding his chamberlain instantly to introduce his good friend master christian and censuring him for hesitating for an instant to do so  now thought jerningham within himself if christian knew the duke as well as i do he would sooner stand the leap of a lion like the london prentice bold than venture on my master at this moment who is even now in a humour nearly as dangerous as the animal  he then ushered christian into his masters presence taking care to post himself within earshot of the door     chapter xxxviii          speak not of niceness when theres chance of wreck         the captain said as ladies writhed their neck         to see the dying dolphin flap the deck         if we go down on us these gentry sup         we dine upon them if we haul them up         wise men applaud us when we eat the eaters         as the devil laughs when keen folks cheat the cheaters                                                    the sea voyage  there was nothing in dukes manner towards christian which could have conveyed to that latter personage experienced as he was in the worst possible ways of the world that buckingham would at that particular moment rather have seen the devil than himself unless it was that buckinghams reception of him being rather extraordinarily courteous towards so old an acquaintance might have excited some degree of suspicion  having escaped with some difficulty from the vague region of general compliments which bears the same relation to that of business that milton informs us the limbo patrum has to the sensible and material earth christian asked his grace of buckingham with the same blunt plainness with which he usually veiled a very deep and artificial character whether he had lately seen chiffinch or his helpmate  neither of them lately answered buckingham have not you waited on them yourselfi thought you would have been more anxious about the great scheme  i have called once and again said christian but i can gain no access to the sight of that important couple i begin to be afraid they are paltering with me  which by the welkin and its stars you would not be slow in avenging master christian i know your puritanical principles on that point well said the duke revenge may be well said to be sweet when so many grave and wise men are ready to exchange for it all the sugarplums which pleasures offer to the poor sinful people of the world besides the reversion of those which they talk of expecting in the way of post obit  you may jest my lord said christian but still  but still you will be revenged on chiffinch and his little commodious companion and yet the task may be difficultchiffinch has so many ways of obliging his masterhis little woman is such a convenient pretty sort of a screen and has such winning little ways of her own that in faith in your case i would not meddle with them what is this refusing their door man we all do it to our best friends now and then as well as to duns and dull company  if your grace is in a humour of rambling thus wildly in your talk said christian you know my old faculty of patiencei can wait till it be your pleasure to talk more seriously  seriously said his gracewherefore noti only wait to know what your serious business may be  in a word my lord from chiffinchs refusal to see me and some vain calls which i have made at your graces mansion i am afraid either that our plan has miscarried or that there is some intention to exclude me from the farther conduct of the matter christian pronounced these words with considerable emphasis  that were folly as well as treachery returned the duke to exclude from the spoil the very engineer who conducted the attack but hark ye christiani am sorry to tell bad news without preparation but as you insist on knowing the worst and are not ashamed to suspect your best friends out it must comeyour niece left chiffinchs house the morning before yesterday  christian staggered as if he had received a severe blow and the blood ran to his face in such a current of passion that the duke concluded he was struck with an apoplexy but exerting the extraordinary command which he could maintain under the most trying circumstances he said with a voice the composure of which had an unnatural contrast with the alteration of his countenance am i to conclude that in leaving the protection of the roof in which i placed her the girl has found shelter under that of your grace  sir replied buckingham gravely the supposition does my gallantry more credit than it deserves  oh my lord duke answered christian i am not one whom you can impose on by this species of courtly jargon i know of what your grace is capable and that to gratify the caprice of a moment you would not hesitate to disappoint even the schemes at which you yourself have laboured most busilysuppose this jest played off take your laugh at those simple precautions by which i intended to protect your graces interest as well as that of others let us know the extent of your frolic and consider how far its consequences can be repaired  on my word christian said the duke laughing you are the most obliging of uncles and of guardians let your niece pass through as many adventures as boccaccios bride of the king of garba you care not pure or soiled she will still make the footstool of your fortune  an indian proverb says that the dart of contempt will even pierce through the shell of the tortoise but this is more peculiarly the case when conscience tells the subject of the sarcasm that it is justly merited christian stung with buckinghams reproach at once assumed a haughty and threatening mien totally inconsistent with that in which sufferance seemed to be as much his badge as that of shylock you are a foulmouthed and most unworthy lord he said and as such i will proclaim you unless you make reparation for the injury you have done me  and what said the duke of buckingham shall i proclaim you that can give you the least title to notice from such as i am what name shall i bestow on the little transaction which has given rise to such unexpected misunderstanding  christian was silent either from rage or from mental conviction  come come christian said the duke smiling we know too much of each other to make a quarrel safe hate each other we maycircumvent each otherit is the way of courtsbut proclaima fico for the phrase  i used it not said christian till your grace drove me to extremity you know my lord i have fought both at home and abroad and you should not rashly think that i will endure any indignity which blood can wipe away  on the contrary said the duke with the same civil and sneering manner i can confidently assert that the life of half a score of your friends would seem very light to you christian if their existence interfered i do not say with your character as being a thing of much less consequence but with any advantage which their existence might intercept fie upon it man we have known each other long i never thought you a coward and am only glad to see i could strike a few sparkles of heat out of your cold and constant disposition i will now if you please tell you at once the fate of the young lady in which i pray you to believe that i am truly interested  i hear you my lord duke said christian the curl of your upper lip and your eyebrow does not escape me your grace knows the french proverb he laughs best who laughs last but i hear you  thank heaven you do said buckingham for your case requires haste i promise you and involves no laughing matter well then hear a simple truth on which if it became me to offer any pledge for what i assert to be such i could pledge life fortune and honour it was the morning before last when meeting with the king at chiffinchs unexpectedlyin fact i had looked in to fool an hour away and to learn how your scheme advancedi saw a singular scene your niece terrified little chiffinchthe hen chiffinch i meanbid the king defiance to his teeth and walked out of the presence triumphantly under the guardianship of a young fellow of little mark or likelihood excepting a tolerable personal presence and the advantage of a most unconquerable impudence egad i can hardly help laughing to think how the king and i were both baffled for i will not deny that i had tried to trifle for a moment with the fair indamora but egad the young fellow swooped her off from under our noses like my own drawcansir clearing off the banquet from the two kings of brentford there was a dignity in the gallants swaggering retreat which i must try to teach mohun it will suit his part admirably        then a noted actor  this is incomprehensible my lord duke said christian who by this time had recovered all his usual coolness you cannot expect me to believe this who dared be so bold as to carry of my niece in such a manner and from so august a presence and with whom a stranger as he must have been would she wise and cautious as i know her have consented to depart in such a mannermy lord i cannot believe this  one of your priests my most devoted christian replied the duke would only answer die infidel in thine unbelief but i am only a poor worldling sinner and i will add what mite of information i can the young fellows name as i am given to understand is julian son of sir geoffrey whom men call peveril of the peak  peveril of the devil who hath his cavern there said christian warmly for i know that gallant and believe him capable of anything bold and desperate but how could he intrude himself into the royal presence either hell aids him or heaven looks nearer into mortal dealings than i have yet believed if so may god forgive us who deemed he thought not on us at all  amen most christian christian replied the duke i am glad to see thou hast yet some touch of grace that leads thee to augur so but empson the hen chiffinch and halfadozen more saw the swains entrance and departure please examine these witnesses with your own wisdom if you think your time may not be better employed in tracing the fugitives i believe he gained entrance as one of some dancing or masking party rowley you know is accessible to all who will come forth to make him sport so in stole this termagant tearing gallant like samson among the philistines to pull down our fine scheme about our ears  i believe you my lord said christian i cannot but believe you and i forgive you since it is your nature for making sport of what is ruin and destruction but which way did they take  to derbyshire i should presume to seek her father said the duke she spoke of going into paternal protection instead of yours master christian something had chanced at chiffinchs to give her cause to suspect that you had not altogether provided for his daughter in the manner which her father was likely to approve of  now heaven be praised said christian she knows not her father is come to london and they must be gone down either to martindale castle or to moultrassie hall in either case they are in my poweri must follow them close i will return instantly to derbyshirei am undone if she meet her father until these errors are amended adieu my lord i forgive the part which i fear your grace must have had in baulking our enterpriseit is no time for mutual reproaches  you speak truth master christian said the duke and i wish you all success can i help you with men or horses or money  i thank your grace said christian and hastily left the apartment  the duke watched his descending footsteps on the staircase until they could be heard no longer and then exclaimed to jerningham who entered victoria victoria magna est veritas et prævalebithad i told the villain a word of a lie he is so familiar with all the regions of falsehoodhis whole life has been such an absolute imposture that i had stood detected in an instant but i told him truth and that was the only means of deceiving him victoria my dear jerningham i am prouder of cheating christian than i should have been of circumventing a minister of state  your grace holds his wisdom very high said the attendant  his cunning at least i do which in court affairs often takes the weathergage of wisdomas in yarmouth roads a herringbuss will baffle a frigate he shall not return to london if i can help it until all these intrigues are over  as his grace spoke the colonel after whom he had repeatedly made inquiry was announced by a gentleman of his household he met not christian did he said the duke hastily  no my lord returned the domestic the colonel came by the old garden staircase  i judged as much replied the duke tis an owl that will not take wing in daylight when there is a thicket left to skulk under here he comes from threading lane vault and ruinous alley very near ominous a creature as the fowl of ill augury which he resembles  the colonel to whom no other appellation seemed to be given than that which belonged to his military station now entered the apartment he was tall strongly built and past the middle period of life and his countenance but for the heavy cloud which dwelt upon it might have been pronounced a handsome one while the duke spoke to him either from humility or some other cause his large serious eye was cast down upon the ground but he raised it when he answered with a keen look of earnest observation his dress was very plain and more allied to that of the puritans than of the cavaliers of the time a shadowy black hat like the spanish sombrero a large black mantle or cloak and a long rapier gave him something the air of a castilione to which his gravity and stiffness of demeanour added considerable strength  well colonel said the duke we have been long strangershow have matters gone with you  as with other men of action in quiet times answered the colonel or as a good warcaper that lies high and dry in a muddy creek till seams and planks are rent and riven        a privateer  well colonel said the duke i have used your valour before now and i may again so that i shall speedily see that the vessel is careened and undergoes a thorough repair  i conjecture then said the colonel that your grace has some voyage in hand  no but there is one which i want to interrupt replied the duke  tis but another stave of the same tunewell my lord i listen answered the stranger  nay said the duke it is but a trifling matter after allyou know ned christian  ay surely my lord replied the colonel we have been long known to each other  he is about to go down to derbyshire to seek a certain niece of his whom he will scarcely find there now i trust to your tried friendship to interrupt his return to london go with him or meet him cajole him or assail him or do what thou wilt with himonly keep him from london for a fortnight at least and then i care little how soon he comes  for by that time i suppose replied the colonel any one may find the wench that thinks her worth the looking for  thou mayst think her worth the looking for thyself colonel rejoined the duke i promise you she hath many a thousand stitched to her petticoat such a wife would save thee from skeldering on the public  my lord i sell my blood and my sword but not my honour answered the man sullenly if i marry my bed may be a poor but it shall be an honest one  then thy wife will be the only honest matter in thy possession colonelat least since i have known you replied the duke  why truly your grace may speak your pleasure on that point it is chiefly your business which i have done of late and if it were less strictly honest than i could have wished the employer was to blame as well as the agent but for marrying a castoff mistress the man saving your grace to whom i am bound lives not who dares propose it to me  the duke laughed loudly why this is mine ancient pistols vein he replied    shall i sir pandarus of troy become   and by my side wear steelthen lucifer take all  my breeding is too plain to understand ends of playhouse verse my lord said the colonel suddenly has your grace no other service to command me  noneonly i am told you have published a narrative concerning the plot  what should ail me my lord said the colonel i hope i am a witness as competent as any that has yet appeared  truly i think so to the full said the duke and it would have been hard when so much profitable mischief was going if so excellent a protestant as yourself had not come in for a share  i came to take your graces commands not to be the object of your wit said the colonel  gallantly spoken most resolute and most immaculate colonel as you are to be on full pay in my service for a month to come i pray your acceptance of this purse for contingents and equipments and you shall have my instructions from time to time  they shall be punctually obeyed my lord said the colonel i know the duty of a subaltern officer i wish your grace a good morning  so saying he pocketed the purse without either affecting hesitation or expressing gratitude but merely as a part of a transaction in the regular way of business and stalked from the apartment with the same sullen gravity which marked his entrance now there goes a scoundrel after my own heart said the duke a robber from his cradle a murderer since he could hold a knife a profound hypocrite in religion and a worse and deeper hypocrite in honourwould sell his soul to the devil to accomplish any villainy and would cut the throat of his brother did he dare to give the villainy he had so acted its right namenow why stand you amazed good master jerningham and look on me as you would on some monster of ind when you had paid your shilling to see it and were staring out your pennyworth with your eyes as round as a pair of spectacles wink man and save them and then let thy tongue untie the mystery  on my word my lord duke answered jerningham since i am compelled to speak i can only say that the longer i live with your grace i am the more at a loss to fathom your motives of action others lay plans either to attain profit or pleasure by their execution but your graces delight is to counteract your own schemes when in the very act of performance like a childforgive methat breaks its favourite toy or a man who should set fire to the house he has half built  and why not if he wanted to warm his hands at the blaze said the duke  ay my lord replied his dependent but what if in doing so he should burn his fingersmy lord it is one of your noblest qualities that you will sometimes listen to the truth without taking offence but were it otherwise i could not at this moment help speaking out at every risk  well say on i can bear it said the duke throwing himself into an easychair and using his toothpick with graceful indifference and equanimity i love to hear what such potsherds as thou art think of the proceeding of us who are of the pure porcelain clay of the earth  in the name of heaven my lord let me then ask you said jerningham what merit you claim or what advantage you expect from having embroiled everything in which you are concerned to a degree which equals the chaos of the blind old roundheads poem which your grace is so fond of to begin with the king in spite of goodhumour he will be incensed at your repeated rivalry  his majesty defied me to it  you have lost all hopes of the isle by quarrelling with christian  i have ceased to care a farthing about it replied the duke  in christian himself whom you have insulted and to whose family you intend dishonour you have lost a sagacious artful and coolheaded instrument and adherent said the monitor  poor jerningham answered the duke christian would say as much for thee i doubt not wert thou discarded tomorrow it is the common error of such tools as you and he to think themselves indispensable as to his family what was never honourable cannot be dishonoured by any connection with my house  i say nothing of chiffinch said jerningham offended as he will be when he learns why and by whom his scheme has been ruined and the lady spirited awayhe and his wife i say nothing of them  you need not said the duke for were they even fit persons to speak to me about the duchess of portsmouth has bargained for their disgrace  then this bloodhound of a colonel as he calls himself your grace cannot even lay him on a quest which is to do you service but you must do him such indignity at the same time as he will not fail to remember and be sure to fly at your throat should he ever have an opportunity of turning on you  i will take care he has none said the duke and yours jerningham is a lowlived apprehension beat your spaniel heartily if you would have him under command ever let your agents see you know what they are and prize them accordingly a rogue who must needs be treated as a man of honour is apt to get above his work enough therefore of your advice and censure jerningham we differ in every particular were we both engineers you would spend your life in watching some old womans wheel which spins flax by the ounce i must be in the midst of the most varied and counteracting machinery regulating checks and counterchecks balancing weights proving springs and wheels directing and controlling a hundred combined powers  and your fortune in the meanwhile said jerningham pardon this last hint my lord  my fortune said the duke is too vast to be hurt by a petty wound and i have as thou knowest a thousand salves in store for the scratches and scars which it sometimes receives in greasing my machinery  your grace does not mean dr wilderheads powder of projection  pshaw he is a quacksalver and mountebank and beggar  or solicitor drowndlands plan for draining the fens  he is a cheatvidelicet an attorney  or the laird of lackpelfs sale of highland woods  he is a scotsman said the dukevidelicet both cheat and beggar  these streets here upon the site of your noble mansionhouse said jerningham  the architects a bite and the plans a bubble i am sick of the sight of this rubbish and i will soon replace our old alcoves alleys and flowerpots by an italian garden and a new palace  that my lord would be to waste not to improve your fortune said his domestic  clodpate and muddy spirit that thou art thou hast forgot the most hopeful scheme of allthe south sea fisheriestheir stock is up 50 per cent already post down to the alley and tell old mansses to buy £20000 for meforgive me plutus i forgot to lay my sacrifice on thy shrine and yet expected thy favoursfly posthaste jerninghamfor thy life for thy life for thy life   stockjobbing as it is called that is dealing in shares of     monopolies patent and jointstock companies of every     description was at least as common in charles iis time as our     own and as the exercise of ingenuity in this way promised a road     to wealth without the necessity of industry it was then much     pursued by dissolute courtiers  with hands and eyes uplifted jerningham left the apartment and the duke without thinking a moment farther on old or new intrigueson the friendship he had formed or the enmity he had provokedon the beauty whom he had carried off from her natural protectors as well as from her loveror on the monarch against whom he had placed himself in rivalshipsat down to calculate chances with all the zeal of demoivre tired of the drudgery in halfanhour and refused to see the zealous agent whom he had employed in the city because he was busily engaged in writing a new lampoon     chapter xxxix                  ah changeful head and fickle heart                                        progress of discontent  no event is more ordinary in narratives of this nature than the abduction of the female on whose fate the interest is supposed to turn but that of alice bridgenorth was thus far particular that she was spirited away by the duke of buckingham more in contradiction than in the rivalry of passion and that as he made his first addresses to her at chiffinchs rather in the spirit of rivalry to this sovereign than from any strong impression which her beauty had made on his affections so he had formed the sudden plan of spiriting her away by means of his dependents rather to perplex christian the king chiffinch and all concerned than because he had any particular desire for her society at his own mansion indeed so far was this from being the case that his grace was rather surprised than delighted with the success of the enterprise which had made her an inmate there although it is probable he might have thrown himself into an uncontrollable passion had he learned its miscarriage instead of its success  twentyfour hours had passed over since he had returned to his own roof before notwithstanding sundry hints from jerningham he could even determine on the exertion necessary to pay his fair captive a visit and then it was with the internal reluctance of one who can only be stirred from indolence by novelty  i wonder what made me plague myself about this wench said he and doom myself to encounter all the hysterical rhapsodies of a country phillis with her head stuffed with her grandmothers lessons about virtue and the biblebook when the finest and bestbred women in town may be had upon more easy terms it is a pity one cannot mount the victors car of triumph without having a victory to boast of yet faith it is what most of our modern gallants do though it would not become buckinghamwell i must see her he concluded though it were but to rid the house of her the portsmouth will not hear of her being set at liberty near charles so much is she afraid of a new fair seducing the old sinner from his allegiance so how the girl is to be disposed offor i shall have little fancy to keep her here and she is too wealthy to be sent down to cliefden as a housekeeperis a matter to be thought on  he then called for such a dress as might set off his natural good miena compliment which he considered as due to his own merit for as to anything farther he went to pay his respects to his fair prisoner with almost as little zeal in the cause as a gallant to fight a duel in which he has no warmer interest than the maintenance of his reputation as man of honour  the set of apartments consecrated to the use of those favourites who occasionally made buckinghams mansion their place of abode and who were so far as liberty was concerned often required to observe the regulations of a convent were separated from the rest of the dukes extensive mansion he lived in the age when what was called gallantry warranted the most atrocious actions of deceit and violence as may be best illustrated by the catastrophe of an unfortunate actress whose beauty attracted the attention of the last de vere earl of oxford while her virtue defied his seductions he ruined her under colour of a mock marriage and was rewarded for a success which occasioned the death of his victim by the general applause of the men of wit and gallantry who filled the drawingroom of charles  buckingham had made provision in the interior of his ducal mansion for exploits of a similar nature and the set of apartments which he now visited were alternately used to confine the reluctant and to accommodate the willing  being now destined for the former purpose the key was delivered to the duke by a hooded and spectacled old lady who sat reading a devout book in the outer hall which divided these apartments usually called the nunnery from the rest of the house this experienced dowager acted as mistress of the ceremonies on such occasions and was the trusty depositary of more intrigues than were known to any dozen of her worshipful calling besides  as sweet a linnet she said as she undid the outward door as ever sung in a cage  i was afraid she might have been more for moping than for singing dowlas said the duke  till yesterday she was so please your grace answered dowlas or to speak sooth till early this morning we heard of nothing but lachrymæ but the air of your noble graces house is favourable to singingbirds and today matters have been amuch mended  tis sudden dame said the duke and tis something strange considering that i have never visited her that the pretty trembler should have been so soon reconciled to her fate  ah your grace has such magic that it communicates itself to your very walls as wholesome scripture says exodus first and seventh it cleaveth to the walls and the doorposts  you are too partial dame dowlas said the duke of buckingham  not a word but truth said the dame and i wish i may be an outcast from the fold of the lambs but i think this damsels very frame has changed since she was under your graces roof methinks she hath a lighter form a finer step a more displayed anklei cannot tell but i think there is a change but lackaday your grace knows i am as old as i am trusty and that my eyes wax something uncertain  especially when you wash them with a cup of canary dame dowlas answered the duke who was aware that temperance was not amongst the cardinal virtues which were most familiar to the old ladys practice  was it canary your grace saidwas it indeed with canary that your grace should have supposed me to have washed my eyes said the offended matron i am sorry that your grace should know me no better  i crave your pardon dame said the duke shaking aside fastidiously the grasp which in the earnestness of her exculpation madam dowlas had clutched upon his sleeve i crave your pardon your nearer approach has convinced me of my erroneous imputationi should have said nantznot canary  so saying he walked forward into the inner apartments which were fitted up with an air of voluptuous magnificence  the dame said true however said the proud deviser and proprietor of the splendid mansiona country phillis might well reconcile herself to such a prison as this even without a skilful birdfancier to touch a birdcall but i wonder where she can be this rural phidele is it possible she can have retreated like a despairing commandant into her bedchamber the very citadel of the place without even an attempt to defend the outworks  as he made this reflection he passed through an antechamber and little eating parlour exquisitely furnished and hung with excellent paintings of the venetian school  beyond these lay a withdrawingroom fitted up in a style of still more studied elegance the windows were darkened with painted glass of such a deep and rich colour as made the midday beams which found their way into the apartment imitate the rich colours of sunset and in the celebrated expression of the poet taught light to counterfeit a gloom  buckinghams feelings and taste had been too much and too often and too readily gratified to permit him in the general case to be easily accessible even to those pleasures which it had been the business of his life to pursue the hackneyed voluptuary is like the jaded epicure the mere listlessness of whose appetite becomes at length a sufficient penalty for having made it the principal object of his enjoyment and cultivation yet novelty has always some charms and uncertainty has more  the doubt how he was to be receivedthe change of mood which his prisoner was said to have evincedthe curiosity to know how such a creature as alice bridgenorth had been described was likely to bear herself under the circumstances in which she was so unexpectedly placed had upon buckingham the effect of exciting unusual interest on his own part he had none of those feelings of anxiety with which a man even of the most vulgar mind comes to the presence of the female whom he wishes to please far less the more refined sentiments of love respect desire and awe with which the more refined lover approaches the beloved object he had been to use an expressive french phrase too completely blasé even from his earliest youth to permit him now to experience the animal eagerness of the one far less the more sentimental pleasure of the other it is no small aggravation of this jaded and uncomfortable state of mind that the voluptuary cannot renounce the pursuits with which he is satiated but must continue for his characters sake or from the mere force of habit to take all the toil fatigue and danger of the chase while he has so little real interest in the termination  buckingham therefore felt it due to his reputation as a successful hero of intrigue to pay his addresses to alice bridgenorth with dissembled eagerness and as he opened the door of the inner apartment he paused to consider whether the tone of gallantry or that of passion was fittest to use on the occasion this delay enabled him to hear a few notes of a lute touched with exquisite skill and accompanied by the still sweeter strains of a female voice which without executing any complete melody seemed to sport itself in rivalship of the silver sound of the instrument  a creature so well educated said the duke with the sense she is said to possess would rustic as she is laugh at the assumed rants of oroondates it is the vein of dorimontonce buckingham thine ownthat must here do the feat besides that the part is easier  so thinking he entered the room with that easy grace which characterised the gay courtiers among whom he flourished and approached the fair tenant whom he found seated near a table covered with books and music and having on her left hand the large halfopen casement dim with stained glass admitting only a doubtful light into this lordly retiringroom which hung with the richest tapestry of the gobelines and ornamented with piles if china and splendid mirrors seemed like a bower built for a prince to receive his bride  the splendid dress of the inmate corresponded with the taste of the apartment which she occupied and partook of the oriental costume which the muchadmired roxalana had the brought into fashion a slender foot and ankle which escaped from the wide trowser of richly ornamented and embroidered blue satin was the only part of her person distinctly seen the rest was enveloped from head to foot in a long veil of silver gauze which like a feathery and light mist on a beautiful landscape suffered you to perceive that what it concealed was rarely lovely yet induced the imagination even to enhance the charms it shaded such part of the dress as could be discovered was like the veil and the trowsers in the oriental taste a rich turban and splendid caftan were rather indicated than distinguished through the folds of the former the whole attire argued at least coquetry on the part of the fair one who must have expected from her situation a visitor of some pretension and induced buckingham to smile internally at christians account of the extreme simplicity and purity of his niece  he approached the lady en cavalier and addressed her with the air of being conscious while he acknowledged his offences that his condescending to do so formed a sufficient apology for them fair mistress alice he said i am sensible how deeply i ought to sue for pardon for the mistaken zeal of my servants who seeing you deserted and exposed without protection during an unlucky affray took it upon them to bring you under the roof of one who would expose his life rather than suffer you to sustain a moments anxiety was it my fault that those around me should have judged it necessary to interfere for your preservation or that aware of the interest i must take in you they have detained you till i could myself in personal attendance receive your commands  that attendance has not been speedily rendered my lord answered the lady i have been a prisoner for two daysneglected and left to the charge of menials  how say you ladyneglected exclaimed the duke by heaven if the best in my household has failed in his duty i will discard him on the instant  i complain of no lack of courtesy from your servants my lord she replied but methinks it had been but complaisant in the duke himself to explain to me earlier wherefore he has had the boldness to detain me as a state prisoner  and can the divine alice doubt said buckingham that had time and space those cruel enemies to the flight of passion given permission the instant in which you crossed your vassals threshold had seen its devoted master at your feet who hath thought since he saw you of nothing but the charms which that fatal morning placed before him at chiffinchs  i understand then my lord said the lady that you have been absent and have had no part in the restraint which has been exercised upon me  absent on the kings command lady and employed in the discharge of his duty answered buckingham without hesitation what could i dothe moment you left chiffinchs his majesty commanded me to the saddle in such haste that i had no time to change my satin buskins for ridingboots if my absence has occasioned you a moment of inconvenience blame the inconsiderate zeal of those who seeing me depart from london half distracted at my separation from you were willing to contribute their unmannered though wellmeant exertions to preserve their master from despair by retaining the fair alice within his reach to whom indeed could they have restored you he whom you selected as your champion is in prison or fledyour father absent from townyour uncle in the north to chiffinchs house you had expressed your wellfounded aversion and what fitter asylum remained than that of your devoted slave where you must ever reign a queen   this case is not without precedent among the jealousies and fears     expressed by the long parliament they insisted much upon an agent     for the king departing for the continent so abruptly that he had     not time to change his court dresswhite buskins to wit and     black silk pantaloonsfor an equipment more suitable to travel     with  an imprisoned one said the lady i desire not royalty  alas how wilfully you misconstrue me said the duke kneeling on one knee and what right can you have to complain of a few hours gentle restraintyou who destine so many to hopeless captivity be merciful for once and withdraw that envious veil for the divinities are ever most cruel when they deliver their oracles from such clouded recesses suffer at least my rash hand  i will save your grace that unworthy trouble said the lady haughtily and rising up she flung back over her shoulders the veil which shrouded her saying at the same time look on me my lord duke and see if these be indeed the charms which have made on your grace an impression so powerful  buckingham did look and the effect produced on him by surprise was so strong that he rose hastily from his knee and remained for a few seconds as if he had been petrified the figure that stood before him had neither the height nor the rich shape of alice bridgenorth and though perfectly well made was so slightly formed as to seem almost infantine her dress was three or four short vests of embroidered satin disposed one over the other of different colours or rather different shades of similar colours for strong contrast was carefully avoided these opened in front so as to show part of the throat and neck partially obscured by an inner covering of the finest lace over the uppermost vest was worn a sort of mantle or coat of rich fur a small but magnificent turban was carelessly placed on her head from under which flowed a profusion of coalblack tresses which cleopatra might have envied the taste and splendour of the eastern dress corresponded with the complexion of the ladys face which was brunette of a shade so dark as might almost have served an indian  amidst a set of features in which rapid and keen expression made amends for the want of regular beauty the essential points of eyes as bright as diamonds and teeth as white as pearls did not escape the duke of buckingham a professed connoisseur in female charms in a word the fanciful and singular female who thus unexpectedly produced herself before him had one of those faces which are never seen without making an impression which when removed are long after remembered and for which in our idleness we are tempted to invent a hundred histories that we may please our fancy by supposing the features under the influence of different kinds of emotion every one must have in recollection countenances of this kind which from a captivating and stimulating originality of expression abide longer in the memory and are more seductive to the imagination than ever regular beauty  my lord duke said the lady it seems the lifting of my veil has done the work of magic upon your grace alas for the captive princess whose nod was to command a vassal so costly as your grace she runs methinks no slight chance of being turned out of doors like a second cinderella to seek her fortune among lackeys and lightermen  i am astonished said the duke that villain jerninghami will have the scoundrels blood  nay never abuse jerningham for the matter said the unknown but lament your own unhappy engagements while you my lord duke were posting northward in white satin buskins to toil in the kings affairs the right and lawful princess sat weeping in sables in the uncheered solitude to which your absence condemned her two days she was disconsolate in vain on the third came an african enchantress to change the scene for her and the person for your grace methinks my lord this adventure will tell but ill when some faithful squire shall recount or record the gallant adventures of the second duke of buckingham  fairly bit and bantered to boot said the dukethe monkey has a turn for satire too by all that is piquantehark ye fair princess how dared you adventure on such a trick as you have been accomplice to  dare my lord answered the stranger put the question to others not to one who fears nothing  by my faith i believe so for thy front is bronzed by naturehark ye once more mistresswhat is your name and condition  my condition i have told youi am a mauritanian sorceress by profession and my name is zarah replied the eastern maiden  but methinks that face shape and eyessaid the dukewhen didst thou pass for a dancing fairysome such imp thou wert not many days since  my sister you may have seenmy twin sister but not me my lord answered zarah  indeed said the duke that duplicate of thine if it was not thy very self was possessed with a dumb spirit as thou with a talking one i am still in the mind that you are the same and that satan always so powerful with your sex had art enough on our former meeting to make thee hold thy tongue  believe what you will of it my lord replied zarah it cannot change the truthand now my lord i bid you farewell have you any commands to mauritania  tarry a little my princess said the duke and remember that you have voluntarily entered yourself as pledge for another and are justly subjected to any penalty which it is my pleasure to exact none must brave buckingham with impunity  i am in no hurry to depart if your grace hath any commands for me  what are you neither afraid of my resentment nor of my love fair zarah said the duke  of neither by this glove answered the lady your resentment must be a pretty passion indeed if it could stoop to such a helpless object as i am and for your lovegood lack good lack  and why good lack with such a tone of contempt lady said the duke piqued in spite of himself think you buckingham cannot love or has never been beloved in return  he may have thought himself beloved said the maiden but by what slight creaturesthings whose heads could be rendered giddy by a playhouse rantwhose brains were only filled with redheeled shoes and satin buskinsand who run altogether mad on the argument of a george and a star  and are there no such frail fair ones in your climate most scornful princess said the duke  there are said the lady but men rate them as parrots and monkeysthings without either sense or soul head or heart the nearness we bear to the sun has purified while it strengthens our passions the icicles of your frozen climate shall as soon hammer hot bars into ploughshares as shall the foppery and folly of your pretended gallantry make an instants impression on a breast like mine  you speak like one who knows what passion is said the duke sit down fair lady and grieve not that i detain you who can consent to part with a tongue of so much melody or an eye of such expressive eloquenceyou have known then what it is to love  i knowno matter if by experience or through the report of othersbut i do know that to love as i would love would be to yield not an iota to avarice not one inch to vanity not to sacrifice the slightest feeling to interest or to ambition but to give up all to fidelity of heart and reciprocal affection  and how many women think you are capable of feeling such disinterested passion  more by thousands than there are men who merit it answered zarah alas how often do you see the female pale and wretched and degraded still following with patient constancy the footsteps of some predominating tyrant and submitting to all his injustice with the endurance of a faithful and misused spaniel which prizes a look from his master though the surliest groom that ever disgraced humanity more than all the pleasure which the world besides can furnish him think what such would be to one who merited and repaid her devotion  perhaps the very reverse said the duke and for your simile i can see little resemblance i cannot charge my spaniel with any perfidy but for my mistressesto confess truth i must always be in a cursed hurry if i would have the credit of changing them before they leave me  and they serve you but rightly my lord answered the lady for what are younay frown not for you must hear the truth for once nature has done its part and made a fair outside and courtly education hath added its share you are noble it is the accident of birthhandsome it is the caprice of naturegenerous because to give is more easy than to refusewellapparelled it is to the credit of your tailorwellnatured in the main because you have youth and healthbrave because to be otherwise were to be degradedand witty because you cannot help it  the duke darted a glance on one of the large mirrors noble and handsome and courtlike generous wellattired goodhumoured brave and wittyyou allow me more madam than i have the slightest pretension to and surely enough to make my way at some point at least to female favour  i have neither allowed you a heart nor a head said zarah calmlynay never redden as if you would fly at me i say not but nature may have given you both but folly has confounded the one and selfishness perverted the other the man whom i call deserving the name is one whose thoughts and exertions are for others rather than himselfwhose high purpose is adopted on just principles and never abandoned while heaven or earth affords means of accomplishing it he is one who will neither seek an indirect advantage by a specious road nor take an evil path to gain a real good purpose such a man were one for whom a womans heart should beat constant while he breathes and break when he dies  she spoke with so much energy that the water sparkled in her eyes and her cheek coloured with the vehemence of her feelings  you speak said the duke as if you had yourself a heart which could pay the full tribute to the merit which you describe so warmly  and have i not said she laying her hand on her bosom here beats one that would bear me out in what i have said whether in life or in death  were it in my power said the duke who began to get farther interested in his visitor than he could at first have thought possiblewere it in my power to deserve such faithful attachment methinks it should be my care to requite it  your wealth your titles your reputation as a gallantall you possess were too little to merit such sincere affection  come fair lady said the duke a good deal piqued do not be quite so disdainful bethink you that if your love be as pure as coined gold still a poor fellow like myself may offer you an equivalent in silverthe quantity of my affection must make up for its quality  but i am not carrying my affection to market my lord and therefore i need none of the base coin you offer in change for it  how do i know that my fairest said the duke this is the realm of paphosyou have invaded it with what purpose you best know but i think with none consistent with your present assumption of cruelty come comeeyes that are so intelligent can laugh with delight as well as gleam with scorn and anger you are here a waif on cupids manor and i must seize on you in name of the deity  do not think of touching me my lord said the lady approach me not if you would hope to learn the purpose of my being here your grace may suppose yourself a solomon if you please but i am no travelling princess come from distant climes either to flatter your pride or wonder at your glory  a defiance by jupiter said the duke  you mistake the signal said the dark ladye i came not here without taking sufficient precautions for my retreat  you mouth it bravely said the duke but never fortress so boasted its resources but the garrison had some thoughts of surrender thus i open the first parallel  they had been hitherto divided from each other by a long narrow table which placed in the recess of the large casement we have mentioned had formed a sort of barrier on the ladys side against the adventurous gallant the duke went hastily to remove it as he spoke but attentive to all his motions his visitor instantly darted through the halfopen window buckingham uttered a cry of horror and surprise having no doubt at first that she had precipitated herself from a height of at least fourteen feet for so far the window was distant from the ground but when he sprung to the spot he perceived to his astonishment that she had effected her descent with equal agility and safety  the outside of this stately mansion was decorated with a quantity of carving in the mixed state betwixt the gothic and grecian styles which marks the age of elizabeth and her successor and though the feat seemed a surprising one the projections of these ornaments were sufficient to afford footing to a creature so light and active even in her hasty descent  inflamed alike by mortification and curiosity buckingham at first entertained some thought of following her by the same dangerous route and had actually got upon the sill of the window for that purpose and was contemplating what might be his next safe movement when from a neighbouring thicket of shrubs amongst which his visitor had disappeared he heard her chant a verse of a comic song then much in fashion concerning a despairing lover who had recourse to a precipice   but when he came near     beholding how steep   the sides did appear     and the bottom how deep   though his suit was rejected     he sadly reflected   that a lover forsaken     a new love may get   but a neck thats once broken     can never be set  the duke could not help laughing though much against his will at the resemblance which the verses bore to his own absurd situation and stepping back into the apartment desisted from an attempt which might have proved dangerous as well as ridiculous he called his attendants and contented himself with watching the little thicket unwilling to think that a female who had thrown herself in a great measure into his way meant absolutely to mortify him by a retreat  that question was determined in an instant a form wrapped in a mantle with a slouched hat and shadowy plume issued from the bushes and was lost in a moment amongst the ruins of ancient and of modern buildings with which as we have already stated the demesne formerly termed york house was now encumbered in all directions  the dukes servants who had obeyed his impatient summons were hastily directed to search for this tantalising siren in every direction their master in the meantime eager and vehement in every new pursuit but especially when his vanity was piqued encouraged their diligence by bribes and threats and commands all was in vain they found nothing of the mauritanian princess as she called herself but the turban and the veil both of which she had left in the thicket together with her satin slippers which articles doubtless she had thrown aside as she exchanged them for others less remarkable  finding all his search in vain the duke of buckingham after the example of spoiled children of all ages and stations gave a loose to the frantic vehemence of passion and fiercely he swore vengeance on his late visitor whom he termed by a thousand opprobrious epithets of which the elegant phrase jilt was most frequently repeated  even jerningham who knew the depths and the shallows of his masters mood and was bold to fathom them at almost every state of his passions kept out of his way on the present occasion and cabineted with the pious old housekeeper declared to her over a bottle of ratafia that in his apprehension if his grace did not learn to put some control on his temper chains darkness straw and bedlam would be the final doom of the gifted and admired duke of buckingham     chapter xl              contentious fierce             ardent and dire spring from no petty cause                                                     albion  the quarrels between man and wife are proverbial but let not these honest folks think that connections of a less permanent nature are free from similar jars the frolic of the duke of buckingham and the subsequent escape of alice bridgenorth had kindled fierce dissension in chiffinchs family when on his arrival in town he learned these two stunning events i tell you he said to his obliging helpmate who seemed but little moved by all that he could say on the subject that your dd carelessness has ruined the work of years  i think it is the twentieth time you have said so replied the dame and without such frequent assurance i was quite ready to believe that a very trifling matter would overset any scheme of yours however long thought of  how on earth could you have the folly to let the duke into the house when you expected the king said the irritated courtier  lord chiffinch answered the lady ought not you to ask the porter rather than me that sort of questioni was putting on my cap to receive his majesty  with the address of a madgehowlet said chiffinch and in the meanwhile you gave the cat the cream to keep  indeed chiffinch said the lady these jaunts to the country do render you excessively vulgar there is a brutality about your very boots nay your muslin ruffles being somewhat soiled give to your knuckles a sort of rural rusticity as i may call it  it were a good deed muttered chiffinch to make both boots and knuckles bang the folly and affectation out of thee then speaking aloud he added like a man who would fain break off an argument by extorting from his adversary a confession that he has reason on his side i am sure kate you must be sensible that our all depends on his majestys pleasure  leave that to me said she i know how to pleasure his majesty better than you can teach me do you think his majesty is booby enough to cry like a schoolboy because his sparrow has flown away his majesty has better taste i am surprised at you chiffinch she added drawing herself up who were once thought to know the points of a fine woman that you should have made such a roaring about this country wench why she has not even the country quality of being plump as a barndoor fowl but is more like a dunstable lark that one must crack bones and all if you would make a mouthful of it what signifies whence she came or where she goes there will be those behind that are much more worthy of his majestys condescending attention even when the duchess of portsmouth takes the frumps  you mean your neighbour mistress nelly said her worthy helpmate but kate her date is out wit she has let her keep herself warm with it in worse company for the cant of a gang of strollers is not language for a princes chamber   in evelyns memoirs is the following curious passage respecting     nell gwyn who is hinted at in the texti walked with him king     charles ii through saint james park to the garden where i both     saw and heard a very familiar discourse between the king     and mrs nelly as they called her an intimate comedian she     looking out of her garden on a terrace at the top of the wall and     the king standing on the green walk under it i was heartily     sorry at this sceneevelyns memoirs vol i p413  it is no matter what i mean or whom i mean said mrs chiffinch but i tell you tom chiffinch that you will find your master quite consoled for loss of the piece of prudish puritanism that you would need saddle him with as if the good man were not plagued enough with them in parliament but you must forsooth bring them into his very bedchamber  well kate said chiffinch if a man were to speak all the sense of the seven wise masters a woman would find nonsense enough to overwhelm him with so i shall say no more but that i would to heaven i may find the king in no worse humour than you describe him i am commanded to attend him down the river to the tower today where he is to make some survey of arms and stores they are clever fellows who contrive to keep rowley from engaging in business for by my word he has a turn for it  i warrant you said chiffinch the female nodding but rather to her own figure reflected from a mirror than to her politic husbandi warrant you we will find means of occupying him that will sufficiently fill up his time  on my honour kate said the male chiffinch i find you strangely altered and to speak truth grown most extremely opinionative i shall be happy if you have good reason for your confidence  the dame smiled superciliously but deigned no other answer unless this were onei shall order a boat to go upon the thames today with the royal party  take care what you do kate there are none dare presume so far but women of the first rank duchess of boltonof buckinghamof  who cares for a list of names why may not i be as forward as the greatest b amongst your string of them  nay faith thou mayest match the greatest b in court already answered chiffinch so een take thy own course of it but do not let chaubert forget to get some collation ready and a souper au petit couvert in case it should be commanded for the evening  ay there your boasted knowledge of court matters begins and endschiffinch chaubert and companydissolve that partnership and you break tom chiffinch for a courtier  amen kate replied chiffinch and let me tell you it is as safe to rely on another persons fingers as on our own wit but i must give orders for the waterif you will take the pinnace there are the clothofgold cushions in the chapel may serve to cover the benches for the day they are never wanted where they lie so you may make free with them too  madam chiffinch accordingly mingled with the flotilla which attended the king on his voyage down the thames amongst whom was the queen attended by some of the principal ladies of the court the little plump cleopatra dressed to as much advantage as her taste could devise and seated upon her embroidered cushions like venus in her shell neglected nothing that effrontery and minauderie could perform to draw upon herself some portion of the kings observation but charles was not in the vein and did not even pay her the slightest passing attention of any kind until her boatmen having ventured to approach nearer to the queens barge than etiquette permitted received a peremptory order to back their oars and fall out of the royal procession madam chiffinch cried for spite and transgressed solomons warning by cursing the king in her heart but had no better course than to return to westminster and direct chauberts preparations for the evening  in the meantime the royal barge paused at the tower and accompanied by a laughing train of ladies and of courtiers the gay monarch made the echoes of the old prisontowers ring with the unwonted sounds of mirth and revelry as they ascended from the riverside to the centre of the building where the fine old keep of william the conqueror called the white tower predominates over the exterior defences heaven only knows how many gallant jests good or bad were run on the comparison of his majestys stateprison to that of cupid and what killing similes were drawn between the ladies eyes and the guns of the fortress which spoken with a fashionable congée and listened to with a smile from a fair lady formed the fine conversations of the day  this gay swarm of flutterers did not however attend close on the kings person though they had accompanied him upon his party on the river charles who often formed manly and sensible resolutions though he was too easily diverted from them by indolence or pleasure had some desire to make himself personally acquainted with the state of the military stores arms c of which the tower was then as now the magazine and although he had brought with him the usual number of his courtiers only three or four attended him on the scrutiny which he intended whilst therefore the rest of the train amused themselves as they might in other parts of the tower the king accompanied by the dukes of buckingham ormond and one or two others walked through the wellknown hall in which is preserved the most splendid magazine of arms in the world and which though far from exhibiting its present extraordinary state of perfection was even then an arsenal worthy of the great nation to which it belonged  the duke of ormond well known for his services during the great civil war was as we have elsewhere noticed at present rather on cold terms with his sovereign who nevertheless asked his advice on many occasions and who required it on the present amongst others when it was not a little feared that the parliament in their zeal for the protestant religion might desire to take the magazines of arms and ammunition under their own exclusive orders while charles sadly hinted at such a termination of the popular jealousies of the period and discussed with ormond the means of resisting or evading it buckingham falling a little behind amused himself with ridiculing the antiquated appearance and embarrassed demeanour of the old warder who attended on the occasion and who chanced to be the very same who escorted julian peveril to his present place of confinement the duke prosecuted his raillery with the greater activity that he found the old man though restrained by the place and presence was rather upon the whole testy and disposed to afford what sportsmen call play to his persecutor the various pieces of ancient armour with which the wall was covered afforded the principal source of the dukes wit as he insisted upon knowing from the old man who he said could best remember matters from the days of king arthur downwards at the least the history of the different warlike weapons and anecdotes of the battles in which they had been wielded the old man obviously suffered when he was obliged by repeated questions to tell the legends often sufficiently absurd which the tradition of the place had assigned to particular relics far from flourishing his partisan and augmenting the emphasis of his voice as was and is the prevailing fashion of these warlike ciceroni it was scarcely possible to extort from him a single word concerning those topics on which their information is usually overflowing  do you know my friend said the duke to him at last i begin to change my mind respecting you i supposed you must have served as a yeoman of the guard since bluff king henrys time and expected to hear something from you about the field of the cloth of goldand i thought of asking you the colour of anne bullens breastknot which cost the pope three kingdoms but i am afraid you are but a novice in such recollections of love and chivalry art sure thou didst not creep into thy warlike office from some dark shop in towerhamlets and that thou hast not converted an unlawful measuringyard into that glorious halberdi warrant thou canst not even tell you whom this piece of antique panoply pertained to  the duke pointed at random to a cuirass which hung amongst others but was rather remarkable from being better cleansed  i should know that piece of iron said the warder bluntly yet with some change in his voice for i have known a man within side of it who would not have endured half the impertinence i have heard spoken today  the tone of the old man as well as the words attracted the attention of charles and the duke of ormond who were only two steps before the speaker they both stopped and turned round the former saying at the same timehow now sirrahwhat answers are thesewhat man do you speak of  of one who is none now said the warder whatever he may have been  the old man surely speaks of himself said the duke of ormond closely examining the countenance of the warder which he in vain endeavoured to turn away i am sure i remember these featuresare not you my old friend major coleby  i wish your graces memory had been less accurate said the old man colouring deeply and fixing his eyes on the ground  the king was greatly shockedgood god he said the gallant major coleby who joined us with his four sons and a hundred and fifty men at warringtonand is this all we could do for an old worcester friend  the tears rushed thick into the old mans eyes as he said in broken accents never mind me sire i am well enough herea wornout soldier rusting among old armour where one old cavalier is better there are twenty worsei am sorry your majesty should know anything of it since it grieves you  with that kindness which was a redeeming point of his character charles while the old man was speaking took the partisan from him with his own hand and put it into that of buckingham saying what colebys hand has borne can disgrace neither yours nor mineand you owe him this atonement time has been with him that for less provocation he would have laid it about your ears  the duke bowed deeply but coloured with resentment and took an immediate opportunity to place the weapon carelessly against a pile of arms the king did not observe a contemptuous motion which perhaps would not have pleased him being at the moment occupied with the veteran whom he exhorted to lean upon him as he conveyed him to a seat permitting no other person to assist him rest there he said my brave old friend and charles stewart must be poor indeed if you wear that dress an hour longeryou look very pale my good coleby to have had so much colour a few minutes since be not vexed at what buckingham says no one minds his follyyou look worse and worse come come you are too much hurried by this meeting sit stilldo not risedo not attempt to kneel i command you to repose yourself till i have made the round of these apartments  the old cavalier stooped his head in token of acquiescence in the command of his sovereign but he raised it not again the tumultuous agitation of the moment had been too much for spirits which had been long in a state of depression and health which was much decayed when the king and his attendants after halfanhours absence returned to the spot where they had left the veteran they found him dead and already cold in the attitude of one who has fallen easily asleep the king was dreadfully shocked and it was with a low and faltering voice that he directed the body in due time to be honourably buried in the chapel of the tower he was then silent until he attained the steps in front of the arsenal where the party in attendance upon his person began to assemble at his approach along with some other persons of respectable appearance whom curiosity had attracted   a story of this nature is current in the legends of the tower the     affecting circumstances are i believe recorded in one of the     little manuals which are put into the hands of visitors but are     not to be found in the later editions  this is dreadful said the king we must find some means of relieving the distresses and rewarding the fidelity of our suffering followers or posterity will cry fie upon our memory  your majesty has had often such plans agitated in your council said buckingham  true george said the king i can safely say it is not my fault i have thought of it for years  it cannot be too well considered said buckingham besides every year makes the task of relief easier  true said the duke of ormond by diminishing the number of sufferers here is poor old coleby will no longer be a burden to the crown  you are too severe my lord of ormond said the king and should respect the feelings you trespass on you cannot suppose that we would have permitted this poor man to hold such a situation had we known of the circumstances  for gods sake then sire said the duke of ormond turn your eyes which have just rested on the corpse of one old friend upon the distresses of others here is the valiant old sir geoffrey peveril of the peak who fought through the whole war wherever blows were going and was the last man i believe in england who laid down his armshere is his son of whom i have the highest accounts as a gallant of spirit accomplishments and couragehere is the unfortunate house of derbyfor pitys sake interfere in behalf of these victims whom the folds of this hydraplot have entangled in order to crush them to deathrebuke the fiends that are seeking to devour their lives and disappoint the harpies that are gaping for their property this very day sevennight the unfortunate family father and son are to be brought upon trial for crimes of which they are as guiltless i boldly pronounce as any who stand in this presence for gods sake sire let us hope that should the prejudices of the people condemn them as it has done others you will at last step in between the bloodhunters and their prey  the king looked as he really was exceedingly perplexed  buckingham between whom and ormond there existed a constant and almost mortal quarrel interfered to effect a diversion in charless favour your majestys royal benevolence he said needs never want exercise while the duke of ormond is near your person he has his sleeve cut in the old and ample fashion that he may always have store of ruined cavaliers stowed in it to produce at demand rare old rawboned boys with malmsey noses bald heads spindle shanks and merciless histories of edgehill and naseby  my sleeve is i dare say of an antique cut said ormond looking full at the duke but i pin neither bravoes nor ruffians upon it my lord of buckingham as i see fastened to coats of the new mode  that is a little too sharp for our presence my lord said the king  not if i make my words good said ormondmy lord of buckingham will you name the man you spoke to as you left the boat  i spoke to no one said the duke hastilynay i mistake i remember a fellow whispered in my ear that one who i thought had left london was still lingering in town a person whom i had business with  was yon the messenger said ormond singling out from the crowd who stood in the courtyard a tall darklooking man muffled in a large cloak wearing a broad shadowy black beaver hat with a long sword of the spanish fashionthe very colonel in short whom buckingham had despatched in quest of christian with the intention of detaining him in the country  when buckinghams eyes had followed the direction of ormonds finger he could not help blushing so deeply as to attract the kings attention  what new frolic is this george he said gentlemen bring that fellow forward on my life a truculentlooking caitiffhark ye friend who are you if an honest man nature has forgot to label it upon your countenancedoes none here know him   with every symptom of a knave complete   if he be honest hes a devilish cheat  he is well known to many sire replied ormond and that he walks in this area with his neck safe and his limbs unshackled is an instance amongst many that we live under the sway of the most merciful prince of europe  oddsfish who is the man my lord duke said the king your grace talks mysteriesbuckingham blushesand the rogue himself is dumb  that honest gentleman please your majesty replied the duke of ormond whose modesty makes him mute though it cannot make him blush is the notorious colonel blood as he calls himself whose attempt to possess himself of your majestys royal crown took place at no very distant date in this very tower of london  that exploit is not easily forgotten said the king but that the fellow lives shows your graces clemency as well as mine  i cannot deny that i was in his hands sire said ormond and had certainly been murdered by him had he chosen to take my life on the spot instead of destining mei thank him for the honourto be hanged at tyburn i had certainly been sped if he had thought me worth knife or pistol or anything short of the cordlook at him sire if the rascal dared he would say at this moment like caliban in the play ho ho i would i had done it  why oddsfish answered the king he hath a villainous sneer my lord which seems to say as much but my lord duke we have pardoned him and so has your grace  it would ill have become me said the duke of ormond to have been severe in prosecuting an attempt on my poor life when your majesty was pleased to remit his more outrageous and insolent attempt upon your royal crown but i must conceive it as a piece of supreme insolence on the part of this bloodthirsty bully by whomsoever he may be now backed to appear in the tower which was the theatre of one of his villainies or before me who was wellnigh the victim of another  it shall be amended in future said the kinghark ye sirrah blood if you again presume to thrust yourself in the way you have done but now i will have the hangmans knife and your knavish ears made acquainted  blood bowed and with a coolness of impudence which did his nerves great honour he said he had only come to the tower accidentally to communicate with a particular friend on business of importance my lord duke of buckingham he said knew he had no other intentions  get you gone you scoundrelly cutthroat said the duke as much impatient of colonel bloods claim of acquaintance as a townrake of the low and blackguard companions of his midnight rambles when they accost him in daylight amidst better company if you dare to quote my name again i will have you thrown into the thames  blood thus repulsed turned round with the most insolent composure and walked away down from the parade all men looking at him as at some strange and monstrous prodigy so much was he renowned for daring and desperate villainy some even followed him to have a better survey of the notorious colonel blood like the smaller tribe of birds which keep fluttering round an owl when he appears in the light of the sun but as in the latter case these thoughtless flutterers are careful to keep out of reach of the beak and claws of the bird of minerva so none of those who followed and gazed on blood as something ominous cared to bandy looks with him or to endure and return the lowering and deadly glances which he shot from time to time on those who pressed nearest to him he stalked on in this manner like a daunted yet sullen wolf afraid to stop yet unwilling to fly until he reached the traitors gate and getting on board a sculler which waited for him he disappeared from their eyes  charles would fain have obliterated all recollection of his appearance by the observation it were a shame that such a reprobate scoundrel should be the subject of discord between two noblemen of distinction and he recommended to the dukes of buckingham and ormond to join hands and forget a misunderstanding which rose on so unworthy a subject  buckingham answered carelessly that the duke of ormonds honoured white hairs were a sufficient apology for his making the first overtures to a reconciliation and he held out his hand accordingly but ormond only bowed in return and said the king had no cause to expect that the court would be disturbed by his personal resentments since time would not yield him back twenty years nor the grave restore his gallant son ossory as to the ruffian who had intruded himself there he was obliged to him since by showing that his majestys clemency extended even to the very worst of criminals he strengthened his hopes of obtaining the kings favour for such of his innocent friends as were now in prison and in danger from the odious charges brought against them on the score of the popish plot  the king made no other answer to this insinuation than by directing that the company should embark for their return to whitehall and thus took leave of the officers of the tower who were in attendance with one of those wellturned compliments to their discharge of duty which no man knew better how to express and issued at the same time strict and anxious orders for protection and defence of the important fortress confided to them and all which it contained  before he parted with ormond on their arrival at whitehall he turned round to him as one who has made up his resolution and said be satisfied my lord dukeour friends case shall be looked to  in the same evening the attorneygeneral and north lord chief justice of the common pleas had orders with all secrecy to meet his majesty that evening on especial matters of state at the apartments of chiffinch the centre of all affairs whether of gallantry or business     chapter xli              yet corah thou shalt from oblivion pass             erect thyself thou monumental brass             high as the serpent of thy metal made             while nations stand secure beneath thy shade                                        absalom and achitophel  the morning which charles had spent in visiting the tower had been very differently employed by those unhappy individuals whom their bad fate and the singular temper of the times had made the innocent tenants of that state prison and who had received official notice that they were to stand their trial in the court of queens bench at westminster on the seventh succeeding day the stout old cavalier at first only railed at the officer for spoiling his breakfast with the news but evinced great feeling when he was told that julian was to be put under the same indictment  we intend to dwell only very generally on the nature of their trial which corresponded in the outline with almost all those which took place during the prevalence of the popish plot that is one or two infamous and perjured evidences whose profession of common informers had become frightfully lucrative made oath to the prisoners having expressed themselves interested in the great confederacy of the catholics a number of others brought forward facts or suspicions affecting the character of the parties as honest protestants and good subjects and betwixt the direct and presumptive evidence enough was usually extracted for justifying to a corrupted court and perjured jury the fatal verdict of guilty  the fury of the people had however now begun to pass away exhausted even by its own violence the english nation differ from all others indeed even from those of the sister kingdoms in being very easily sated with punishment even when they suppose it most merited other nations are like the tamed tiger which when once its native appetite for slaughter is indulged in one instance rushes on in promiscuous ravages but the english public have always rather resembled what is told of the sleuthdog which eager fierce and clamorous in pursuit of his prey desists from it so soon as blood is sprinkled upon his path  mens minds were now beginning to coolthe character of the witnesses was more closely siftedtheir testimonies did not in all cases tallyand a wholesome suspicion began to be entertained of men who would never say they had made a full discovery of all they knew but avowedly reserved some points of evidence to bear on future trials  the king also who had lain passive during the first burst of popular fury was now beginning to bestir himself which produced a marked effect on the conduct of the crown counsel and even the judges sir george wakeman had been acquitted in spite of oatess direct testimony and public attention was strongly excited concerning the event of the next trial which chanced to be that of the peverils father and son with whom i know not from what concatenation little hudson the dwarf was placed at the bar of the court of kings bench  it was a piteous sight to behold a father and son who had been so long separated meet under circumstances so melancholy and many tears were shed when the majestic old manfor such he was though now broken with yearsfolded his son to his bosom with a mixture of joy affection and a bitter anticipation of the event of the impending trial there was a feeling in the court that for a moment overcame every prejudice and party feeling many spectators shed tears and there was even a low moaning as of those who weep aloud  such as felt themselves sufficiently at ease to remark the conduct of poor little geoffrey hudson who was scarcely observed amid the preponderating interest created by his companions in misfortune could not but notice a strong degree of mortification on the part of that diminutive gentleman he had soothed his great mind by the thoughts of playing the character which he was called on to sustain in a manner which should be long remembered in that place and on his entrance had saluted the numerous spectators as well as the court with a cavalier air which he meant should express grace highbreeding perfect coolness with a noble disregard to the issue of their proceedings but his little person was so obscured and jostled aside on the meeting of the father and son who had been brought in different boats from the tower and placed at the bar at the same moment that his distress and his dignity were alike thrown into the background and attracted neither sympathy nor admiration  the dwarfs wisest way to attract attention would have been to remain quiet when so remarkable an exterior would certainly have received in its turn the share of public notice which he so eagerly coveted but when did personal vanity listen to the suggestions of prudenceour impatient friend scrambled with some difficulty on the top of the bench intended for his seat and there paining himself to stand atiptoe like chaucers gallant sir chaunticlere he challenged the notice of the audience as he stood bowing and claiming acquaintance of his namesake sir geoffrey the larger with whose shoulders notwithstanding his elevated situation he was scarcely yet upon a level  the taller knight whose mind was occupied in a very different manner took no notice of these advances upon the dwarfs part but sat down with the determination rather to die on the spot than evince any symptoms of weakness before roundheads and presbyterians under which obnoxious epithets being too oldfashioned to find out party designations of newer date he comprehended all persons concerned in his present trouble  by sir geoffrey the largers change of position his face was thus brought on a level with that of sir geoffrey the less who had an opportunity of pulling him by the cloak he of martindale castle rather mechanically than consciously turned his head towards the large wrinkled visage which struggling between an assumed air of easy importance and an anxious desire to be noticed was grimacing within a yard of him but neither the singular physiognomy the nods and smiles of greeting and recognition into which it was wreathed nor the strange little form by which it was supported had at that moment the power of exciting any recollections in the old knights mind and having stared for a moment at the poor little man his bulky namesake turned away his head without farther notice  julian peveril the dwarfs more recent acquaintance had even amid his own anxious feelings room for sympathy with those of his little fellowsufferer as soon as he discovered that he was at the same terrible bar with himself although he could not conceive how their causes came to be conjoined he acknowledged him by a hearty shake of the hand which the old man returned with affected dignity and real gratitude worthy youth he said thy presence is restorative like the nepenthe of homer even in this syncopé of our mutual fate i am concerned to see that your father hath not the same alacrity of soul as that of ours which are lodged within smaller compass and that he hath forgotten an ancient comrade and fellowsoldier who now stands beside him to perform perhaps their last campaign  julian briefly replied that his father had much to occupy him but the little manwho to do him justice cared no more in his own phrase for imminent danger or death than he did for the puncture of a fleas proboscisdid not so easily renounce the secret object of his ambition which was to acquire the notice of the large and lofty sir geoffrey peveril who being at least three inches taller than his son was in so far possessed of that superior excellence which the poor dwarf in his secret soul valued before all other distinctions although in his conversation he was constantly depreciating it good comrade and namesake he proceeded stretching out his hand so as to again to reach the elder peverils cloak i forgive your want of reminiscence seeing it is long since i saw you at naseby fighting as if you had as many arms as the fabled briareus  the knight of martindale who had again turned his head towards the little man and had listened as if endeavouring to make something out of his discourse here interrupted him with a peevish pshaw  pshaw repeated sir geoffrey the less pshaw is an expression of slight esteemnay of contemptin all languages and were this a befitting place  but the judges had now taken their places the criers called silence and the stern voice of the lord chief justice the notorious scroggs demanded what the officers meant by permitting the accused to communicate together in open court  it may here be observed that this celebrated personage was upon the present occasion at a great loss how to proceed a calm dignified judicial demeanour was at no time the characteristic of his official conduct he always ranted and roared either on the one side or the other and of late he had been much unsettled which side to take being totally incapable of anything resembling impartiality at the first trials for the plot when the whole stream of popularity ran against the accused no one had been so loud as scroggs to attempt to the character of oates or bedloe or any other leading witnesses he treated as a crime more heinous than it would have been to blaspheme the gospel on which they had been swornit was a stifling of the plot or discrediting of the kings witnessesa crime not greatly if at all short of high treason against the king himself  but of late a new light had begun to glimmer upon the understanding of this interpreter of the laws sagacious in the signs of the times he began to see that the tide was turning and that court favour at least and probably popular opinion also were likely in a short time to declare against the witnesses and in favour of the accused  the opinion which scroggs had hitherto entertained of the high respect in which shaftesbury the patron of the plot was held by charles had been definitely shaken by a whisper from his brother north to the following effect his lordship has no more interest at court than your footman  this notice from a sure hand and received but that morning had put the judge to a sore dilemma for however indifferent to actual consistency he was most anxious to save appearances he could not but recollect how violent he had been on former occasions in favour of these prosecutions and being sensible at the same time that the credit of the witnesses though shaken in the opinion of the more judicious was amongst the bulk of the people out of doors as strong as ever he had a difficult part to play his conduct therefore during the whole trial resembled the appearance of a vessel about to go upon another tack when her sails are shivering in the wind ere they have yet caught the impulse which is to send her forth in a new direction in a word he was so uncertain which side it was his interest to favour that he might be said on that occasion to have come nearer a state of total impartiality than he was ever capable of attaining whether before or afterwards this was shown by his bullying now the accused and now the witnesses like a mastiff too much irritated to lie still without baying but uncertain whom he shall first bite  the indictment was then read and sir geoffrey peveril heard with some composure the first part of it which stated him to have placed his son in the household of the countess of derby a recusant papist for the purpose of aiding the horrible and bloodthirsty popish plotwith having had arms and ammunition concealed in his houseand with receiving a blank commission from the lord stafford who had suffered death on account of the plot but when the charge went on to state that he had communicated for the same purpose with geoffrey hudson sometimes called sir geoffrey hudson now or formerly in the domestic service of the queen dowager he looked at his companion as if he suddenly recalled him to remembrance and broke out impatiently these lies are too gross to require a moments consideration i might have had enough of intercourse though in nothing but what was loyal and innocent with my noble kinsman the late lord staffordi will call him so in spite of his misfortunesand with my wifes relation the honourable countess of derby but what likelihood can there be that i should have colleagued with a decrepit buffoon with whom i never had an instants communication save once at an easter feast when i whistled a hornpipe as he danced on a trencher to amuse the company  the rage of the poor dwarf brought tears in his eyes while with an affected laugh he said that instead of those juvenile and festive passages sir geoffrey peveril might have remembered his charging along with him at wiggan lane  on my word said sir geoffrey after a moments recollection i will do you justice master hudsoni believe you were therei think i heard you did good service but you will allow you might have been near one without his seeing you  a sort of titter ran through the court at the simplicity of the larger sir geoffreys testimony which the dwarf endeavoured to control by standing on his tiptoes and looking fiercely around as if to admonish the laughers that they indulged their mirth at their own peril but perceiving that this only excited farther scorn he composed himself into a semblance of careless contempt observing with a smile that no one feared the glance of a chained lion a magnificent simile which rather increased than diminished the mirth of those who heard it  against julian peveril there failed not to be charged the aggravated fact that he had been bearer of letters between the countess of derby and other papists and priests engaged in the universal treasonable conspiracy of the catholics and the attack of the house at moultrassie hallwith his skirmish with chiffinch and his assault as it was termed on the person of john jenkins servant to the duke of buckingham were all narrated at length as so many open and overt acts of treasonable import to this charge peveril contented himself with pleadingnot guilty  his little companion was not satisfied with so simple a plea for when he heard it read as a part of the charge applying to him that he had received from an agent of the plot a blank commission as colonel of a regiment of grenadiers he replied in wrath and scorn that if goliath of gath had come to him with such a proposal and proffered him the command of the whole sons of anak in a body he should never have had occasion or opportunity to repeat the temptation to another i would have slain him said the little man of loyalty even where he stood  the charge was stated anew by the counsel for the crown and forth came the notorious doctor oates rustling in the full silken canonicals of priesthood for it was a time when he affected no small dignity of exterior decoration and deportment  this singular man who aided by the obscure intrigues of the catholics themselves and the fortuitous circumstance of godfreys murder had been able to cram down the public throat such a mass of absurdity as his evidence amounts to had no other talent for imposture than an impudence which set conviction and shame alike at defiance a man of sense or reflection by trying to give his plot an appearance of more probability would most likely have failed as wise men often to do in addressing the multitude from not daring to calculate upon the prodigious extent of their credulity especially where the figments presented to them involve the fearful and the terrible  oates was by nature choleric and the credit he had acquired made him insolent and conceited even his exterior was portentous a fleece of white periwig showed a most uncouth visage of great length having the mouth as the organ by use of which he was to rise to eminence placed in the very centre of the countenance and exhibiting to the astonished spectator as much chin below as there was nose and brow above the aperture his pronunciation too was after a conceited fashion of his own in which he accented the vowels in a manner altogether peculiar to himself  this notorious personage such as we have described him stood forth on the present trial and delivered his astonishing testimony concerning the existence of a catholic plot for the subversion of the government and murder of the king in the same general outline in which it may be found in every english history but as the doctor always had in reserve some special piece of evidence affecting those immediately on trial he was pleased on the present occasion deeply to inculpate the countess of derby he had seen as he said that honourable lady when he was at the jesuits college at saint omers she had sent for him to an inn or auberge as it was there termedthe sign of the golden lamb and had ordered him to breakfast in the same room with her ladyship and afterwards told him that knowing he was trusted by the fathers of the society she was determined that he should have a share of her secrets also and therewithal that she drew from her bosom a broad sharppointed knife such as butchers kill sheep with and demanded of him what he thought of it for the purpose and when he the witness said for what purpose she rapt him on the fingers with her fan called him a dull fellow and said it was designed to kill the king with  here sir geoffrey peveril could no longer refrain his indignation and surprise mercy of heaven he said did ever one hear of ladies of quality carrying butchering knives about them and telling every scurvy companion she meant to kill the king with themgentleman of the jury do but think if this is reasonablethough if the villain could prove by any honest evidence that my lady of derby ever let such a scum as himself come to speech of her i would believe all he can say  sir geoffrey said the judge rest you quietyou must not fly outpassion helps you not herethe doctor must be suffered to proceed  doctor oates went on to state how the lady complained of the wrongs the house of derby had sustained from the king and the oppression of her religion and boasted of the schemes of the jesuits and seminary priests and how they would be farthered by her noble kinsman of the house of stanley he finally averred that both the countess and the fathers of the seminary abroad founded much upon the talents and courage of sir geoffrey peveril and his sonthe latter of whom was a member of her family of hudson he only recollected of having heard one of the fathers say that although but a dwarf in stature he would prove a giant in the cause of the church  when he had ended his evidence there was a pause until the judge as if the thought had suddenly occurred to him demanded of dr oates whether he had ever mentioned the names of the countess of derby in any of the previous informations which he had lodged before the privy council and elsewhere upon this affair  oates seemed rather surprised at the question and coloured with anger as he answered in his peculiar mode of pronunciation whoy no maay laard  and pray doctor said the judge how came so great a revealer of mysteries as you have lately proved to have suffered so material a circumstance as the accession of this powerful family to the plot to have remained undiscovered  maay laard said oates with much effrontery aye do not come here to have my evidence questioned as touching the plaat  i do not question your evidence doctor said scroggs for the time was not arrived that he dared treat him roughly nor do i doubt the existence of the plaat since it is your pleasure to swear to it i would only have you for your own sake and the satisfaction of all good protestants to explain why you have kept back such a weighty point of information from the king and country  maay laard said oates i will tell you a pretty fable  i hope answered the judge it may be the first and last which you shall tell in this place  maay laard continued oates there was once a faux who having to carry a goose over a frazen river and being afraid the aice would not bear him and his booty did caarry aaver a staane my laard in the first instance to prove the strength of the aice  so your former evidence was but the stone and now for the first time you have brought us the goose said sir william scroggs to tell us this doctor is to make geese of the court and jury  i desoire your laardships honest construction said oates who saw the current changing against him but was determined to pay the score with effrontery all men knaw at what coast and praice i have given my evidence which has been always under gaad the means of awakening this poor naation to the dangerous state in which it staunds many here knaw that i have been obliged to faartify my ladging at whitehall against the bloody papists it was not to be thought that i should have brought all the story out at aance i think your wisdome would have advised me otherwise   it was on such terms that dr oates was pleased to claim the     extraordinary privilege of dealing out the information which he     chose to communicate to a court of justice the only sense in     which his story of the fox stone and goose could be applicable     is by supposing that he was determined to ascertain the extent of     his countrymens credulity before supplying it with a full meal  nay doctor said the judge it is not for me to direct you in this affair and it is for the jury to believe you or not and as for myself i sit here to do justice to boththe jury have heard your answer to my question  doctor oates retired from the witnessbox reddening like a turkeycock as one totally unused to have such accounts questioned as he chose to lay before the courts of justice and there was perhaps for the first time amongst the counsel and solicitors as well as the templars and students of law there present a murmur distinct and audible unfavourable to the character of the great father of the popish plot  everett and dangerfield with whom the reader is already acquainted were then called in succession to sustain the accusation they were subordinate informersa sort of underspurleathers as the cant term wentwho followed the path of oates with all deference to his superior genius and invention and made their own fictions chime in and harmonise with his as well as their talents could devise but as their evidence had at no time received the full credence into which the impudence of oates had cajoled the public so they now began to fall into discredit rather more hastily than their prototype as the superadded turrets of an illconstructed building are naturally the first to give way  it was in vain that everett with the precision of a hypocrite and dangerfield with the audacity of a bully narrated with added circumstances of suspicion and criminality their meeting with julian peveril in liverpool and again at martindale castle it was in vain they described the arms and accoutrements which they pretended to have discovered in old sir geoffreys possession and that they gave a most dreadful account of the escape of the younger peveril from moultrassie hall by means of an armed force  the jury listened coldly and it was visible that they were but little moved by the accusation especially as the judge always professing his belief in the plot and his zeal for the protestant religion was ever and anon reminding them that presumptions were no proofsthat hearsay was no evidencethat those who made a trade of discovery were likely to aid their researches by inventionand that without doubting the guilt of the unfortunate persons at the bar he would gladly hear some evidence brought against them of a different nature here we are told of a riot and an escape achieved by the younger peveril at the house of a grave and worthy magistrate known i think to most of us why master attorney bring ye not master bridgenorth himself to prove the fact or all his household if it be necessarya rising in arms is an affair over public to be left on the hearsay tale of these two menthough heaven forbid that i should suppose they speak one word more than they believe they are the witnesses for the kingand what is equally dear to us the protestant religionand witnesses against a most foul and heathenish plot on the other hand here is a worshipful old knight for such i must suppose him to be since he has bled often in battle for the kingsuch i must say i suppose him to be until he is proved otherwise and here is his son a hopeful young gentlemanwe must see that they have right master attorney  unquestionably my lord answered the attorney god forbid else but we will make out these matters against these unhappy gentlemen in a manner more close if your lordship will permit us to bring in our evidence  go on master attorney said the judge throwing himself back in his seat heaven forbid i hinder proving the kings accusation i only say what you know as well as i that de non apparentibus et non existentibus eadem est ratio  we shall then call master bridgenorth as your lordship advised who i think is in waiting  no answered a voice from the crowd apparently that of a female he is too wise and too honest to be here  the voice was distinct as that of lady fairfax when she expressed herself to a similar effect on the trial of charles the first but the researches which were made on the present occasion to discover the speaker were unsuccessful  after the slight confusion occasioned by this circumstance was abated the attorney who had been talking aside with the conductors of the prosecution said whoever favoured us with that information my lord had good reason for what they said master bridgenorth has become i am told suddenly invisible since this morning  look you there now master attorney said the judgethis comes of not keeping the crown witnesses together and in readinessi am sure i cannot help the consequences  nor i either my lord said the attorney pettishly i could have proved by this worshipful gentleman master justice bridgenorth the ancient friendship betwixt this party sir geoffrey peveril and the countess of derby of whose doings and intentions dr oates has given such a deliberate evidence i could have proved his having sheltered her in his castle against a process of law and rescued her by force of arms from this very justice bridgenorth not without actual violence moreover i could have proved against young peveril the whole affray charged upon him by the same worshipful evidence  here the judge stuck his thumbs into his girdle which was a favourite attitude of his on such occasions and exclaimed pshaw pshaw master attorneytell me not that you could have proved that or that or thisprove what you will but let it be through the mouths of your evidence men are not to be licked out of their lives by the rough side of a lawyers tongue  nor is a foul plot to be smothered said the attorney for all the haste your lordship is in i cannot call master chiffinch neither as he is employed on the kings especial affairs as i am this instant certiorated from the court at whitehall  produce the papers then master attorney of which this young man is said to be the bearer said the judge  they are before the privy council my lord  then why do you found on them here said the judgethis is something like trifling with the court  since your lordship gives it that name said the attorney sitting down in a huff you may manage the cause as you will  if you do not bring more evidence i pray you to charge the jury said the judge  i shall not take the trouble to do so said the crown counsel i see plainly how the matter is to go  nay but be better advised said scroggs consider your case is but half proved respecting the two peverils and doth not pinch on the little man at all saving that doctor oates said that he was in a certain case to prove a giant which seems no very probable popish miracle  this sally occasioned a laugh in the court which the attorneygeneral seemed to take in great dudgeon  master attorney said oates who always interfered in the management of these lawsuits this is a plain an absolute giving away of the causei must needs say it a mere stoifling of the plaat  then the devil who bred it may blow wind into it again if he lists answered the attorneygeneral and flinging down his brief he left the court as if in a huff with all who were concerned in the affair  the judge having obtained silencefor a murmur arose in the court when the counsel for the prosecution threw up his briefbegan to charge the jury balancing as he had done throughout the whole day the different opinions by which he seemed alternately swayed he protested on his salvation that he had no more doubt of the existence of the horrid and damnable conspiracy called the popish plot than he had of the treachery of judas iscariot and that he considered oates as the instrument under providence of preserving the nation from all the miseries of his majestys assassination and of a second saint bartholomew acted in the streets of london but then he stated it was the candid construction of the law of england that the worse the crime the more strong should be the evidence here was the case of accessories tried whilst their principalfor such he should call the countess of derbywas unconvicted and at large and for doctor oates he had but spoke of matters which personally applied to that noble lady whose words if she used such in passion touching aid which she expected in some treasonable matters from these peverils and from her kinsmen or her sons kinsmen of the house of stanley may have been but a burst of female resentmentdulcis amaryllidis ira as the poet hath it who knoweth but doctor oates did mistakehe being a gentleman of a comely countenance and easy demeanourthis same rap with the fan as a chastisement for lack of courage in the catholic cause when peradventure it was otherwise meant as popish ladies will put it is said such neophytes and youthful candidates for orders to many severe trials i speak these things jocularly said the judge having no wish to stain the reputation either of the honourable countess or the reverend doctor only i think the bearing between them may have related to something short of high treason as for what the attorneygeneral hath set forth of rescues and force and i wot not what sure i am that in a civil country when such things happen such things may be proved and that you and i gentlemen are not to take them for granted gratuitously touching this other prisoner this galfridus minimus he must needs say he continued he could not discover even a shadow of suspicion against him was it to be thought so abortive a creature would thrust himself into depths of policy far less into stratagems of war they had but to look at him to conclude the contrarythe creature was from his age fitter for the grave than a conspiracyand by his size and appearance for the inside of a rareeshow than the mysteries of a plot  the dwarf here broke in upon the judge by force of screaming to assure him that he had been simple as he sat there engaged in seven plots in cromwells time and as he proudly added with some of the tallest men of england the matchless look and air with which sir geoffrey made this vaunt set all alaughing and increased the ridicule with which the whole trial began to be received so that it was amidst shaking sides and watery eyes that a general verdict of not guilty was pronounced and the prisoners dismissed from the bar  but a warmer sentiment awakened among those who saw the father and son throw themselves into each others arms and after a hearty embrace extend their hands to their poor little companion in peril who like a dog when present at a similar scene had at last succeeded by stretching himself up to them and whimpering at the same time to secure to himself a portion of their sympathy and gratulation  such was the singular termination of this trial charles himself was desirous to have taken considerable credit with the duke of ormond for the evasion of the law which had been thus effected by his private connivance and was both surprised and mortified at the coldness with which his grace replied that he was rejoiced at the poor gentlemans safety but would rather have had the king redeem them like a prince by his royal prerogative of mercy than that his judge should convey them out of the power of the law like a juggler with his cups and balls     chapter xlii                       on fair ground                      i could beat forty of them                                            coriolanus  it doubtless occurred to many that were present at the trial we have described that it was managed in a singular manner and that the quarrel which had the appearance of having taken place between the court and the crown counsel might proceed from some private understanding betwixt them the object of which was the miscarriage of the accusation yet though such underhand dealing was much suspected the greater part of the audience being well educated and intelligent had already suspected the bubble of the popish plot and were glad to see that accusations founded on what had already cost so much blood could be evaded in any way but the crowd who waited in the court of requests and in the hall and without doors viewed in a very different light the combination as they interpreted it between the judge and the attorneygeneral for the escape of the prisoners  oates whom less provocation than he had that day received often induced to behave like one frantic with passion threw himself amongst the crowd and repeated till he was hoarse theay are stoifling the plaattheay are straangling the plaatmy laard justice and maaster attarney are in league to secure the escape of the plaaters and paapists  it is the device of the papist whore of portsmouth said one  of old rowley himself said another  if he could be murdered by himself why hang those that would hinder it exclaimed a third  he should be tried said a fourth for conspiring his own death and hanged in terrorem  in the meanwhile sir geoffrey his son and their little companion left the hall intending to go to lady peverils lodgings which had been removed to fleet street she had been relieved from considerable inconvenience as sir geoffrey gave julian hastily to understand by an angel in the shape of a young friend and she now expected them doubtless with impatience humanity and some indistinct idea of having unintentionally hurt the feelings of the poor dwarf induced the honest cavalier to ask this unprotected being to go with them he knew lady peverils lodgings were but small he said but it would be strange if there was not some cupboard large enough to accommodate the little gentleman  the dwarf registered this wellmeant remark in his mind to be the subject of a proper explanation along with the unhappy reminiscence of the trencherhornpipe whenever time should permit an argument of such nicety  and thus they sallied from the hall attracting general observation both from the circumstances in which they had stood so lately and from their resemblance as a wag of the inner temple expressed it to the three degrees of comparison large lesser least but they had not passed far along the street when julian perceived that more malevolent passions than mere curiosity began to actuate the crowd which followed and as it were dogged their motions  there go the papist cutthroats tantivy for rome said one fellow  tantivy to whitehall you mean said another  ah the bloodthirsty villains cried a woman shame one of them should be suffered to live after poor sir edmondsburys cruel murder  out upon the mealymouthed jury that turned out the bloodhounds on an innocent town cried a fourth  in short the tumult thickened and the word began to pass among the more desperate lambe them lads lambe thema cant phrase of the time derived from the fate of dr lambe an astrologer and quack who was knocked on the head by the rabble in charles the firsts time  julian began to be much alarmed at these symptoms of violence and regretted that they had not gone down to the city by water it was now too late to think of that mode of retreating and he therefore requested his father in a whisper to walk steadily forward towards charing cross taking no notice of the insults which might be cast upon them while the steadiness of their pace and appearance might prevent the rabble from resorting to actual violence the execution of this prudent resolution was prevented after they had passed the palace by the hasty disposition of the elder sir geoffrey and the no less choleric temper of galfridus minimus who had a soul which spurned all odds as well of numbers as of size  now a murrain take the knaves with their hollowing and whooping said the large knight by this day if i could but light on a weapon i would cudgel reason and loyalty into some of their carcasses  and i also said the dwarf who was toiling to keep up with the longer strides of his companions and therefore spoke in a very phthisical tonei also will cudgel the plebeian knaves beyond measurehehem  among the crowd who thronged around them impeded and did all but assault them was a mischievous shoemakers apprentice who hearing this unlucky vaunt of the valorous dwarf repaid it by flapping him on the head with a boot which he was carrying home to the owner so as to knock the little gentlemans hat over his eyes the dwarf thus rendered unable to discover the urchin that had given him the offence flew with instinctive ambition against the biggest fellow in the crowd who received the onset with a kick on the stomach which made the poor little champion reel back to his companions they were now assaulted on all sides but fortune complying with the wish of sir geoffrey the larger ordained that the scuffle should happen near the booth of a cutler from amongst whose wares as they stood exposed to the public sir geoffrey peveril snatched a broadsword which he brandished with the formidable address of one who had for many a day been in the familiar practice of using such a weapon julian while at the same time he called loudly for a peaceofficer and reminded the assailants that they were attacking inoffensive passengers saw nothing better for it than to imitate his fathers example and seized also one of the weapons thus opportunely offered  when they displayed these demonstrations of defence the rush which the rabble at first made towards them was so great as to throw down the unfortunate dwarf who would have been trampled to death in the scuffle had not his stout old namesake cleared the rascal crowd from about him with a few flourishes of his weapon and seizing on the fallen champion put him out of danger except from missiles by suddenly placing him on the bulkhead that is to say the flat wooden roof of the cutlers projecting booth from the rusty ironware which was displayed there the dwarf instantly snatched an old rapier and target and covering himself with the one stood making passes with the other at the faces and eyes of the people in the street so much delighted with his post of vantage that he called loudly to his friends who were skirmishing with the riotous on more equal terms as to position to lose no time in putting themselves under his protection but far from being in a situation to need his assistance the father and son might easily have extricated themselves from the rabble by their own exertions could they have thought of leaving the mannikin in the forlorn situation in which to every eye but his own he stood like a diminutive puppet tricked out with sword and target as a fencingmasters sign  stones and sticks began now to fly very thick and the crowd notwithstanding the exertions of the peverils to disperse them with as little harm as possible seemed determined on mischief when some gentlemen who had been at the trial understanding that the prisoners who had been just acquitted were in danger of being murdered by the populace drew their swords and made forward to effect their rescue which was completed by a small party of the kings life guards who had been despatched from their ordinary post of alarm upon intelligence of what was passing when this unexpected reinforcement arrived the old jolly knight at once recognised amidst the cries of those who then entered upon action some of the sounds which had animated his more active years  where be these cuckoldly roundheads cried somedown with the sneaking knaves cried othersthe king and his friends and the devil a one else exclaimed a third set with more oaths and dn mes than in the present more correct age it is necessary to commit to paper  the old soldier pricking up his ears like an ancient hunter at the cry of the hounds would gladly have scoured the strand with the charitable purpose now he saw himself so well supported of knocking the london knaves who had insulted him into twiggen bottles but he was withheld by the prudence of julian who though himself extremely irritated by the unprovoked illusage which they had received saw himself in a situation in which it was necessary to exercise more caution than vengeance he prayed and pressed his father to seek some temporary place of retreat from the fury of the populace while that prudent measure was yet in their power the subaltern officer who commanded the party of the life guards exhorted the old cavalier eagerly to the same sage counsel using as a spice of compulsion the name of the king while julian strongly urged that of his mother the old knight looked at his blade crimsoned with crosscuts and slashes which he had given to the most forward of the assailants with the eye of one not half sufficed  i would i had pinked one of the knaves at leastbut i know not how it was when i looked on their broad round english faces i shunned to use my point and only sliced the rogues a little  but the kings pleasure said the officer is that no tumult be prosecuted  my mother said julian will die with fright if the rumour of this scuffle reaches her ere we see her  ay ay said the knight the kings majesty and my good damewell their pleasure be done thats all i can saykings and ladies must be obeyed but which way to retreat since retreat we must  julian would have been at some loss to advise what course to take for everybody in the vicinity had shut up their shops and chained their doors upon observing the confusion become so formidable the poor cutler however with whose goods they made so free offered them an asylum on the part of his landlord whose house served as a rest for his shop and only intimated gently he hoped the gentleman would consider him for the use of his weapons  julian was hastily revolving whether they ought in prudence to accept this mans invitation aware by experience how many trepans as they were then termed were used betwixt two contending factions each too inveterate to be very scrupulous of the character of fair play to an enemy when the dwarf exerting his cracked voice to the uttermost and shrieking like an exhausted herald from the exalted station which he still occupied on the bulkhead exhorted them to accept the offer of the worthy man of the mansion he himself he said as he reposed himself after the glorious conquest in which he had some share had been favoured with a beatific vision too splendid to be described to common and mere mortal ears but which had commanded him in a voice to which his heart had bounded as to a trumpet sound to take refuge with the worthy person of the house and cause his friends to do so  vision said the knight of the peaksound of a trumpetthe little man is stark mad  but the cutler in great haste intimated to them that their little friend had received an intimation from a gentlewoman of his acquaintance who spoke to him from the window while he stood on the bulkhead that they would find a safe retreat in his landlords and desiring them to attend to two or three deep though distant huzzas made them aware that the rabble were up still and would soon be upon them with renewed violence and increased numbers  the father and son therefore hastily thanked the officer and his party as well as the other gentlemen who had volunteered in their assistance lifted little sir geoffrey hudson from the conspicuous post which he had so creditably occupied during the skirmish and followed the footsteps of the tenant of the booth who conducted them down a blind alley and through one or two courts in case as he said any one might have watched where they burrowed and so into a backdoor this entrance admitted them to a staircase carefully hung with straw mats to exclude damp from the upper step of which they entered upon a tolerably large withdrawingroom hung with coarse green serge edged with gilded leather which the poorer or more economical citizens at that time use instead of tapestry or wainscoting  here the poor cutler received from julian such a gratuity for the loan of the swords that he generously abandoned the property to the gentlemen who had used them so well the rather he said that he saw by the way they handed their weapons that they were men of mettle and tall fellows  here the dwarf smiled on him courteously and bowed thrusting at the same time his hand into his pocket which however he withdrew carelessly probably because he found he had not the means of making the small donation which he had meditated  the cutler proceeded to say as he bowed and was about to withdraw that he saw there would be merry days yet in old england and that bilboa blades would fetch as good a price as ever i remember he said gentlemen though i was then but a prentice the demand for weapons in the years fortyone and fortytwo sword blades were more in request than toothpicks and old ironsides my master took more for rascally provant rapiers than i dare ask nowadays for a toledo but to be sure a mans life then rested on the blade he carried the cavaliers and roundheads fought every day at the gates of whitehall as it is like gentlemen by your good example they may do again when i shall be enabled to leave my pitiful booth and open a shop of better quality i hope you will recommend me gentlemen to your friends i am always provided with ware which a gentleman may risk his life on  thank you good friend said julian i prithee begone i trust we shall need thy ware no more for some time at least  the cutler retired while the dwarf hollowed after him downstairs that he would call on him soon and equip himself with a longer blade and one more proper for action although he said the little weapon he had did well enough for a walkingsword or in a skirmish with such canaille as they had been engaged with  the cutler returned at this summons and agreed to pleasure the little man with a weapon more suitable to his magnanimity then as if the thought had suddenly occurred to him he said but gentlemen it will be wild work to walk with your naked swords through the strand and it can scarce fail to raise the rabble again if you please while you repose yourselves here i can fit the blades with sheaths  the proposal seemed so reasonable that julian and his father gave up their weapons to the friendly cutler an example which the dwarf followed after a moments hesitation not caring as he magnificently expressed it to part so soon with the trusty friend which fortune had but the moment before restored to his hand the man retired with the weapons under his arm and in shutting the door behind him they heard him turn the key  did you hear that said sir geoffrey to his sonand we are disarmed  julian without reply examined the door which was fast secured and then looked at the casements which were at a storeys height from the ground and grated besides with iron i cannot think he said after a moments pause that the fellow means to trepan us and in any event i trust we should have no difficulty in forcing the door or otherwise making escape but before resorting to such violent measures i think it is better to give the rabble leisure to disperse by waiting this mans return with our weapons within a reasonable time when if he does not appear i trust we shall find little difficulty in extricating ourselves as he spoke thus the hangings were pulled aside and from a small door which was concealed behind them major bridgenorth entered the room     chapter xliii              he came amongst them like a new raised spirit             to speak of dreadful judgments that impend             and of the wrath to come                                                the reformer  the astonishment of julian at the unexpected apparition of bridgenorth was instantly succeeded by apprehension of his fathers violence which he had every reason to believe would break forth against one whom he himself could not but reverence on account of his own merits as well as because he was the father of alice the appearance of bridgenorth was not however such as to awaken resentment his countenance was calm his step slow and composed his eye not without the indication of some deepseated anxiety but without any expression either of anger or of triumph you are welcome he said sir geoffrey peveril to the shelter and hospitality of this house as welcome as you would have been in other days when we called each other neighbours and friends  odzooks said the old cavalier and had i known it was thy house man i would sooner had my hearts blood run down the kennel than my foot should have crossed your thresholdin the way of seeking safety that is  i forgive your inveteracy said major bridgenorth on account of your prejudices  keep your forgiveness answered the cavalier until you are pardoned yourself by saint george i have sworn if ever i got my heels out of yon rascally prison whither i was sent much through your means master bridgenorththat you should pay the reckoning for my bad lodgingi will strike no man in his own house but if you will cause the fellow to bring back my weapon and take a turn in that blind court there below along with me you shall soon see what chance a traitor hath with a true man and a kennelblooded puritan with peveril of the peak  bridgenorth smiled with much composure when i was younger and more warmblooded he replied i refused your challenge sir geoffrey it is not likely i should now accept it when each is within a stride of the grave i have not spared and will not spare my blood when my country wants it  that is when there is any chance of treason against the king said sir geoffrey  nay my father said julian let us hear master bridgenorth we have been sheltered in his house and although we now see him in london we should remember that he did not appear against us this day when perhaps his evidence might have given a fatal turn to our situation  you are right young man said bridgenorth and it should be some pledge of my sincere goodwill that i was this day absent from westminster when a few words from my mouth had ended the long line of peveril of the peak it needed but ten minutes to walk to westminster hall to have ensured your condemnation but could i have done this knowing as i now know that to thee julian peveril i owe the extrication of my daughterof my dearest alicethe memory of her departed motherfrom the snares which hell and profligacy had opened around her  she is i trust safe said peveril eagerly and almost forgetting his fathers presence she is i trust safe and in your own wardship  not in mine said the dejected father but in that of one in whose protection next to that of heaven i can most fully confide  are you sureare you very sure of that repeated julian eagerly i found her under the charge of one to whom she had been trusted and who yet  and who yet was the basest of women answered bridgenorth but he who selected her for the charge was deceived in her character  say rather you were deceived in his remember that when we parted in moultrassie i warned you of that ganlessethat  i know your meaning said bridgenorth nor did you err in describing him as a worldlywise man but he has atoned for his error by recovering alice from the dangers into which she has plunged when separated from you and besides i have not thought meet again to entrust him with the charge that is dearest to me  i thank god your eyes are thus far opened said julian  this day will open them wide or close them for ever answered bridgenorth  during this dialogue which the speakers hurried through without attending to the others who were present sir geoffrey listened with surprise and eagerness endeavouring to catch something which should render their conversation intelligible but as he totally failed in gaining any such key to their meaning he broke in withsblood and thunder julian what unprofitable gossip is this what hast thou to do with this fellow more than to bastinado him if you should think it worth while to beat so old a rogue  my dearest father said julian you know not this gentlemani am certain you do him injustice my own obligations to him are many and i am sure when you come to know them  i hope i shall die ere that moment come said sir geoffrey and continued with increasing violence i hope in the mercy of heaven that i shall be in the grave of my ancestors ere i learn that my sonmy only sonthe last hope of my ancient housethe last remnant of the name of peverilhath consented to receive obligations from the man on earth i am most bound to hate were i not still more bound to contemn himdegenerate dogwhelp he repeated with great vehemence you colour without replying speak and disown such disgrace or by the god of my fathers  the dwarf suddenly stepped forward and called out forbear with a voice at once so discordant and commanding that it sounded supernatural man of sin and pride he said forbear and call not the name of a holy god to witness thine unhallowed resentments  the rebuke so boldly and decidedly given and the moral enthusiasm with which he spoke gave the despised dwarf an ascendancy for the moment over the fiery spirit of his gigantic namesake sir geoffrey peveril eyed him for an instant askance and shyly as he might have done a supernatural apparition and then muttered what knowest thou of my cause of wrath  nothing said the dwarfnothing but thisthat no cause can warrant the oath thou wert about to swear ungrateful man thou wert today rescued from the devouring wrath of the wicked by a marvellous conjunction of circumstancesis this a day thinkest thou on which to indulge thine own hasty resentments  i stand rebuked said sir geoffrey and by a singular monitorthe grasshopper as the prayerbook saith hath become a burden to mejulian i will speak to thee of these matters hereafterand for you master bridgenorth i desire to have no farther communication with you either in peace or in anger our time passes fast and i would fain return to my family cause our weapons to be restored unbar the doors and let us part without farther altercation which can but disturb and aggravate our spirits  sir geoffrey peveril said bridgenorth i have no desire to vex your spirit or my own but for thus soon dismissing you that may hardly be it being a course inconsistent with the work which i have on hand  how sir do you mean that we should abide here whether with or against our inclinations said the dwarf were it not that i am laid under charge to remain here by one who hath the best right to command this poor microcosm i would show thee that bolts and bars are unavailing restraints on such as i am  truly said sir geoffrey i think upon an emergency the little man might make his escape through the keyhole  bridgenorths face was moved into something like a smile at the swaggering speech of the pigmy hero and the contemptuous commentary of sir geoffrey peveril but such an expression never dwelt on his features for two seconds together and he replied in these wordsgentlemen each and all of you must be fain to content yourselves believe me no hurt is intended towards you on the contrary your remaining here will be a means of securing your safety which would be otherwise deeply endangered it will be your own fault if a hair of your head is hurt but the stronger force is on my side and whatever harm you may meet with should you attempt to break forth by violence the blame must rest with yourselves it you will not believe me i will permit master julian peveril to accompany me where he shall see that i am provided fully with the means of repressing violence  treasontreason exclaimed the old knighttreason against god and king charlesoh for one halfhour of the broadsword which i parted with like an ass  hold my father i conjure you said julian i will go with master bridgenorth since he requests it i will satisfy myself whether there be danger and of what nature it is possible i may prevail on him to desist from some desperate measure if such be indeed in agitation should it be necessary fear not that your son will behave as he ought to do  do your pleasure julian said his father i will confide in thee but if you betray my confidence a fathers curse shall cleave to you  bridgenorth now motioned to peveril to follow him and they passed through the small door by which he entered  the passage led to a vestibule or anteroom in which several other doors and passages seemed to centre through one of these julian was conducted by bridgenorth walking with silence and precaution in obedience to a signal made by his guide to that effect as they advanced he heard sounds like those of the human voice engaged in urgent and emphatic declamation with slow and light steps bridgenorth conducted him through a door which terminated this passage and as he entered a little gallery having a curtain in front the sound of the preachers voicefor such it now seemedbecame distinct and audible  julian now doubted not that he was in one of those conventicles which though contrary to the existing laws still continued to be regularly held in different parts of london and the suburbs many of these as frequented by persons of moderate political principles though dissenters from the church for conscience sake were connived at by the prudence or timidity of the government but some of them in which assembled the fiercer and more exalted sects of independents anabaptists fifthmonarchy men and other sectaries whose stern enthusiasm had contributed so greatly to effect the overthrow of the late kings throne were sought after suppressed and dispersed whenever they could be discovered  julian was soon satisfied that the meeting into which he was thus secretly introduced was one of the latter class and to judge by the violence of the preacher of the most desperate character he was still more effectually convinced of this when at a sign from bridgenorth he cautiously unclosed a part of the curtain which hung before the gallery and thus unseen himself looked down on the audience and obtained a view of the preacher  about two hundred persons were assembled beneath in an area filled up with benches as if for the exercise of worship and they were all of the male sex and well armed with pikes and muskets as well as swords and pistols most of them had the appearance of veteran soldiers now past the middle of life yet retaining such an appearance of strength as might well supply the loss of youthful agility they stood or sat in various attitudes of stern attention and resting on their spears and muskets kept their eyes firmly fixed on the preacher who ended the violence of his declamation by displaying from the pulpit a banner on which was represented a lion with the motto vicit leo ex tribu judæ  the torrent of mystical yet animating eloquence of the preacheran old greyhaired man whom zeal seemed to supply with the powers of voice and action of which years had deprived himwas suited to the taste of his audience but could not be transferred to these pages without scandal and impropriety he menaced the rulers of england with all the judgments denounced on those of moab and assyriahe called upon the saints to be strong to be up and doing and promised those miracles which in the campaigns of joshua and his successors the valiant judges of israel supplied all odds against the amorites midianites and philistines he sounded trumpets opened vials broke seals and denounced approaching judgments under all the mystical signs of the apocalypse the end of the world was announced accompanied with all its preliminary terrors  julian with deep anxiety soon heard enough to make him aware that the meeting was likely to terminate in open insurrection like that of the fifthmonarchy men under venner at an earlier period of charless reign and he was not a little concerned at the probability of bridgenorth being implicated in so criminal and desperate an undertaking if he had retained any doubts of the issue of the meeting they must have been removed when the preacher called on his hearers to renounce all expectation which had hitherto been entertained of safety to the nation from the execution of the ordinary laws of the land this he said was at best but a carnal seeking after earthly aida going down to egypt for help which the jealousy of their divine leader would resent as a fleeing to another rock and a different banner from that which was this day displayed over themand here he solemnly swung the bannered lion over their heads as the only sign under which they ought to seek for life and safety he then proceeded to insist that recourse to ordinary justice was vain as well as sinful  the event of that day at westminster he said might teach them that the man at whitehall was even as the man his father and closed a long tirade against the vices of the court with assurance that tophet was ordained of oldfor the king it was made hot  as the preacher entered on a description of the approaching theocracy which he dared to prophesy bridgenorth who appeared for a time to have forgotten the presence of julian whilst with stern and fixed attention he drunk in the words of the preacher seemed suddenly to collect himself and taking julian by the hand led him out of the gallery of which he carefully closed the door into an apartment at no great distance  when they arrived there he anticipated the expostulations of julian by asking him in a tone of severe triumph whether these men he had seen were likely to do their work negligently or whether it would not be perilous to attempt to force their way from a house when all the avenues were guarded by such as he had now seenmen of war from their childhood upwards  in the name of heaven said julian without replying to bridgenorths question for what desperate purpose have you assembled so many desperate men i am well aware that your sentiments of religion are peculiar but beware how you deceive yourselfno views of religion can sanction rebellion and murder and such are the natural and necessary consequences of the doctrine we have just heard poured into the ears of fanatical and violent enthusiasts  my son said bridgenorth calmly in the days of my nonage i thought as you do i deemed it sufficient to pay my tithes of cummin and aniseedmy poor petty moral observances of the old law and i thought i was heaping up precious things when they were in value no more than the husks of the swinetrough praised be heaven the scales are fallen from mine eyes and after forty years wandering in the desert of sinai i am at length arrived in the land of promisemy corrupt human nature has left mei have cast my slough and can now with some conscience put my hand to the plough certain that there is no weakness left in me wherethrough i may look back the furrows he added bending his brows while a gloomy fire filled his large eyes must be drawn long and deep and watered by the blood of the mighty  there was a change in bridgenorths tone and manner when he used these singular expressions which convinced julian that his mind which had wavered for so many years between his natural good sense and the insane enthusiasm of the time had finally given way to the latter and sensible of the danger in which the unhappy man himself the innocent and beautiful alice and his own father were likely to be placedto say nothing of the general risk of the community by a sudden insurrection he at the same time felt that there was no chance of reasoning effectually with one who would oppose spiritual conviction to all arguments which reason could urge against his wild schemes to touch his feeling seemed a more probable resource and julian therefore conjured bridgenorth to think how much his daughters honour and safety were concerned in his abstaining from the dangerous course which he meditated if you fall he said must she not pass under the power and guardianship of her uncle whom you allow to have shown himself capable of the grossest mistake in the choice of her female protectress and whom i believe upon good grounds to have made that infamous choice with his eyes open  young man answered bridgenorth you make me feel like the poor bird around whose wing some wanton boy has fixed a line to pull the struggling wretch to earth at his pleasure know since thou wilt play this cruel part and drag me down from higher contemplations that she with whom alice is placed and who hath in future full power to guide her motions and decide her fate despite of christian and every one else isi will not tell thee who she isenoughno onethou least of all needs to fear for her safety  at this moment a sidedoor opened and christian himself came into the apartment he started and coloured when he saw julian peveril then turning to bridgenorth with an assumed air of indifference asked is saul among the prophetsis a peveril among the saints  no brother replied bridgenorth his time is not come more than thine ownthou art too deep in the ambitious intrigues of manhood and he in the giddy passions of youth to hear the still calm voiceyou will both hear it as i trust and pray  master ganlesse or christian or by whatever name you are called said julian by whatever reasons you guide yourself in this most perilous matter you at least are not influenced by any idea of an immediate divine command for commencing hostilities against the state leaving therefore for the present whatever subjects of discussion may be between us i implore you as a man of shrewdness and sense to join with me in dissuading master bridgenorth from the fatal enterprise which he now meditates  young gentleman said christian with great composure when we met in the west i was willing to have made a friend of you but you rejected the overture you might however even then have seen enough of me to be assured that i am not likely to rush too rashly on any desperate undertaking as to this which lies before us my brother bridgenorth brings to it the simplicity though not the harmlessness of the dove and i the subtilty of the serpent he hath the leading of saints who are moved by the spirit and i can add to their efforts a powerful body who have for their instigators the world the devil and the flesh  and can you said julian looking at bridgenorth accede to such an unworthy union  i unite not with them said bridgenorth but i may not without guilt reject the aid which providence sends to assist his servants we are ourselves few though determinedthose whose swords come to help the cutting down of the harvest must be welcomewhen their work is wrought they will be converted or scatteredhave you been at york place brother with that unstable epicure we must have his last resolution and that within an hour  christian looked at julian as if his presence prevented him from returning an answer upon which bridgenorth arose and taking the young man by the arm led him out of the apartment into that in which they had left his father assuring him by the way that determined and vigilant guards were placed in every different quarter by which escape could be effected and that he would do well to persuade his father to remain a quiet prisoner for a few hours  julian returned him no answer and bridgenorth presently retired leaving him alone with his father and hudson to their questions he could only briefly reply that he feared they were trepanned since they were in the house with at least two hundred fanatics completely armed and apparently prepared for desperate enterprise their own want of arms precluded the possibility of open violence and however unpleasant it might be to remain in such a condition it seemed difficult from the strength of the fastenings at doors and windows to attempt any secret escape without instantaneous detection  the valiant dwarf alone nursed hopes with which he in vain endeavoured to inspire his companions in affliction the fair one whose eyes he said were like the twin stars of ledafor the little man was a great admirer of lofty languagehad not invited him the most devoted and it might be not the least favoured of her servants into this place as a harbour in order that he might therein suffer shipwreck and he generously assured his friends that in his safety they also should be safe  sir geoffrey little cheered by this intimation expressed his despair at not being able to get the length of whitehall where he trusted to find as many jolly cavaliers as would help him to stifle the whole nest of wasps in their hive while julian was of opinion that the best service he could now render bridgenorth would be timeously to disclose his plot and if possible to send him at the same time warning to save his person  but we must leave them to meditate over their plans at leisure no one of which as they all depended on their previous escape from confinement seemed in any great chance of being executed     chapter xliv           and some for safety took the dreadful leap          some for the voice of heaven seemd calling on them          some for advancement or for lucres sake          i leapd in frolic                                                   the dream  after a private conversation with bridgenorth christian hastened to the duke of buckinghams hotel taking at the same time such a route as to avoid meeting with any acquaintance he was ushered into the apartment of the duke whom he found cracking and eating filberts with a flask of excellent white wine at his elbow christian said his grace come help me to laughi have bit sir charles sedleyflung him for a thousand by the gods  i am glad at your luck my lord duke replied christian but i am come here on serious business  seriouswhy i shall hardly be serious in my life againha ha haand for luck it was no such thingsheer wit and excellent contrivance and but that i dont care to affront fortune like the old greek general i might tell her to her facein this thou hadst no share you have heard ned christian that mother cresswell is dead  yes i did hear that the devil hath got his due answered christian  well said the duke you are ungrateful for i know you have been obliged to her as well as others before george a most benevolent and helpful old lady and that she might not sleep in an unblest grave i betteddo you mark mewith sedley that i would write her funeral sermon that it should be every word in praise of her life and conversation that it should be all true and yet that the diocesan should be unable to lay his thumb on quodling my little chaplain who should preach it  i perfectly see the difficulty my lord said christian who well knew that if he wished to secure attention from this volatile nobleman he must first suffer nay encourage him to exhaust the topic whatever it might be that had got temporary possession of his pineal gland  why said the duke i had caused my little quodling to go through his oration thusthat whatever evil reports had passed current during the lifetime of the worthy matron whom they had restored to dust that day malice herself could not deny that she was born well married well lived well and died well since she was born in shadwell married to cresswell lived in camberwell and died in bridewell here ended the oration and with it sedleys ambitious hopes of overreaching buckinghamha ha haand now master christian what are your commands for me today  first to thank your grace for being so attentive as to send so formidable a person as colonel blood to wait upon your poor friend and servant faith he took such an interest in my leaving town that he wanted to compel me to do it at point of fox so i was obliged to spill a little of his malapert blood your graces swordsmen have had ill luck of late and it is hard since you always choose the best hands and such scrupleless knaves too  come now christian said the duke do not thus exult over me a great man if i may so call myself is never greater than amid miscarriage i only played this little trick on you christian to impress on you a wholesome idea of the interest i take in your motions the scoundrels having dared to draw upon you is a thing not to be forgivenwhat injure my old friend christian  and why not said christian coolly if your old friend was so stubborn as not to go out of town like a good boy when your grace required him to do so for the civil purpose of entertaining his niece in his absence  howwhathow do you mean by my entertaining your niece master christian said the duke she was a personage far beyond my poor attentions being destined if i recollect aright to something like royal favour  it was her fate however to be the guest of your graces convent for a brace of days or so marry my lord the father confessor was not at home andfor convents have been scaled of latereturned not till the bird was flown  christian thou art an old reynardi see there is no doubling with thee it was thou then that stole away my pretty prize but left me something so much prettier in my mind that had it not made itself wings to fly away with i would have placed it in a cage of gold never be downcast man i forgive theei forgive thee  your grace is of a most merciful disposition especially considering it is i who have had the wrong and sages have said that he who doth the injury is less apt to forgive than he who only sustains it  true true christian said the duke which as you say is something quite new and places my clemency in a striking point of view well then thou forgiven man when shall i see my mauritanian princess again  wherever i am certain that a quibble and a carwhichit for a play or a sermon will not banish her from your graces memory  not all the wit of south or of etherege said buckingham hastily to say nothing of my own shall in future make me oblivious of what i owe the morisco princess  yet to leave the fair lady out of thought for a little whilea very little while said christian since i swear that in due time your grace shall see her and know in her the most extraordinary woman that the age has producedto leave her i say out of sight for a little while has your grace had late notice of your duchesss health  health said the duke umphnonothing particular she has been illbut  she is no longer so subjoined christian she died in yorkshire fortyeight hours since  thou must deal with the devil said the duke  it would ill become one of my name to do so replied christian but in the brief interval since your grace hath known of an event which hath not yet reached the public ear you have i believe made proposals to the king for the hand of the lady anne second daughter of the duke of york and your graces proposals have been rejected  fiends and firebrands villain said the duke starting up and seizing christian by the collar who hath told thee that  take your hand from my cloak my lord duke and i may answer you said christian i have a scurvy touch of old puritanical humour about me i abide not the imposition of handstake off your grasp from my cloak or i will find means to make you unloose it  the duke who had kept his right hand on his daggerhilt while he held christians collar with his left unloosed it as he spoke but slowly and as one who rather suspends than abandons the execution of some hasty impulse while christian adjusting his cloak with perfect composure said sohmy cloak being at liberty we speak on equal terms i come not to insult your grace but to offer you vengeance for the insult you have received  vengeance said the dukeit is the dearest proffer man can present to me in my present mood i hunger for vengeancethirst for vengeancecould die to ensure vengeancesdeath he continued walking up and down the large apartment with the most unrestrained and violent agitation i have chased this repulse out of my brain with ten thousand trifles because i thought no one knew it but it is known and to thee the very commonsewer of courtsecretsthe honour of villiers is in thy keeping ned christian speak thou man of wiles and of intrigueon whom dost thou promise the vengeance speak and if thy answers meet my desires i will make a bargain with thee as willingly as with thy master satan himself  i will not be said christian so unreasonable in my terms as stories tell of the old apostate i will offer your grace as he might do temporal prosperity and revenge which is his frequent recruiting money but i leave it to yourself to provide as you may be pleased for your future salvation  the duke gazing upon him fixedly and sadly replied i would to god christian that i could read what purpose of damnable villainy thou hast to propose to me in thy countenance without the necessity of thy using words  your grace can but try a guess said christian calmly smiling  no replied the duke after gazing at him again for the space of a minute thou art so deeply dyed a hypocrite that thy mean features and clear grey eye are as likely to conceal treason as any petty scheme of theft or larceny more corresponding to your degree  treason my lord echoed christian you may have guessed more nearly than you were aware of i honour your graces penetration  treason echoed the duke who dare name such a crime to me  if a name startles your grace you may call it vengeancevengeance on the cabal of councillors who have ever countermined you in spite of your wit and your interest with the kingvengeance on arlington ormondon charles himself  no by heaven said the duke resuming his disordered walk through the apartmentvengeance on these rats of the privy councilcome at it as you will but the kingnevernever i have provoked him a hundred times where he has stirred me once i have crossed his path in state intriguerivalled him in lovehad the advantage in bothand dn it he has forgiven me if treason would put me in his throne i have no apology for itit were worse than bestial ingratitude  nobly spoken my lord said christian and consistent alike with the obligations under which your grace lies to charles stewart and the sense you have ever shown of thembut it signifies not if your grace patronise not our enterprise there is shaftesburythere is monmouth  scoundrel exclaimed the duke even more vehemently agitated than before think you that you shall carry on with others an enterprise which i have refusedno by every heathen and every christian godhark ye christian i will arrest you on the spoti will by gods and devils and carry you to unravel your plot at whitehall  where the first words i speak answered the imperturbable christian will be to inform the privy council in what place they may find certain letters wherewith your grace has honoured your poor vassal containing as i think particulars which his majesty will read with more surprise than pleasure  sdeath villain said the duke once more laying his hand on his poniardhilt thou hast me again at advantage i know not why i forbear to poniard you where you stand  i might fall my lord duke said christian slightly colouring and putting his right hand into his bosom though not i think unavengedfor i have not put my person into this peril altogether without means of defence i might fall but alas your graces correspondence is in hands which by that very act would be rendered sufficiently active in handing them to the king and the privy council what say you to the moorish princess my lord duke what if i have left her executrix of my will with certain instructions how to proceed if i return not unharmed from york place oh my lord though my head is in the wolfs mouth i was not goose enough to place it there without settling how many carabines should be fired on the wolf so soon as my dying cackle was heardpshaw my lord duke you deal with a man of sense and courage yet you speak to him as a child and a coward  the duke threw himself into a chair fixed his eyes on the ground and spoke without raising them i am about to call jerningham he said but fear nothingit is only for a draught of winethat stuff on the table may be a vehicle of filberts and walnuts but not for such communications as yoursbring me champagne he said to the attendant who answered to his summons  the domestic returned and brought a flask of champagne with two large silver cups one of them he filled for buckingham who contrary to the usual etiquette was always served first at home and then offered the other to christian who declined to receive it  the duke drank off the large goblet which was presented to him and for a moment covered his forehead with the palm of his hand then instantly withdrew it and said christian speak your errand plainly we know each other if my reputation be in some degree in your hands you are well aware that your life is in mine sit down he said taking a pistol from his bosom and laying it on the tablesit down and let me hear your proposal  my lord said christian smiling i shall produce no such ultimate argument on my part though possibly in time of need i may not be found destitute of them but my defence is in the situation of things and in the composed view which doubtless your majesty will take of them  majesty repeated the dukemy good friend christian you have kept company with the puritans so long that you confuse the ordinary titles of the court  i know not how to apologise said christian unless your grace will suppose that i spoke by prophecy  such as the devil delivered to macbeth said the dukeagain paced the chamber and again seated himself and said be plain christianspeak out at once and manfully what is it you intend  i said christianwhat should i doi can do nothing in such a matter but i thought it right that your grace should know that the godly of this cityhe spoke the word with a kind of ironical grinare impatient of inactivity and must needs be up and doing my brother bridgenorth is at the head of all old weivers congregation for you must know that after floundering from one faith to another he hath now got beyond ordinances and is become a fifthmonarchy man he has nigh two hundred of weivers people fully equipped and ready to fall on and with slight aid from your graces people they must carry whitehall and make prisoners of all within it  rascal said the duke and is it to a peer of england you make this communication  nay answered christian i admit it would be extreme folly in your grace to appear until all is over but let me give blood and the others a hint on your part there are the four germans alsoright knipperdolings and anabaptistswill be specially useful you are wise my lord and know the value of a corps of domestic gladiators as well as did octavius lepidus and anthony when by such family forces they divided the world by indenture tripartite  stay stay said the duke even if these bloodhounds were to join with younot that i would permit it without the most positive assurances for the kings personal safetybut say the villains were to join what hope have you of carrying the court  bully tom armstrong my lord hath promised his interest with the life guards then there are my lord shaftesburys brisk boys in the citythirty thousand on the holding up a finger   thomas or sir thomas armstrong a person who had distinguished     himself in youth by duels and drunken exploits he was     particularly connected with the duke of monmouth and was said to     be concerned in the ryehouse plot for which he suffered capital     punishment 20th june 1684  let him hold up both hands and if he count a hundred for each finger said the duke it will be more than i expect you have not spoken to him  surely not till your graces pleasure was known but if he is not applied to there is the dutch train hans snorehouts congregation in the strandthere are the french protestants in piccadillythere are the family of levi in lewkenors lanethe muggletonians in thames street  ah faughout upon themout upon themhow the knaves will stink of cheese and tobacco when they come upon actionthey will drown all the perfumes in whitehall spare me the detail and let me know my dearest ned the sum total of thy most odoriferous forces  fifteen hundred men well armed said christian besides the rabble that will rise to a certaintythey have already nearly torn to pieces the prisoners who were this day acquitted on account of the plot  all then i understandand now hark ye most christian christian said he wheeling his chair full in front of that on which his agent was seated you have told me many things todayshall i be equally communicative shall i show you that my accuracy of information matches yours shall i tell you in a word why you have at once resolved to push every one from the puritan to the freethinker upon a general attack of the palace of whitehall without allowing me a peer of the realm time either to pause upon or to prepare for a step so desperate shall i tell you why you would lead or drive seduce or compel me into countenancing your measures  my lord if you please to form a guess said christian i will answer with all sincerity if you have assigned the right cause  the countess of derby is this day arrived and attends the court this evening with hopes of the kindest reception she may be surprised amid the mêléeha said i not right master christian you who pretend to offer me revenge know yourself its exquisite sweetness  i would not presume said christian half smiling to offer your grace a dish without acting as your taster as well as purveyor  thats honestly said said the duke away then my friend give blood this ringhe knows it and knows how to obey him who bears it let him assemble my gladiators as thou dost most wittily term my coup jarrets the old scheme of the german music may be resorted to for i think thou hast the instruments ready but take notice i know nothing ont and rowleys person must be safei will hang and burn on all hands if a hair of his black periwig be but singedthen what is to followa lord protector of the realmor staycromwell has made the word somewhat slovenly and unpopulara lord lieutenant of the kingdomthe patriots who take it on themselves to avenge the injustice done to the country and to remove evil counsellors from before the kings throne that it may be henceforward established in righteousnessso i think the rubric runscannot fail to make a fitting choice   charles to suit his dark complexion always wore a black peruke     he used to say of the players that if they wished to represent a     villain on the stage oddsfish they always clappd on him a     black periwig whereas the greatest rogue in england meaning     probably dr oates wears a white onesee cibbers apology  they cannot my lord duke said christian since there is but one man in the three kingdoms on whom that choice can possibly fall  i thank you christian said his grace and i trust you away and make all ready be assured your services shall not be forgot we will have you near to us  my lord duke said christian you bind me doubly to you but remember that as your grace is spared any obnoxious proceedings which may befall in the way of military execution or otherwise so it will be advisable that you hold yourself in preparation upon a moments notice to put yourself at the head of a band of honourable friends and allies and come presently to the palace where you will be received by the victors as a commander and by the vanquished as a preserver  i conceive youi conceive you i will be in prompt readiness said the duke  ay my lord continued christian and for heavens sake let none of those toys which are the very delilahs of your imagination come across your grace this evening and interfere with the execution of this sublime scheme  why christian dost think me mad was his graces emphatic reply it is you who linger when all should be ordered for a deed so daring go thenbut hark ye ned ere you go tell me when i shall again see yonder thing of fire and airyon eastern peri that glides into apartments by the keyhole and leaves them through the casementyon blackeyed houri of the mahometan paradisewhen i say shall i see her once more  when your grace has the truncheon of lord lieutenant of the kingdom said christian and left the apartment  buckingham stood fixed in contemplation for a moment after he was gone should i have done this he said arguing the matter with himself or had i the choice rather of doing aught else should i not hasten to the court and make charles aware of the treason which besets him i will by heavenhere jerningham my coach with the despatch of lighti will throw myself at his feet and tell him of all the follies which i have dreamed of with this christianand then he will laugh at me and spurn meno i have kneeled to him today already and my repulse was nothing gentle to be spurned once in the suns daily round is enough for buckingham  having made this reflection he seated himself and began hastily to mark down the young nobles and gentlemen of quality and others their very ignoble companions who he supposed might be likely to assume him for their leader in any popular disturbance he had nearly completed it when jerningham entered to say the coach would be ready in an instant and to bring his masters sword hat and cloak  let the coachman draw off said the duke but be in readiness and send to the gentlemen thou wilt find named in this list say i am but ill at ease and wish their company to a light collation let instant expedition be made and care not for expense you will find most of them at the club house in fullers rents   the place of meeting of the green ribbon club their place of     meeting says roger north was in a sort of carrefour at     chancery lance in a centre of business and company most proper     for such anglers of fools the house was double balconied in     front as may yet be seen for the clubbers to issue forth in     fresco with hats and no perukes pipes in their mouths merry     faces and dilated throats for vocal encouragement of the     canaglia below on usual and unusual occasions  the preparations for festivity were speedily made and the intended guests most of them persons who were at leisure for any call that promised pleasure though sometimes more deaf to those of duty began speedily to assemble there were many youths of the highest rank and with them as is usual in those circles many of a different class whom talents or impudence or wit or a turn for gambling had reared up into companions for the great and the gay the duke of buckingham was a general patron of persons of this description and a numerous attendance took place on the present occasion  the festivity was pursued with the usual appliances of wine music and games of hazard with which however there mingled in that period much more wit and a good deal more gross profligacy of conversation than the talents of the present generation can supply or their taste would permit  the duke himself proved the complete command which he possessed over his versatile character by maintaining the frolic the laugh and the jest while his ear caught up and with eagerness the most distant sounds as intimating the commencement of christians revolutionary project such sounds were heard from time to time and from time to time they died away without any of those consequences which buckingham expected  at length and when it was late in the evening jerningham announced master chiffinch from the court and that worthy personage followed the annunciation  strange things have happened my lord duke he said your presence at court is instantly required by his majesty  you alarm me said buckingham standing up i hope nothing has happenedi hope there is nothing wrongi hope his majesty is well  perfectly well said chiffinch and desirous to see your grace without a moments delay  this is sudden said the duke you see i have had merry fellows about me and am scarce in case to appear chiffinch  your grace seems to be in very handsome plight said chiffinch and you know his majesty is gracious enough to make allowances  true said the duke not a little anxious in his mind touching the cause of this unexpected summonstruehis majesty is most graciousi will order my coach  mine is below replied the royal messenger it will save time if your grace will condescend to use it  forced from every evasion buckingham took a goblet from the table and requested his friends to remain at his palace so long as they could find the means of amusement there he expected he said to return almost immediately if not he would take farewell of them with his usual toast may all of us that are not hanged in the interval meet together again here on the first monday of next month  this standing toast of the duke bore reference to the character of several of his guests but he did not drink it on the present occasion without some anticipation concerning his own fate in case christian had betrayed him he hastily made some addition to his dress and attended chiffinch in the chariot to whitehall     chapter xlv             high feasting was there therethe gilded roofs            rung to the wassailhealththe dancers step            sprung to the chord responsivethe gay gamester            to fates disposal flung his heap of gold            and laughd alike when it increased or lessend            such virtue hath courtair to teach us patience            which schoolmen preach in vain                                        why come ye not to court  upon the afternoon of this eventful day charles held his court in the queens apartments which were opened at a particular hour to invited guests of a certain lower degree but accessible without restriction to the higher classes of nobility who had from birth and to the courtiers who held by office the privilege of the entrée  it was one part of charless character which unquestionably rendered him personally popular and postponed to a subsequent reign the precipitation of his family from the throne that he banished from his court many of the formal restrictions with which it was in other reigns surrounded he was conscious of the goodnatured grace of his manners and trusted to it often not in vain to remove evil impressions arising from actions which he was sensible could not be justified on the grounds of liberal or national policy  in the daytime the king was commonly seen in the public walks alone or only attended by one or two persons and his answer to the remonstrance of his brother on the risk of thus exposing his person is well knownbelieve me james he said no one will murder me to make you king  in the same manner charless evenings unless such as were destined to more secret pleasures were frequently spent amongst all who had any pretence to approach a courtly circle and thus it was upon the night which we are treating of queen catherine reconciled or humbled to her fate had long ceased to express any feelings of jealousy nay seemed so absolutely dead to such a passion that she received at her drawingroom without scruple and even with encouragement the duchesses of portsmouth and cleveland and others who enjoyed though in a less avowed character the credit of having been royal favourites constraint of every kind was banished from a circle so composed and which was frequented at the same time if not by the wisest at least by the wittiest courtiers who ever assembled round a monarch and who as many of them had shared the wants and shifts and frolics of his exile had then acquired a sort of prescriptive licence which the goodnatured prince when he attained his period of prosperity could hardly have restrained had it suited his temper to do so this however was the least of charless thoughts his manners were such as secured him from indelicate obtrusion and he sought no other protection from overfamiliarity than what these and his ready wit afforded him  on the present occasion he was peculiarly disposed to enjoy the scene of pleasure which had been prepared the singular death of major coleby which taking place in his own presence had proclaimed with the voice of a passing bell the ungrateful neglect of the prince for whom he had sacrificed everything had given charles much pain but in his own opinion at least he had completely atoned for this negligence by the trouble which he had taken for sir geoffrey peveril and his son whose liberation he looked upon not only as an excellent good deed in itself but in spite of the grave rebuke of ormond as achieved in a very pardonable manner considering the difficulties with which he was surrounded he even felt a degree of satisfaction on receiving intelligence from the city that there had been disturbances in the streets and that some of the more violent fanatics had betaken themselves to their meetinghouses upon sudden summons to inquire as their preachers phrased it into the causes of heavens wrath and into the backsliding of the court lawyers and jury by whom the false and bloody favourers of the popish plot were screened and cloaked from deserved punishment  the king we repeat seemed to hear these accounts with pleasure even when he was reminded of the dangerous and susceptible character of those with whom such suspicions originated will any one now assert he said with selfcomplacence that i am so utterly negligent of the interest of friendsyou see the peril in which i place myself and even the risk to which i have exposed the public peace to rescue a man whom i have scarce seen for twenty years and then only in his buffcoat and bandoleers with other trainband officers who kissed hands upon the restoration they say kings have long handsi think they have as much occasion for long memories since they are expected to watch over and reward every man in england who hath but shown his goodwill by crying god save the king  nay the rogues are even more unreasonable still said sedley for every knave of them thinks himself entitled to your majestys protection in a good cause whether he has cried god save the king or no  the king smiled and turned to another part of the stately hall where everything was assembled which could according to the taste of the age make the time glide pleasantly away  in one place a group of the young nobility and of the ladies of the court listened to the readers acquaintance empson who was accompanying with his unrivalled breathings on the flute a young siren who while her bosom palpitated with pride and with fear warbled to the courtly and august presence the beautiful air beginning   young i am and yet unskilld   how to make a lover yield c  she performed her task in a manner so corresponding with the strains of the amatory poet and the voluptuous air with which the words had been invested by the celebrated purcel that the men crowded around in ecstasies while most of the ladies thought it proper either to look extremely indifferent to the words she sung or to withdraw from the circle as quietly as possible to the song succeeded a concerto performed by a select band of most admirable musicians which the king whose taste was indisputable had himself selected  at other tables in the apartment the elder courtiers worshipped fortune at the various fashionable games of ombre quadrille hazard and the like while heaps of gold which lay before the players augmented or dwindled with every turn of a card or cast of a die many a years rent of fair estates was ventured upon the main or the odds which spent in the old deserted manorhouse had repaired the ravages of cromwell upon its walls and replaced the sources of good housekeeping and hospitality that exhausted in the last age by fine and sequestration were now in a fair way of being annihilated by careless prodigality elsewhere under cover of observing the gamester or listening to the music the gallantries of that alllicensed age were practised among the gay and fair closely watched the whilst by the ugly or the old who promised themselves at least the pleasure of observing and it may be that of proclaiming intrigues in which they could not be sharers  from one table to another glided the merry monarch exchanging now a glance with a court beauty now a jest with a court wit now beating time to the music and anon losing or winning a few pieces of gold on the chance of the game to which he stood nearestthe most amiable of voluptuariesthe gayest and bestnatured of companionsthe man that would of all others have best sustained his character had life been a continued banquet and its only end to enjoy the passing hour and send it away as pleasantly as might be  but kings are least of all exempted from the ordinary lot of humanity and seged of ethiopia is amongst monarchs no solitary example of the vanity of reckoning on a day or an hour of undisturbed serenity an attendant on the court announced suddenly to their majesties that a lady who would only announce herself as a peeress of england desired to be admitted into the presence  the queen said hastily it was impossible no peeress without announcing her title was entitled to the privilege of her rank  i could be sworn said a nobleman in attendance that it is some whim of the duchess of newcastle  the attendant who brought the message said that he did indeed believe it to be the duchess both from the singularity of the message and that the lady spoke with somewhat a foreign accent  in the name of madness then said the king let us admit her her grace is an entire rareeshow in her own persona universal masqueradeindeed a sort of private bedlamhospital her whole ideas being like so many patients crazed upon the subjects of love and literature who act nothing in their vagaries save minerva venus and the nine muses  your majestys pleasure must always supersede mine said the queen i only hope i shall not be expected to entertain so fantastic a personage the last time she came to court isabellashe spoke to one of her portuguese ladies of honouryou had not returned from our lovely lisbonher grace had the assurance to assume a right to bring a trainbearer into my apartment and when this was not allowed what then think you she dideven caused her train to be made so long that three mortal yards of satin and silver remained in the antechamber supported by four wenches while the other end was attached to her graces person as she paid her duty at the upper end of the presenceroom full thirty yards of the most beautiful silk did her graces madness employ in this manner  and most beautiful damsels they were who bore this portentous train said the kinga train never equalled save by that of the great comet in sixtysix sedley and etherege told us wonders of them for it is one advantage of this new fashion brought up by the duchess that a matron may be totally unconscious of the coquetry of her train and its attendants  am i to understand then your majestys pleasure is that the lady is to be admitted said the usher  certainly said the king that is if the incognita be really entitled to the honourit may be as well to inquire her titlethere are more madwomen abroad than the duchess of newcastle i will walk into the anteroom myself and receive your answer  but ere charles had reached the lower end of the apartment in his progress to the anteroom the usher surprised the assembly by announcing a name which had not for many a year been heard in these courtly hallsthe countess of derby  stately and tall and still at an advanced period of life having a person unbroken by years the noble lady advanced towards her sovereign with a step resembling that with which she might have met an equal there was indeed nothing in her manner that indicated either haughtiness or assumption unbecoming that presence but her consciousness of wrongs sustained from the administration of charles and of the superiority of the injured party over those from whom or in whose name the injury had been offered gave her look dignity and her step firmness she was dressed in widows weeds of the same fashion which were worn at the time her husband was brought to the scaffold and which in the thirty years subsequent to that event she had never permitted her tirewoman to alter  the surprise was no pleasing one to the king and cursing in his heart the rashness which had allowed the lady entrance on the gay scene in which they were engaged he saw at the same time the necessity of receiving her in a manner suitable to his own character and her rank in the british court he approached her with an air of welcome into which he threw all his natural grace while he began chère comtesse de derby puissante reine de man notre très auguste sur  speak english sire if i may presume to ask such a favour said the countess i am a peeress of this nationmother to one english earl and widow alas to another in england i have spent my brief days of happiness my long years of widowhood and sorrow france and its language are but to me the dreams of an uninteresting childhood i know no tongue save that of my husband and my son permit me as the widow and mother of derby thus to render my homage  she would have kneeled but the king gracefully prevented her and saluting her cheek according to the form led her towards the queen and himself performed the ceremony of introduction your majesty he said must be informed that the countess has imposed a restriction on frenchthe language of gallantry and compliment i trust your majesty will though a foreigner like herself find enough of honest english to assure the countess of derby with what pleasure we see her at court after the absence of so many years  i will endeavour to do so at least said the queen on whom the appearance of the countess of derby made a more favourable impression than that of many strangers whom at the kings request she was in the habit of receiving with courtesy  charles himself again spoke to any other lady of the same rank i might put the question why she was so long absent from the circle i fear i can only ask the countess of derby what fortunate cause produces the pleasure of seeing her here  no fortunate cause my liege though one most strong and urgent  the king augured nothing agreeable from this commencement and in truth from the countesss first entrance he had anticipated some unpleasant explanation which he therefore hastened to parry having first composed his features into an expression of sympathy and interest  if said he the cause is of a nature in which we can render assistance we cannot expect your ladyship should enter upon it at the present time but a memorial addressed to our secretary or if it is more satisfactory to ourselves directly will receive our immediate and i trust i need not add our favourable construction  the countess bowed with some state and answered my business sire is indeed important but so brief that it need not for more than a few minutes withdraw your ear from what is more pleasingyet it is so urgent that i am afraid to postpone it even for a moment  this is unusual said charles but you countess of derby are an unwonted guest and must command my time does the matter require my private ear  for my part said the countess the whole court might listen but you majesty may prefer hearing me in the presence of one or two of your counsellors  ormond said the king looking around attend us for an instantand do you arlington do the same  the king led the way into an adjoining cabinet and seating himself requested the countess would also take a chair it needs not sire she replied then pausing for a moment as if to collect her spirits she proceeded with firmness  your majesty well said that no light cause had drawn me from my lonely habitation i came not hither when the property of my sonthat property which descended to him from a father who died for your majestys rightswas conjured away from him under pretext of justice that it might first feed the avarice of the rebel fairfax and then supply the prodigality of his soninlaw buckingham  these are over harsh terms lady said the king a legal penalty was as we remember incurred by an act of irregular violenceso our courts and our laws term it though personally i have no objection to call it with you an honourable revenge but admit it were such in prosecution of the laws of honour bitter legal consequences are often necessarily incurred  i come not to argue for my sons wasted and forfeited inheritance sire said the countess i only take credit for my patience under that afflicting dispensation i now come to redeem the honour of the house of derby more dear to me than all the treasures and lands which ever belonged to it  and by whom is the honour of the house of derby impeached said the king for on my word you bring me the first news of it  has there one narrative as these wild fictions are termed been printed with regard to the popish plotthis pretended plot as i will call itin which the honour of our house has not been touched and tainted and are there not two noble gentlemen father and son allies of the house of stanley about to be placed in jeopardy of their lives on account of matters in which we are the parties first impeached  the king looked around and smiled to arlington and ormond the countesss courage methinks shames ours what lips dared have called the immaculate plot pretended or the narrative of the witnesses our preservers from popish knives a wild fictionbut madam he said though i admire the generosity of your interference in behalf of the two peverils i must acquaint you that your interference is unnecessarythey are this morning acquitted  now may god be praised said the countess folding her hands i have scarce slept since i heard the news of their impeachment and have arrived here to surrender myself to your majestys justice or to the prejudices of the nation in hopes by so doing i might at least save the lives of my noble and generous friends enveloped in suspicion only or chiefly by their connection with usare they indeed acquitted  they are by my honour said the king i marvel you heard it not  i arrived but last night and remained in the strictest seclusion said the countess afraid to make any inquiries that might occasion discovery ere i saw your majesty  and now that we have met said the king taking her hand kindlya meeting which gives me the greatest pleasuremay i recommend to you speedily to return to your royal island with as little éclat as you came thither the world my dear countess has changed since we were young men fought in the civil war with good swords and muskets but now we fight with indictments and oaths and such like legal weapons you are no adept in such warfare and though i am well aware you know how to hold out a castle i doubt much if you have the art to parry off an impeachment this plot has come upon us like a land stormthere is no steering the vessel in the teeth of the tempestwe must run for the nearest haven and happy if we can reach one  this is cowardice my liege said the countessforgive the wordit is but a woman who speaks it call your noble friends around you and make a stand like your royal father there is but one right and one wrongone honourable and forward course and all others which deviate are oblique and unworthy  your language my venerated friend said ormond who saw the necessity of interfering betwixt the dignity of the actual sovereign and the freedom of the countess who was generally accustomed to receive not to pay observanceyour language is strong and decided but it applies not to the times it might occasion a renewal of the civil war and of all its miseries but could hardly be attended with the effects you sanguinely anticipate  you are too rash my lady countess said arlington not only to rush upon this danger yourself but to desire to involve his majesty let me say plainly that in this jealous time you have done but ill to exchange the security of castle rushin for the chance of a lodging in the tower of london  and were i to kiss the block there said the countess as did my husband at boltononthemoors i would do so willingly rather than forsake a friendand one too whom as in the case of the younger peveril i have thrust upon danger  but have i not assured you that both of the peverils elder and younger are freed from peril said the king and my dear countess what can else tempt you to thrust yourself on danger from which doubtless you expect to be relieved by my intervention methinks a lady of your judgment should not voluntarily throw herself into a river merely that her friends might have the risk and merit of dragging her out  the countess reiterated her intention to claim a fair trialthe two counsellors again pressed their advice that she should withdraw though under the charge of absconding from justice and remain in her own feudal kingdom  the king seeing no termination to the debate gently reminded the countess that her majesty would be jealous if he detained her ladyship longer and offered her his hand to conduct her back to the company this she was under the necessity of accepting and returned accordingly to the apartments of state where an event occurred immediately afterwards which must be transferred to the next chapter     chapter xlvi                here stand i tight and trim               quick of eye though little of limb               he who denieth the word i have spoken               betwixt him and me shall lances be broken                             lay of the little john de saintre  when charles had reconducted the countess of derby into the presencechamber before he parted with her he entreated her in a whisper to be governed by good counsel and to regard her own safety and then turned easily from her as if to distribute his attentions equally among the other guests  these were a good deal circumscribed at the instant by the arrival of a party of five or six musicians one of whom a german under the patronage of the duke of buckingham was particularly renowned for his performance on the violoncello but had been detained in inactivity in the antechamber by the nonarrival of his instrument which had now at length made its appearance  the domestic who placed it before the owner shrouded as it was within its wooden case seemed heartily glad to be rid of his load and lingered for a moment as if interested in discovering what sort of instrument was to be produced that could weigh so heavily his curiosity was satisfied and in a most extraordinary manner for while the musician was fumbling with the key the case being for his greater convenience placed upright against the wall the case and instrument itself at once flew open and out started the dwarf geoffrey hudsonat sight of whose unearthly appearance thus suddenly introduced the ladies shrieked and ran backwards the gentlemen started and the poor german on seeing the portentous delivery of his fiddlecase tumbled on the floor in an agony supposing it might be that his instrument was metamorphosed into the strange figure which supplied its place so soon however as he recovered he glided out of the apartment and was followed by most of his companions  hudson said the kingmy little old friend i am not sorry to see you though buckingham who i suppose is the purveyor of this jest hath served us up but a stale one  will your majesty honour me with one moments attention said hudson  assuredly my good friend said the king old acquaintances are springing up in every quarter tonight and our leisure can hardly be better employed than in listening to themit was an idle trick of buckingham he added in a whisper to ormond to send the poor thing hither especially as he was today tried for the affair of the plot at any rate he comes not to ask protection from us having had the rare fortune to come off plotfree he is but fishing i suppose for some little present or pension  the little man precise in court etiquette yet impatient of the kings delaying to attend to him stood in the midst of the floor most valorously pawing and prancing like a scots pony assuming the airs of a warhorse waving meanwhile his little hat with the tarnished feather and bowing from time to time as if impatient to be heard  speak on then my friend said charles if thou hast some poetical address penned for thee out with it that thou mayst have time to repose these flourishing little limbs of thine  no poetical speech have i most mighty sovereign answered the dwarf but in plain and most loyal prose i do accuse before this company the once noble duke of buckingham of high treason  well spoken and manfullyget on man said the king who never doubted that this was the introduction to something burlesque or witty not conceiving that the charge was made in solemn earnest  a great laugh took place among such courtiers as heard and among many who did not hear what was uttered by the dwarf the former entertained by the extravagant emphasis and gesticulation of the little champion and the others laughing not the less loud that they laughed for examples sake and upon trust  what matter is there for all this mirth said he very indignantlyis it fit subject for laughing that i geoffrey hudson knight do before king and nobles impeach george villiers duke of buckingham of high treason  no subject of mirth certainly said charles composing his features but great matter of wondercome cease this mouthing and prancing and mummeryif there be a jest come out with it man and if not even get thee to the beaffet and drink a cup of wine to refresh thee after thy close lodging  i tell you my liege said hudson impatiently yet in a whisper intended only to be audible by the king that if you spend overmuch time in trifling you will be convinced by dire experience of buckinghams treason i tell youi asseverate to your majestytwo hundred armed fanatics will be here within the hour to surprise the guards  stand back ladies said the king or you may hear more than you will care to listen to my lord of buckinghams jests are not always you know quite fitted for female ears besides we want a few words in private with our little friend you my lord of ormondyou arlington and he named one or two others may remain with us  the gay crowd bore back and dispersed through the apartmentthe men to conjecture what the end of this mummery as they supposed it was likely to prove and what jest as sedley said the bassfiddle had been brought to bed ofand the ladies to admire and criticise the antique dress and richly embroidered ruff and hood of the countess of derby to whom the queen was showing particular attention  and now in the name of heaven and amongst friends said the king to the dwarf what means all this  treason my lord the kingtreason to his majesty of englandwhen i was chambered in yonder instrument my lord the highdutch fellows who bore me carried me into a certain chapel to see as they said to each other that all was ready sire i went where bassfiddle never went before even into a conventicle of fifthmonarchists and when they brought me away the preacher was concluding his sermon and was within a now to apply of setting off like the bellwether at the head of his flock to surprise your majesty in your royal court i heard him through the soundholes of my instrument when the fellow set me down for a moment to profit by this precious doctrine  it would be singular said lord arlington were there some reality at the bottom of this buffoonery for we know these wild men have been consulting together today and five conventicles have held a solemn fast  nay said the king if that be the case they are certainly determined on some villainy  might i advise said the duke of ormond i would summon the duke of buckingham to this presence his connections with the fanatics are well known though he affects to conceal them  you would not my lord do his grace the injustice to treat him as a criminal on such a charge as this said the king however he added after a moments consideration buckingham is accessible to every sort of temptation from the flightiness of his genius i should not be surprised if he nourished hopes of an aspiring kindi think we had some proof of it latelyhark ye chiffinch go to him instantly and bring him here on any fair pretext thou canst devise i would fain save him from what lawyers call an overt act the court would be dull as a dead horse were buckingham to miscarry  will not your majesty order the horse guards to turn out said young selby who was present and an officer  no selby said the king i like not horseplay but let them be prepared and let the high bailiff collect his civil officers and command the sheriffs to summon their worshipful attendants from javelinmen to hangmen and have them in readiness in case of any sudden tumultdouble the sentinels on the doors of the palaceand see no strangers get in  or out said the duke of ormond where are the foreign fellows who brought in the dwarf  they were sought for but they were not to be found they had retreated leaving their instrumentsa circumstance which seemed to bear hard on the duke of buckingham their patron  hasty preparations were made to provide resistance to any effort of despair which the supposed conspirators might be driven to and in the meanwhile the king withdrawing with arlington ormond and a few other counsellors into the cabinet where the countess of derby had had her audience resumed the examination of the little discoverer his declaration though singular was quite coherent the strain of romance intermingled with it being in fact a part of his character which often gained him the fate of being laughed at when he would otherwise have been pitied or even esteemed  he commenced with a flourish about his sufferings for the plot which the impatience of ormond would have cut short had not the king reminded his grace that a top when it is not flogged must needs go down of itself at the end of a definite time while the application of the whip may keep it up for hours  geoffrey hudson was therefore allowed to exhaust himself on the subject of his prisonhouse which he informed the king was not without a beam of lightan emanation of lovelinessa mortal angelquick of step and beautiful of eye who had more than once visited his confinement with words of cheering and comfort  by my faith said the king they fare better in newgate than i was aware of who would have thought of the little gentleman being solaced with female society in such a place  i pray your majesty said the dwarf after the manner of a solemn protest to understand nothing amiss my devotion to this fair creature is rather like what we poor catholics pay to the blessed saints than mixed with any grosser quality indeed she seems rather a sylphid of the rosicrucian system than aught more carnal being slighter lighter and less than the females of common life who have something of that coarseness of make which is doubtless derived from the sinful and gigantic race of the antediluvians  well say on man quoth charles didst thou not discover this sylph to be a mere mortal wench after all  whoi my liegeoh fie  nay little gentleman do not be so particularly scandalised said the king i promise you i suspect you of no audacity of gallantry  time wears fast said the duke of ormond impatiently and looking at his watch chiffinch hath been gone ten minutes and ten minutes will bring him back  true said charles gravely come to the point hudson and tell us what this female has to do with your coming hither in this extraordinary manner  everything my lord said little hudson i saw her twice during my confinement in newgate and in my thought she is the very angel who guards my life and welfare for after my acquittal as i walked towards the city with two tall gentlemen who had been in trouble along with me and just while we stood to our defence against a rascally mob and just as i had taken possession of an elevated situation to have some vantage against the great odds of numbers i heard a heavenly voice sound as it were from a window behind me counselling me to take refuge in a certain house to which measure i readily persuaded my gallant friends the peverils who have always shown themselves willing to be counselled by me  showing therein their wisdom at once and modesty said the king but what chanced next be briefbe like thyself man  for a time sire said the dwarf it seemed as if i were not the principal object of attention first the younger peveril was withdrawn from us by a gentleman of venerable appearance though something smacking of a puritan having boots of neats leather and wearing his weapon without a swordknot when master julian returned he informed us for the first time that we were in the power of a body of armed fanatics who were as the poet says prompt for direful act and your majesty will remark that both father and son were in some measure desperate and disregardful from that moment of the assurances which i gave them that the star which i was bound to worship would in her own time shine forth in signal of our safety may it please your majesty in answer to my hilarious exhortations to confidence the father did but say tush and the son pshaw which showed how mens prudence and manners are disturbed by affliction nevertheless these two gentlemen the peverils forming a strong opinion of the necessity there was to break forth were it only to convey a knowledge of these dangerous passages to your majesty commenced an assault on the door of the apartment i also assisting with the strength which heaven hath given and some threescore years have left me we could not as it unhappily proved manage our attempt so silently but that our guards overheard us and entering in numbers separated us from each other and compelled my companions at point of pike and poniard to go to some other and more distant apartment thus separating our fair society i was again enclosed in the now solitary chamber and i will own that i felt a certain depression of soul but when bale is at highest as the poet singeth boot is at nighest for a door of hope was suddenly opened  in the name of god my liege said the duke of ormond let this poor creatures story be translated into the language of common sense by some of the scribblers of romances about court and we may be able to make meaning of it  geoffrey hudson looked with a frowning countenance of reproof upon the impatient old irish nobleman and said with a very dignified air that one duke upon a poor gentlemans hand was enough at a time and that but for his present engagement and dependency with the duke of buckingham he would have endured no such terms from the duke of ormond  abate your valour and diminish your choler at our request most puissant sir geoffrey hudson said the king and forgive the duke of ormond for my sake but at all events go on with your story  geoffrey hudson laid his hand on his bosom and bowed in proud and dignified submission to his sovereign then waved his forgiveness gracefully to ormond accompanied with a horrible grin which he designed for a smile of gracious forgiveness and conciliation under the dukes favour then he proceeded when i said a door of hope was opened to me i meant a door behind the tapestry from whence issued that fair visionyet not so fair as lustrously dark like the beauty of a continental night where the cloudless azure sky shrouds us in a veil more lovely than that of daybut i note your majestys impatienceenough i followed my beautiful guide into an apartment where there lay strangely intermingled warlike arms and musical instruments amongst these i saw my own late place of temporary obscuritya violoncello to my astonishment she turned around the instrument and opening it behind the pressure of a spring showed that it was filled with pistols daggers and ammunition made up in bandoleers these she said are this night destined to surprise the court of the unwary charlesyour majesty must pardon my using her own words but if thou darest go in their stead thou mayst be the saviour of king and kingdoms if thou art afraid keep secret i will myself try the adventure now may heaven forbid that geoffrey hudson were craven enough said i to let thee run such a risk you know notyou cannot know what belongs to such ambuscades and concealmentsi am accustomed to themhave lurked in the pocket of a giant and have formed the contents of a pasty get in then she said and lose no time nevertheless while i prepared to obey i will not deny that some cold apprehensions came over my hot valour and i confessed to her if it might be so i would rather find my way to the palace on my own feet but she would not listen to me saying hastily i would be intercepted or refused admittance and that i must embrace the means she offered me of introduction into the presence and when there tell the king to be on his guardlittle more is necessary for once the scheme is known it becomes desperate rashly and boldly i bid adieu to the daylight which was then fading away she withdrew the contents of the instrument destined for my concealment and having put them behind the chimneyboard introduced me in their room as she clasped me in i implored her to warn the men who were to be entrusted with me to take heed and keep the neck of the violoncello uppermost but ere i had completed my request i found i was left alone and in darkness presently two or three fellows entered whom by their language which i in some sort understood i perceived to be germans and under the influence of the duke of buckingham i heard them receive from the leader a charge how they were to deport themselves when they should assume the concealed armsandfor i will do the duke no wrongi understood their orders were precise not only to spare the person of the king but also those of the courtiers and to protect all who might be in the presence against an irruption of the fanatics in other respects they had charge to disarm the gentlemenpensioners in the guardroom and in fine to obtain the command of the court  the king looked disconcerted and thoughtful at this communication and bade lord arlington see that selby quietly made search into the contents of the other cases which had been brought as containing musical instruments he then signed to the dwarf to proceed in his story asking him again and again and very solemnly whether he was sure that he heard the dukes name mentioned as commanding or approving this action  the dwarf answered in the affirmative  this said the king is carrying the frolic somewhat far  the dwarf proceeded to state that he was carried after his metamorphosis into the chapel where he heard the preacher seemingly about the close of his harangue the tenor of which he also mentioned words he said could not express the agony which he felt when he found that his bearer in placing the instrument in a corner was about to invert its position in which case he said human frailty might have proved too great for love for loyalty for true obedience nay for the fear of death which was like to ensue on discovery and he concluded that he greatly doubted he could not have stood on his head for many minutes without screaming aloud  i could not have blamed you said the king placed in such a posture in the royal oak i must needs have roared myselfis this all you have to tell us of this strange conspiracy sir geoffrey hudson replied in the affirmative and the king presently subjoinedgo my little friend your services shall not be forgotten since thou hast crept into the bowels of a fiddle for our service we are bound in duty and conscience to find you a more roomy dwelling in future  it was a violoncello if your majesty is pleased to remember said the little jealous man not a common fiddle though for your majestys service i would have crept even into a kit  whatever of that nature could have been performed by any subject of ours thou wouldst have enacted in our behalfof that we hold ourselves certain withdraw for a little and hark ye for the present beware what you say about this matter let your appearance be considereddo you mark meas a frolic of the duke of buckingham and not a word of conspiracy  were it not better to put him under some restraint sire said the duke of ormond when hudson had left the room  it is unnecessary said the king i remember the little wretch of old fortune to make him the model of absurdity has closed a most lofty soul within that little miserable carcass for wielding his sword and keeping his word he is a perfect don quixote in decimooctavo he shall be taken care ofbut oddsfish my lords is not this freak of buckingham too villainous and ungrateful  he had not had the means of being so had your majesty said the duke of ormond been less lenient on other occasions  my lord my lord said charles hastilyyour lordship is buckinghams known enemywe will take other and more impartial counselarlington what think you of all this  may it please your majesty said arlington i think the thing is absolutely impossible unless the duke has had some quarrel with your majesty of which we know nothing his grace is very flighty doubtless but this seems actual insanity  why faith said the king some words passed betwixt us this morninghis duchess it seems is deadand to lose no time his grace had cast his eyes about for means of repairing the loss and had the assurance to ask our consent to woo my niece lady anne  which your majesty of course rejected said the statesman  and not without rebuking his assurance added the king  in private sire or before any witnesses said the duke of ormond  before no one said the kingexcepting indeed little chiffinch and he you know is no one  hinc illæ lachrymæ said ormond i know his grace well while the rebuke of his aspiring petulance was a matter betwixt your majesty and him he might have let it pass by but a check before a fellow from whom it was likely enough to travel through the court was a matter to be revenged  here selby came hastily from the other room to say that his grace of buckingham had just entered the presencechamber  the king rose let a boat be in readiness with a party of the yeomen said he it may be necessary to attach him of treason and send him to the tower  should not a secretary of states warrant be prepared said ormond  no my lord duke said the king sharply i still hope that the necessity may be avoided     chapter xlvii               highreaching buckingham grows circumspect                                            richard iii  before giving the reader an account of the meeting betwixt buckingham and his injured sovereign we may mention a trifling circumstance or two which took place betwixt his grace and chiffinch in the short drive betwixt york place and whitehall  in the outset the duke endeavoured to learn from the courtier the special cause of his being summoned so hastily to the court chiffinch answered cautiously that he believed there were some gambols going forward at which the king desired the dukes presence  this did not quite satisfy buckingham for conscious of his own rash purpose he could not but apprehend discovery after a moments silence chiffinch he said abruptly did you mention to any one what the king said to me this morning touching the lady anne  my lord duke said chiffinch hesitantly surely my duty to the kingmy respect to your grace  you mentioned it to no one then said the duke sternly  to no one replied chiffinch faintly for he was intimidated by the dukes increasing severity of manner  ye lie like a scoundrel said the dukeyou told christian  your grace said chiffinchyour graceyour grace ought to remember that i told you christians secret that the countess of derby was come up  and you think the one point of treachery may balance for the other but no i must have a better atonement be assured i will blow your brains out ere you leave this carriage unless you tell me the truth of this message from court  as chiffinch hesitated what reply to make a man who by the blaze of the torches then always borne as well by the lackeys who hung behind the carriage as by the footmen who ran by the side might easily see who sat in the coach approached and sung in a deep manly voice the burden of an old french song on the battle of marignan in which is imitated the german french of the defeated swiss   tout est verlore   la tintelore   tout est verlore             bei got  i am betrayed said the duke who instantly conceived that this chorus expressing all is lost was sung by one of his faithful agents as a hint to him that their machinations were discovered  he attempted to throw himself from the carriage but chiffinch held him with a firm though respectful grasp do not destroy yourself my lord he said in a tone of deep humilitythere are soldiers and officers of the peace around the carriage to enforce your graces coming to whitehall and to prevent your escape to attempt it would be to confess guilt and i advise you strongly against thatthe king is your friendbe your own  the duke after a moments consideration said sullenly i believe you are right why should i fly when i am guilty of nothing but sending some fireworks to entertain the court instead of a concert of music  and the dwarf who came so unexpectedly out of the bassviol  was a masking device of my own chiffinch said the duke though the circumstance was then first known to him chiffinch you will bind me for ever if you will permit me to have a minutes conversation with christian  with christian my lordwhere could you find himyou are aware we must go straight to the court  true said the duke but i think i cannot miss finding him and you master chiffinch are no officer and have no warrant either to detain me prisoner or prevent my speaking to whom i please  chiffinch replied my lord duke your genius is so great and your escapes so numerous that it will be from no wish of my own if i am forced to hurt a man so skilful and so popular  nay then there is life in it yet said the duke and whistled when from beside the little cutlers booth with which the reader is acquainted appeared suddenly master christian and was in a moment at the side of the coach ganz ist verloren said the duke  i know it said christian and all our godly friends are dispersed upon the news luckily the colonel and these german rascals gave a hint all is safeyou go to courthark ye i will follow  you christian that would be more friendly than wise  why what is there against me said christian i am innocent as the child unbornso is your grace there is but one creature who can bear witness to our guilt but i trust to bring her on the stage in our favourbesides if i were not i should presently be sent for  the familiar of whom i have heard you speak i warrant  hark in your ear again  i understand said the duke and will delay master chiffinchfor he you must know is my conductorno longerwell chiffinch let them drive onvogue la galère he exclaimed as the carriage went onward i have sailed through worse perils than this yet  it is not for me to judge said chiffinch your grace is a bold commander and christian hath the cunning of the devil for a pilot buthowever i remain your graces poor friend and will heartily rejoice in your extrication  give me a proof of your friendship said the duke tell me what you know of christians familiar as he calls her  i believe it to be the same dancing wench who came with empson to my house on the morning that mistress alice made her escape from us but you have seen her my lord  i said the duke when did i see her  she was employed by christian i believe to set his niece at liberty when he found himself obliged to gratify his fanatical brotherinlaw by restoring his child besides being prompted by a private desire as i think of bantering your grace  umph i suspected so much i will repay it said the duke but first to get out of this dilemmathat little numidian witch then was his familiar and she joined in the plot to tantalise mebut here we reach whitehallnow chiffinch be no worse than thy word andnow buckingham be thyself  but ere we follow buckingham into the presence where he had so difficult a part to sustain it may not be amiss to follow christian after his brief conversation with him on reentering the house which he did by a circuitous passage leading from a distant alley and through several courts christian hastened to a low matted apartment in which bridgenorth sat alone reading the bible by the light of a small brazen lamp with the utmost serenity of countenance  have you dismissed the peverils said christian hastily  i have said the major  and upon what pledgethat they will not carry information against you to whitehall  they gave me their promise voluntarily when i showed them our armed friends were dismissed tomorrow i believe it is their purpose to lodge informations  and why not tonight i pray you said christian  because they allow us that time for escape  why then do you not avail yourself of it wherefore are you here said christian  nay rather why do you not fly said bridgenorth of a surety you are as deeply engaged as i  brother bridgenorth i am the fox who knows a hundred modes of deceiving the hounds you are the deer whose sole resource is in hasty flight therefore lose no timebegone to the countryor rather zedekiah fishs vessel the good hope lies in the river bound for massachusettstake the wings of the morning and begoneshe can fall down to gravesend with the tide  and leave to thee brother christian said bridgenorth the charge of my fortune and my daughter no brother my opinion of your good faith must be reestablished ere i again trust thee  go thy ways then for a suspicious fool said christian suppressing his strong desire to use language more offensive or rather stay where thou art and take thy chance of the gallows  it is appointed to all men to die once said bridgenorth my life hath been a living death my fairest boughs have been stripped by the axe of the foresterthat which survives must if it shall blossom be grafted elsewhere and at a distance from my aged trunk the sooner then the root feels the axe the stroke is more welcome i had been pleased indeed had i been called to bringing yonder licentious court to a purer character and relieving the yoke of the suffering people of god that youth tooson to that precious woman to whom i owe the last tie that feebly links my wearied spirit to humanitycould i have travailed with him in the good causebut that with all my other hopes is broken for ever and since i am not worthy to be an instrument in so great a work i have little desire to abide longer in this vale of sorrow  farewell then desponding fool said christian unable with all his calmness any longer to suppress his contempt for the resigned and hopeless predestinarian that fate should have clogged me with such confederates he muttered as he left the apartmentthis bigoted fool is now nearly irreclaimablei must to zarah for she or no one must carry us through these straits if i can but soothe her sullen temper and excite her vanity to actionbetwixt her address the kings partiality for the duke buckinghams matchless effrontery and my own hand upon the helm we may yet weather the tempest that darkens around us but what we do must be hastily done  in another apartment he found the person he soughtthe same who visited the duke of buckinghams harem and having relieved alice bridgenorth from her confinement there had occupied her place as has been already narrated or rather intimated she was now much more plainly attired than when she had tantalised the duke with her presence but her dress had still something of the oriental character which corresponded with the dark complexion and quick eye of the wearer she had the kerchief at her eyes as christian entered the apartment but suddenly withdrew it and flashing on him a glance of scorn and indignation asked him what he meant by intruding where his company was alike unsought for and undesired  a proper question said christian from a slave to her master  rather say a proper question and of all questions the most proper from a mistress to her slave know you not that from the hour in which you discovered your ineffable baseness you have made me mistress of your lot while you seemed but a demon of vengeance you commanded terror and to good purpose but such a foul fiend as thou hast of late shown thyselfsuch a very worthless base trickster of the devilsuch a sordid grovelling imp of perdition can gain nothing but scorn from a soul like mine  gallantly mouthed said christian and with good emphasis  yes answered zarah i can speaksometimesi can also be mute and that no one knows better than thou  thou art a spoiled child zarah and dost but abuse the indulgence i entertain for your freakish humour replied christian thy wits have been disturbed since ever you landed in england and all for the sake of one who cares for thee no more than for the most worthless object who walks the streets amongst whom he left you to engage in a brawl for one he loved better  it is no matter said zarah obviously repressing very bitter emotion it signifies not that he loves another better there is noneno nonethat ever did or can love him so well  i pity you zarah said christian with some scorn  i deserve your pity she replied were your pity worth my accepting whom have i to thank for my wretchedness but youyou bred me up in thirst of vengeance ere i knew that good and evil were anything better than namesto gain your applause and to gratify the vanity you had excited i have for years undergone a penance from which a thousand would have shrunk  a thousand zarah answered christian ay a hundred thousand and a million to boot the creature is not on earth being mere mortal woman that would have undergone the thirtieth part of thy selfdenial  i believe it said zarah drawing up her slight but elegant figure i believe iti have gone through a trial that few indeed could have sustained i have renounced the dear intercourse of my kind compelled my tongue only to utter like that of a spy the knowledge which my ear had only collected as a base eavesdropper this i have done for yearsfor yearsand all for the sake of your private applauseand the hope of vengeance on a woman who if she did ill in murdering my father has been bitterly repaid by nourishing a serpent in her bosom that had the tooth but not the deafened ear of the adder  wellwellwell reiterated christian and had you not your reward in my approbationin the consequences of your own unequalled dexterityby which superior to anything of thy sex that history has ever known you endured what woman never before endured insolence without notice admiration without answer and sarcasm without reply  not without reply said zarah fiercely gave not nature to my feelings a course of expression more impressive than words and did not those tremble at my shrieks who would have little minded my entreaties or my complaints and my proud lady who sauced her charities with the taunts she thought i heard notshe was justly paid by the passing her dearest and most secret concerns into the hands of her mortal enemy and the vain earlyet he was a thing as insignificant as the plume that nodded in his capand the maidens and ladies who taunted mei had or can easily have my revenge upon them but there is one she added looking upward who never taunted me one whose generous feelings could treat the poor dumb girl even as his sister who never spoke word of her but was to excuse or defendand you tell me i must not love him and that it is madness to love himi will be mad then for i will love till the latest breath of my life  think but an instant silly girlsilly but in one respect since in all others thou mayest brave the world of women think what i have proposed to thee for the loss of this hopeless affection a career so brilliantthink only that it rests with thyself to be the wifethe wedded wifeof the princely buckingham with my talentswith thy wit and beautywith his passionate love of these attributesa short space might rank you among englands princessesbe but guided by mehe is now at deadly passneeds every assistance to retrieve his fortunesabove all that which we alone can render him put yourself under my conduct and not fate itself shall prevent your wearing a duchesss coronet  a coronet of thistledown entwined with thistleleaves said zarahi know not a slighter thing than your buckingham i saw him at your requestsaw him when as a man he should have shown himself generous and noblei stood the proof at your desire for i laugh at those dangers from which the poor blushing wailers of my sex shrink and withdraw themselves what did i find hima poor wavering voluptuaryhis nearest attempt to passion like the fire on a wretched stubblefield that may singe indeed or smoke but can neither warm nor devour christian were his coronet at my feet this moment i would sooner take up a crown of gilded gingerbread than extend my hand to raise it  you are mad zarahwith all your taste and talent you are utterly mad but let buckingham passdo you owe me nothing on this emergencynothing to one who rescued you from the cruelty of your owner the posturemaster to place you in ease and affluence  christian she replied i owe you much had i not felt i did so i would as i have been often tempted to do have denounced thee to the fierce countess who would have gibbeted you on her feudal walls of castle rushin and bid your family seek redress from the eagles that would long since have thatched their nest with your hair and fed their young ospreys with your flesh  i am truly glad you have had so much forbearance for me answered christian  i have it in truth and in sincerity replied zarahnot for your benefits to mesuch as they were they were every one interested and conferred from the most selfish considerations i have overpaid them a thousand times by the devotion to your will which i have displayed at the greatest personal risk but till of late i respected your powers of mindyour inimitable command of passionthe force of intellect which i have ever seen you exercise over all others from the bigot bridgenorth to the debauched buckinghamin that indeed i have recognised my master  and those powers said christian are unlimited as ever and with thy assistance thou shalt see the strongest meshes that the laws of civil society ever wove to limit the natural dignity of man broke asunder like a spiders web  she paused and answered while a noble motive fired theeay a noble motive though irregularfor i was born to gaze on the sun which the pale daughters of europe shrink fromi could serve theei could have followed while revenge or ambition had guided theebut love of wealth and by what means acquiredwhat sympathy can i hold with thatwouldst thou not have pandered to the lust of the king though the object was thine own orphan nieceyou smilesmile again when i ask you whether you meant not my own prostitution when you charged me to remain in the house of that wretched buckinghamsmile at that question and by heaven i stab you to the heart and she thrust her hand into her bosom and partly showed the hilt of a small poniard  and if i smile said christian it is but in scorn of so odious an accusation girl i will not tell thee the reason but there exists not on earth the living thing over whose safety and honour i would keep watch as over thine buckinghams wife indeed i wished thee and through thy own beauty and thy wit i doubted not to bring the match to pass  vain flatterer said zarah yet seeming soothed even by the flattery which she scoffed at you would persuade me that it was honourable love which you expected the duke was to have offered me how durst you urge a gross a deception to which time place and circumstance gave the liehow dare you now again mention it when you well know that at the time you mention the duchess was still in life  in life but on her deathbed said christian and for time place and circumstance had your virtue my zarah depended on these how couldst thou have been the creature thou art i knew thee allsufficient to bid him defianceelsefor thou art dearer to me than thou thinkesti had not risked thee to win the duke of buckingham ay and the kingdom of england to boot so now wilt thou be ruled and go on with me  zarah or fenella for our readers must have been long aware of the identity of these two personages cast down her eyes and was silent for a long time christian she said at last in a solemn voice if my ideas of right and of wrong be wild and incoherent i owe it first to the wild fever which my native sun communicated to my veins next to my childhood trained amidst the shifts tricks and feats of jugglers and mountebanks and then to a youth of fraud and deception through the course thou didst prescribe me in which i might indeed hear everything but communicate with no one the last cause of my wild errors if such they are originates o christian with you alone by whose intrigues i was placed with yonder lady and who taught me that to revenge my fathers death was my first great duty on earth and that i was bound by nature to hate and injure her by whom i was fed and fostered though as she would have fed and caressed a dog or any other mute animal i also thinkfor i will deal fairly with youthat you had not so easily detected your niece in the child whose surprising agility was making yonder brutal mountebanks fortune nor so readily induced him to part with his bondslave had you not for your own purposes placed me under his charge and reserved the privilege of claiming me when you pleased i could not under any other tuition have identified myself with the personage of a mute which it has been your desire that i should perform through life  you do me injustice zarah said christiani found you capable of the avenging of your fathers deathi consecrated you to it as i consecrated my own life and hopes and you held the duty sacred till these mad feeling towards a youth who loves your cousin  wholovesmycousin repeated zarah for we will continue to call her by her real name slowly and as if the words dropped unconsciously from her lips wellbe it soman of many wiles i will follow thy course for a little a very little farther but take heedtease me not with remonstrances against the treasure of my secret thoughtsi mean my most hopeless affection to julian peveriland bring me not as an assistant to any snare which you may design to cast around him you and your duke shall rue the hour most bitterly in which you provoke me you may suppose you have me in your power but remember the snakes of my burning climate are never so fatal as when you grasp them  i care not for these peverils said christiani care not for their fate a poor straw unless where it bears on that of the destined woman whose hands are red in your fathers blood believe me i can divide her fate and theirs i will explain to you how and for the duke he may pass among men of the town for wit and among soldiers for valour among courtiers for manners and for form and why with his high rank and immense fortune you should throw away an opportunity which as i could now improve it  speak not of it said zarah if thou wouldst have our truceremember it is no peaceif i say thou wouldst have our truce grow to be an hour old  this then said christian with a last effort to work upon the vanity of this singular being is she who pretended such superiority to human passion that she could walk indifferently and unmoved through the halls of the prosperous and the prison cells of the captive unknowing and unknown sympathising neither with the pleasures of the one nor the woes of the other but advancing with sure though silent steps her own plans in despite and regardless of either  my own plans said zarahthy plans christianthy plans of extorting from the surprised prisoners means whereby to convict themthine own plans formed with those more powerful than thyself to sound mens secrets and by using them as a matter of accusation to keep up the great delusion of the nation  such access was indeed given you as my agent said christian and for advancing a great national change but how did you use itto advance your insane passion  insane said zarahhad he been less than insane whom i addressed he and i had ere now been far from the toils which you have pitched for us both i had means prepared for everything and ere this the shores of britain had been lost to our sight for ever  the dwarf too said christianwas it worthy of you to delude that poor creature with flattering visionslull him asleep with drugs was that my doing  he was my destined tool said zarah haughtily i remembered your lessons too well not to use him as such yet scorn him not too much i tell you that yon very miserable dwarf whom i made my sport in the prisonyon wretched abortion of nature i would select for a husband ere i would marry your buckinghamthe vain and imbecile pigmy has yet the warm heart and noble feelings that a man should hold his highest honour  in gods name then take your own way said christian and for my sake let never man hereafter limit a woman in the use of her tongue since he must make it amply up to her in allowing her the privilege of her own will who would have thought it but the colt has slipped the bridle and i must needs follow since i cannot guide her  our narrative returns to the court of king charles at whitehall     chapter xlviii                                     but oh           what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel           ingrateful savage and inhuman creature           thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels           that knewst the very bottom of my soul           that almost mightst have coined me into gold           wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use                                                    henry v  at no period of his life not even when that life was in imminent danger did the constitutional gaiety of charles seem more overclouded than when waiting for the return of chiffinch with the duke of buckingham his mind revolted at the idea that the person to whom he had been so particularly indulgent and whom he had selected as the friend of his lighter hours and amusements should prove capable of having tampered with a plot apparently directed against his liberty and life he more than once examined the dwarf anew but could extract nothing more than his first narrative contained the apparition of the female to him in the cell of newgate he described in such fanciful and romantic colours that the king could not help thinking the poor mans head a little turned and as nothing was found in the kettledrum and other musical instruments brought for the use of the dukes band of foreigners he nourished some slight hope that the whole plan might be either a mere jest or that the idea of an actual conspiracy was founded in mistake  the persons who had been despatched to watch the motions of mr weivers congregation brought back word that they had quietly dispersed it was known at the same time that they had met in arms but this augured no particular design of aggression at a time when all true protestants conceived themselves in danger of immediate massacre when the fathers of the city had repeatedly called out the trainbands and alarmed the citizens of london under the idea of an instant insurrection of the catholics and when to sum the whole up in the emphatic words of an alderman of the day there was a general belief that they would all waken some unhappy morning with their throats cut who was to do these dire deeds it was more difficult to suppose but all admitted the possibility that they might be achieved since one justice of the peace was already murdered there was therefore no inference of hostile intentions against the state to be decidedly derived from a congregation of protestants par excellence military from old associations bringing their arms with them to a place of worship in the midst of a panic so universal  neither did the violent language of the minister supposing that to be proved absolutely infer meditated violence the favourite parables of the preachers and the metaphors and ornaments which they selected were at all times of a military cast and the taking the kingdom of heaven by storm a strong and beautiful metaphor when used generally as in scripture was detailed in their sermons in all the technical language of the attack and defence of a fortified place the danger in short whatever might have been its actual degree had disappeared as suddenly as a bubble upon the water when broken by a casual touch and had left as little trace behind it it became therefore matter of much doubt whether it had ever actually existed  while various reports were making from without and while their tenor was discussed by the king and such nobles and statesmen as he thought proper to consult on the occasion a gradual sadness and anxiety mingled with and finally silenced the mirth of the evening all became sensible that something unusual was going forward and the unwonted distance which charles maintained from his guests while it added greatly to the dulness that began to predominate in the presencechamber gave intimation that something unusual was labouring in the kings mind  thus play was neglectedthe music was silent or played without being heardgallants ceased to make compliments and ladies to expect them and a sort of apprehensive curiosity pervaded the circle each asked the others why they were grave and no answer was returned any more than could have been rendered by a herd of cattle instinctively disturbed by the approach of a thunderstorm  to add to the general apprehension it began to be whispered that one or two of the guests who were desirous of leaving the palace had been informed no one could be permitted to retire until the general hour of dismissal and these gliding back into the hall communicated in whispers that the sentinels at the gates were doubled and that there was a troop of the horse guards drawn up in the courtcircumstances so unusual as to excite the most anxious curiosity  such was the state of the court when wheels were heard without and the bustle which took place denoted the arrival of some person of consequence  here comes chiffinch said the king with his prey in his clutch  it was indeed the duke of buckingham nor did he approach the royal presence without emotion on entering the court the flambeaux which were borne around the carriage gleamed on the scarlet coats laced hats and drawn broadswords of the horse guardsa sight unusual and calculated to strike terror into a conscience which was none of the clearest  the duke alighted from the carriage and only said to the officer whom he saw upon duty you are late under arms tonight captain carleton  such are our orders sir answered carleton with military brevity and then commanded the four dismounted sentinels at the under gate to make way for the duke of buckingham his grace had no sooner entered than he heard behind him the command move close up sentinelscloser yet to the gate and he felt as if all chance of rescue were excluded by the sound  as he advanced up the grand staircase there were other symptoms of alarm and precaution the yeomen of the guard were mustered in unusual numbers and carried carabines instead of their halberds and the gentlemenpensioners with their partisans appeared also in proportional force in short all that sort of defence which the royal household possesses within itself seemed for some hasty and urgent reason to have been placed under arms and upon duty  buckingham ascended the royal staircase with an eye attentive to these preparations and a step steady and slow as if he counted each step on which he trode who he asked himself shall ensure christians fidelity let him but stand fast and we are secure otherwise  as he shaped the alternative he entered the presencechamber  the king stood in the midst of the apartment surrounded by the personages with whom he had been consulting the rest of the brilliant assembly scattered into groups looked on at some distance all were silent when buckingham entered in hopes of receiving some explanation of the mysteries of the evening all bent forward though etiquette forbade them to advance to catch if possible something of what was about to pass betwixt the king and his intriguing statesman at the same time those counsellors who stood around charles drew back on either side so as to permit the duke to pay his respects to his majesty in the usual form he went through the ceremonial with his accustomed grace but was received by charles with much unwonted gravity  we have waited for you some time my lord duke it is long since chiffinch left us to request your attendance here i see you are elaborately dressed your toilette was needless on the present occasion  needless to the splendour of your majestys court said the duke but not needless on my part this chanced to be black monday at york place and my club of pendables were in full glee when your majestys summons arrived i could not be in the company of ogle maniduc dawson and so forth but what i must needs make some preparation and some ablution ere entering the circle here  i trust the purification will be complete said the king without any tendency to the smile which always softened features that ungilded by its influence were dark harsh and even severe we wished to ask your grace concerning the import of a sort of musical mask which you designed us here but which miscarried as we are given to understand  it must have been a great miscarriage indeed said the duke since your majesty looks so serious on it i thought to have done your majesty pleasure as i have seen you condescend to be pleased with such passages by sending the contents of that bassviol but i fear the jest has been unacceptablei fear the fireworks may have done mischief  not the mischief they were designed for perhaps said the king gravely you see my lord we are all alive and unsinged  long may your majesty remain so said the duke yet i see there is something misconstrued on my partit must be a matter unpardonable however little intended since it hath displeased so indulgent a master  too indulgent a master indeed buckingham replied the king and the fruit of my indulgence has been to change loyal men into traitors  may it please your majesty i cannot understand this said the duke  follow us my lord answered charles and we will endeavour to explain our meaning  attended by the same lords who stood around him and followed by the duke of buckingham on whom all eyes were fixed charles retired into the same cabinet which had been the scene of repeated consultations in the course of the evening there leaning with his arms crossed on the back of an easychair charles proceeded to interrogate the suspected nobleman  let us be plain with each other speak out buckingham what in one word was to have been the regale intended for us this evening  a petty mask my lord i had destined a little dancinggirl to come out of that instrument who i thought would have performed to your majestys likinga few chinese fireworks there were thinking the entertainment was to have taken place in the marble hall might i hoped have been discharged with good effect and without the slightest alarm at the first appearance of my little sorceress and were designed to have masked as it were her entrance upon the stage i hope there have been no perukes singedno ladies frightenedno hopes of noble descent interrupted by my illfancied jest  we have seen no such fireworks my lord and your female dancer of whom we now hear for the first time came forth in the form of our old acquaintance geoffrey hudson whose dancing days are surely ended  your majesty surprises me i beseech you let christian be sent foredward christianhe will be found lodging in a large old house near sharper the cutlers in the strand as i live by bread sire i trusted him with the arrangement of this matter as indeed the dancinggirl was his property if he has done aught to dishonour my concert or disparage my character he shall die under the baton  it is singular said the king and i have often observed it that this fellow christian bears the blame of all mens enormitieshe performs the part which in a great family is usually assigned to that mischiefdoing personage nobody when chiffinch blunders he always quotes christian when sheffield writes a lampoon i am sure to hear of christian having corrected or copied or dispersed ithe is the ame damnée of every one about my courtthe scapegoat who is to carry away all their iniquities and he will have a cruel load to bear into the wilderness but for buckinghams sins in particular he is the regular and uniform sponsor and i am convinced his grace expects christian should suffer every penalty he has incurred in this world or the next  not so with the deepest reverence replied the duke i have no hope of being either hanged or damned by proxy but it is clear some one hath tampered with and altered my device if i am accused of aught let me at least hear the charge and see my accuser  that is but fair said the king bring our little friend from behind the chimneyboard hudson being accordingly produced he continued there stands the duke of buckingham repeat before him the tale you told us let him hear what were those contents of the bassviol which were removed that you might enter it be not afraid of any one but speak the truth boldly  may it please your majesty said hudson fear is a thing unknown to me  his body has no room to hold such a passion or there is too little of it to be worth fearing for said buckinghambut let him speak  ere hudson had completed his tale buckingham interrupted him by exclaiming is it possible that i can be suspected by your majesty on the word of this pitiful variety of the baboon tribe  villainlord i appeal thee to the combat said the little man highly offended at the appellation thus bestowed on him  la you there now said the dukethe little animal is quite crazed and defies a man who need ask no other weapon than a corkingpin to run him through the lungs and whose single kick could hoist him from dover to calais without yacht or wherry and what can you expect from an idiot who is engoué of a common ropedancing girl that capered on a packthread at ghent in flanders unless they were to club their talents to set up a booth at bartholomew fairis it not plain that supposing the little animal is not malicious as indeed his whole kind bear a general and most cankered malice against those who have the ordinary proportions of humanitygrant i say that this were not a malicious falsehood of his why what does it amount tothat he has mistaken squibs and chinese crackers for arms he says not he himself touched or handled them and judging by the sight alone i question if the infirm old creature when any whim or preconception hath possession of his noddle can distinguish betwixt a blunderbuss and a blackpudding  the horrible clamour which the dwarf made so soon as he heard this disparagement of his military skillthe haste with which he blundered out a detail of this warlike experiencesand the absurd grimaces which he made in order to enforce his story provoked not only the risibility of charles but even of the statesmen around him and added absurdity to the motley complexion of the scene the king terminated this dispute by commanding the dwarf to withdraw  a more regular discussion of his evidence was then resumed and ormond was the first who pointed out that it went farther than had been noticed since the little man had mentioned a certain extraordinary and treasonable conversation held by the dukes dependents by whom he had been conveyed to the palace  i am sure not to lack my lord of ormonds good word said the duke scornfully but i defy him alike and all my other enemies and shall find it easy to show that this alleged conspiracy if any grounds for it at all exist in a mere shamplot got up to turn the odium justly attached to the papists upon the protestants here is a halfhanged creature who on the very day he escapes from the gallows which many believe was his most deserved destiny comes to take away the reputation of a protestant peerand on whaton the treasonable conversation of three or four german fiddlers heard through the soundholes of a violoncello and that too when the creature was incased in it and mounted on a mans shoulders the urchin too in repeating their language shows he understands german as little as my horse does and if he did rightly hear truly comprehend and accurately report what they said still is my honour to be touched by the language held by such persons as these are with whom i have never communicated otherwise than men of my rank do with those of their calling and capacitypardon me sire if i presume to say that the profound statesmen who endeavoured to stifle the popish conspiracy by the pretended mealtub plot will take little more credit by their figments about fiddles and concertos  the assistant counsellors looked at each other and charles turned on his heel and walked through the room with long steps  at this period the peverils father and son were announced to have reached the palace and were ordered into the royal presence  these gentlemen had received the royal mandate at a moment of great interest after being dismissed from their confinement by the elder bridgenorth in the manner and upon the terms which the reader must have gathered from the conversation of the latter with christian they reached the lodgings of lady peveril who awaited them with joy mingled with terror and uncertainty the news of the acquittal had reached her by the exertions of the faithful lance outram but her mind had been since harassed by the long delay of their appearance and rumours of disturbances which had taken place in fleet street and in the strand  when the first rapturous meeting was over lady peveril with an anxious look towards her son as if recommending caution said she was now about to present to him the daughter of an old friend whom he had never there was an emphasis on the word seen before this young lady she continued was the only child of colonel mitford in north wales who had sent her to remain under her guardianship for an interval finding himself unequal to attempt the task of her education  ay ay said sir geoffrey dick mitford must be old nowbeyond the threescore and ten i think he was no chicken though a cock of the game when he joined the marquis of hertford at namptwich with two hundred wild welshmenbefore george julian i love that girl as if she was my own flesh and blood lady peveril would never have got through this work without her and dick mitford sent me a thousand pieces too in excellent time when there was scarce a cross to keep the devil from dancing in our pockets much more for these lawdoings i used it without scruple for there is wood ready to be cut at martindale when we get down there and dick mitford knows i would have done the like for him strange that he should have been the only one of my friends to reflect i might want a few pieces  whilst sir geoffrey thus run on the meeting betwixt alice and julian peveril was accomplished without any particular notice on his side except to say kiss her juliankiss her what the devil is that the way you learned to accost a lady at the isle of man as if her lips were a redhot horseshoeand do not you be offended my pretty one julian is naturally bashful and has been bred by an old lady but you will find him byandby as gallant as thou hast found me my princessand now dame peveril to dinner to dinner the old fox must have his bellytimber though the hounds have been after him the whole day  lance whose joyous congratulations were next to be undergone had the consideration to cut them short in order to provide a plain but hearty meal from the next cooks shop at which julian sat like one enchanted betwixt his mistress and his mother he easily conceived that the last was the confidential friend to whom bridgenorth had finally committed the charge of his daughter and his only anxiety now was to anticipate the confusion that was likely to arise when her real parentage was made known to his father wisely however he suffered not these anticipations to interfere with the delight of his present situation in the course of which many slight but delightful tokens of recognition were exchanged without censure under the eye of lady peveril under cover of the boisterous mirth of the old baronet who spoke for two ate for four and drank wine for halfadozen his progress in the latter exercise might have proceeded rather too far had he not been interrupted by a gentleman bearing the kings orders that he should instantly attend upon the presence at whitehall and bring his son along with him  lady peveril was alarmed and alice grew pale with sympathetic anxiety but the old knight who never saw more than what lay straight before him set it down to the kings hasty anxiety to congratulate him on his escape an interest on his majestys part which he considered by no means extravagant conscious that it was reciprocal on his own side it came upon him indeed with the more joyful surprise that he had received a previous hint ere he left the court of justice that it would be prudent in him to go down to martindale before presenting himself at courta restriction which he supposed as repugnant to his majestys feelings as it was to his own  while he consulted with lance outram about cleaning his buffbelt and swordhilt as well as time admitted lady peveril had the means to give julian more distinct information that alice was under her protection by her fathers authority and with his consent to their union if it could be accomplished she added that it was her determination to employ the mediation of the countess of derby to overcome the obstacles which might be foreseen on the part of sir geoffrey     chapter xlix                    in the kings name                   let fall your swords and daggers                                                  critic  when the father and son entered the cabinet of audience it was easily visible that sir geoffrey had obeyed the summons as he would have done the trumpets call to horse and his dishevelled grey locks and halfarranged dress though they showed zeal and haste such as he would have used when charles i called him to attend a council of war seemed rather indecorous in a pacific drawingroom he paused at the door of the cabinet but when the king called on him to advance came hastily forward with every feeling of his earlier and later life afloat and contending in his memory threw himself on his knees before the king seized his hand and without even an effort to speak wept aloud charles who generally felt deeply so long as an impressive object was before his eyes indulged for a moment the old mans rapturemy good sir geoffrey he said you have had some hard measure we owe you amends and will find time to pay our debt  no sufferingno debt said the old man i cared not what the rogues said of mei knew they could never get twelve honest fellows to believe a word of their most damnable lies i did long to beat them when they called me traitor to your majestythat i confessbut to have such an early opportunity of paying my duty to your majesty overpays it all the villains would have persuaded me i ought not to come to courtaha  the duke of ormond perceived that the king coloured much for in truth it was from the court that the private intimation had been given to sir geoffrey to go down to the country without appearing at whitehall and he moreover suspected that the jolly old knight had not risen from his dinner altogether drylipped after the fatigues of a day so agitatingmy old friend he whispered you forget that your son is to be presentedpermit me to have that honour  i crave your graces pardon humbly said sir geoffrey but it is an honour i design for myself as i apprehend no one can so utterly surrender and deliver him up to his majestys service as the father that begot him is entitled to dojulian come forward and kneelhere he is please your majestyjulian peverila chip of the old blockas stout though scarce so tall a tree as the old trunk when at the freshest take him to you sir for a faithful servant à pendre as the french say if he fears fire or steel axe or gallows in your majestys service i renounce himhe is no son of minei disown him and he may go to the isle of man the isle of dogs or the isle of devils for what i care  charles winked to ormond and having with his wonted courtesy expressed his thorough conviction that julian would imitate the loyalty of his ancestors and especially of his father added that he believed his grace of ormond had something to communicate which was of consequence to his service sir geoffrey made his military reverence at this hint and marched off in the rear of the duke who proceeded to inquire of him concerning the events of the day charles in the meanwhile having in the first place ascertained that the son was not in the same genial condition with the father demanded and received from him a precise account of all the proceedings subsequent to the trial  julian with the plainness and precision which such a subject demanded when treated in such a presence narrated all that happened down to the entrance of bridgenorth and his majesty was so much pleased with his manner that he congratulated arlington on their having gained the evidence of at least one man of sense to these dark and mysterious events but when bridgenorth was brought upon the scene julian hesitated to bestow a name upon him and although he mentioned the chapel which he had seen filled with men in arms and the violent language of the preacher he added with earnestness that notwithstanding all this the men departed without coming to any extremity and had all left the place before his father and he were set at liberty  and you retired quietly to your dinner in fleet street young man said the king severely without giving a magistrate notice of the dangerous meeting which was held in the vicinity of our palace and who did not conceal their intention of proceeding to extremities  peveril blushed and was silent the king frowned and stepped aside to communicate with ormond who reported that the father seemed to have known nothing of the matter  and the son i am sorry to say said the king seems more unwilling to speak the truth than i should have expected we have all variety of evidence in this singular investigationa mad witness like the dwarf a drunken witness like the father and now a dumb witnessyoung man he continued addressing julian your behaviour is less frank than i expected from your fathers son i must know who this person is with whom you held such familiar intercourseyou know him i presume  julian acknowledged that he did but kneeling on one knee entreated his majestys forgiveness for concealing his name he had been freed he said from his confinement on promising to that effect  that was a promise made by your own account under compulsion answered the king and i cannot authorise your keeping it it is your duty to speak the truthif you are afraid of buckingham the duke shall withdraw  i have no reason to fear the duke of buckingham said peveril that i had an affair with one of his household was the mans own fault and not mine  oddsfish said the king the light begins to break in on mei thought i remembered thy physiognomy wert thou not the very fellow whom i met at chiffinchs yonder morningthe matter escaped me since but now i recollect thou saidst then that thou wert the son of that jolly old threebottle baronet yonder  it is true said julian that i met your majesty at master chiffinchs and i am afraid had the misfortune to displease you but  no more of that young manno more of thatbut i recollect you had with you that beautiful dancing sirenbuckingham i will hold you gold to silver that she was the intended tenant of that bassfiddle  your majesty has rightly guessed it said the duke and i suspect she has put a trick upon me by substituting the dwarf in her place for christian thinks  damn christian said the king hastilyi wish they would bring him hither that universal refereeand as the wish was uttered christians arrival was announced let him attend said the king but harka thought strikes mehere master peverilyonder dancing maiden that introduced you to us by the singular agility of her performance is she not by your account a dependent of the countess of derby  i have known her such for years answered julian  then will we call the countess hither said the king it is fit we should learn who this little fairy really is and if she be now so absolutely at the beck of buckingham and this master christian of hiswhy i think it would be but charity to let her ladyship know so much since i question if she will wish in that case to retain her in her service besides he continued speaking apart this julian to whom suspicion attaches in these matters from his obstinate silence is also of the countesss household we will sift this matter to the bottom and do justice to all  the countess of derby hastily summoned entered the royal closet at one door just as christian and zarah or fenella were ushered in by the other the old knight of martindale who had ere this returned to the presence was scarce controlled even by the signs which she made so much was he desirous of greeting his old friend but as ormond laid a kind restraining hand upon his arm he was prevailed on to sit still  the countess after a deep reverence to the king acknowledged the rest of the nobility present by a slighter reverence smiled to julian peveril and looked with surprise at the unexpected apparition of fenella buckingham bit his lip for he saw the introduction of lady derby was likely to confuse and embroil every preparation which he had arranged for his defence and he stole a glance at christian whose eye when fixed on the countess assumed the deadly sharpness which sparkles in the adders while his cheek grew almost black under the influence of strong emotion  is there any one in this presence whom your ladyship recognises said the king graciously besides your old friends of ormond and arlington  i see my liege two worthy friends of my husbands house replied the countess sir geoffrey peveril and his sonthe latter a distinguished member of my sons household  any one else continued the king  an unfortunate female of my family who disappeared from the island of man at the same time when julian peveril left it upon business of importance she was thought to have fallen from the cliff into the sea  had your ladyship any reason to suspectpardon me said the king for putting such a questionany improper intimacy between master peveril and this same female attendant  my liege said the countess colouring indignantly my household is of reputation  nay my lady be not angry said the king i did but asksuch things will befall in the best regulated families  not in mine sire said the countess besides that in common pride and in common honesty julian peveril is incapable of intriguing with an unhappy creature removed by her misfortune almost beyond the limits of humanity  zarah looked at her and compressed her lips as if to keep in the words that would fain break from them  i know how it is said the kingwhat your ladyship says may be true in the main yet mens tastes have strange vagaries this girl is lost in man as soon as the youth leaves it and is found in saint james park bouncing and dancing like a fairy so soon as he appears in london  impossible said the countess she cannot dance  i believe said the king she can do more feats than your ladyship either suspects or would approve of  the countess drew up and was indignantly silent  the king proceededno sooner is peveril in newgate than by the account of the venerable little gentleman this merry maiden is even there also for company now without inquiring how she got in i think charitably that she had better taste than to come there on the dwarfs accountah ha i think master julian is touched in conscience  julian did indeed start as the king spoke for it reminded him of the midnight visit in his cell  the king looked fixedly at him and then proceededwell gentlemen peveril is carried to his trial and is no sooner at liberty than we find him in the house where the duke of buckingham was arranging what he calls a musical maskegad i hold it next to certain that this wench put the change on his grace and popt the poor dwarf into the bassviol reserving her own more precious hours to be spent with master julian peverilthink you not so sir christian you the universal referee is there any truth in this conjecture  christian stole a glance at zarah and read that in her eye which embarrassed him he did not know he said he had indeed engaged this unrivalled performer to take the proposed part in the mask and she was to have come forth in the midst of a shower of lambent fire very artificially prepared with perfumes to overcome the smell of the powder but he knew not whyexcepting that she was wilful and capricious like all great geniusesshe had certainly spoiled the concert by cramming in that more bulky dwarf  i should like said the king to see this little maiden stand forth and bear witness in such manner as she can express herself on this mysterious matter can any one here understand her mode of communication  christian said he knew something of it since he had become acquainted with her in london the countess spoke not till the king asked her and then owned dryly that she had necessarily some habitual means of intercourse with one who had been immediately about her person for so many years  i should think said charles that this same master peveril has the more direct key to her language after all we have heard  the king looked first at peveril who blushed like a maiden at the inference which the kings remark implied and then suddenly turned his eyes on the supposed mute on whose cheek a faint colour was dying away a moment afterwards at a signal from the countess fenella or zarah stepped forward and having kissed her ladys hand stood with her arms folded on her breast with a humble air as different from that which she wore in the harem of the duke of buckingham as that of a magdalene from a judith yet this was the least show of her talent of versatility for so well did she play the part of the dumb girl that buckingham sharp as his discernment was remained undecided whether the creature which stood before him could possibly be the same with her who had in a different dress made such an impression on his imagination or indeed was the imperfect creature she now represented she had at once all that could mark the imperfection of hearing and all that could show the wonderful address by which nature so often makes up of the deficiency there was the lip that trembles not at any soundthe seeming insensibility to the conversation that passed around while on the other hand was the quick and vivid glance that seemed anxious to devour the meaning of those sounds which she could gather no otherwise than by the motion of the lips  examined after her own fashion zarah confirmed the tale of christian in all its points and admitted that she had deranged the project laid for a mask by placing the dwarf in her own stead the cause of her doing so she declined to assign and the countess pressed her no farther  everything tells to exculpate my lord of buckingham said charles from so absurd an accusation the dwarfs testimony is too fantastic that of the two peverils does not in the least affect the duke that of the dumb damsel completely contradicts the possibility of his guilt methinks my lords we should acquaint him that he stands acquitted of a complaint too ridiculous to have been subjected to a more serious scrutiny than we have hastily made upon this occasion  arlington bowed in acquiescence but ormond spoke plainlyi should suffer sire in the opinion of the duke of buckingham brilliant as his talents are known to be should i say that i am satisfied in my own mind on this occasion but i subscribe to the spirit of the times and i agree it would be highly dangerous on such accusations as we have been able to collect to impeach the character of a zealous protestant like his gracehad he been a catholic under such circumstances of suspicion the tower had been too good a prison for him  buckingham bowed to the duke of ormond with a meaning which even his triumph could not disguisetu me la pagherai he muttered in a tone of deep and abiding resentment but the stout old irishman who had long since braved his utmost wrath cared little for this expression of his displeasure  the king then signing to the other nobles to pass into the public apartments stopped buckingham as he was about to follow them and when they were alone asked with a significant tone which brought all the blood in the dukes veins into his countenance when was it george that your useful friend colonel blood became a musicianyou are silent he said do not deny the charge for yonder villain once seen is remembered for ever down down on your knees george and acknowledge that you have abused my easy temperseek for no apologynone will serve your turn i saw the man myself among your germans as you call them and you know what i must needs believe from such a circumstance  believe that i have been guiltymost guilty my liege and king said the duke consciencestricken and kneeling downbelieve that i was misguidedthat i was madbelieve anything but that i was capable of harming or being accessory to harm your person  i do not believe it said the king i think of you villiers as the companion of my dangers and my exile and am so far from supposing you mean worse than you say that i am convinced you acknowledge more than ever you meant to attempt  by all that is sacred said the duke still kneeling had i not been involved to the extent of life and fortune with the villain christian  nay if you bring christian on the stage again said the king smiling it is time for me to withdraw come villiers risei forgive thee and only recommend one act of penancethe curse you yourself bestowed on the dog who bit youmarriage and retirement to your countryseat  the duke rose abashed and followed the king into the circle which charles entered leaning on the shoulder of his repentant peer to whom he showed so much countenance as led the most acute observers present to doubt the possibility of there existing any real cause for the surmises to the dukes prejudice  the countess of derby had in the meanwhile consulted with the duke of ormond with the peverils and with her other friends and by their unanimous advice though with considerable difficulty became satisfied that to have thus shown herself at court was sufficient to vindicate the honour of her house and that it was her wisest course after having done so to retire to her insular dominions without farther provoking the resentment of a powerful faction she took farewell of the king in form and demanded his permission to carry back with her the helpless creature who had so strangely escaped from her protection into a world where her condition rendered her so subject to every species of misfortune  will your ladyship forgive me said charles i have studied your sex longi am mistaken if your little maiden is not as capable of caring for herself as any of us  impossible said the countess  possible and most true whispered the king i will instantly convince you of the fact though the experiment is too delicate to be made by any but your ladyship yonder she stands looking as if she heard no more than the marble pillar against which she leans now if lady derby will contrive either to place her hand near the region of the damsels heart or at least on her arm so that she can feel the sensation of the blood when the pulse increases then do you my lord of ormond beckon julian peveril out of sighti will show you in a moment that it can stir at sounds spoken  the countess much surprised afraid of some embarrassing pleasantry on the part of charles yet unable to repress her curiosity placed herself near fenella as she called her little mute and while making signs to her contrived to place her hand on her wrist  at this moment the king passing near them said this is a horrid deedthe villain christian has stabbed young peveril  the mute evidence of the pulse which bounded as if a cannon had been discharged close by the poor girls ear was accompanied by such a loud scream of agony as distressed while it startled the goodnatured monarch himself i did but jest he said julian is well my pretty maiden i only used the wand of a certain blind deity called cupid to bring a deaf and dumb vassal of his to the exercise of her faculties  i am betrayed she said with her eyes fixed on the groundi am betrayedand it is fit that she whose life has been spent in practising treason on others should be caught in her own snare but where is my tutor in iniquitywhere is christian who taught me to play the part of spy on this unsuspicious lady until i had wellnigh delivered her into his bloody hands  this said the king craves more secret examination let all leave the apartment who are not immediately connected with these proceedings and let this christian be again brought before uswretched man he continued addressing christian what wiles are these you have practised and by what extraordinary means  she has betrayed me then said christianbetrayed me to bonds and death merely for an idle passion which can never be successfulbut know zarah he added addressing her sternly when my life is forfeited through thy evidence the daughter has murdered the father  the unfortunate girl stared on him in astonishment you said at length she stammered forth that i was the daughter of your slaughtered brother  that was partly to reconcile thee to the part thou wert to play in my destined drama of vengeancepartly to hide what men call the infamy of thy birth but my daughter thou art and from the eastern clime in which thy mother was born you derive that fierce torrent of passion which i laboured to train to my purposes but which turned into another channel has become the cause of your fathers destructionmy destiny is the tower i suppose  he spoke these words with great composure and scarce seemed to regard the agonies of his daughter who throwing herself at his feet sobbed and wept most bitterly  this must not be said the king moved with compassion at this scene of misery if you consent christian to leave this country there is a vessel in the river bound for new englandgo carry your dark intrigues to other lands  i might dispute the sentence said christian boldly and if i submit to it it is a matter of my own choiceone halfhour had made me even with that proud woman but fortune hath cast the balance against merise zarah fenella no more tell the lady of derby that if the daughter of edward christian the niece of her murdered victim served her as a menial it was but for the purpose of vengeancemiserably miserably frustratedthou seest thy folly nowthou wouldst follow yonder ungrateful striplingthou wouldst forsake all other thoughts to gain his slightest notice and now thou art a forlorn outcast ridiculed and insulted by those on whose necks you might have trod had you governed yourself with more wisdombut come thou art still my daughterthere are other skies than that which canopies britain  stop him said the king we must know by what means this maiden found access to those confined in our prisons  i refer your majesty to your most protestant jailer and to the most protestant peers who in order to obtain perfect knowledge of the depth of the popish plot have contrived these ingenious apertures for visiting them in their cells by night or day his grace of buckingham can assist your majesty if you are inclined to make the inquiry   it was said that very unfair means were used to compel the     prisoners committed on account of the popish plot to make     disclosures and that several of them were privately put to the     torture  christian said the duke thou art the most barefaced villain who ever breathed  of a commoner i may answered christian and led his daughter out of the presence  see after him selby said the king lose not sight of him till the ship sail if he dare return to britain it shall be at his peril would to god we had as good riddance of others as dangerous and i would also he added after a moments pause that all our political intrigues and feverish alarms could terminate as harmlessly as now here is a plot without a drop of blood and all the elements of a romance without its conclusion here we have a wandering island princess i pray my lady of derbys pardon a dwarf a moorish sorceress an impenitent rogue and a repentant man of rank and yet all ends without either hanging or marriage  not altogether without the latter said the countess who had an opportunity during the evening of much private conversation with julian peveril there is a certain major bridgenorth who since your majesty relinquishes farther inquiry into these proceedings which he had otherwise intended to abide designs as we are informed to leave england for ever now this bridgenorth by dint of law hath acquired strong possession over the domains of peveril which he is desirous to restore to the ancient owners with much fair land besides conditionally that our young julian will receive them as the dowry of his only child and heir  by my faith said the king she must be a foulfavoured wench indeed if julian requires to be pressed to accept her on such fair conditions  they love each other like lovers of the last age said the countess but the stout old knight likes not the roundheaded alliance  our royal recommendation shall put that to rights said the king sir geoffrey peveril has not suffered hardship so often at our command that he will refuse our recommendation when it comes to make him amends for all his losses  it may be supposed the king did not speak without being fully aware of the unlimited ascendancy which he possessed over the old tory for within four weeks afterwards the bells of martindalemoultrassie were ringing for the union of the families from whose estates it takes its compound name and the beaconlight of the castle blazed high over hill and dale and summoned all to rejoice who were within twenty miles of its gleam                                   the end
