 conclusion      book ii  in court and camp continued    28 joan foretells her doom  the troops must have a rest two days would be allowed for this the morning of the 14th i was writing from joans dictation in a small room which she sometimes used as a private office when she wanted to get away from officials and their interruptions catherine boucher came in and sat down and said  joan dear i want you to talk to me  indeed i am not sorry for that but glad what is in your mind  this i scarcely slept last night for thinking of the dangers you are running the paladin told me how you made the duke stand out of the way when the cannonballs were flying all about and so saved his life  well that was right wasnt it  right yes but you stayed there yourself why will you do like that it seems such a wanton risk  oh no it was not so i was not in any danger  how can you say that joan with those deadly things flying all about you  joan laughed and tried to turn the subject but catherine persisted she said  it was horribly dangerous and it could not be necessary to stay in such a place and you led an assault again joan it is tempting providence i want you to make me a promise i want you to promise me that you will let others lead the assaults if there must be assaults and that you will take better care of yourself in those dreadful battles will you  but joan fought away from the promise and did not give it catherine sat troubled and discontented awhile then she said  joan are you going to be a soldier always these wars are so longso long they last forever and ever and ever  there was a glad flash in joans eye as she cried  this campaign will do all the really hard work that is in front of it in the next four days the rest of it will be gentleroh far less bloody yes in four days france will gather another trophy like the redemption of orleans and make her second long step toward freedom  catherine started and so did i then she gazed long at joan like one in a trance murmuring four daysfour days as if to herself and unconsciously finally she asked in a low voice that had something of awe in it  joan tell mehow is it that you know that for you do know it i think  yes said joan dreamily i knowi know i shall strikeand strike again and before the fourth day is finished i shall strike yet again she became silent we sat wondering and still this was for a whole minute she looking at the floor and her lips moving but uttering nothing then came these words but hardly audible and in a thousand years the english power in france will not rise up from that blow  it made my flesh creep it was uncanny she was in a trance againi could see itjust as she was that day in the pastures of domremy when she prophesied about us boys in the war and afterward did not know that she had done it she was not conscious now but catherine did not know that and so she said in a happy voice  oh i believe it i believe it and i am so glad then you will come back and bide with us all your life long and we will love you so and honor you  a scarcely perceptible spasm flitted across joans face and the dreamy voice muttered  before two years are sped i shall die a cruel death  i sprang forward with a warning hand up that is why catherine did not scream she was going to do thati saw it plainly then i whispered her to slip out of the place and say nothing of what had happened i said joan was asleepasleep and dreaming catherine whispered back and said  oh i am so grateful that it is only a dream it sounded like prophecy and she was gone  like prophecy i knew it was prophecy and i sat down crying as knowing we should lose her soon she started shivering slightly and came to herself and looked around and saw me crying there and jumped out of her chair and ran to me all in a whirl of sympathy and compassion and put her hand on my head and said  my poor boy what is it look up and tell me  i had to tell her a lie i grieved to do it but there was no other way i picked up an old letter from my table written by heaven knows who about some matter heaven knows what and told her i had just gotten it from pere fronte and that in it it said the childrens fairy tree had been chopped down by some miscreant or other and i got no further she snatched the letter from my hand and searched it up and down and all over turning it this way and that and sobbing great sobs and the tears flowing down her cheeks and ejaculating all the time oh cruel cruel how could any be so heartless ah poor arbre fee de bourlemont goneand we children loved it so show me the place where it says it  and i still lying showed her the pretended fatal words on the pretended fatal page and she gazed at them through her tears and said she could see herself that they were hateful ugly wordsthey had the very look of it  then we heard a strong voice down the corridor announcing  his majestys messengerwith despatches for her excellency the commanderinchief of the armies of france      29 fierce talbot reconsiders  i knew she had seen the wisdom of the tree but when i could not know doubtless before she had lately told the king to use her for that she had but one year left to work in it had not occurred to me at the time but the conviction came upon me now that at that time she had already seen the tree it had brought her a welcome message that was plain otherwise she could not have been so joyous and lighthearted as she had been these latter days the deathwarning had nothing dismal about it for her no it was remission of exile it was leave to come home  yes she had seen the tree no one had taken the prophecy to heart which she made to the king and for a good reason no doubt no one wanted to take it to heart all wanted to banish it away and forget it and all had succeeded and would go on to the end placid and comfortable all but me alone i must carry my awful secret without any to help me a heavy load a bitter burden and would cost me a daily heartbreak she was to die and so soon i had never dreamed of that how could i and she so strong and fresh and young and every day earning a new right to a peaceful and honored old age for at that time i thought old age valuable i do not know why but i thought so all young people think it i believe they being ignorant and full of superstitions she had seen the tree all that miserable night those ancient verses went floating back and forth through my brain        and when in exile wandring we      shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee      oh rise upon our sight  but at dawn the bugles and the drums burst through the dreamy hush of the morning and it was turn out all mount and ride for there was red work to be done  we marched to meung without halting there we carried the bridge by assault and left a force to hold it the rest of the army marching away next morning toward beaugency where the lion talbot the terror of the french was in command when we arrived at that place the english retired into the castle and we sat down in the abandoned town  talbot was not at the moment present in person for he had gone away to watch for and welcome fastolfe and his reinforcement of five thousand men  joan placed her batteries and bombarded the castle till night then some news came richemont constable of france this long time in disgrace with the king largely because of the evil machinations of la tremouille and his party was approaching with a large body of men to offer his services to joanand very much she needed them now that fastolfe was so close by richemont had wanted to join us before when we first marched on orleans but the foolish king slave of those paltry advisers of his warned him to keep his distance and refused all reconciliation with him  i go into these details because they are important important because they lead up to the exhibition of a new gift in joans extraordinary mental makeupstatesmanship it is a sufficiently strange thing to find that great quality in an ignorant countrygirl of seventeen and a half but she had it  joan was for receiving richemont cordially and so was la hire and the two young lavals and other chiefs but the lieutenantgeneral dalencon strenuously and stubbornly opposed it he said he had absolute orders from the king to deny and defy richemont and that if they were overridden he would leave the army this would have been a heavy disaster indeed but joan set herself the task of persuading him that the salvation of france took precedence of all minor thingseven the commands of a sceptered ass and she accomplished it she persuaded him to disobey the king in the interest of the nation and to be reconciled to count richemont and welcome him that was statesmanship and of the highest and soundest sort whatever thing men call great look for it in joan of arc and there you will find it  in the early morning june 17th the scouts reported the approach of talbot and fastolfe with fastolfes succoring force then the drums beat to arms and we set forth to meet the english leaving richemont and his troops behind to watch the castle of beaugency and keep its garrison at home by and by we came in sight of the enemy fastolfe had tried to convince talbot that it would be wisest to retreat and not risk a battle with joan at this time but distribute the new levies among the english strongholds of the loire thus securing them against capture then be patient and waitwait for more levies from paris let joan exhaust her army with fruitless daily skirmishing then at the right time fall upon her in resistless mass and annihilate her he was a wise old experienced general was fastolfe but that fierce talbot would hear of no delay he was in a rage over the punishment which the maid had inflicted upon him at orleans and since and he swore by god and saint george that he would have it out with her if he had to fight her all alone so fastolfe yielded though he said they were now risking the loss of everything which the english had gained by so many years work and so many hard knocks  the enemy had taken up a strong position and were waiting in order of battle with their archers to the front and a stockade before them  night was coming on a messenger came from the english with a rude defiance and an offer of battle but joans dignity was not ruffled her bearing was not discomposed she said to the herald  go back and say it is too late to meet tonight but tomorrow please god and our lady we will come to close quarters  the night fell dark and rainy it was that sort of light steady rain which falls so softly and brings to ones spirit such serenity and peace about ten oclock dalencon the bastard of orleans la hire pothon of saintrailles and two or three other generals came to our headquarters tent and sat down to discuss matters with joan some thought it was a pity that joan had declined battle some thought not then pothon asked her why she had declined it she said  there was more than one reason these english are oursthey cannot get away from us wherefore there is no need to take risks as at other times the day was far spent it is good to have much time and the fair light of day when ones force is in a weakened statenine hundred of us yonder keeping the bridge of meung under the marshal de rais fifteen hundred with the constable of france keeping the bridge and watching the castle of beaugency  dunois said  i grieve for this decision excellency but it cannot be helped and the case will be the same the morrow as to that  joan was walking up and down just then she laughed her affectionate comrady laugh and stopping before that old wartiger she put her small hand above his head and touched one of his plumes saying  now tell me wise man which feather is it that i touch  in sooth excellency that i cannot  name of god bastard bastard you cannot tell me this small thing yet are bold to name a large onetelling us what is in the stomach of the unborn morrow that we shall not have those men now it is my thought that they will be with us  that made a stir all wanted to know why she thought that but la hire took the word and said  let be if she thinks it that is enough it will happen  then pothon of santrailles said  there were other reasons for declining battle according to the saying of your excellency  yes one was that we being weak and the day far gone the battle might not be decisive when it is fought it must be decisive and it shall be  god grant it and amen there were still other reasons  one otheryes she hesitated a moment then said this was not the day tomorrow is the day it is so written  they were going to assail her with eager questionings but she put up her hand and prevented them then she said  it will be the most noble and beneficent victory that god has vouchsafed for france at any time i pray you question me not as to whence or how i know this thing but be content that it is so  there was pleasure in every face and conviction and high confidence a murmur of conversation broke out but that was interrupted by a messenger from the outposts who brought newsnamely that for an hour there had been stir and movement in the english camp of a sort unusual at such a time and with a resting army he said spies had been sent under cover of the rain and darkness to inquire into it they had just come back and reported that large bodies of men had been dimly made out who were slipping stealthily away in the direction of meung  the generals were very much surprised as any might tell from their faces  it is a retreat said joan  it has that look said dalencon  it certainly has observed the bastard and la hire  it was not to be expected said louis de bourbon but one can divine the purpose of it  yes responded joan talbot has reflected his rash brain has cooled he thinks to take the bridge of meung and escape to the other side of the river he knows that this leaves his garrison of beaugency at the mercy of fortune to escape our hands if it can but there is no other course if he would avoid this battle and that he also knows but he shall not get the bridge we will see to that  yes said dalencon we must follow him and take care of that matter what of beaugency  leave beaugency to me gentle duke i will have it in two hours and at no cost of blood  it is true excellency you will but need to deliver this news there and receive the surrender  yes and i will be with you at meung with the dawn fetching the constable and his fifteen hundred and when talbot knows that beaugency has fallen it will have an effect upon him  by the mass yes cried la hire he will join his meung garrison to his army and break for paris then we shall have our bridge force with us again along with our beaugency watchers and be stronger for our great days work by fourandtwenty hundred able soldiers as was here promised within the hour verily this englishman is doing our errands for us and saving us much blood and trouble orders excellencygive us orders  they are simple let the men rest three hours longer at one oclock the advanceguard will march under our command with pothon of saintrailles as second the second division will follow at two under the lieutenantgeneral keep well in the rear of the enemy and see to it that you avoid an engagement i will ride under guard to beaugency and make so quick work there that i and the constable of france will join you before dawn with his men  she kept her word her guard mounted and we rode off through the puttering rain taking with us a captured english officer to confirm joans news we soon covered the journey and summoned the castle richard guetin talbots lieutenant being convinced that he and his five hundred men were left helpless conceded that it would be useless to try to hold out he could not expect easy terms yet joan granted them nevertheless his garrison could keep their horses and arms and carry away property to the value of a silver mark per man they could go whither they pleased but must not take arms against france again under ten days  before dawn we were with our army again and with us the constable and nearly all his men for we left only a small garrison in beaugency castle we heard the dull booming of cannon to the front and knew that talbot was beginning his attack on the bridge but some time before it was yet light the sound ceased and we heard it no more  guetin had sent a messenger through our lines under a safeconduct given by joan to tell talbot of the surrender of course this poursuivant had arrived ahead of us talbot had held it wisdom to turn now and retreat upon paris when daylight came he had disappeared and with him lord scales and the garrison of meung  what a harvest of english strongholds we had reaped in those three daysstrongholds which had defied france with quite cool confidence and plenty of it until we came      30 the red field of patay  when the morning broke at last on that forever memorable 18th of june there was no enemy discoverable anywhere as i have said but that did not trouble me i knew we should find him and that we should strike him strike him the promised blowthe one from which the english power in france would not rise up in a thousand years as joan had said in her trance  the enemy had plunged into the wide plains of la beaucea roadless waste covered with bushes with here and there bodies of forest treesa region where an army would be hidden from view in a very little while we found the trail in the soft wet earth and followed it it indicated an orderly march no confusion no panic  but we had to be cautious in such a piece of country we could walk into an ambush without any trouble therefore joan sent bodies of cavalry ahead under la hire pothon and other captains to feel the way some of the other officers began to show uneasiness this sort of hideandgoseek business troubled them and made their confidence a little shaky joan divined their state of mind and cried out impetuously  name of god what would you we must smite these english and we will they shall not escape us though they were hung to the clouds we would get them  by and by we were nearing patay it was about a league away now at this time our reconnaissance feeling its way in the bush frightened a deer and it went bounding away and was out of sight in a moment then hardly a minute later a dull great shout went up in the distance toward patay it was the english soldiery they had been shut up in a garrison so long on moldy food that they could not keep their delight to themselves when this fine fresh meat came springing into their midst poor creature it had wrought damage to a nation which loved it well for the french knew where the english were now whereas the english had no suspicion of where the french were  la hire halted where he was and sent back the tidings joan was radiant with joy the duke dalencon said to her  very well we have found them shall we fight them  have you good spurs prince  why will they make us run away  nenni en nom de dieu these english are oursthey are lost they will fly who overtakes them will need good spurs forwardclose up  by the time we had come up with la hire the english had discovered our presence talbots force was marching in three bodies first his advanceguard then his artillery then his battlecorps a good way in the rear he was now out of the bush and in a fair open country he at once posted his artillery his advanceguard and five hundred picked archers along some hedges where the french would be obliged to pass and hoped to hold this position till his battlecorps could come up sir john fastolfe urged the battlecorps into a gallop joan saw her opportunity and ordered la hire to advancewhich la hire promptly did launching his wild riders like a stormwind his customary fashion  the duke and the bastard wanted to follow but joan said  not yetwait  so they waitedimpatiently and fidgeting in their saddles but she was readygazing straight before her measuring weighing calculatingby shades minutes fractions of minutes secondswith all her great soul present in eye and set of head and noble pose of bodybut patient steady master of herselfmaster of herself and of the situation  and yonder receding receding plumes lifting and falling lifting and falling streamed the thundering charge of la hires godless crew la hires great figure dominating it and his sword stretched aloft like a flagstaff  oh satan and his hellions see them go somebody muttered it in deep admiration  and now he was closing upclosing up on fastolfes rushing corps  and now he struck itstruck it hard and broke its order it lifted the duke and the bastard in their saddles to see it and they turned trembling with excitement to joan saying  now  but she put up her hand still gazing weighing calculating and said again  waitnot yet  fastolfes harddriven battlecorps raged on like an avalanche toward the waiting advanceguard suddenly these conceived the idea that it was flying in panic before joan and so in that instant it broke and swarmed away in a mad panic itself with talbot storming and cursing after it  now was the golden time joan drove her spurs home and waved the advance with her sword follow me she cried and bent her head to her horses neck and sped away like the wind  we went down into the confusion of that flying rout and for three long hours we cut and hacked and stabbed at last the bugles sang halt  the battle of patay was won  joan of arc dismounted and stood surveying that awful field lost in thought presently she said  the praise is to god he has smitten with a heavy hand this day after a little she lifted her face and looking afar off said with the manner of one who is thinking aloud in a thousand yearsa thousand yearsthe english power in france will not rise up from this blow she stood again a time thinking then she turned toward her grouped generals and there was a glory in her face and a noble light in her eye and she said  oh friends friends do you knowdo you comprehend france is on the way to be free  and had never been but for joan of arc said la hire passing before her and bowing low the other following and doing likewise he muttering as he went i will say it though i be damned for it then battalion after battalion of our victorious army swung by wildly cheering and they shouted live forever maid of orleans live forever while joan smiling stood at the salute with her sword  this was not the last time i saw the maid of orleans on the red field of patay toward the end of the day i came upon her where the dead and dying lay stretched all about in heaps and winrows our men had mortally wounded an english prisoner who was too poor to pay a ransom and from a distance she had seen that cruel thing done and had galloped to the place and sent for a priest and now she was holding the head of her dying enemy in her lap and easing him to his death with comforting soft words just as his sister might have done and the womanly tears running down her face all the time 1  1 lord ronald gower joan of arc p 82 says michelet discovered this story in the deposition of joan of arcs page louis de conte who was probably an eyewitness of the scene this is true it was a part of the testimony of the author of these personal recollections of joan of arc given by him in the rehabilitation proceedings of 1456 translator      31 france begins to live again   joan had said true france was on the way to be free  the war called the hundred years war was very sick today sick on its english sidefor the very first time since its birth ninetyone years gone by  shall we judge battles by the numbers killed and the ruin wrought or shall we not rather judge them by the results which flowed from them any one will say that a battle is only truly great or small according to its results yes any one will grant that for it is the truth  judged by results patays place is with the few supremely great and imposing battles that have been fought since the peoples of the world first resorted to arms for the settlement of their quarrels so judged it is even possible that patay has no peer among that few just mentioned but stand alone as the supremest of historic conflicts for when it began france lay gasping out the remnant of an exhausted life her case wholly hopeless in the view of all political physicians when it ended three hours later she was convalescent convalescent and nothing requisite but time and ordinary nursing to bring her back to perfect health the dullest physician of them all could see this and there was none to deny it  many deathsick nations have reached convalescence through a series of battles a procession of battles a weary tale of wasting conflicts stretching over years but only one has reached it in a single day and by a single battle that nation is france and that battle patay  remember it and be proud of it for you are french and it is the stateliest fact in the long annals of your country there it stands with its head in the clouds and when you grow up you will go on pilgrimage to the field of patay and stand uncovered in the presence ofwhat a monument with its head in the clouds yes for all nations in all times have built monuments on their battlefields to keep green the memory of the perishable deed that was wrought there and of the perishable name of him who wrought it and will france neglect patay and joan of arc not for long and will she build a monument scaled to their rank as compared with the worlds other fields and heroes perhapsif there be room for it under the arch of the sky  but let us look back a little and consider certain strange and impressive facts the hundred years war began in 1337 it raged on and on year after year and year after year and at last england stretched france prone with that fearful blow at crecy but she rose and struggled on year after year and at last again she went down under another devastating blowpoitiers she gathered her crippled strength once more and the war raged on and on and still on year after year decade after decade children were born grew up married diedthe war raged on their children in turn grew up married diedthe war raged on their children growing saw france struck down again this time under the incredible disaster of agincourtand still the war raged on year after year and in time these children married in their turn  france was a wreck a ruin a desolation the half of it belonged to england with none to dispute or deny the truth the other half belonged to nobodyin three months would be flying the english flag the french king was making ready to throw away his crown and flee beyond the seas  now came the ignorant countrymaid out of her remote village and confronted this hoary war this allconsuming conflagration that had swept the land for three generations then began the briefest and most amazing campaign that is recorded in history in seven weeks it was finished in seven weeks she hopelessly crippled that gigantic war that was ninetyone years old at orleans she struck it a staggering blow on the field of patay she broke its back  think of it yes one can do that but understand it ah that is another matter none will ever be able to comprehend that stupefying marvel  seven weekswith her and there a little bloodshed perhaps the most of it in any single fight at patay where the english began six thousand strong and left two thousand dead upon the field it is said and believed that in three battles alonecrecy poitiers and agincourtnear a hundred thousand frenchmen fell without counting the thousand other fights of that long war the dead of that war make a mournful long listan interminable list of men slain in the field the count goes by tens of thousands of innocent women and children slain by bitter hardship and hunger it goes by that appalling term millions  it was an ogre that war an ogre that went about for near a hundred years crunching men and dripping blood from its jaws and with her little hand that child of seventeen struck him down and yonder he lies stretched on the field of patay and will not get up any more while this old world lasts      32 the joyous news flies fast  the great news of patay was carried over the whole of france in twenty hours people said i do not know as to that but one thing is sure anyway the moment a man got it he flew shouting and glorifying god and told his neighbor and that neighbor flew with it to the next homestead and so on and so on without resting the word traveled and when a man got it in the night at what hour soever he jumped out of his bed and bore the blessed message along and the joy that went with it was like the light that flows across the land when an eclipse is receding from the face of the sun and indeed you may say that france had lain in an eclipse this long time yes buried in a black gloom which these beneficent tidings were sweeping away now before the onrush of their white splendor  the news beat the flying enemy to yeuville and the town rose against its english masters and shut the gates against their brethren it flew to mont pipeau to saint simon and to this that and the other english fortress and straightway the garrison applied the torch and took to the fields and the woods a detachment of our army occupied meung and pillaged it  when we reached orleans that tow was as much as fifty times insaner with joy than we had ever seen it beforewhich is saying much night had just fallen and the illuminations were on so wonderful a scale that we seemed to plow through seas of fire and as to the noisethe hoarse cheering of the multitude the thundering of cannon the clash of bellsindeed there was never anything like it and everywhere rose a new cry that burst upon us like a storm when the column entered the gates and nevermore ceased welcome to joan of arcway for the savior of france and there was another cry crecy is avenged poitiers is avenged agincourt is avengedpatay shall live forever  mad why you never could imagine it in the world the prisoners were in the center of the column when that came along and the people caught sight of their masterful old enemy talbot that had made them dance so long to his grim warmusic you may imagine what the uproar was like if you can for i can not describe it they were so glad to see him that presently they wanted to have him out and hang him so joan had him brought up to the front to ride in her protection they made a striking pair      33 joans five great deeds  yes orleans was in a delirium of felicity she invited the king and made sumptuous preparations to receive him buthe didnt come he was simply a serf at that time and la tremouille was his master master and serf were visiting together at the masters castle of sullysurloire  at beaugency joan had engaged to bring about a reconciliation between the constable richemont and the king she took richemont to sullysurloire and made her promise good  the great deeds of joan of arc are five  1 the raising of the siege  2 the victory of patay  3 the reconciliation at sullysurloire  4 the coronation of the king  5 the bloodless march  we shall come to the bloodless march presently and the coronation it was the victorious long march which joan made through the enemys country from gien to rheims and thence to the gates of paris capturing every english town and fortress that barred the road from the beginning of the journey to the end of it and this by the mere force of her name and without shedding a drop of bloodperhaps the most extraordinary campaign in this regard in historythis is the most glorious of her military exploits  the reconciliation was one of joans most important achievements no one else could have accomplished it and in fact no one else of high consequence had any disposition to try in brains in scientific warfare and in statesmanship the constable richemont was the ablest man in france his loyalty was sincere his probity was above suspicionand it made him sufficiently conspicuous in that trivial and conscienceless court  in restoring richemont to france joan made thoroughly secure the successful completion of the great work which she had begun she had never seen richemont until he came to her with his little army was it not wonderful that at a glance she should know him for the one man who could finish and perfect her work and establish it in perpetuity how was it that that child was able to do this it was because she had the seeing eye as one of our knights had once said yes she had that great giftalmost the highest and rarest that has been granted to man nothing of an extraordinary sort was still to be done yet the remaining work could not safely be left to the kings idiots for it would require wise statesmanship and long and patient though desultory hammering of the enemy now and then for a quarter of a century yet there would be a little fighting to do and a handy man could carry that on with small disturbance to the rest of the country and little by little and with progressive certainty the english would disappear from france  and that happened under the influence of richemont the king became at a later time a mana man a king a brave and capable and determined soldier within six years after patay he was leading storming parties himself fighting in fortress ditches up to his waist in water and climbing scalingladders under a furious fire with a pluck that would have satisfied even joan of arc in time he and richemont cleared away all the english even from regions where the people had been under their mastership for three hundred years in such regions wise and careful work was necessary for the english rule had been fair and kindly and men who have been ruled in that way are not always anxious for a change  which of joans five chief deeds shall we call the chiefest it is my thought that each in its turn was that this is saying that taken as a whole they equalized each other and neither was then greater than its mate  do you perceive each was a stage in an ascent to leave out one of them would defeat the journey to achieve one of them at the wrong time and in the wrong place would have the same effect  consider the coronation as a masterpiece of diplomacy where can you find its superior in our history did the king suspect its vast importance no did his ministers no did the astute bedford representative of the english crown no an advantage of incalculable importance was here under the eyes of the king and of bedford the king could get it by a bold stroke bedford could get it without an effort but being ignorant of its value neither of them put forth his hand of all the wise people in high office in france only one knew the priceless worth of this neglected prizethe untaught child of seventeen joan of arcand she had known it from the beginning as an essential detail of her mission  how did she know it it was simple she was a peasant that tells the whole story she was of the people and knew the people those others moved in a loftier sphere and knew nothing much about them we make little account of that vague formless inert mass that mighty underlying force which we call the peoplean epithet which carries contempt with it it is a strange attitude for at bottom we know that the throne which the people support stands and that when that support is removed nothing in this world can save it  now then consider this fact and observe its importance whatever the parish priest believes his flock believes they love him they revere him he is their unfailing friend their dauntless protector their comforter in sorrow their helper in their day of need he has their whole confidence what he tells them to do that they will do with a blind and affectionate obedience let it cost what it may add these facts thoughtfully together and what is the sum this the parish priest governs the nation what is the king then if the parish priest withdraws his support and deny his authority merely a shadow and no king let him resign  do you get that idea then let us proceed a priest is consecrated to his office by the awful hand of god laid upon him by his appointed representative on earth that consecration is final nothing can undo it nothing can remove it neither the pope nor any other power can strip the priest of his office god gave it and it is forever sacred and secure the dull parish knows all this to priest and parish whatsoever is anointed of god bears an office whose authority can no longer be disputed or assailed to the parish priest and to his subjects the nation an uncrowned king is a similitude of a person who has been named for holy orders but has not been consecrated he has no office he has not been ordained another may be appointed to his place in a word an uncrowned king is a doubtful king but if god appoint him and his servant the bishop anoint him the doubt is annihilated the priest and the parish are his loyal subjects straightway and while he lives they will recognize no king but him  to joan of arc the peasantgirl charles vii was no king until he was crowned to her he was only the dauphin that is to say the heir if i have ever made her call him king it was a mistake she called him the dauphin and nothing else until after the coronation it shows you as in a mirrorfor joan was a mirror in which the lowly hosts of france were clearly reflectedthat to all that vast underlying force called the people he was no king but only dauphin before his crowning and was indisputably and irrevocably king after it  now you understand what a colossal move on the political chessboard the coronation was bedford realized this by and by and tried to patch up his mistake by crowning his king but what good could that do none in the world  speaking of chess joans great acts may be likened to that game each move was made in its proper order and it as great and effective because it was made in its proper order and not out of it each at the time made seemed the greatest move but the final result made them all recognizable as equally essential and equally important this is the game as played  1 joan moves to orleans and pataycheck  2 then moves the reconciliationbut does not proclaim check it being a move for position and to take effect later  3 next she moves the coronationcheck  4 next the bloodless marchcheck  5 final move after her death the reconciled constable richemont to the french kings elbowcheckmate      34 the jests of the burgundians  the campaign of the loire had as good as opened the road to rheims there was no sufficient reason now why the coronation should not take place the coronation would complete the mission which joan had received from heaven and then she would be forever done with war and would fly home to her mother and her sheep and never stir from the hearthstone and happiness any more that was her dream and she could not rest she was so impatient to see it fulfilled she became so possessed with this matter that i began to lose faith in her two prophecies of her early deathand of course when i found that faith wavering i encouraged it to waver all the more  the king was afraid to start to rheims because the road was mileposted with english fortresses so to speak joan held them in light esteem and not things to be afraid of in the existing modified condition of english confidence  and she was right as it turned out the march to rheims was nothing but a holiday excursion joan did not even take any artillery along she was so sure it would not be necessary we marched from gien twelve thousand strong this was the 29th of june the maid rode by the side of the king on his other side was the duke dalencon after the duke followed three other princes of the blood after these followed the bastard of orleans the marshal de boussac and the admiral of france after these came la hire saintrailles tremouille and a long procession of knights and nobles  we rested three days before auxerre the city provisioned the army and a deputation waited upon the king but we did not enter the place  saintflorentin opened its gates to the king  on the 4th of july we reached saintfal and yonder lay troyes before usa town which had a burning interest for us boys for we remembered how seven years before in the pastures of domremy the sunflower came with his black flag and brought us the shameful news of the treaty of troyesthat treaty which gave france to england and a daughter of our royal line in marriage to the butcher of agincourt that poor town was not to blame of course yet we flushed hot with that old memory and hoped there would be a misunderstanding here for we dearly wanted to storm the place and burn it it was powerfully garrisoned by english and burgundian soldiery and was expecting reinforcements from paris before night we camped before its gates and made rough work with a sortie which marched out against us  joan summoned troyes to surrender its commandant seeing that she had no artillery scoffed at the idea and sent her a grossly insulting reply five days we consulted and negotiated no result the king was about to turn back now and give up he was afraid to go on leaving this strong place in his rear then la hire put in a word with a slap in it for some of his majestys advisers  the maid of orleans undertook this expedition of her own motion and it is my mind that it is her judgment that should be followed here and not that of any other let him be of whatsoever breed and standing he may  there was wisdom and righteousness in that so the king sent for the maid and asked her how she thought the prospect looked she said without any tone of doubt or question in her voice  in three days time the place is ours  the smug chancellor put in a word now  if we were sure of it we would wait her six days  six days forsooth name of god man we will enter the gates tomorrow  then she mounted and rode her lines crying out  make preparationto your work friends to your work we assault at dawn  she worked hard that night slaving away with her own hands like a common soldier she ordered fascines and fagots to be prepared and thrown into the fosse thereby to bridge it and in this rough labor she took a mans share  at dawn she took her place at the head of the storming force and the bugles blew the assault at that moment a flag of truce was flung to the breeze from the walls and troyes surrendered without firing a shot  the next day the king with joan at his side and the paladin bearing her banner entered the town in state at the head of the army and a goodly army it was now for it had been growing ever bigger and bigger from the first  and now a curious thing happened by the terms of the treaty made with the town the garrison of english and burgundian soldiery were to be allowed to carry away their goods with them this was well for otherwise how would they buy the wherewithal to live very well these people were all to go out by the one gate and at the time set for them to depart we young fellows went to that gate along with the dwarf to see the marchout presently here they came in an interminable file the footsoldiers in the lead as they approached one could see that each bore a burden of a bulk and weight to sorely tax his strength and we said among ourselves truly these folk are well off for poor common soldiers when they were come nearer what do you think every rascal of them had a french prisoner on his back they were carrying away their goods you seetheir propertystrictly according to the permission granted by the treaty  now think how clever that was how ingenious what could a body say what could a body do for certainly these people were within their right these prisoners were property nobody could deny that my dears if those had been english captives conceive of the richness of that booty for english prisoners had been scarce and precious for a hundred years whereas it was a different matter with french prisoners they had been overabundant for a century the possessor of a french prisoner did not hold him long for ransom as a rule but presently killed him to save the cost of his keep this shows you how small was the value of such a possession in those times when we took troyes a calf was worth thirty francs a sheep sixteen a french prisoner eight it was an enormous price for those other animalsa price which naturally seems incredible to you it was the war you see it worked two ways it made meat dear and prisoners cheap  well here were these poor frenchmen being carried off what could we do very little of a permanent sort but we did what we could we sent a messenger flying to joan and we and the french guards halted the procession for a parleyto gain time you see a big burgundian lost his temper and swore a great oath that none should stop him he would go and would take his prisoner with him but we blocked him off and he saw that he was mistaken about goinghe couldnt do it he exploded into the maddest cursings and revilings then and unlashing his prisoner from his back stood him up all bound and helpless then drew his knife and said to us with a light of sarcasting triumph in his eye  i may not carry him away you sayyet he is mine none will dispute it since i may not convey him hence this property of mine there is another way yes i can kill him not even the dullest among you will question that right ah you had not thought of thatvermin  that poor starved fellow begged us with his piteous eyes to save him then spoke and said he had a wife and little children at home think how it wrung our heartstrings but what could we do the burgundian was within his right we could only beg and plead for the prisoner which we did and the burgundian enjoyed it he stayed his hand to hear more of it and laugh at it that stung then the dwarf said  prithee young sirs let me beguile him for when a matter requiring permission is to the fore i have indeed a gift in that sort as any will tell you that know me well you smile and that is punishment for my vanity and fairly earned i grant you still if i may toy a little just a little saying which he stepped to the burgundian and began a fair soft speech all of goodly and gentle tenor and in the midst he mentioned the maid and was going on to say how she out of her good heart would prize and praise this compassionate deed which he was about to it was as far as he got the burgundian burst into his smooth oration with an insult leveled at joan of arc we sprang forward but the dwarf his face all livid brushed us aside and said in a most grave and earnest way  i crave your patience am not i her guard of honor this is my affair  and saying this he suddenly shot his right hand out and gripped the great burgundian by the throat and so held him upright on his feet you have insulted the maid he said and the maid is france the tongue that does that earns a long furlough  one heard the muffled cracking of bones the burgundians eyes began to protrude from their sockets and stare with a leaden dullness at vacancy the color deepened in his face and became an opaque purple his hands hung down limp his body collapsed with a shiver every muscle relaxed its tension and ceased from its function the dwarf took away his hand and the column of inert mortality sank mushily to the ground  we struck the bonds from the prisoner and told him he was free his crawling humbleness changed to frantic joy in a moment and his ghastly fear to a childish rage he flew at that dead corpse and kicked it spat in its face danced upon it crammed mud into its mouth laughing jeering cursing and volleying forth indecencies and bestialities like a drunken fiend it was a thing to be expected soldiering makes few saints many of the onlookers laughed others were indifferent none was surprised but presently in his mad caperings the freed man capered within reach of the waiting file and another burgundian promptly slipped a knife through his neck and down he went with a deathshriek his brilliant artery blood spurting ten feet as straight and bright as a ray of light there was a great burst of jolly laughter all around from friend and foe alike and thus closed one of the pleasantest incidents of my checkered military life  and now came joan hurrying and deeply troubled she considered the claim of the garrison then said  you have right upon your side it is plain it was a careless word to put in the treaty and covers too much but ye may not take these poor men away they are french and i will not have it the king shall ransom them every one wait till i send you word from him and hurt no hair of their heads for i tell you i who speak that that would cost you very dear  that settled it the prisoners were safe for one while anyway then she rode back eagerly and required that thing of the king and would listen to no paltering and no excuses so the king told her to have her way and she rode straight back and bought the captives free in his name and let them go      35 the heir of france is crowned  it was here hat we saw again the grand master of the kings household in whose castle joan was guest when she tarried at chinon in those first days of her coming out of her own country she made him bailiff of troyes now by the kings permission  and now we marched again chalons surrendered to us and there by chalons in a talk joan being asked if she had no fears for the future said yes onetreachery who would believe it who could dream it and yet in a sense it was prophecy truly man is a pitiful animal  we marched marched kept on marching and at last on the 16th of july we came in sight of our goal and saw the great cathedraled towers of rheims rise out of the distance huzza after huzza swept the army from van to rear and as for joan of arc there where she sat her horse gazing clothed all in white armor dreamy beautiful and in her face a deep deep joy a joy not of earth oh she was not flesh she was a spirit her sublime mission was closingclosing in flawless triumph tomorrow she could say it is finishedlet me go free  we camped and the hurry and rush and turmoil of the grand preparations began the archbishop and a great deputation arrived and after these came flock after flock crowd after crowd of citizens and countryfolk hurrahing in with banners and music and flowed over the camp one rejoicing inundation after another everybody drunk with happiness and all night long rheims was hard at work hammering away decorating the town building triumphal arches and clothing the ancient cathedral within and without in a glory of opulent splendors  we moved betimes in the morning the coronation ceremonies would begin at nine and last five hours we were aware that the garrison of english and burgundian soldiers had given up all thought of resisting the maid and that we should find the gates standing hospitably open and the whole city ready to welcome us with enthusiasm  it was a delicious morning brilliant with sunshine but cool and fresh and inspiring the army was in great form and fine to see as it uncoiled from its lair fold by fold and stretched away on the final march of the peaceful coronation campaign  joan on her black horse with the lieutenantgeneral and the personal staff grouped about her took post for a final review and a goodby for she was not expecting to ever be a soldier again or ever serve with these or any other soldiers any more after this day the army knew this and believed it was looking for the last time upon the girlish face of its invincible little chief its pet its pride its darling whom it had ennobled in its private heart with nobilities of its own creation call her daughter of god savior of france victorys sweetheart the page of christ together with still softer titles which were simply naive and frank endearments such as men are used to confer upon children whom they love and so one saw a new thing now a thing bred of the emotion that was present there on both sides always before in the marchpast the battalions had gone swinging by in a storm of cheers heads up and eyes flashing the drums rolling the bands braying paens of victory but now there was nothing of that but for one impressive sound one could have closed his eyes and imagined himself in a world of the dead that one sound was all that visited the ear in the summer stillnessjust that one soundthe muffled tread of the marching host as the serried masses drifted by the men put their right hands up to their temples palms to the front in military salute turning their eyes upon joans face in mute godblessyou and farewell and keeping them there while they could they still kept their hands up in reverent salute many steps after they had passed by every time joan put her handkerchief to her eyes you could see a little quiver of emotion crinkle along the faces of the files  the marchpast after a victory is a thing to drive the heart mad with jubilation but this one was a thing to break it  we rode now to the kings lodgings which was the archbishops country palace and he was presently ready and we galloped off and took position at the head of the army by this time the countrypeople were arriving in multitudes from every direction and massing themselves on both sides of the road to get sight of joanjust as had been done every day since our first days march began our march now lay through the grassy plain and those peasants made a dividing double border for that plain they stretched right down through it a broad belt of bright colors on each side of the road for every peasant girl and woman in it had a white jacket on her body and a crimson skirt on the rest of her endless borders made of poppies and lilies stretching away in front of usthat is what it looked like and that is the kind of lane we had been marching through all these days not a lane between multitudinous flowers standing upright on their stemsno these flowers were always kneeling kneeling these human flowers with their hands and faces lifted toward joan of arc and the grateful tears streaming down and all along those closest to the road hugged her feet and kissed them and laid their wet cheeks fondly against them i never during all those days saw any of either sex stand while she passed nor any man keep his head covered afterward in the great trial these touching scenes were used as a weapon against her she had been made an object of adoration by the people and this was proof that she was a hereticso claimed that unjust court  as we drew near the city the curving long sweep of ramparts and towers was gay with fluttering flags and black with masses of people and all the air was vibrant with the crash of artillery and gloomed with drifting clouds of smoke we entered the gates in state and moved in procession through the city with all the guilds and industries in holiday costume marching in our rear with their banners and all the route was hedged with a huzzaing crush of people and all the windows were full and all the roofs and from the balconies hung costly stuffs of rich colors and the waving of handkerchiefs seen in perspective through a long vista was like a snowstorm  joans name had been introduced into the prayers of the churchan honor theretofore restricted to royalty but she had a dearer honor and an honor more to be proud of from a humbler source the common people had had leaden medals struck which bore her effigy and her escutcheon and these they wore as charms one saw them everywhere  from the archbishops palace where we halted and where the king and joan were to lodge the king sent to the abbey church of st remi which was over toward the gate by which we had entered the city for the sainte ampoule or flask of holy oil this oil was not earthly oil it was made in heaven the flask also the flask with the oil in it was brought down from heaven by a dove it was sent down to st remi just as he was going to baptize king clovis who had become a christian i know this to be true i had known it long before for pere fronte told me in domremy i cannot tell you how strange and awful it made me feel when i saw that flask and knew i was looking with my own eyes upon a thing which had actually been in heaven a thing which had been seen by angels perhaps and by god himself of a certainty for he sent it and i was looking upon iti at one time i could have touched it but i was afraid for i could not know but that god had touched it it is most probable that he had  from this flask clovis had been anointed and from it all the kings of france had been anointed since yes ever since the time of clovis and that was nine hundred years and so as i have said that flask of holy oil was sent for while we waited a coronation without that would not have been a coronation at all in my belief  now in order to get the flask a most ancient ceremonial had to be gone through with otherwise the abby of st remi hereditary guardian in perpetuity of the oil would not deliver it so in accordance with custom the king deputed five great nobles to ride in solemn state and richly armed and accoutered they and their steeds to the abbey church as a guard of honor to the archbishop of rheims and his canons who were to bear the kings demand for the oil when the five great lords were ready to start they knelt in a row and put up their mailed hands before their faces palm joined to palm and swore upon their lives to conduct the sacred vessel safely and safely restore it again to the church of st remi after the anointing of the king the archbishop and his subordinates thus nobly escorted took their way to st remi the archbishop was in grand costume with his miter on his head and his cross in his hand at the door of st remi they halted and formed to receive the holy vial soon one heard the deep tones of the organ and of chanting men then one saw a long file of lights approaching through the dim church and so came the abbot in his sacerdotal panoply bearing the vial with his people following after he delivered it with solemn ceremonies to the archbishop then the march back began and it was most impressive for it moved the whole way between two multitudes of men and women who lay flat upon their faces and prayed in dumb silence and in dread while that awful thing went by that had been in heaven  this august company arrived at the great west door of the cathedral and as the archbishop entered a noble anthem rose and filled the vast building the cathedral was packed with peoplepeople in thousands only a wide space down the center had been kept free down this space walked the archbishop and his canons and after them followed those five stately figures in splendid harness each bearing his feudal bannerand riding  oh that was a magnificent thing to see riding down the cavernous vastness of the building through the rich lights streaming in long rays from the pictured windowsoh there was never anything so grand  they rode clear to the choiras much as four hundred feet from the door it was said then the archbishop dismissed them and they made deep obeisance till their plumes touched their horses necks then made those proud prancing and mincing and dancing creatures go backward all the way to the doorwhich was pretty to see and graceful then they stood them on their hindfeet and spun them around and plunged away and disappeared  for some minutes there was a deep hush a waiting pause a silence so profound that it was as if all those packed thousands there were steeped in dreamless slumberwhy you could even notice the faintest sounds like the drowsy buzzing of insects then came a mighty flood of rich strains from four hundred silver trumpets and then framed in the pointed archway of the great west door appeared joan and the king they advanced slowly side by side through a tempest of welcomeexplosion after explosion of cheers and cries mingled with the deep thunders of the organ and rolling tides of triumphant song from chanting choirs behind joan and the king came the paladin and the banner displayed and a majestic figure he was and most proud and lofty in his bearing for he knew that the people were marking him and taking note of the gorgeous state dress which covered his armor  at his side was the sire dalbret proxy for the constable of france bearing the sword of state  after these in order of rank came a body royally attired representing the lay peers of france it consisted of three princes of the blood and la tremouille and the young de laval brothers  these were followed by the representatives of the ecclesiastical peersthe archbishop of rheims and the bishops of laon chalons orleans and one other  behind these came the grand staff all our great generals and famous names and everybody was eager to get a sight of them through all the din one could hear shouts all along that told you where two of them were live the bastard of orleans satan la hire forever  the august procession reached its appointed place in time and the solemnities of the coronation began they were long and imposingwith prayers and anthems and sermons and everything that is right for such occasions and joan was at the kings side all these hours with her standard in her hand but at last came the grand act the king took the oath he was anointed with the sacred oil a splendid personage followed by trainbearers and other attendants approached bearing the crown of france upon a cushion and kneeling offered it the king seemed to hesitatein fact did hesitate for he put out his hand and then stopped with it there in the air over the crown the fingers in the attitude of taking hold of it but that was for only a momentthough a moment is a notable something when it stops the heartbeat of twenty thousand people and makes them catch their breath yes only a moment then he caught joans eye and she gave him a look with all the joy of her thankful great soul in it then he smiled and took the crown of france in his hand and right finely and right royally lifted it up and set it upon his head  then what a crash there was all about us cries and cheers and the chanting of the choirs and groaning of the organ and outside the clamoring of the bells and the booming of the cannon the fantastic dream the incredible dream the impossible dream of the peasantchild stood fulfilled the english power was broken the heir of france was crowned  she was like one transfigured so divine was the joy that shone in her face as she sank to her knees at the kings feet and looked up at him through her tears her lips were quivering and her words came soft and low and broken  now o gentle king is the pleasure of god accomplished according to his command that you should come to rheims and receive the crown that belongeth of right to you and unto none other my work which was given me to do is finished give me your peace and let me go back to my mother who is poor and old and has need of me  the king raised her up and there before all that host he praised her great deeds in most noble terms and there he confirmed her nobility and titles making her the equal of a count in rank and also appointed a household and officers for her according to her dignity and then he said  you have saved the crown speakrequiredemand and whatsoever grace you ask it shall be granted though it make the kingdom poor to meet it  now that was fine that was royal joan was on her knees again straightway and said  then o gentle king if out of your compassion you will speak the word i pray you give commandment that my village poor and hard pressed by reason of war may have its taxes remitted  it is so commanded say on  that is all  all nothing but that  it is all i have no other desire  but that is nothingless than nothing askdo not be afraid  indeed i cannot gentle king do not press me i will not have aught else but only this alone  the king seemed nonplussed and stood still a moment as if trying to comprehend and realize the full stature of this strange unselfishness then he raised his head and said  who has won a kingdom and crowned its king and all she asks and all she will take is this poor graceand even this is for others not for herself and it is well her act being proportioned to the dignity of one who carries in her head and heart riches which outvalue any that any king could add though he gave his all she shall have her way now therefore it is decreed that from this day forth domremy natal village of joan of arc deliverer of france called the maid of orleans is freed from all taxation forever whereat the silver horns blew a jubilant blast  there you see she had had a vision of this very scene the time she was in a trance in the pastures of domremy and we asked her to name to boon she would demand of the king if he should ever chance to tell her she might claim one but whether she had the vision or not this act showed that after all the dizzy grandeurs that had come upon her she was still the same simple unselfish creature that she was that day  yes charles vii remitted those taxes forever often the gratitude of kings and nations fades and their promises are forgotten or deliberately violated but you who are children of france should remember with pride that france has kept this one faithfully sixtythree years have gone by since that day the taxes of the region wherein domremy lies have been collected sixtythree times since then and all the villages of that region have paid except that onedomremy the taxgatherer never visits domremy domremy has long ago forgotten what that dread sorrowsowing apparition is like sixtythree taxbooks have been filed meantime and they lie yonder with the other public records and any may see them that desire it at the top of every page in the sixtythree books stands the name of a village and below that name its weary burden of taxation is figured out and displayed in the case of all save one it is true just as i tell you in each of the sixtythree books there is a page headed domremi but under that name not a figure appears where the figures should be there are three words written and the same words have been written every year for all these years yes it is a blank page with always those grateful words lettered across the face of ita touching memorial thus    domremi     rienla pucelle   nothingthe maid of orleans  how brief it is yet how much it says it is the nation speaking you have the spectacle of that unsentimental thing a government making reverence to that name and saying to its agent uncover and pass on it is france that commands yes the promise has been kept it will be kept always forever was the kings word 1 at two oclock in the afternoon the ceremonies of the coronation came at last to an end then the procession formed once more with joan and the king at its head and took up its solemn march through the midst of the church all instruments and all people making such clamor of rejoicing noises as was indeed a marvel to hear an so ended the third of the great days of joans life and how close together they standmay 8th june 18th july 17th  1 it was faithfully kept during three hundred and sixty years and more then the overconfident octogenarians prophecy failed during the tumult of the french revolution the promise was forgotten and the grace withdrawn it has remained in disuse ever since joan never asked to be remembered but france has remembered her with an inextinguishable love and reverence joan never asked for a statue but france has lavished them upon her joan never asked for a church for domremy but france is building one joan never asked for saintship but even that is impending everything which joan of arc did not ask for has been given her and with a noble profusion but the one humble little thing which she did ask for and get has been taken away from her there is something infinitely pathetic about this france owes domremy a hundred years of taxes and could hardly find a citizen within her borders who would vote against the payment of the debt  note by the translator      36 joan hears news from home  we mounted and rode a spectacle to remember a most noble display of rich vestments and nodding plumes and as we moved between the banked multitudes they sank down all along abreast of us as we advanced like grain before the reaper and kneeling hailed with a rousing welcome the consecrated king and his companion the deliverer of france but by and by when we had paraded about the chief parts of the city and were come near to the end of our course we being now approaching the archbishops palace one saw on the right hard by the inn that is called the zebra a strange thingtwo men not kneeling but standing standing in the front rank of the kneelers unconscious transfixed staring yes and clothed in the coarse garb of the peasantry these two two halberdiers sprang at them in a fury to teach them better manners but just as they seized them joan cried out forbear and slid from her saddle and flung her arms about one of those peasants calling him by all manner of endearing names and sobbing for it was her father and the other was her uncle laxart  the news flew everywhere and shouts of welcome were raised and in just one little moment those two despised and unknown plebeians were become famous and popular and envied and everybody was in a fever to get sight of them and be able to say all their lives long that they had seen the father of joan of arc and the brother of her mother how easy it was for her to do miracles like to this she was like the sun on whatsoever dim and humble object her rays fell that thing was straightway drowned in glory  all graciously the king said  bring them to me  and she brought them she radiant with happiness and affection they trembling and scared with their caps in their shaking hands and there before all the world the king gave them his hand to kiss while the people gazed in envy and admiration and he said to old darc  give god thanks for that you are father to this child this dispenser of immortalities you who bear a name that will still live in the mouths of men when all the race of kings has been forgotten it is not meet that you bare your head before the fleeting fames and dignities of a daycover yourself and truly he looked right fine and princely when he said that then he gave order that the bailly of rheims be brought and when he was come and stood bent low and bare the king said to him these two are guests of france and bade him use them hospitably  i may as well say now as later that papa darc and laxart were stopping in that little zebra inn and that there they remained finer quarters were offered them by the bailly also public distinctions and brave entertainment but they were frightened at these projects they being only humble and ignorant peasants so they begged off and had peace they could not have enjoyed such things poor souls they did not even know what to do with their hands and it took all their attention to keep from treading on them the bailly did the best he could in the circumstances he made the innkeeper place a whole floor at their disposal and told him to provide everything they might desire and charge all to the city also the bailly gave them a horse apiece and furnishings which so overwhelmed them with pride and delight and astonishment that they couldnt speak a word for in their lives they had never dreamed of wealth like this and could not believe at first that the horses were real and would not dissolve to a mist and blow away they could not unglue their minds from those grandeurs and were always wrenching the conversation out of its groove and dragging the matter of animals into it so that they could say my horse here and my horse there and yonder and all around and taste the words and lick their chops over them and spread their legs and hitch their thumbs in their armpits and feel as the good god feels when he looks out on his fleets of constellations plowing the awful deeps of space and reflects with satisfaction that they are hisall his well they were the happiest old children one ever saw and the simplest  the city gave a grand banquet to the king and joan in midafternoon and to the court and the grand staff and about the middle of it pere darc and laxart were sent for but would not venture until it was promised that they might sit in a gallery and be all by themselves and see all that was to be seen and yet be unmolested and so they sat there and looked down upon the splendid spectacle and were moved till the tears ran down their cheeks to see the unbelievable honors that were paid to their small darling and how naively serene and unafraid she sat there with those consuming glories beating upon her  but at last her serenity was broken up yes it stood the strain of the kings gracious speech and of dalencons praiseful words and the bastards and even la hires thunderblast which took the place by storm but at last as i have said they brought a force to bear which was too strong for her for at the close the king put up his hand to command silence and so waited with his hand up till every sound was dead and it was as if one could almost the stillness so profound it was then out of some remote corner of that vast place there rose a plaintive voice and in tones most tender and sweet and rich came floating through that enchanted hush our poor old simple song larbre fee bourlemont and then joan broke down and put her face in her hands and cried yes you see all in a moment the pomps and grandeurs dissolved away and she was a little child again herding her sheep with the tranquil pastures stretched about her and war and wounds and blood and death and the mad frenzy and turmoil of battle a dream ah that shows you the power of music that magician of magicians who lifts his wand and says his mysterious word and all things real pass away and the phantoms of your mind walk before you clothed in flesh  that was the kings invention that sweet and dear surprise indeed he had fine things hidden away in his nature though one seldom got a glimpse of them with that scheming tremouille and those others always standing in the light and he so indolently content to save himself fuss and argument and let them have their way  at the fall of night we the domremy contingent of the personal staff were with the father and uncle at the inn in their private parlor brewing generous drinks and breaking ground for a homely talk about domremy and the neighbors when a large parcel arrived from joan to be kept till she came and soon she came herself and sent her guard away saying she would take one of her fathers rooms and sleep under his roof and so be at home again we of the staff rose and stood as was meet until she made us sit then she turned and saw that the two old men had gotten up too and were standing in an embarrassed and unmilitary way which made her want to laugh but she kept it in as not wishing to hurt them and got them to their seats and snuggled down between them and took a hand of each of them upon her knees and nestled her own hands in them and said  now we will nave no more ceremony but be kin and playmates as in other times for i am done with the great wars now and you two will take me home with you and i shall see she stopped and for a moment her happy face sobered as if a doubt or a presentiment had flitted through her mind then it cleared again and she said with a passionate yearning oh if the day were but come and we could start  the old father was surprised and said  why child are you in earnest would you leave doing these wonders that make you to be praised by everybody while there is still so much glory to be won and would you go out from this grand comradeship with princes and generals to be a drudging villager again and a nobody it is not rational  no said the uncle laxart it is amazing to hear and indeed not understandable it is a stranger thing to hear her say she will stop the soldiering that it was to hear her say she would begin it and i who speak to you can say in all truth that that was the strangest word that ever i had heard till this day and hour i would it could be explained  it is not difficult said joan i was not ever fond of wounds and suffering nor fitted by my nature to inflict them and quarrelings did always distress me and noise and tumult were against my liking my disposition being toward peace and quietness and love for all things that have life and being made like this how could i bear to think of wars and blood and the pain that goes with them and the sorrow and mourning that follow after but by his angels god laid his great commands upon me and could i disobey i did as i was bid did he command me to do many things no only two to raise the siege of orleans and crown the king at rheims the task is finished and i am free has ever a poor soldier fallen in my sight whether friend or foe and i not felt the pain in my own body and the grief of his homemates in my own heart no not one and oh it is such bliss to know that my release is won and that i shall not any more see these cruel things or suffer these tortures of the mind again then why should i not go to my village and be as i was before it is heaven and ye wonder that i desire it ah ye are menjust men my mother would understand  they didnt quite know what to say so they sat still awhile looking pretty vacant then old darc said  yes your motherthat is true i never saw such a woman she worries and worries and worries and wakes nights and lies so thinkingthat is worrying worrying about you and when the night storms go raging along she moans and says ah god pity her she is out in this with her poor wet soldiers and when the lightning glares and the thunder crashes she wrings her hands and trembles saying it is like the awful cannon and the flash and yonder somewhere she is riding down upon the spouting guns and i not there to protect her  ah poor mother it is pity it is pity  yes a most strange woman as i have noticed a many times when there is news of a victory and all the village goes mad with pride and joy she rushes here and there in a maniacal frenzy till she finds out the one only thing she cares to knowthat you are safe then down she goes on her knees in the dirt and praises god as long as there is any breath left in her body and all on your account for she never mentions the battle once and always she says now it is overnow france is savednow she will come homeand always is disappointed and goes about mourning  dont father it breaks my heart i will be so good to her when i get home i will do her work for her and be her comfort and she shall not suffer any more through me  there was some more talk of this sort then uncle laxart said  you have done the will of god dear and are quits it is true and none may deny it but what of the king you are his best soldier what if he command you to stay  that was a crusherand sudden it took joan a moment or two to recover from the shock of it then she said quite simply and resignedly  the king is my lord i am his servant she was silent and thoughtful a little while then she brightened up and said cheerily but let us drive such thoughts awaythis is no time for them tell me about home  so the two old gossips talked and talked talked about everything and everybody in the village and it was good to hear joan out of her kindness tried to get us into the conversation but that failed of course she was the commanderinchief we were nobodies her name was the mightiest in france we were invisible atoms she was the comrade of princes and heroes we of the humble and obscure she held rank above all personages and all puissances whatsoever in the whole earth by right of baring her commission direct from god to put it in one word she was joan of arcand when that is said all is said to us she was divine between her and us lay the bridgeless abyss which that word implies we could not be familiar with her no you can see yourselves that that would have been impossible  and yet she was so human too and so good and kind and dear and loving and cheery and charming and unspoiled and unaffected those are all the words i think of now but they are not enough no they are too few and colorless and meager to tell it all or tell the half those simple old men didnt realize her they couldnt they had never known any people but human beings and so they had no other standard to measure her by to them after their first little shyness had worn off she was just a girlthat was all it was amazing it made one shiver sometimes to see how calm and easy and comfortable they were in her presence and hear them talk to her exactly as they would have talked to any other girl in france  why that simple old laxart sat up there and droned out the most tedious and empty tale one ever heard and neither he nor papa darc ever gave a thought to the badness of the etiquette of it or ever suspected that that foolish tale was anything but dignified and valuable history there was not an atom of value in it and whilst they thought it distressing and pathetic it was in fact not pathetic at all but actually ridiculous at least it seemed so to me and it seems so yet indeed i know it was because it made joan laugh and the more sorrowful it got the more it made her laugh and the paladin said that he could have laughed himself if she had not been there and noel rainguesson said the same it was about old laxart going to a funeral there at domremy two or three weeks back he had spots all over his face and hands and he got joan to rub some healing ointment on them and while she was doing it and comforting him and trying to say pitying things to him he told her how it happened and first he asked her if she remembered that black bull calf that she left behind when she came away and she said indeed she did and he was a dear and she loved him so and was he welland just drowned him in questions about that creature and he said it was a young bull now and very frisky and he was to bear a principal hand at a funeral and she said the bull and he said no myself but said the bull did take a hand but not because of his being invited for he wasnt but anyway he was away over beyond the fairy tree and fell asleep on the grass with his sunday funeral clothes on and a long black rag on his hat and hanging down his back and when he woke he saw by the sun how late it was and not a moment to lose and jumped up terribly worried and saw the young bull grazing there and thought maybe he could ride part way on him and gain time so he tied a rope around the bulls body to hold on by and put a halter on him to steer with and jumped on and started but it was all new to the bull and he was discontented with it and scurried around and bellowed and reared and pranced and uncle laxart was satisfied and wanted to get off and go by the next bull or some other way that was quieter but he didnt dare try and it was getting very warm for him too and disturbing and wearisome and not proper for sunday but by and by the bull lost all his temper and went tearing down the slope with his tail in the air and blowing in the most awful way and just in the edge of the village he knocked down some beehives and the bees turned out and joined the excursion and soared along in a black cloud that nearly hid those other two from sight and prodded them both and jabbed them and speared them and spiked them and made them bellow and shriek and shriek and bellow and here they came roaring through the village like a hurricane and took the funeral procession right in the center and sent that section of it sprawling and galloped over it and the rest scattered apart and fled screeching in every direction every person with a layer of bees on him and not a rag of that funeral left but the corpse and finally the bull broke for the river and jumped in and when they fished uncle laxart out he was nearly drowned and his face looked like a pudding with raisins in it and then he turned around this old simpleton and looked a long time in a dazed way at joan where she had her face in a cushion dying apparently and says  what do you reckon she is laughing at  and old darc stood looking at her the same way sort of absently scratching his head but had to give it up and said he didnt knowmust have been something that happened when we werent noticing  yes both of those old people thought that that tale was pathetic whereas to my mind it was purely ridiculous and not in any way valuable to any one it seemed so to me then and it seems so to me yet and as for history it does not resemble history for the office of history is to furnish serious and important facts that teach whereas this strange and useless event teaches nothing nothing that i can see except not to ride a bull to a funeral and surely no reflecting person needs to be taught that      37 again to arms  now these were nobles you know by decree of the kingthese precious old infants but they did not realize it they could not be called conscious of it it was an abstraction a phantom to them it had no substance their minds could not take hold of it no they did not bother about their nobility they lived in their horses the horses were solid they were visible facts and would make a mighty stir in domremy presently something was said about the coronation and old darc said it was going to be a grand thing to be able to say when they got home that they were present in the very town itself when it happened joan looked troubled and said  ah that reminds me you were here and you didnt send me word in the town indeed why you could have sat with the other nobles and been welcome and could have looked upon the crowning itself and carried that home to tell ah why did you use me so and send me no word  the old father was embarrassed now quite visibly embarrassed and had the air of one who does not quite know what to say but joan was looking up in his face her hands upon his shoulderswaiting he had to speak so presently he drew her to his breast which was heaving with emotion and he said getting out his words with difficulty  there hide your face child and let your old father humble himself and make his confession iidont you see dont you understandi could not know that these grandeurs would not turn your young headit would be only natural i might shame you before these great per  father  and then i was afraid as remembering that cruel thing i said once in my sinful anger oh appointed of god to be a soldier and the greatest in the land and in my ignorant anger i said i would drown you with my own hands if you unsexed yourself and brought shame to your name and family ah how could i ever have said it and you so good and dear and innocent i was afraid for i was guilty you understand it now my child and you forgive  do you see even that poor groping old landcrab with his skull full of pulp had pride isnt it wonderful and morehe had conscience he had a sense of right and wrong such as it was he was able to find remorse it looks impossible it looks incredible but it is not i believe that some day it will be found out that peasants are people yes beings in a great many respects like ourselves and i believe that some day they will find this out tooand then well then i think they will rise up and demand to be regarded as part of the race and that by consequence there will be trouble whenever one sees in a book or in a kings proclamation those words the nation they bring before us the upper classes only those we know no other nation for us and the kings no other nation exists but from the day that i saw old darc the peasant acting and feeling just as i should have acted and felt myself i have carried the conviction in my heart that our peasants are not merely animals beasts of burden put here by the good god to produce food and comfort for the nation but something more and better you look incredulous well that is your training it is the training of everybody but as for me i thank that incident for giving me a better light and i have never forgotten it  let me seewhere was i ones mind wanders around here and there and yonder when one is old i think i said joan comforted him certainly that is what she would dothere was no need to say that she coaxed him and petted him and caressed him and laid the memory of that old hard speech of his to rest laid it to rest until she should be dead then he would remember it againyes yes lord how those things sting and burn and gnawthe things which we did against the innocent dead and we say in our anguish if they could only come back which is all very well to say but as far as i can see it doesnt profit anything in my opinion the best way is not to do the thing in the first place and i am not alone in this i have heard our two knights say the same thing and a man there in orleansno i believe it was at beaugency or one of those placesit seems more as if it was at beaugency than the othersthis man said the same thing exactly almost the same words a dark man with a cast in his eye and one leg shorter than the other his name waswasit is singular that i cant call that mans name i had it in my mind only a moment ago and i know it begins withno i dont remember what it begins with but never mind let it go i will think of it presently and then i will tell you  well pretty soon the old father wanted to know how joan felt when she was in the thick of a battle with the bright blades hacking and flashing all around her and the blows rapping and slatting on her shield and blood gushing on her from the cloven ghastly face and broken teeth of the neighbor at her elbow and the perilous sudden back surge of massed horses upon a person when the front ranks give way before a heavy rush of the enemy and men tumble limp and groaning out of saddles all around and battleflags falling from dead hands wipe across ones face and hide the tossing turmoil a moment and in the reeling and swaying and laboring jumble ones horses hoofs sink into soft substances and shrieks of pain respond and presentlypanic rush swarm flight and death and hell following after and the old fellow got ever so much excited and strode up and down his tongue going like a mill asking question after question and never waiting for an answer and finally he stood joan up in the middle of the room and stepped off and scanned her critically and said  noi dont understand it you are so little so little and slender when you had your armor on today it gave one a sort of notion of it but in these pretty silks and velvets you are only a dainty page not a leaguestriding warcolossus moving in clouds and darkness and breathing smoke and thunder i would god i might see you at it and go tell your mother that would help her sleep poor thing hereteach me the arts of the soldier that i may explain them to her  and she did it she gave him a pike and put him through the manual of arms and made him do the steps too his marching was incredibly awkward and slovenly and so was his drill with the pike but he didnt know it and was wonderfully pleased with himself and mightily excited and charmed with the ringing crisp words of command i am obliged to say that if looking proud and happy when one is marching were sufficient he would have been the perfect soldier  and he wanted a lesson in swordplay and got it but of course that was beyond him he was too old it was beautiful to see joan handle the foils but the old man was a bad failure he was afraid of the things and skipped and dodged and scrambled around like a woman who has lost her mind on account of the arrival of a bat he was of no good as an exhibition but if la hire had only come in that would have been another matter those two fenced often i saw them many times true joan was easily his master but it made a good show for all that for la hire was a grand swordsman what a swift creature joan was you would see her standing erect with her anklebones together and her foil arched over her head the hilt in one hand and the button in the otherthe old general opposite bent forward left hand reposing on his back his foil advanced slightly wiggling and squirming his watching eye boring straight into hersand all of a sudden she would give a spring forward and back again and there she was with the foil arched over her head as before la hire had been hit but all that the spectator saw of it was a something like a thin flash of light in the air but nothing distinct nothing definite  we kept the drinkables moving for that would please the bailly and the landlord and old laxart and darc got to feeling quite comfortable but without being what you could call tipsy they got out the presents which they had been buying to carry homehumble things and cheap but they would be fine there and welcome and they gave to joan a present from pere fronte and one from her motherthe one a little leaden image of the holy virgin the other half a yard of blue silk ribbon and she was as pleased as a child and touched too as one could see plainly enough yes she kissed those poor things over and over again as if they had been something costly and wonderful and she pinned the virgin on her doublet and sent for her helmet and tied the ribbon on that first one way then another then a new way then another new way and with each effort perching the helmet on her hand and holding it off this way and that and canting her head to one side and then the other examining the effect as a bird does when it has got a new bug and she said she could almost wish she was going to the wars again for then she would fight with the better courage as having always with her something which her mothers touch had blessed  old laxart said he hoped she would go to the wars again but home first for that all the people there were cruel anxious to see herand so he went on  they are proud of you dear yes prouder than any village ever was of anybody before and indeed it is right and rational for it is the first time a village has ever had anybody like you to be proud of and call its own and it is strange and beautiful how they try to give your name to every creature that has a sex that is convenient it is but half a year since you began to be spoken of and left us and so it is surprising to see how many babies there are already in that region that are named for you first it was just joan then it was joanorleans then joanorleansbeaugencypatay and now the next ones will have a lot of towns and the coronation added of course yes and the animals the same they know how you love animals and so they try to do you honor and show their love for you by naming all those creatures after you insomuch that if a body should step out and call joan of arccome there would be a landslide of cats and all such things each supposing it was the one wanted and all willing to take the benefit of the doubt anyway for the sake of the food that might be on delivery the kitten you left behindthe last stray you fetched homebears you name now and belongs to pere fronte and is the pet and pride of the village and people have come miles to look at it and pet it and stare at it and wonder over it because it was joan of arcs cat everybody will tell you that and one day when a stranger threw a stone at it not knowing it was your cat the village rose against him as one man and hanged him and but for pere fronte  there was an interruption it was a messenger from the king bearing a note for joan which i read to her saying he had reflected and had consulted his other generals and was obliged to ask her to remain at the head of the army and withdraw her resignation also would she come immediately and attend a council of war straightway at a little distance military commands and the rumble of drums broke on the still night and we knew that her guard was approaching  deep disappointment clouded her face for just one moment and no moreit passed and with it the homesick girl and she was joan of arc commanderinchief again and ready for duty      38 the king cries forward  in my double quality of page and secretary i followed joan to the council she entered that presence with the bearing of a grieved goddess what was become of the volatile child that so lately was enchanted with a ribbon and suffocated with laughter over the distress of a foolish peasant who had stormed a funeral on the back of a beestung bull one may not guess simply it was gone and had left no sign she moved straight to the counciltable and stood her glance swept from face to face there and where it fell these lit it as with a torch those it scorched as with a brand she knew where to strike she indicated the generals with a nod and said  my business is not with you you have not craved a council of war then she turned toward the kings privy council and continued no it is with you a council of war it is amazing there is but one thing to do and only one and lo ye call a council of war councils of war have no value but to decide between two or several doubtful courses but a council of war when there is only one course conceive of a man in a boat and his family in the water and he goes out among his friends to ask what he would better do a council of war name of god to determine what  she stopped and turned till her eyes rested upon the face of la tremouille and so she stood silent measuring him the excitement in all faces burning steadily higher and higher and all pulses beating faster and faster then she said with deliberation  every sane manwhose loyalty is to his king and not a show and a pretenseknows that there is but one rational thing before usthe march upon paris  down came the fist of la hire with an approving crash upon the table la tremouille turned white with anger but he pulled himself firmly together and held his peace the kings lazy blood was stirred and his eye kindled finely for the spirit of war was away down in him somewhere and a frank bold speech always found it and made it tingle gladsomely joan waited to see if the chief minister might wish to defend his position but he was experienced and wise and not a man to waste his forces where the current was against him he would wait the kings private ear would be at his disposal by and by  that pious fox the chancellor of france took the word now he washed his soft hands together smiling persuasively and said to joan  would it be courteous your excellency to move abruptly from here without waiting for an answer from the duke of burgundy you may not know that we are negotiating with his highness and that there is likely to be a fortnights truce between us and on his part a pledge to deliver paris into our hands without the cost of a blow or the fatigue of a march thither  joan turned to him and said gravely  this is not a confessional my lord you were not obliged to expose that shame here  the chancellors face reddened and he retorted  shame what is there shameful about it  joan answered in level passionless tones  one may describe it without hunting far for words i knew of this poor comedy my lord although it was not intended that i should know it is to the credit of the devisers of it that they tried to conceal itthis comedy whose text and impulse are describable in two words  the chancellor spoke up with a fine irony in his manner  indeed and will your excellency be good enough to utter them  cowardice and treachery  the fists of all the generals came down this time and again the kings eye sparkled with pleasure the chancellor sprang to his feet and appealed to his majesty  sire i claim your protection  but the king waved him to his seat again saying  peace she had a right to be consulted before that thing was undertaken since it concerned war as well as politics it is but just that she be heard upon it now  the chancellor sat down trembling with indignation and remarked to joan  out of charity i will consider that you did not know who devised this measure which you condemn in so candid language  save your charity for another occasion my lord said joan as calmly as before whenever anything is done to injure the interests and degrade the honor of france all but the dead know how to name the two conspiratorsinchief  sir sire this insinuation  it is not an insinuation my lord said joan placidly it is a charge i bring it against the kings chief minister and his chancellor  both men were on their feet now insisting that the king modify joans frankness but he was not minded to do it his ordinary councils were stale waterhis spirit was drinking wine now and the taste of it was good he said  sitand be patient what is fair for one must in fairness be allowed the other considerand be just when have you two spared her what dark charges and harsh names have you withheld when you spoke of her then he added with a veiled twinkle in his eyes if these are offenses i see no particular difference between them except that she says her hard things to your faces whereas you say yours behind her back  he was pleased with that neat shot and the way it shriveled those two people up and made la hire laugh out loud and the other generals softly quake and chuckle joan tranquilly resumed  from the first we have been hindered by this policy of shillyshally this fashion of counseling and counseling and counseling where no counseling is needed but only fighting we took orleans on the 8th of may and could have cleared the region round about in three days and saved the slaughter of patay we could have been in rheims six weeks ago and in paris now and would see the last englishman pass out of france in half a year but we struck no blow after orleans but went off into the countrywhat for ostensibly to hold councils really to give bedford time to send reinforcements to talbotwhich he did and patay had to be fought after patay more counseling more waste of precious time oh my king i would that you would be persuaded she began to warm up now once more we have our opportunity if we rise and strike all is well bid me march upon paris in twenty days it shall be yours and in six months all france here is half a years work before us if this chance be wasted i give you twenty years to do it in speak the word o gentle kingspeak but the one  i cry you mercy interrupted the chancellor who saw a dangerous enthusiasm rising in the kings face march upon paris does your excellency forget that the way bristles with english strongholds  that for your english strongholds and joan snapped her fingers scornfully whence have we marched in these last days from gien and whither to rheims what bristled between english strongholds what are they now french onesand they never cost a blow here applause broke out from the group of generals and joan had to pause a moment to let it subside yes english strongholds bristled before us now french ones bristle behind us what is the argument a child can read it the strongholds between us and paris are garrisoned by no new breed of english but by the same breed as those otherswith the same fears the same questionings the same weaknesses the same disposition to see the heavy hand of god descending upon them we have but to marchon the instantand they are ours paris is ours france is ours give the word o my king command your servant to  stay cried the chancellor it would be madness to put our affront upon his highness the duke of burgundy by the treaty which we have every hope to make with him  oh the treaty which we hope to make with him he has scorned you for years and defied you is it your subtle persuasions that have softened his manners and beguiled him to listen to proposals no it was blowsthe blows which we gave him that is the only teaching that that sturdy rebel can understand what does he care for wind the treaty which we hope to make with himalack he deliver paris there is no pauper in the land that is less able to do it he deliver paris ah but that would make great bedford smile oh the pitiful pretext the blind can see that this thin pourparler with its fifteenday truce has no purpose but to give bedford time to hurry forward his forces against us more treacheryalways treachery we call a council of warwith nothing to council about but bedford calls no council to teach him what our course is he knows what he would do in our place he would hang his traitors and march upon paris o gentle king rouse the way is open paris beckons france implores speak and we  sire it is madness sheer madness your excellency we cannot we must not go back from what we have done we have proposed to treat we must treat with the duke of burgundy  and we will said joan  ah how  at the point of the lance  the house rose to a manall that had french heartsand let go a crack of applauseand kept it up and in the midst of it one heard la hire growl out at the point of the lance by god that is music the king was up too and drew his sword and took it by the blade and strode to joan and delivered the hilt of it into her hand saying  there the king surrenders carry it to paris  and so the applause burst out again and the historical council of war that has bred so many legends was over      39 we win but the king balks  it was away past midnight and had been a tremendous day in the matter of excitement and fatigue but that was no matter to joan when there was business on hand she did not think of bed the generals followed her to her official quarters and she delivered her orders to them as fast as she could talk and they sent them off to their different commands as fast as delivered wherefore the messengers galloping hither and thither raised a world of clatter and racket in the still streets and soon were added to this the music of distant bugles and the roll of drumsnotes of preparation for the vanguard would break camp at dawn  the generals were soon dismissed but i wasnt nor joan for it was my turn to work now joan walked the floor and dictated a summons to the duke of burgundy to lay down his arms and make peace and exchange pardons with the king or if he must fight go fight the saracens pardonnezvous lunlautre de bon coeligeur entierement ainsi que doivent faire loyaux chretiens et sil vous plait de guerroyer allez contre les sarrasins it was long but it was good and had the sterling ring to it it is my opinion that it was as fine and simple and straightforward and eloquent a state paper as she ever uttered  it was delivered into the hands of a courier and he galloped away with it the joan dismissed me and told me to go to the inn and stay and in the morning give to her father the parcel which she had left there it contained presents for the domremy relatives and friends and a peasant dress which she had bought for herself she said she would say goodby to her father and uncle in the morning if it should still be their purpose to go instead of tarrying awhile to see the city  i didnt say anything of course but i could have said that wild horses couldnt keep those men in that town half a day they waste the glory of being the first to carry the great news to domremythe taxes remitted foreverand hear the bells clang and clatter and the people cheer and shout oh not they patay and orleans and the coronation were events which in a vague way these men understood to be colossal but they were colossal mists films abstractions this was a gigantic reality  when i got there do you suppose they were abed quite the reverse they and the rest were as mellow as mellow could be and the paladin was doing his battles in great style and the old peasants were endangering the building with their applause he was doing patay now and was bending his big frame forward and laying out the positions and movements with a rake here and a rake there of his formidable sword on the floor and the peasants were stooped over with their hands on their spread knees observing with excited eyes and ripping out ejaculations of wonder and admiration all along  yes here we were waitingwaiting for the word our horses fidgeting and snorting and dancing to get away we lying back on the bridles till our bodies fairly slanted to the rear the word rang out at lastgo and we went  went there was nothing like it ever seen where we swept by squads of scampering english the mere wind of our passage laid them flat in piles and rows then we plunged into the ruck of fastolfes frantic battlecorps and tore through it like a hurricane leaving a causeway of the dead stretching far behind no tarrying no slacking rein but on on on far yonder in the distance lay our preytalbot and his host looming vast and dark like a stormcloud brooding on the sea down we swooped upon them glooming all the air with a quivering pall of dead leaves flung up by the whirlwind of our flight in another moment we should have struck them as world strikes world when disorbited constellations crash into the milky way but by misfortune and the inscrutable dispensation of god i was recognized talbot turned white and shouting save yourselves it is the standardbearer of joan of arc drove his spurs home till they met in the middle of his horses entrails and fled the field with his billowing multitudes at his back i could have cursed myself for not putting on a disguise i saw reproach in the eyes of her excellency and was bitterly ashamed i had caused what seemed an irreparable disaster another might have gone aside to grieve as not seeing any way to mend it but i thank god i am not of those great occasions only summon as with a trumpetcall the slumbering reserves of my intellect i saw my opportunity in an instantin the next i was away through the woods i vanishedfstlike an extinguished light away around through the curtaining forest i sped as if on wings none knowing what was become of me none suspecting my design minute after minute passed on and on i flew on and still on and at last with a great cheer i flung my banner to the breeze and burst out in front of talbot oh it was a mighty thought that weltering chaos of distracted men whirled and surged backward like a tidal wave which has struck a continent and the day was ours poor helpless creatures they were in a trap they were surrounded they could not escape to the rear for there was our army they could not escape to the front for there was i their hearts shriveled in their bodies their hands fell listless at their sides they stood still and at our leisure we slaughtered them to a man all except talbot and fastolfe whom i saved and brought away one under each arm  well there is no denying it the paladin was in great form that night such style such noble grace of gesture such grandeur of attitude such energy when he got going such steady rise on such sure wing such nicely graduated expenditures of voice according to the weight of the matter such skilfully calculated approaches to his surprises and explosions such beliefcompelling sincerity of tone and manner such a climaxing peal from his brazen lungs and such a lightningvivid picture of his mailed form and flaunting banner when he burst out before that despairing army and oh the gentle art of the last half of his last sentencedelivered in the careless and indolent tone of one who has finished his real story and only adds a colorless and inconsequential detail because it has happened to occur to him in a lazy way  it was a marvel to see those innocent peasants why they went all to pieces with enthusiasm and roared out applauses fit to raise the roof and wake the dead when they had cooled down at last and there was silence but for the heaving and panting old laxart said admiringly  as it seems to me you are an army in your single person  yes that is what he is said noel rainguesson convincingly he is a terror and not just in this vicinity his mere name carries a shudder with it to distant landsjust his mere name and when he frowns the shadow of it falls as far as rome and the chickens go to roost an hour before schedule time yes and some say  noel rainguesson you are preparing yourself for trouble i will say just one word to you and it will be to your advantage to  i saw that the usual thing had got a start no man could prophesy when it would end so i delivered joans message and went off to bed  joan made her goodbyes to those old fellows in the morning with loving embraces and many tears and with a packed multitude for sympathizers and they rode proudly away on their precious horses to carry their great news home i had seen better riders some will say that for horsemanship was a new art to them  the vanguard moved out at dawn and took the road with bands braying and banners flying the second division followed at eight then came the burgundian ambassadors and lost us the rest of that day and the whole of the next but joan was on hand and so they had their journey for their pains the rest of us took the road at dawn next morning july 20th and got how far six leagues tremouille was getting in his sly work with the vacillating king you see the king stopped at st marcoul and prayed three days precious time lostfor us precious time gained for bedford he would know how to use it  we could not go on without the king that would be to leave him in the conspirators camp joan argued reasoned implored and at last we got under way again  joans prediction was verified it was not a campaign it was only another holiday excursion english strongholds lined our route they surrendered without a blow we garrisoned them with frenchmen and passed on bedford was on the march against us with his new army by this time and on the 25th of july the hostile forces faced each other and made preparation for battle but bedfords good judgment prevailed and he turned and retreated toward paris now was our chance our men were in great spirits  will you believe it our poor stick of a king allowed his worthless advisers to persuade him to start back for gien whence he had set out when we first marched for rheims and the coronation and we actually did start back the fifteenday truce had just been concluded with the duke of burgundy and we would go and tarry at gien until he should deliver paris to us without a fight  we marched to bray then the king changed his mind once more and with it his face toward paris joan dictated a letter to the citizens of rheims to encourage them to keep heart in spite of the truce and promising to stand by them she furnished them the news herself that the kin had made this truce and in speaking of it she was her usual frank self she said she was not satisfied with it and didnt know whether she would keep it or not that if she kept it it would be solely out of tenderness for the kings honor all french children know those famous words how naive they are de cette treve qui a ete faite je ne suis pas contente et je ne sais si je la tiendrai si je la tiens ce sera seulement pour garder lhonneur du roi but in any case she said she would not allow the blood royal to be abused and would keep the army in good order and ready for work at the end of the truce  poor child to have to fight england burgundy and a french conspiracy all at the same timeit was too bad she was a match for the others but a conspiracyah nobody is a match for that when the victim that is to be injured is weak and willing it grieved her these troubled days to be so hindered and delayed and baffled and at times she was sad and the tears lay near the surface once talking with her good old faithful friend and servant the bastard of orleans she said  ah if it might but please god to let me put off this steel raiment and go back to my father and my mother and tend my sheep again with my sister and my brothers who would be so glad to see me  by the 12th of august we were camped near dampmartin later we had a brush with bedfords rearguard and had hopes of a big battle on the morrow but bedford and all his force got away in the night and went on toward paris  charles sent heralds and received the submission of beauvais the bishop pierre cauchon that faithful friend and slave of the english was not able to prevent it though he did his best he was obscure then but his name was to travel round the globe presently and live forever in the curses of france bear with me now while i spit in fancy upon his grave  compiegne surrendered and hauled down the english flag on the 14th we camped two leagues from senlis bedford turned and approached and took up a strong position we went against him but all our efforts to beguile him out from his intrenchments failed though he had promised us a duel in the open field night shut down let him look out for the morning but in the morning he was gone again  we entered compiegne the 18th of august turning out the english garrison and hoisting our own flag  on the 23d joan gave command to move upon paris the king and the clique were not satisfied with this and retired sulking to senlis which had just surrendered within a few days many strong places submittedcreil pontsaintmaxence choisy gournaysuraronde remy le neufvilleenhez moguay chantilly saintines the english power was tumbling crash after crash and still the king sulked and disapproved and was afraid of our movement against the capital  on the 26th of august 1429 joan camped at st denis in effect under the walls of paris  and still the king hung back and was afraid if we could but have had him there to back us with his authority bedford had lost heart and decided to waive resistance and go an concentrate his strength in the best and loyalest province remaining to himnormandy ah if we could only have persuaded the king to come and countenance us with his presence and approval at this supreme moment      40 treachery conquers joan  courier after courier was despatched to the king and he promised to come but didnt the duke dalencon went to him and got his promise again which he broke again nine days were lost thus then he came arriving at st denis september 7th  meantime the enemy had begun to take heart the spiritless conduct of the king could have no other result preparations had now been made to defend the city joans chances had been diminished but she and her generals considered them plenty good enough yet joan ordered the attack for eight oclock next morning and at that hour it began  joan placed her artillery and began to pound a strong work which protected the gate st honor when it was sufficiently crippled the assault was sounded at noon and it was carried by storm then we moved forward to storm the gate itself and hurled ourselves against it again and again joan in the lead with her standard at her side the smoke enveloping us in choking clouds and the missiles flying over us and through us as thick as hail  in the midst of our last assault which would have carried the gate sure and given us paris and in effect france joan was struck down by a crossbow bolt and our men fell back instantly and almost in a panicfor what were they without her she was the army herself  although disabled she refused to retire and begged that a new assault be made saying it must win and adding with the battlelight rising in her eyes i will take paris now or die she had to be carried away by force and this was done by gaucourt and the duke dalencon  but her spirits were at the very top notch now she was brimming with enthusiasm she said she would be carried before the gate in the morning and in half an hour paris would be ours without any question she could have kept her word about this there was no doubt but she forgot one factorthe king shadow of that substance named la tremouille the king forbade the attempt  you see a new embassy had just come from the duke of burgundy and another sham private trade of some sort was on foot  you would know without my telling you that joans heart was nearly broken because of the pain of her wound and the pain at her heart she slept little that night several times the watchers heard muffled sobs from the dark room where she lay at st denis and many times the grieving words it could have been takenit could have been taken which were the only ones she said  she dragged herself out of bed a day later with a new hope dalencon had thrown a bridge across the seine near st denis might she not cross by that and assault paris at another point but the king got wind of it and broke the bridge down and morehe declared the campaign ended and more stillhe had made a new truce and a long one in which he had agreed to leave paris unthreatened and unmolested and go back to the loire whence he had come  joan of arc who had never been defeated by the enemy was defeated by her own king she had said once that all she feared for her cause was treachery it had struck its first blow now she hung up her white armor in the royal basilica of st denis and went and asked the king to relieve her of her functions and let her go home as usual she was wise grand combinations farreaching great military moves were at an end now for the future when the truce should end the war would be merely a war of random and idle skirmishes apparently work suitable for subalterns and not requiring the supervision of a sublime military genius but the king would not let her go the truce did not embrace all france there were french strongholds to be watched and preserved he would need her really you see tremouille wanted to keep her where he could balk and hinder her  now came her voices again they said remain at st denis there was no explanation they did not say why that was the voice of god it took precedence of the command of the king joan resolved to stay but that filled la tremouille with dread she was too tremendous a force to be left to herself she would surely defeat all his plans he beguiled the king to use compulsion joan had to submitbecause she was wounded and helpless in the great trial she said she was carried away against her will and that if she had not been wounded it could not have been accomplished ah she had a spirit that slender girl a spirit to brave all earthly powers and defy them we shall never know why the voices ordered her to stay we only know this that if she could have obeyed the history of france would not be as it now stands written in the books yes well we know that  on the 13th of september the army sad and spiritless turned its face toward the loire and marchedwithout music yes one noted that detail it was a funeral march that is what it was a long dreary funeral march with never a shout or a cheer friends looking on in tears all the way enemies laughing we reached gien at lastthat place whence we had set out on our splendid march toward rheims less than three months before with flags flying bands playing the victoryflush of patay glowing in our faces and the massed multitudes shouting and praising and giving us godspeed there was a dull rain falling now the day was dark the heavens mourned the spectators were few we had no welcome but the welcome of silence and pity and tears  then the king disbanded that noble army of heroes it furled its flags it stored its arms the disgrace of france was complete la tremouille wore the victors crown joan of arc the unconquerable was conquered      41 the maid will march no more  yes it was as i have said joan had paris and france in her grip and the hundred years war under her heel and the king made her open her fist and take away her foot  now followed about eight months of drifting about with the king and his council and his gay and showy and dancing and flirting and hawking and frolicking and serenading and dissipating courtdrifting from town to town and from castle to castlea life which was pleasant to us of the personal staff but not to joan however she only saw it she didnt live it the king did his sincerest best to make her happy and showed a most kind and constant anxiety in this matter  all others had to go loaded with the chains of an exacting court etiquette but she was free she was privileged so that she paid her duty to the king once a day and passed the pleasant word nothing further was required of her naturally then she made herself a hermit and grieved the weary days through in her own apartments with her thoughts and devotions for company and the planning of now forever unrealizable military combinations for entertainment in fancy she moved bodies of men from this and that and the other point so calculating the distances to be covered the time required for each body and the nature of the country to be traversed as to have them appear in sight of each other on a given day or at a given hour and concentrate for battle it was her only game her only relief from her burden of sorrow and inaction she played it hour after hour as others play chess and lost herself in it and so got repose for her mind and healing for her heart  she never complained of course it was not her way she was the sort that endure in silence  butshe was a caged eagle just the same and pined for the free air and the alpine heights and the fierce joys of the storm  france was full of roversdisbanded soldiers ready for anything that might turn up several times at intervals when joans dull captivity grew too heavy to bear she was allowed to gather a troop of cavalry and make a healthrestoring dash against the enemy these things were a bath to her spirits  it was like old times there at saintpierrelemoutier to see her lead assault after assault be driven back again and again but always rally and charge anew all in a blaze of eagerness and delight till at last the tempest of missiles rained so intolerably thick that old daulon who was wounded sounded the retreat for the king had charged him on his head to let no harm come to joan and away everybody rushed after himas he supposed but when he turned and looked there were we of the staff still hammering away wherefore he rode back and urged her to come saying she was mad to stay there with only a dozen men her eye danced merrily and she turned upon him crying out  a dozen men name of god i have fiftythousand and will never budge till this place is taken  sound the charge  which he did and over the walls we went and the fortress was ours old daulon thought her mind was wandering but all she meant was that she felt the might of fifty thousand men surging in her heart it was a fanciful expression but to my thinking truer word was never said  then there was the affair near lagny where we charged the intrenched burgundians through the open field four times the last time victoriously the best prize of it franquet darras the freebooter and pitiless scourge of the region roundabout  now and then other such affairs and at last away toward the end of may 1430 we were in the neighborhood of compiegne and joan resolved to go to the help of that place which was being besieged by the duke of burgundy  i had been wounded lately and was not able to ride without help but the good dwarf took me on behind him and i held on to him and was safe enough we started at midnight in a sullen downpour of warm rain and went slowly and softly and in dead silence for we had to slip through the enemys lines we were challenged only once we made no answer but held our breath and crept steadily and stealthily along and got through without any accident about three or half past we reached compiegne just as the gray dawn was breaking in the east  joan set to work at once and concerted a plan with guillaume de flavy captain of the citya plan for a sortie toward evening against the enemy who was posted in three bodies on the other side of the oise in the level plain from our side one of the city gates communicated with a bridge the end of this bridge was defended on the other side of the river by one of those fortresses called a boulevard and this boulevard also commanded a raised road which stretched from its front across the plain to the village of marguy a force of burgundians occupied marguy another was camped at clairoix a couple of miles above the raised road and a body of english was holding venette a mile and a half below it a kind of bowandarrow arrangement you see the causeway the arrow the boulevard at the featherend of it marguy at the barb venette at one end of the bow clairoix at the other  joans plan was to go straight per causeway against marguy carry it by assault then turn swiftly upon clairoix up to the right and capture that camp in the same way then face to the rear and be ready for heavy work for the duke of burgundy lay behind clairoix with a reserve flavys lieutenant with archers and the artillery of the boulevard was to keep the english troops from coming up from below and seizing the causeway and cutting off joans retreat in case she should have to make one also a fleet of covered boats was to be stationed near the boulevard as an additional help in case a retreat should become necessary  it was the 24th of may at four in the afternoon joan moved out at the head of six hundred cavalryon her last march in this life  it breaks my heart i had got myself helped up onto the walls and from there i saw much that happened the rest was told me long afterward by our two knights and other eyewitnesses joan crossed the bridge and soon left the boulevard behind her and went skimming away over the raised road with her horsemen clattering at her heels she had on a brilliant silvergilt cape over her armor and i could see it flap and flare and rise and fall like a little patch of white flame  it was a bright day and one could see far and wide over that plain soon we saw the english force advancing swiftly and in handsome order the sunlight flashing from its arms  joan crashed into the burgundians at marguy and was repulsed then she saw the other burgundians moving down from clairoix joan rallied her men and charged again and was again rolled back two assaults occupy a good deal of timeand time was precious here the english were approaching the road now from venette but the boulevard opened fire on them and they were checked joan heartened her men with inspiring words and led them to the charge again in great style this time she carried marguy with a hurrah then she turned at once to the right and plunged into the plan and struck the clairoix force which was just arriving then there was heavy work and plenty of it the two armies hurling each other backward turn about and about and victory inclining first to the one then to the other now all of a sudden there was a panic on our side some say one thing caused it some another some say the cannonade made our front ranks think retreat was being cut off by the english some say the rear ranks got the idea that joan was killed anyway our men broke and went flying in a wild rout for the causeway joan tried to rally them and face them around crying to them that victory was sure but it did no good they divided and swept by her like a wave old daulon begged her to retreat while there was yet a chance for safety but she refused so he seized her horses bridle and bore her along with the wreck and ruin in spite of herself and so along the causeway they came swarming that wild confusion of frenzied men and horsesand the artillery had to stop firing of course consequently the english and burgundians closed in in safety the former in front the latter behind their prey clear to the boulevard the french were washed in this enveloping inundation and there cornered in an angle formed by the flank of the boulevard and the slope of the causeway they bravely fought a hopeless fight and sank down one by one  flavy watching from the city wall ordered the gate to be closed and the drawbridge raised this shut joan out  the little personal guard around her thinned swiftly both of our good knights went down disabled joans two brothers fell wounded then noel rainguessonall wounded while loyally sheltering joan from blows aimed at her when only the dwarf and the paladin were left they would not give up but stood their ground stoutly a pair of steel towers streaked and splashed with blood and where the ax of one fell and the sword of the other an enemy gasped and died  and so fighting and loyal to their duty to the last good simple souls they came to their honorable end peace to their memories they were very dear to me  then there was a cheer and a rush and joan still defiant still laying about her with her sword was seized by her cape and dragged from her horse she was borne away a prisoner to the duke of burgundys camp and after her followed the victorious army roaring its joy  the awful news started instantly on its round from lip to lip it flew and wherever it came it struck the people as with a sort of paralysis and they murmured over and over again as if they were talking to themselves or in their sleep the maid of orleans taken joan of arc a prisoner the savior of france lost to usand would keep saying that over as if they couldnt understand how it could be or how god could permit it poor creatures  you know what a city is like when it is hung from eaves to pavement with rustling black then you know what rouse was like and some other cities but can any man tell you what the mourning in the hearts of the peasantry of france was like no nobody can tell you that and poor dumb things they could not have told you themselves but it was thereindeed yes why it was the spirit of a whole nation hung with crape  the 24th of may we will draw down the curtain now upon the most strange and pathetic and wonderful military drama that has been played upon the stage of the world joan of arc will march no more      book iii trial and martyrdom    1 the maid in chains  i cannot bear to dwell at great length upon the shameful history of the summer and winter following the capture for a while i was not much troubled for i was expecting every day to hear that joan had been put to ransom and that the kingno not the king but grateful francehad come eagerly forward to pay it by the laws of war she could not be denied the privilege of ransom she was not a rebel she was a legitimately constituted soldier head of the armies of france by her kings appointment and guilty of no crime known to military law therefore she could not be detained upon any pretext if ransom were proffered  but day after day dragged by and no ransom was offered it seems incredible but it is true was that reptile tremouille busy at the kings ear all we know is that the king was silent and made no offer and no effort in behalf of this poor girl who had done so much for him  but unhappily there was alacrity enough in another quarter the news of the capture reached paris the day after it happened and the glad english and burgundians deafened the world all the day and all the night with the clamor of their joybells and the thankful thunder of their artillery and the next day the vicargeneral of the inquisition sent a message to the duke of burgundy requiring the delivery of the prisoner into the hands of the church to be tried as an idolater  the english had seen their opportunity and it was the english power that was really acting not the church the church was being used as a blind a disguise and for a forcible reason the church was not only able to take the life of joan of arc but to blight her influence and the valorbreeding inspiration of her name whereas the english power could but kill her body that would not diminish or destroy the influence of her name it would magnify it and make it permanent joan of arc was the only power in france that the english did not despise the only power in france that they considered formidable if the church could be brought to take her life or to proclaim her an idolater a heretic a witch sent from satan not from heaven it was believed that the english supremacy could be at once reinstated  the duke of burgundy listenedbut waited he could not doubt that the french king or the french people would come forward presently and pay a higher price than the english he kept joan a close prisoner in a strong fortress and continued to wait week after week he was a french prince and was at heart ashamed to sell her to the english yet with all his waiting no offer came to him from the french side  one day joan played a cunning trick on her jailer and not only slipped out of her prison but locked him up in it but as she fled away she was seen by a sentinel and was caught and brought back  then she was sent to beaurevoir a stronger castle this was early in august and she had been in captivity more than two months now here she was shut up in the top of a tower which was sixty feet high she ate her heart there for another long stretchabout three months and a half and she was aware all these weary five months of captivity that the english under cover of the church were dickering for her as one would dicker for a horse or a slave and that france was silent the king silent all her friends the same yes it was pitiful  and yet when she heard at last that compiegne was being closely besieged and likely to be captured and that the enemy had declared that no inhabitant of it should escape massacre not even children of seven years of age she was in a fever at once to fly to our rescue so she tore her bedclothes to strips and tied them together and descended this frail rope in the night and it broke and she fell and was badly bruised and remained three days insensible meantime neither eating nor drinking  and now came relief to us led by the count of vendome and compiegne was saved and the siege raised this was a disaster to the duke of burgundy he had to save money now it was a good time for a new bid to be made for joan of arc the english at once sent a french bishopthat forever infamous pierre cauchon of beauvais he was partly promised the archbishopric of rouen which was vacant if he should succeed he claimed the right to preside over joans ecclesiastical trial because the battleground where she was taken was within his diocese by the military usage of the time the ransom of a royal prince was 10000 livres of gold which is 61125 francsa fixed sum you see it must be accepted when offered it could not be refused  cauchon brought the offer of this very sum from the englisha royal princes ransom for the poor little peasantgirl of domremy it shows in a striking way the english idea of her formidable importance it was accepted for that sum joan of arc the savior of france was sold sold to her enemies to the enemies of her country enemies who had lashed and thrashed and thumped and trounced france for a century and made holiday sport of it enemies who had forgotten years and years ago what a frenchmans face was like so used were they to seeing nothing but his back enemies whom she had whipped whom she had cowed whom she had taught to respect french valor newborn in her nation by the breath of her spirit enemies who hungered for her life as being the only puissance able to stand between english triumph and french degradation sold to a french priest by a french prince with the french king and the french nation standing thankless by and saying nothing  and shewhat did she say nothing not a reproach passed her lips she was too great for thatshe was joan of arc and when that is said all is said  as a soldier her record was spotless she could not be called to account for anything under that head a subterfuge must be found and as we have seen was found she must be tried by priests for crimes against religion if none could be discovered some must be invented let the miscreant cauchon alone to contrive those  rouen was chosen as the scene of the trial it was in the heart of the english power its population had been under english dominion so many generations that they were hardly french now save in language the place was strongly garrisoned joan was taken there near the end of december 1430 and flung into a dungeon yes and clothed in chains that free spirit  still france made no move how do i account for this i think there is only one way you will remember that whenever joan was not at the front the french held back and ventured nothing that whenever she led they swept everything before them so long as they could see her white armor or her banner that every time she fell wounded or was reported killedas at compiegnethey broke in panic and fled like sheep i argue from this that they had undergone no real transformation as yet that at bottom they were still under the spell of a timorousness born of generations of unsuccess and a lack of confidence in each other and in their leaders born of old and bitter experience in the way of treacheries of all sortsfor their kings had been treacherous to their great vassals and to their generals and these in turn were treacherous to the head of the state and to each other the soldiery found that they could depend utterly on joan and upon her alone with her gone everything was gone she was the sun that melted the frozen torrents and set them boiling with that sun removed they froze again and the army and all france became what they had been before mere dead corpsesthat and nothing more incapable of thought hope ambition or motion      2 joan sold to the english  my wound gave me a great deal of trouble clear into the first part of october then the fresher weather renewed my life and strength all this time there were reports drifting about that the king was going to ransom joan i believed these for i was young and had not yet found out the littleness and meanness of our poor human race which brags about itself so much and thinks it is better and higher than the other animals  in october i was well enough to go out with two sorties and in the second one on the 23d i was wounded again my luck had turned you see on the night of the 25th the besiegers decamped and in the disorder and confusion one of their prisoners escaped and got safe into compiegne and hobbled into my room as pallid and pathetic an object as you would wish to see  what alive noel rainguesson  it was indeed he it was a most joyful meeting that you will easily know and also as sad as it was joyful we could not speak joans name ones voice would have broken down we knew who was meant when she was mentioned we could say she and her but we could not speak the name  we talked of the personal staff old daulon wounded and a prisoner was still with joan and serving her by permission of the duke of burgundy joan was being treated with respect due to her rank and to her character as a prisoner of war taken in honorable conflict and this was continuedas we learned lateruntil she fell into the hands of that bastard of satan pierre cauchon bishop of beauvais  noel was full of noble and affectionate praises and appreciations of our old boastful big standardbearer now gone silent forever his real and imaginary battles all fought his work done his life honorably closed and completed  and think of his luck burst out noel with his eyes full of tears always the pet child of luck  see how it followed him and stayed by him from his first step all through in the field or out of it always a splendid figure in the public eye courted and envied everywhere always having a chance to do fine things and always doing them in the beginning called the paladin in joke and called it afterward in earnest because he magnificently made the title good and at lastsupremest luck of alldied in the field died with his harness on died faithful to his charge the standard in his hand diedoh think of itwith the approving eye of joan of arc upon him  he drained the cup of glory to the last drop and went jubilant to his peace blessedly spared all part in the disaster which was to follow what luck what luck and we what was our sin that we are still here we who have also earned our place with the happy dead  and presently he said  they tore the sacred standard from his dead hand and carried it away their most precious prize after its captured owner but they havent it now a month ago we put our lives upon the riskour two good knights my fellowprisoners and iand stole it and got it smuggled by trusty hands to orleans and there it is now safe for all time in the treasury  i was glad and grateful to learn that i have seen it often since when i have gone to orleans on the 8th of may to be the petted old guest of the city and hold the first place of honor at the banquets and in the processionsi mean since joans brothers passed from this life it will still be there sacredly guarded by french love a thousand years from nowyes as long as any shred of it hangs together 1 two or three weeks after this talk came the tremendous news like a thunderclap and we were aghastjoan of arc sold to the english  not for a moment had we ever dreamed of such a thing we were young you see and did not know the human race as i have said before we had been so proud of our country so sure of her nobleness her magnanimity her gratitude we had expected little of the king but of france we had expected everything everybody knew that in various towns patriot priests had been marching in procession urging the people to sacrifice money property everything and buy the freedom of their heavensent deliverer that the money would be raised we had not thought of doubting  but it was all over now all over it was a bitter time for us the heavens seemed hung with black all cheer went out from our hearts was this comrade here at my bedside really noel rainguesson that lighthearted creature whose whole life was but one long joke and who used up more breath in laughter than in keeping his body alive no no that noel i was to see no more this ones heart was broken he moved grieving about and absently like one in a dream the stream of his laughter was dried at its source  well that was best it was my own mood we were company for each other he nursed me patiently through the dull long weeks and at last in january i was strong enough to go about again then he said  shall we go now  yes  there was no need to explain our hearts were in rouen we would carry our bodies there all that we cared for in this life was shut up in that fortress we could not help her but it would be some solace to us to be near her to breathe the air that she breathed and look daily upon the stone walls that hid her what if we should be made prisoners there well we could but do our best and let luck and fate decide what should happen  and so we started we could not realize the change which had come upon the country we seemed able to choose our own route and go whenever we pleased unchallenged and unmolested when joan of arc was in the field there was a sort of panic of fear everywhere but now that she was out of the way fear had vanished nobody was troubled about you or afraid of you nobody was curious about you or your business everybody was indifferent  we presently saw that we could take to the seine and not weary ourselves out with land travel  so we did it and were carried in a boat to within a league of rouen then we got ashore not on the hilly side but on the other where it is as level as a floor nobody could enter or leave the city without explaining himself it was because they feared attempts at a rescue of joan  we had no trouble we stopped in the plain with a family of peasants and stayed a week helping them with their work for board and lodging and making friends of them we got clothes like theirs and wore them when we had worked our way through their reserves and gotten their confidence we found that they secretly harbored french hearts in their bodies then we came out frankly and told them everything and found them ready to do anything they could to help us  our plan was soon made and was quite simple it was to help them drive a flock of sheep to the market of the city one morning early we made the venture in a melancholy drizzle of rain and passed through the frowning gates unmolested our friends had friends living over a humble wine shop in a quaint tall building situated in one of the narrow lanes that run down from the cathedral to the river and with these they bestowed us and the next day they smuggled our own proper clothing and other belongings to us the family that lodged usthe pieroonswere french in sympathy and we needed to have no secrets from them  1 it remained there three hundred and sixty years and then was destroyed in a public bonfire together with two swords a plumed cap several suits of state apparel and other relics of the maid by a mob in the time of the revolution nothing which the hand of joan of arc is known to have touched now remains in existence except a few preciously guarded military and state papers which she signed her pen being guided by a clerk or her secretary louis de conte a boulder exists from which she is known to have mounted her horse when she was once setting out upon a campaign up to a quarter of a century ago there was a single hair from her head still in existence it was drawn through the wax of a seal attached to the parchment of a state document it was surreptitiously snipped out seal and all by some vandal relichunter and carried off doubtless it still exists but only the thief knows where  translator      3 weaving the net about her  it was necessary for me to have some way to gain bread for noel and myself and when the pierrons found that i knew how to write the applied to their confessor in my behalf and he got a place for me with a good priest named manchon who was to be the chief recorder in the great trial of joan of arc now approaching it was a strange position for meclerk to the recorderand dangerous if my sympathies and the late employment should be found out but there was not much danger manchon was at bottom friendly to joan and would not betray me and my name would not for i had discarded my surname and retained only my given one like a person of low degree  i attended manchon constantly straight along out of january and into february and was often in the citadel with himin the very fortress where joan was imprisoned though not in the dungeon where she was confined and so did not see her of course  manchon told me everything that had been happening before my coming ever since the purchase of joan cauchon had been busy packing his jury for the destruction of the maidweeks and weeks he had spent in this bad industry the university of paris had sent him a number of learned and able and trusty ecclesiastics of the stripe he wanted and he had scraped together a clergyman of like stripe and great fame here and there and yonder until he was able to construct a formidable court numbering half a hundred distinguished names french names they were but their interests and sympathies were english  a great officer of the inquisition was also sent from paris for the accused must be tried by the forms of the inquisition but this was a brave and righteous man and he said squarely that this court had no power to try the case wherefore he refused to act and the same honest talk was uttered by two or three others  the inquisitor was right the case as here resurrected against joan had already been tried long ago at poitiers and decided in her favor yes and by a higher tribunal than this one for at the head of it was an archbishophe of rheimscauchons own metropolitan so here you see a lower court was impudently preparing to try and redecide a cause which had already been decided by its superior a court of higher authority imagine it no the case could not properly be tried again cauchon could not properly preside in this new court for more than one reason  rouen was not in his diocese joan had not been arrested in her domicile which was still domremy and finally this proposed judge was the prisoners outspoken enemy and therefore he was incompetent to try her yet all these large difficulties were gotten rid of the territorial chapter of rouen finally granted territorial letters to cauchonthough only after a struggle and under compulsion force was also applied to the inquisitor and he was obliged to submit  so then the little english king by his representative formally delivered joan into the hands of the court but with this reservation if the court failed to condemn her he was to have her back again ah dear what chance was there for that forsaken and friendless child friendless indeedit is the right word for she was in a black dungeon with half a dozen brutal common soldiers keeping guard night and day in the room where her cage wasfor she was in a cage an iron cage and chained to her bed by neck and hands and feet never a person near her whom she had ever seen before never a woman at all yes this was indeed friendlessness  now it was a vassal of jean de luxembourg who captured joan and compiegne and it was jean who sold her to the duke of burgundy yet this very de luxembourg was shameless enough to go and show his face to joan in her cage he came with two english earls warwick and stafford he was a poor reptile he told her he would get her set free if she would promise not to fight the english any more she had been in that cage a long time now but not long enough to break her spirit she retorted scornfully  name of god you but mock me i know that you have neither the power nor the will to do it  he insisted then the pride and dignity of the soldier rose in joan and she lifted her chained hands and let them fall with a clash saying  see these they know more than you and can prophesy better i know that the english are going to kill me for they think that when i am dead they can get the kingdom of france it is not so  though there were a hundred thousand of them they would never get it  this defiance infuriated stafford and henow think of ithe a free strong man she a chained and helpless girlhe drew his dagger and flung himself at her to stab her but warwick seized him and held him back warwick was wise take her life in that way send her to heaven stainless and undisgraced it would make her the idol of france and the whole nation would rise and march to victory and emancipation under the inspiration of her spirit no she must be saved for another fate than that  well the time was approaching for the great trial for more than two months cauchon had been raking and scraping everywhere for any odds and ends of evidence or suspicion or conjecture that might be usable against joan and carefully suppressing all evidence that came to hand in her favor he had limitless ways and means and powers at his disposal for preparing and strengthening the case for the prosecution and he used them all  but joan had no one to prepare her case for her and she was shut up in those stone walls and had no friend to appeal to for help and as for witnesses she could not call a single one in her defense they were all far away under the french flag and this was an english court they would have been seized and hanged if they had shown their faces at the gates of rouen no the prisoner must be the sole witnesswitness for the prosecution witness for the defense and with a verdict of death resolved upon before the doors were opened for the courts first sitting  when she learned that the court was made up of ecclesiastics in the interest of the english she begged that in fairness an equal number of priests of the french party should be added to these  cauchon scoffed at her message and would not even deign to answer it  by the law of the churchshe being a minor under twentyoneit was her right to have counsel to conduct her case advise her how to answer when questioned and protect her from falling into traps set by cunning devices of the prosecution she probably did not know that this was her right and that she could demand it and require it for there was none to tell her that but she begged for this help at any rate cauchon refused it she urged and implored pleading her youth and her ignorance of the complexities and intricacies of the law and of legal procedure cauchon refused again and said she must get along with her case as best she might by herself ah his heart was a stone  cauchon prepared the proces verbal i will simplify that by calling it the bill of particulars it was a detailed list of the charges against her and formed the basis of the trial charges it was a list of suspicions and public rumorsthose were the words used it was merely charged that she was suspected of having been guilty of heresies witchcraft and other such offenses against religion  now by the law of the church a trial of that sort could not be begun until a searching inquiry had been made into the history and character of the accused and it was essential that the result of this inquiry be added to the proces verbal and form a part of it you remember that that was the first thing they did before the trial at poitiers they did it again now an ecclesiastic was sent to domremy there and all about the neighborhood he made an exhaustive search into joans history and character and came back with his verdict it was very clear the searcher reported that he found joans character to be in every way what he would like his own sisters character to be just about the same report that was brought back to poitiers you see joans was a character which could endure the minutest examination  this verdict was a strong point for joan you will say yes it would have been if it could have seen the light but cauchon was awake and it disappeared from the proces verbal before the trial people were prudent enough not to inquire what became of it  one would imagine that cauchon was ready to begin the trial by this time but no he devised one more scheme for poor joans destruction and it promised to be a deadly one  one of the great personages picked out and sent down by the university of paris was an ecclesiastic named nicolas loyseleur he was tall handsome grave of smooth soft speech and courteous and winning manners there was no seeming of treachery or hypocrisy about him yet he was full of both he was admitted to joans prison by night disguised as a cobbler he pretended to be from her own country he professed to be secretly a patriot he revealed the fact that he was a priest she was filled with gladness to see one from the hills and plains that were so dear to her happier still to look upon a priest and disburden her heart in confession for the offices of the church were the bread of life the breath of her nostrils to her and she had been long forced to pine for them in vain she opened her whole innocent heart to this creature and in return he gave her advice concerning her trial which could have destroyed her if her deep native wisdom had not protected her against following it  you will ask what value could this scheme have since the secrets of the confessional are sacred and cannot be revealed truebut suppose another person should overhear them that person is not bound to keep the secret well that is what happened cauchon had previously caused a hole to be bored through the wall and he stood with his ear to that hole and heard all it is pitiful to think of these things one wonders how they could treat that poor child so she had not done them any harm      4 all ready to condemn  on tuesday the 20th of february while i sat at my masters work in the evening he came in looking sad and said it had been decided to begin the trial at eight oclock the next morning and i must get ready to assist him  of course i had been expecting such news every day for many days but no matter the shock of it almost took my breath away and set me trembling like a leaf i suppose that without knowing it i had been half imagining that at the last moment something would happen something that would stop this fatal trial maybe that la hire would burst in at the gates with his hellions at his back maybe that god would have pity and stretch forth his mighty hand but nownow there was no hope  the trial was to begin in the chapel of the fortress and would be public so i went sorrowing away and told noel so that he might be there early and secure a place it would give him a chance to look again upon the face which we so revered and which was so precious to us all the way both going and coming i plowed through chattering and rejoicing multitudes of english soldiery and englishhearted french citizens there was no talk but of the coming event many times i heard the remark accompanied by a pitiless laugh  the fat bishop has got things as he wants them at last and says he will lead the vile witch a merry dance and a short one  but here and there i glimpsed compassion and distress in a face and it was not always a french one english soldiers feared joan but they admired her for her great deeds and her unconquerable spirit  in the morning manchon and i went early yet as we approached the vast fortress we found crowds of men already there and still others gathering the chapel was already full and the way barred against further admissions of unofficial persons we took our appointed places throned on high sat the president cauchon bishop of beauvais in his grand robes and before him in rows sat his robed courtfifty distinguished ecclesiastics men of high degree in the church of clearcut intellectual faces men of deep learning veteran adepts in strategy and casuistry practised setters of traps for ignorant minds and unwary feet when i looked around upon this army of masters of legal fence gathered here to find just one verdict and no other and remembered that joan must fight for her good name and her life singlehanded against them i asked myself what chance an ignorant poor countrygirl of nineteen could have in such an unequal conflict and my heart sank down low very low when i looked again at that obese president puffing and wheezing there his great belly distending and receding with each breath and noted his three chins fold above fold and his knobby and knotty face and his purple and splotchy complexion and his repulsive cauliflower nose and his cold and malignant eyesa brute every detail of himmy heart sank lower still and when i noted that all were afraid of this man and shrank and fidgeted in their seats when his eye smote theirs my last poor ray of hope dissolved away and wholly disappeared  there was one unoccupied seat in this place and only one it was over against the wall in view of every one it was a little wooden bench without a back and it stood apart and solitary on a sort of dais tall menatarms in morion breastplate and steel gauntlets stood as stiff as their own halberds on each side of this dais but no other creature was near by it a pathetic little bench to me it was for i knew whom it was for and the sight of it carried my mind back to the great court at poitiers where joan sat upon one like it and calmly fought her cunning fight with the astonished doctors of the church and parliament and rose from it victorious and applauded by all and went forth to fill the world with the glory of her name  what a dainty little figure she was and how gentle and innocent how winning and beautiful in the fresh bloom of her seventeen years those were grand days and so recentfor she was just nineteen nowand how much she had seen since and what wonders she had accomplished  but nowoh all was changed now she had been languishing in dungeons away from light and air and the cheer of friendly faces for nearly threequarters of a yearshe born child of the sun natural comrade of the birds and of all happy free creatures she would be weary now and worn with this long captivity her forces impaired despondent perhaps as knowing there was no hope yes all was changed  all this time there had been a muffled hum of conversation and rustling of robes and scraping of feet on the floor a combination of dull noises which filled all the place suddenly  produce the accused  it made me catch my breath my heart began to thump like a hammer but there was silence nowsilence absolute all those noises ceased and it was as if they had never been not a sound the stillness grew oppressive it was like a weight upon one all faces were turned toward the door and one could properly expect that for most of the people there suddenly realized no doubt that they were about to see in actual flesh and blood what had been to them before only an embodied prodigy a word a phrase a worldgirdling name  the stillness continued then far down the stonepaved corridors one heard a vague slow sound approaching clank clink clankjoan of arc deliverer of france in chains  my head swam all things whirled and spun about me ah i was realizing too      5 fifty experts against a novice  i give you my honor now that i am not going to distort or discolor the facts of this miserable trial no i will give them to you honestly detail by detail just as manchon and i set them down daily in the official record of the court and just as one may read them in the printed histories  there will be only this difference that in talking familiarly with you i shall use my right to comment upon the proceedings and explain them as i go along so that you can understand them better also i shall throw in trifles which came under our eyes and have a certain interest for you and me but were not important enough to go into the official record 1 to take up my story now where i left off we heard the clanking of joans chains down the corridors she was approaching  presently she appeared a thrill swept the house and one heard deep breaths drawn two guardsmen followed her at a short distance to the rear her head was bowed a little and she moved slowly she being weak and her irons heavy she had on mens attireall black a soft woolen stuff intensely black funereally black not a speck of relieving color in it from her throat to the floor a wide collar of this same black stuff lay in radiating folds upon her shoulders and breast the sleeves of her doublet were full down to the elbows and tight thence to her manacled wrists below the doublet tight black hose down to the chains on her ankles  halfway to her bench she stopped just where a wide shaft of light fell slanting from a window and slowly lifted her face another thrillit was totally colorless white as snow a face of gleaming snow set in vivid contrast upon that slender statue of somber unmitigated black it was smooth and pure and girlish beautiful beyond belief infinitely sad and sweet but dear dear when the challenge of those untamed eyes fell upon that judge and the droop vanished from her form and it straightened up soldierly and noble my heart leaped for joy and i said all is well all is wellthey have not broken her they have not conquered her she is joan of arc still yes it was plain to me now that there was one spirit there which this dreaded judge could not quell nor make afraid  she moved to her place and mounted the dais and seated herself upon her bench gathering her chains into her lap and nestling her little white hands there then she waited in tranquil dignity the only person there who seemed unmoved and unexcited a bronzed and brawny english soldier standing at martial ease in the front rank of the citizen spectators did now most gallantly and respectfully put up his great hand and give her the military salute and she smiling friendly put up hers and returned it whereat there was a sympathetic little break of applause which the judge sternly silence  now the memorable inquisition called in history the great trial began fifty experts against a novice and no one to help the novice  the judge summarized the circumstances of the case and the public reports and suspicions upon which it was based then he required joan to kneel and make oath that she would answer with exact truthfulness to all questions asked her  joans mind was not asleep it suspected that dangerous possibilities might lie hidden under this apparently fair and reasonable demand she answered with the simplicity which so often spoiled the enemys bestlaid plans in the trial at poitiers and said  no for i do not know what you are going to ask me you might ask of me things which i would not tell you  this incensed the court and brought out a brisk flurry of angry exclamations joan was not disturbed cauchon raised his voice and began to speak in the midst of this noise but he was so angry that he could hardly get his words out he said  with the divine assistance of our lord we require you to expedite these proceedings for the welfare of your conscience swear with your hands upon the gospels that you will answer true to the questions which shall be asked you and he brought down his fat hand with a crash upon his official table  joan said with composure  as concerning my father and mother and the faith and what things i have done since my coming into france i will gladly answer but as regards the revelations which i have received from god my voices have forbidden me to confide them to any save my king  here there was another angry outburst of threats and expletives and much movement and confusion so she had to stop and wait for the noise to subside then her waxen face flushed a little and she straightened up and fixed her eye on the judge and finished her sentence in a voice that had the old ring to it  and i will never reveal these things though you cut my head off  well maybe you know what a deliberative body of frenchmen is like the judge and half the court were on their feet in a moment and all shaking their fists at the prisoner and all storming and vituperating at once so that you could hardly hear yourself think they kept this up several minutes and because joan sat untroubled and indifferent they grew madder and noisier all the time once she said with a fleeting trace of the oldtime mischief in her eye and manner  prithee speak one at a time fair lords then i will answer all of you  at the end of three whole hours of furious debating over the oath the situation had not changed a jot the bishop was still requiring an unmodified oath joan was refusing for the twentieth time to take any except the one which she had herself proposed there was a physical change apparent but it was confined to the court and judge they were hoarse droopy exhausted by their long frenzy and had a sort of haggard look in their faces poor men whereas joan was still placid and reposeful and did not seem noticeably tired  the noise quieted down there was a waiting pause of some moments duration then the judge surrendered to the prisoner and with bitterness in his voice told her to take the oath after her own fashion joan sunk at once to her knees and as she laid her hands upon the gospels that big english soldier set free his mind  by god if she were but english she were not in this place another half a second  it was the soldier in him responding to the soldier in her but what a stinging rebuke it was what an arraignment of french character and french royalty would that he could have uttered just that one phrase in the hearing of orleans i know that that grateful city that adoring city would have risen to the last man and the last woman and marched upon rouen some speechesspeeches that shame a man and humble himburn themselves into the memory and remain there that one is burned into mine  after joan had made oath cauchon asked her her name and where she was born and some questions about her family also what her age was she answered these then he asked her how much education she had  i have learned from my mother the pater noster the ave maria and the belief all that i know was taught me by my mother  questions of this unessential sort dribbled on for a considerable time everybody was tired out by now except joan the tribunal prepared to rise at this point cauchon forbade joan to try to escape from prison upon pain of being held guilty of the crime of heresysingular logic she answered simply  i am not bound by this proposition if i could escape i would not reproach myself for i have given no promise and i shall not  then she complained of the burden of her chains and asked that they might be removed for she was strongly guarded in that dungeon and there was no need of them but the bishop refused and reminded her that she had broken out of prison twice before joan of arc was too proud to insist she only said as she rose to go with the guard  it is true i have wanted to escape and i do want to escape then she added in a way that would touch the pity of anybody i think it is the right of every prisoner  and so she went from the place in the midst of an impressive stillness which made the sharper and more distressful to me the clank of those pathetic chains  what presence of mind she had one could never surprise her out of it she saw noel and me there when she first took her seat on the bench and we flushed to the forehead with excitement and emotion but her face showed nothing betrayed nothing her eyes sought us fifty times that day but they passed on and there was never any ray of recognition in them another would have started upon seeing us and thenwhy then there could have been trouble for us of course  we walked slowly home together each busy with his own grief and saying not a word  1 he kept his word his account of the great trial will be found to be in strict and detailed accordance with the sworn facts of history translator      6 the maid baffles her persecutors  that night manchon told me that all through the days proceedings cauchon had had some clerks concealed in the embrasure of a window who were to make a special report garbling joans answers and twisting them from their right meaning ah that was surely the cruelest man and the most shameless that has lived in this world but his scheme failed those clerks had human hearts in them and their base work revolted them and they turned to and boldly made a straight report whereupon cauchon cursed them and ordered them out of his presence with a threat of drowning which was his favorite and most frequent menace the matter had gotten abroad and was making great and unpleasant talk and cauchon would not try to repeat this shabby game right away it comforted me to hear that  when we arrived at the citadel next morning we found that a change had been made the chapel had been found too small the court had now removed to a noble chamber situated at the end of the great hall of the castle the number of judges was increased to sixtytwoone ignorant girl against such odds and none to help her  the prisoner was brought in she was as white as ever but she was looking no whit worse than she looked when she had first appeared the day before isnt it a strange thing yesterday she had sat five hours on that backless bench with her chains in her lap baited badgered persecuted by that unholy crew without even the refreshment of a cup of waterfor she was never offered anything and if i have made you know her by this time you will know without my telling you that she was not a person likely to ask favors of those people and she had spent the night caged in her wintry dungeon with her chains upon her yet here she was as i say collected unworn and ready for the conflict yes and the only person there who showed no signs of the wear and worry of yesterday and her eyesah you should have seen them and broken your hearts have you seen that veiled deep glow that pathetic hurt dignity that unsubdued and unsubduable spirit that burns and smolders in the eye of a caged eagle and makes you feel mean and shabby under the burden of its mute reproach her eyes were like that how capable they were and how wonderful yes at all times and in all circumstances they could express as by print every shade of the wide range of her moods in them were hidden floods of gay sunshine the softest and peacefulest twilights and devastating storms and lightnings not in this world have there been others that were comparable to them such is my opinion and none that had the privilege to see them would say otherwise than this which i have said concerning them  the seance began and how did it begin should you think exactly as it began beforewith that same tedious thing which had been settled once after so much wrangling the bishop opened thus  you are required now to take the oath pure and simple to answer truly all questions asked you  joan replied placidly  i have made oath yesterday my lord let that suffice  the bishop insisted and insisted with rising temper joan but shook her head and remained silent at last she said  i made oath yesterday it is sufficient then she sighed and said of a truth you do burden me too much  the bishop still insisted still commanded but he could not move her at last he gave it up and turned her over for the days inquest to an old hand at tricks and traps and deceptive plausibilitiesbeaupere a doctor of theology now notice the form of this sleek strategists first remarkflung out in an easy offhand way that would have thrown any unwatchful person off his guard  now joan the matter is very simple just speak up and frankly and truly answer the questions which i am going to ask you as you have sworn to do  it was a failure joan was not asleep she saw the artifice she said  no you could ask me things which i could not tell youand would not then reflecting upon how profane and out of character it was for these ministers of god to be prying into matters which had proceeded from his hands under the awful seal of his secrecy she added with a warning note in her tone if you were well informed concerning me you would wish me out of your hands i have done nothing but by revelation  beaupere changed his attack and began an approach from another quarter he would slip upon her you see under cover of innocent and unimportant questions  did you learn any trade at home  yes to sew and to spin then the invincible soldier victor of patay conqueror of the lion talbot deliverer of orleans restorer of a kings crown commanderinchief of a nations armies straightened herself proudly up gave her head a little toss and said with naive complacency and when it comes to that i am not afraid to be matched against any woman in rouen  the crowd of spectators broke out with applausewhich pleased joanand there was many a friendly and petting smile to be seen but cauchon stormed at the people and warned them to keep still and mind their manners  beaupere asked other questions then  had you other occupations at home  yes i helped my mother in the household work and went to the pastures with the sheep and the cattle  her voice trembled a little but one could hardly notice it as for me it brought those old enchanted days flooding back to me and i could not see what i was writing for a little while  beaupere cautiously edged along up with other questions toward the forbidden ground and finally repeated a question which she had refused to answer a little while backas to whether she had received the eucharist in those days at other festivals than that of easter joan merely said  passez outre or as one might say pass on to matters which you are privileged to pry into  i heard a member of the court say to a neighbor  as a rule witnesses are but dull creatures and an easy preyyes and easily embarrassed easily frightenedbut truly one can neither scare this child nor find her dozing  presently the house pricked up its ears and began to listen eagerly for beaupere began to touch upon joans voices a matter of consuming interest and curiosity to everybody his purpose was to trick her into heedless sayings that could indicate that the voices had sometimes given her evil advicehence that they had come from satan you see to have dealing with the devilwell that would send her to the stake in brief order and that was the deliberate end and aim of this trial  when did you first hear these voices  i was thirteen when i first heard a voice coming from god to help me to live well i was frightened it came at midday in my fathers garden in the summer  had you been fasting  yes  the day before  no  from what direction did it come  from the rightfrom toward the church  did it come with a bright light  oh indeed yes it was brilliant when i came into france i often heard the voices very loud  what did the voice sound like  it was a noble voice and i thought it was sent to me from god the third time i heard it i recognized it as being an angels  you could understand it  quite easily it was always clear  what advice did it give you as to the salvation of your soul  it told me to live rightly and be regular in attendance upon the services of the church and it told me that i must go to france  in what species of form did the voice appear  joan looked suspiciously at he priest a moment then said tranquilly  as to that i will not tell you  did the voice seek you often  yes twice or three times a week saying leave your village and go to france  did you father know about your departure  no the voice said go to france therefore i could not abide at home any longer  what else did it say  that i should raise the siege of orleans  was that all  no i was to go to vaucouleurs and robert de baudricourt would give me soldiers to go with me to france and i answered saying that i was a poor girl who did not know how to ride neither how to fight  then she told how she was balked and interrupted at vaucouleurs but finally got her soldiers and began her march  how were you dressed  the court of poitiers had distinctly decided and decreed that as god had appointed her to do a mans work it was meet and no scandal to religion that she should dress as a man but no matter this court was ready to use any and all weapons against joan even broken and discredited ones and much was going to be made of this one before this trial should end  i wore a mans dress also a sword which robert de baudricourt gave me but no other weapon  who was it that advised you to wear the dress of a man  joan was suspicious again she would not answer  the question was repeated  she refused again  answer it is a command  passez outre was all she said  so beaupere gave up the matter for the present  what did baudricourt say to you when you left  he made them that were to go with me promise to take charge of me and to me he said go and let happen what may advienne que pourra after a good deal of questioning upon other matters she was asked again about her attire she said it was necessary for her to dress as a man  did your voice advise it  joan merely answered placidly  i believe my voice gave me good advice  it was all that could be got out of her so the questions wandered to other matters and finally to her first meeting with the king at chinon she said she chose out the king who was unknown to her by the revelation of her voices all that happened at that time was gone over finally  do you still hear those voices  they come to me every day  what do you ask of them  i have never asked of them any recompense but the salvation of my soul  did the voice always urge you to follow the army  he is creeping upon her again she answered  it required me to remain behind at st denis i would have obeyed if i had been free but i was helpless by my wound and the knights carried me away by force  when were you wounded  i was wounded in the moat before paris in the assault  the next question reveals what beaupere had been leading up to  was it a feastday  you see the suggestion that a voice coming from god would hardly advise or permit the violation by war and bloodshed of a sacred day  joan was troubled a moment then she answered yes it was a feastday  now then tell the this did you hold it right to make the attack on such a day  this was a shot which might make the first breach in a wall which had suffered no damage thus far there was immediate silence in the court and intense expectancy noticeable all about but joan disappointed the house she merely made a slight little motion with her hand as when one brushes away a fly and said with reposeful indifference  passez outre  smiles danced for a moment in some of the sternest faces there and several men even laughed outright the trap had been long and laboriously prepared it fell and was empty  the court rose it had sat for hours and was cruelly fatigued most of the time had been taken up with apparently idle and purposeless inquiries about the chinon events the exiled duke of orleans joans first proclamation and so on but all this seemingly random stuff had really been sown thick with hidden traps but joan had fortunately escaped them all some by the protecting luck which attends upon ignorance and innocence some by happy accident the others by force of her best and surest helper the clear vision and lightning intuitions of her extraordinary mind  now then this daily baiting and badgering of this friendless girl a captive in chains was to continue a long long timedignified sport a kennel of mastiffs and bloodhounds harassing a kittenand i may as well tell you upon sworn testimony what it was like from the first day to the last when poor joan had been in her grave a quarter of a century the pope called together that great court which was to reexamine her history and whose just verdict cleared her illustrious name from every spot and stain and laid upon the verdict and conduct of our rouen tribunal the blight of its everlasting execrations manchon and several of the judges who had been members of our court were among the witnesses who appeared before that tribunal of rehabilitation recalling these miserable proceedings which i have been telling you about manchon testified thushere you have it all in fair print in the unofficial history  when joan spoke of her apparitions she was interrupted at almost every word they wearied her with long and multiplied interrogatories upon all sorts of things almost every day the interrogatories of the morning lasted three or four hours then from these morning interrogatories they extracted the particularly difficult and subtle points and these served as material for the afternoon interrogatories which lasted two or three hours moment by moment they skipped from one subject to another yet in spite of this she always responded with an astonishing wisdom and memory she often corrected the judges saying but i have already answered that once beforeask the recorder referring them to me  and here is the testimony of one of joans judges remember these witnesses are not talking about two or three days they are talking about a tedious long procession of days  they asked her profound questions but she extricated herself quite well sometimes the questioners changed suddenly and passed on to another subject to see if she would not contradict herself they burdened her with long interrogatories of two or three hours from which the judges themselves went forth fatigued from the snares with which she was beset the expertest man in the world could not have extricated himself but with difficulty she gave her responses with great prudence indeed to such a degree that during three weeks i believed she was inspired  ah had she a mind such as i have described you see what these priests say under oathpicked men men chosen for their places in that terrible court on account of their learning their experience their keen and practised intellects and their strong bias against the prisoner they make that poor countrygirl out the match and more than the match of the sixtytwo trained adepts isnt it so they from the university of paris she from the sheepfold and the cowstable  ah yes she was great she was wonderful it took six thousand years to produce her her like will not be seen in the earth again in fifty thousand such is my opinion      7 craft that was in vain  the third meeting of the court was in that same spacious chamber next day 24th of february  how did it begin in just the same old way when the preparations were ended the robed sixtytwo massed in their chairs and the guards and orderkeepers distributed to their stations cauchon spoke from his throne and commanded joan to lay her hands upon the gospels and swear to tell the truth concerning everything asked her  joans eyes kindled and she rose rose and stood fine and noble and faced toward the bishop and said  take care what you do my lord you who are my judge for you take a terrible responsibility on yourself and you presume too far  it made a great stir and cauchon burst out upon her with an awful threatthe threat of instant condemnation unless she obeyed that made the very bones of my body turn cold and i saw cheeks about me blanchfor it meant fire and the stake but joan still standing answered him back proud and undismayed  not all the clergy in paris and rouen could condemn me lacking the right  this made a great tumult and part of it was applause from the spectators joan resumed her seat  the bishop still insisted joan said  i have already made oath it is enough  the bishop shouted  in refusing to swear you place yourself under suspicion  let be i have sworn already it is enough  the bishop continued to insist joan answered that she would tell what she knewbut not all that she knew  the bishop plagued her straight along till at last she said in a weary tone  i came from god i have nothing more to do here return me to god from whom i came  it was piteous to hear it was the same as saying you only want my life take it and let me be at peace  the bishop stormed out again  once more i command you to  joan cut in with a nonchalant passez outre and cauchon retired from the struggle but he retired with some credit this time for he offered a compromise and joan always clearheaded saw protection for herself in it and promptly and willingly accepted it she was to swear to tell the truth as touching the matters et down in the proces verbal they could not sail her outside of definite limits now her course was over a charted sea henceforth the bishop had granted more than he had intended and more than he would honestly try to abide by  by command beaupere resumed his examination of the accused it being lent there might be a chance to catch her neglecting some detail of her religious duties i could have told him he would fail there why religion was her life  since when have you eaten or drunk  if the least thing had passed her lips in the nature of sustenance neither her youth nor the fact that she was being half starved in her prison could save her from dangerous suspicion of contempt for the commandments of the church  i have done neither since yesterday at noon  the priest shifted to the voices again  when have you heard your voice  yesterday and today  at what time  yesterday it was in the morning  what were you doing then  i was asleep and it woke me  by touching your arm  no without touching me  did you thank it did you kneel  he had satan in his mind you see and was hoping perhaps that by and by it could be shown that she had rendered homage to the arch enemy of god and man  yes i thanked it and knelt in my bed where i was chained and joined my hands and begged it to implore gods help for me so that i might have light and instruction as touching the answers i should give here  then what did the voice say  it told me to answer boldly and god would help me then she turned toward cauchon and said you say that you are my judge now i tell you again take care what you do for in truth i am sent of god and you are putting yourself in great danger  beaupere asked her if the voices counsels were not fickle and variable  no it never contradicts itself this very day it has told me again to answer boldly  has it forbidden you to answer only part of what is asked you  i will tell you nothing as to that i have revelations touching the king my master and those i will not tell you then she was stirred by a great emotion and the tears sprang to her eyes and she spoke out as with strong conviction saying  i believe whollyas wholly as i believe the christian faith and that god has redeemed us from the fires of hell that god speaks to me by that voice  being questioned further concerning the voice she said she was not at liberty to tell all she knew  do you think god would be displeased at your telling the whole truth  the voice has commanded me to tell the king certain things and not youand some very latelyeven last night things which i would he knew he would be more easy at his dinner  why doesnt the voice speak to the king itself as it did when you were with him would it not if you asked it  i do not know if it be the wish of god she was pensive a moment or two busy with her thoughts and far away no doubt then she added a remark in which beaupere always watchful always alert detected a possible openinga chance to set a trap do you think he jumped at it instantly betraying the joy he had in his mind as a young hand at craft and artifice would do  no oh no you could not tell that he had noticed the remark at all he slid indifferently away from it at once and began to ask idle questions about other things so as to slip around and spring on it from behind so to speak tedious and empty questions as to whether the voice had told her she would escape from this prison and if it had furnished answers to be used by her in todays seance if it was accompanied with a glory of light if it had eyes etc that risky remark of joans was this  without the grace of god i could do nothing  the court saw the priests game and watched his play with a cruel eagerness poor joan was grown dreamy and absent possibly she was tired her life was in imminent danger and she did not suspect it the time was ripe now and beaupere quietly and stealthily sprang his trap  are you in a state of grace  ah we had two or three honorable brave men in that pack of judges and jean lefevre was one of them he sprang to his feet and cried out  it is a terrible question the accused is not obliged to answer it  cauchons face flushed black with anger to see this plank flung to the perishing child and he shouted  silence and take your seat the accused will answer the question  there was no hope no way out of the dilemma for whether she said yes or whether she said no it would be all the samea disastrous answer for the scriptures had said one cannot know this thing think what hard hearts they were to set this fatal snare for that ignorant young girl and be proud of such work and happy in it it was a miserable moment for me while we waited it seemed a year all the house showed excitement and mainly it was glad excitement joan looked out upon these hungering faces with innocent untroubled eyes and then humbly and gently she brought out that immortal answer which brushed the formidable snare away as it had been but a cobweb  if i be not in a state of grace i pray god place me in it if i be in it i pray god keep me so  ah you will never see an effect like that no not while you live for a space there was the silence of the grave men looked wondering into each others faces and some were awed and crossed themselves and i heard lefevre mutter  it was beyond the wisdom of man to devise that answer whence comes this childs amazing inspirations  beaupere presently took up his work again but the humiliation of his defeat weighed upon him and he made but a rambling and dreary business of it he not being able to put any heart in it  he asked joan a thousand questions about her childhood and about the oak wood and the fairies and the childrens games and romps under our dear arbre fee bourlemont and this stirring up of old memories broke her voice and made her cry a little but she bore up as well as she could and answered everything  then the priest finished by touching again upon the matter of her apparela matter which was never to be lost sight of in this stillhunt for this innocent creatures life but kept always hanging over her a menace charged with mournful possibilities  would you like a womans dress  indeed yes if i may go out from this prisonbut here no      8 joan tells of her visions  the court met next on monday the 27th would you believe it the bishop ignored the contract limiting the examination to matters set down in the proces verbal and again commanded joan to take the oath without reservations she said  you should be content i have sworn enough  she stood her ground and cauchon had to yield  the examination was resumed concerning joans voices  you have said that you recognized them as being the voices of angels the third time that you heard them what angels were they  st catherine and st marguerite  how did you know that it was those two saints how could you tell the one from the other  i know it was they and i know how to distinguish them  by what sign  by their manner of saluting me i have been these seven years under their direction and i knew who they were because they told me  whose was the first voice that came to you when you were thirteen years old  it was the voice of st michael i saw him before my eyes and he was not alone but attended by a cloud of angels  did you see the archangel and the attendant angels in the body or in the spirit  i saw them with the eyes of my body just as i see you and when they went away i cried because they did not take me with them  it made me see that awful shadow again that fell dazzling white upon her that day under larbre fee de bourlemont and it made me shiver again though it was so long ago it was really not very long gone by but it seemed so because so much had happened since  in what shape and form did st michael appear  as to that i have not received permission to speak  what did the archangel say to you that first time  i cannot answer you today  meaning i think that she would have to get permission of her voices first  presently after some more questions as to the revelations which had been conveyed through her to the king she complained of the unnecessity of all this and said  i will say again as i have said before many times in these sittings that i answered all questions of this sort before the court at poitiers and i would that you wold bring here the record of that court and read from that prithee send for that book  there was no answer it was a subject that had to be got around and put aside that book had wisely been gotten out of the way for it contained things which would be very awkward here  among them was a decision that joans mission was from god whereas it was the intention of this inferior court to show that it was from the devil also a decision permitting joan to wear male attire whereas it was the purpose of this court to make the male attire do hurtful work against her  how was it that you were moved to come into franceby your own desire  yes and by command of god but that it was his will i would not have come i would sooner have had my body torn in sunder by horses than come lacking that  beaupere shifted once more to the matter of the male attire now and proceeded to make a solemn talk about it that tried joans patience and presently she interrupted and said  it is a trifling thing and of no consequence and i did not put it on by counsel of any man but by command of god  robert de baudricourt did not order you to wear it  no  did you think you did well in taking the dress of a man  i did well to do whatsoever thing god commanded me to do  but in this particular case do you think you did well in taking the dress of a man  i have done nothing but by command of god  beaupere made various attempts to lead her into contradictions of herself also to put her words and acts in disaccord with the scriptures but it was lost time he did not succeed he returned to her visions the light which shone about them her relations with the king and so on  was there an angel above the kings head the first time you saw him  by the blessed mary  she forced her impatience down and finished her sentence with tranquillity if there was one i did not see it  was there light  there were more than three thousand soldiers there and five hundred torches without taking account of spiritual light  what made the king believe in the revelations which you brought him  he had signs also the counsel of the clergy  what revelations were made to the king  you will not get that out of me this year  presently she added during three weeks i was questioned by the clergy at chinon and poitiers the king had a sign before he would believe and the clergy were of opinion that my acts were good and not evil  the subject was dropped now for a while and beaupere took up the matter of the miraculous sword of fierbois to see if he could not find a chance there to fix the crime of sorcery upon joan  how did you know that there was an ancient sword buried in the ground under the rear of the altar of the church of st catherine of fierbois  joan had no concealments to make as to this  i knew the sword was there because my voices told me so and i sent to ask that it be given to me to carry in the wars it seemed to me that it was not very deep in the ground the clergy of the church caused it to be sought for and dug up and they polished it and the rust fell easily off from it  were you wearing it when you were taken in battle at compiegne  no but i wore it constantly until i left st denis after the attack upon paris  this sword so mysteriously discovered and so long and so constantly victorious was suspected of being under the protection of enchantment  was that sword blest what blessing had been invoked upon it  none i loved it because it was found in the church of st catherine for i loved that church very dearly  she loved it because it had been built in honor of one of her angels  didnt you lay it upon the altar to the end that it might be lucky the altar of st denis no  didnt you pray that it might be made lucky  truly it were no harm to wish that my harness might be fortunate  then it was not that sword which you wore in the field of compiegne what sword did you wear there  the sword of the burgundian franquet darras whom i took prisoner in the engagement at lagny i kept it because it was a good warswordgood to lay on stout thumps and blows with  she said that quite simply and the contrast between her delicate little self and the grim soldier words which she dropped with such easy familiarity from her lips made many spectators smile  what is become of the other sword where is it now  is that in the proces verbal  beaupere did not answer  which do you love best your banner or your sword  her eye lighted gladly at the mention of her banner and she cried out  i love my banner bestoh forty times more than the sword sometimes i carried it myself when i charged the enemy to avoid killing any one then she added naively and with again that curious contrast between her girlish little personality and her subject i have never killed anyone  it made a great many smile and no wonder when you consider what a gentle and innocent little thing she looked one could hardly believe she had ever even seen men slaughtered she look so little fitted for such things  in the final assault at orleans did you tell your soldiers that the arrows shot by the enemy and the stones discharged from their catapults would not strike any one but you  no and the proof is that more than a hundred of my men were struck i told them to have no doubts and no fears that they would raise the siege i was wounded in the neck by an arrow in the assault upon the bastille that commanded the bridge but st catherine comforted me and i was cured in fifteen days without having to quit the saddle and leave my work  did you know that you were going to be wounded  yes and i had told it to the king beforehand i had it from my voices  when you took jargeau why did you not put its commandant to ransom  i offered him leave to go out unhurt from the place with all his garrison and if he would not i would take it by storm  and you did i believe  yes  had your voices counseled you to take it by storm  as to that i do not remember  thus closed a weary long sitting without result every device that could be contrived to trap joan into wrong thinking wrong doing or disloyalty to the church or sinfulness as a little child at home or later had been tried and none of them had succeeded she had come unscathed through the ordeal  was the court discouraged no naturally it was very much surprised very much astonished to find its work baffling and difficult instead of simple and easy but it had powerful allies in the shape of hunger cold fatigue persecution deception and treachery and opposed to this array nothing but a defenseless and ignorant girl who must some time or other surrender to bodily and mental exhaustion or get caught in one of the thousand traps set for her  and had the court made no progress during these seemingly resultless sittings yes it had been feeling its way groping here groping there and had found one or two vague trails which might freshen by and by and lead to something the male attire for instance and the visions and voices of course no one doubted that she had seen supernatural beings and been spoken to and advised by them and of course no one doubted that by supernatural help miracles had been done by joan such as choosing out the king in a crowd when she had never seen him before and her discovery of the sword buried under the altar it would have been foolish to doubt these things for we all know that the air is full of devils and angels that are visible to traffickers in magic on the one hand and to the stainlessly holy on the other but what many and perhaps most did doubt was that joans visions voices and miracles came from god it was hoped that in time they could be proven to have been of satanic origin therefore as you see the courts persistent fashion of coming back to that subject every little while and spooking around it and prying into it was not to pass the timeit had a strictly business end in view      9 her sure deliverance foretold  the next sitting opened on thursday the first of march fiftyeight judges presentthe others resting  as usual joan was required to take an oath without reservations she showed no temper this time she considered herself well buttressed by the proces verbal compromise which cauchon was so anxious to repudiate and creep out of so she merely refused distinctly and decidedly and added in a spirit of fairness and candor  but as to matters set down in the proces verbal i will freely tell the whole truthyes as freely and fully as if i were before the pope  here was a chance we had two or three popes then only one of them could be the true pope of course everybody judiciously shirked the question of which was the true pope and refrained from naming him it being clearly dangerous to go into particulars in this matter here was an opportunity to trick an unadvised girl into bringing herself into peril and the unfair judge lost no time in taking advantage of it he asked in a plausibly indolent and absent way  which one do you consider to be the true pope  the house took an attitude of deep attention and so waited to hear the answer and see the prey walk into the trap but when the answer came it covered the judge with confusion and you could see many people covertly chuckling for joan asked in a voice and manner which almost deceived even me so innocent it seemed  are there two  one of the ablest priests in that body and one of the best swearers there spoke right out so that half the house heard him and said  by god it was a master stroke  as soon as the judge was better of his embarrassment he came back to the charge but was prudent and passed by joans question  is it true that you received a letter from the count of armagnac asking you which of the three popes he ought to obey  yes and answered it  copies of both letters were produced and read joan said that hers had not been quite strictly copied she said she had received the counts letter when she was just mounting her horse and added  so in dictating a word or two of reply i said i would try to answer him from paris or somewhere where i could be at rest  she was asked again which pope she had considered the right one  i was not able to instruct the count of armagnac as to which one he ought to obey then she added with a frank fearlessness which sounded fresh and wholesome in that den of trimmers and shufflers but as for me i hold that we are bound to obey our lord the pope who is at rome  the matter was dropped they produced and read a copy of joans first effort at dictatingher proclamation summoning the english to retire from the siege of orleans and vacate francetruly a great and fine production for an unpractised girl of seventeen  do you acknowledge as your own the document which has just been read  yes except that there are errors in itwords which make me give myself too much importance i saw what was coming i was troubled and ashamed for instance i did not say deliver up to the maid rendez au la pucelle i said deliver up to the king rendez au roi and i did not call myself commanderinchief chef de guerre all those are words which my secretary substituted or mayhap he misheard me or forgot what i said  she did not look at me when she said it she spared me that embarrassment i hadnt misheard her at all and hadnt forgotten i changed her language purposely for she was commanderinchief and entitled to call herself so and it was becoming and proper too and who was going to surrender anything to the kingat that time a stick a cipher if any surrendering was done it would be to the noble maid of vaucouleurs already famed and formidable though she had not yet struck a blow  ah there would have been a fine and disagreeable episode for me there if that pitiless court had discovered that the very scribbler of that piece of dictation secretary to joan of arc was presentand not only present but helping build the record and not only that but destined at a far distant day to testify against lies and perversions smuggled into it by cauchon and deliver them over to eternal infamy  do you acknowledge that you dictated this proclamation  i do  have you repented of it do you retract it  ah then she was indignant  no not even these chainsand she shook themnot even these chains can chill the hopes that i uttered there and moreshe rose and stood a moment with a divine strange light kindling in her face then her words burst forth as in a floodi warn you now that before seven years a disaster will smite the english oh many fold greater than the fall of orleans and  silence sit down  and then soon after they will lose all france  now consider these things the french armies no longer existed the french cause was standing still our king was standing still there was no hint that by and by the constable richemont would come forward and take up the great work of joan of arc and finish it in face of all this joan made that prophecymade it with perfect confidenceand it came true for within five years paris fell1436and our king marched into it flying the victors flag so the first part of the prophecy was then fulfilledin fact almost the entire prophecy for with paris in our hands the fulfilment of the rest of it was assured  twenty years later all france was ours excepting a single towncalais  now that will remind you of an earlier prophecy of joans at the time that she wanted to take paris and could have done it with ease if our king had but consented she said that that was the golden time that with paris ours all france would be ours in six months but if this golden opportunity to recover france was wasted said she i give you twenty years to do it in  she was right after paris fell in 1436 the rest of the work had to be done city by city castle by castle and it took twenty years to finish it  yes it was the first day of march 1431 there in the court that she stood in the view of everybody and uttered that strange and incredible prediction now and then in this world somebodys prophecy turns up correct but when you come to look into it there is sure to be considerable room for suspicion that the prophecy was made after the fact but here the matter is different there in that court joans prophecy was set down in the official record at the hour and moment of its utterance years before the fulfilment and there you may read it to this day  twentyfive years after joans death the record was produced in the great court of the rehabilitation and verified under oath by manchon and me and surviving judges of our court confirmed the exactness of the record in their testimony  joan startling utterance on that now so celebrated first of march stirred up a great turmoil and it was some time before it quieted down again naturally everybody was troubled for a prophecy is a grisly and awful thing whether one thinks it ascends from hell or comes down from heaven  all that these people felt sure of was that the inspiration back of it was genuine and puissant  they would have given their right hands to know the source of it  at last the questions began again  how do you know that those things are going to happen  i know it by revelation and i know it as surely as i know that you sit here before me  this sort of answer was not going to allay the spreading uneasiness therefore after some further dallying the judge got the subject out of the way and took up one which he could enjoy more  what languages do your voices speak  french  st marguerite too  verily why not she is on our side not on the english  saints and angels who did not condescend to speak english is a grave affront they could not be brought into court and punished for contempt but the tribunal could take silent note of joans remark and remember it against her which they did it might be useful by and by  do your saints and angels wear jewelrycrowns rings earrings  to joan questions like these were profane frivolities and not worthy of serious notice she answered indifferently but the question brought to her mind another matter and she turned upon cauchon and said  i had two rings they have been taken away from me during my captivity you have one of them it is the gift of my brother give it back to me if not to me then i pray that it be given to the church  the judges conceived the idea that maybe these rings were for the working of enchantments  perhaps they could be made to do joan a damage  where is the other ring  the burgundians have it  where did you get it  my father and mother gave it to me  describe it  it is plain and simple and has jesus and mary engraved upon it  everybody could see that that was not a valuable equipment to do devils work with so that trail was not worth following still to make sure one of the judges asked joan if she had ever cured sick people by touching them with the ring she said no  now as concerning the fairies that were used to abide near by domremy whereof there are many reports and traditions it is said that your godmother surprised these creatures on a summers night dancing under the tree called larbre fee de bourlemont is it not possible that your pretended saints and angels are but those fairies  is that in your proces  she made no other answer  have you not conversed with st marguerite and st catherine under that tree  i do not know  or by the fountain near the tree  yes sometimes  what promises did they make you  none but such as they had gods warrant for  but what promises did they make  that is not in your proces yet i will say this much they told me that the king would become master of his kingdom in spite of his enemies  and what else  there was a pause then she said humbly  they promised to lead me to paradise  if faces do really betray what is passing in mens minds a fear came upon many in that house at this time that maybe after all a chosen servant and herald of god was here being hunted to her death the interest deepened movements and whisperings ceased the stillness became almost painful  have you noticed that almost from the beginning the nature of the questions asked joan showed that in some way or other the questioner very often already knew his fact before he asked his question have you noticed that somehow or other the questioners usually knew just how and were to search for joans secrets that they really knew the bulk of her privaciesa fact not suspected by herand that they had no task before them but to trick her into exposing those secrets  do you remember loyseleur the hypocrite the treacherous priest tool of cauchon do you remember that under the sacred seal of the confessional joan freely and trustingly revealed to him everything concerning her history save only a few things regarding her supernatural revelations which her voices had forbidden her to tell to any oneand that the unjust judge cauchon was a hidden listener all the time  now you understand how the inquisitors were able to devise that long array of minutely prying questions questions whose subtlety and ingenuity and penetration are astonishing until we come to remember loyseleurs performance and recognize their source ah bishop of beauvais you are now lamenting this cruel iniquity these many years in hell yes verily unless one has come to your help there is but one among the redeemed that would do it and it is futile to hope that that one has not already done itjoan of arc  we will return to the questionings  did they make you still another promise  yes but that is not in your proces i will not tell it now but before three months i will tell it you  the judge seems to know the matter he is asking about already one gets this idea from his next question  did your voices tell you that you would be liberated before three months  joan often showed a little flash of surprise at the good guessing of the judges and she showed one this time i was frequently in terror to find my mind which i could not control criticizing the voices and saying they counsel her to speak boldlya thing which she would do without any suggestion from them or anybody elsebut when it comes to telling her any useful thing such as how these conspirators manage to guess their way so skilfully into her affairs they are always off attending to some other business  i am reverent by nature and when such thoughts swept through my head they made me cold with fear and if there was a storm and thunder at the time i was so ill that i could but with difficulty abide at my post and do my work  joan answered  that is not in your proces i do not know when i shall be set free but some who wish me out of this world will go from it before me  it made some of them shiver  have your voices told you that you will be delivered from this prison  without a doubt they had and the judge knew it before he asked the question  ask me again in three months and i will tell you she said it with such a happy look the tired prisoner and i and noel rainguesson drooping yonderwhy the floods of joy went streaming through us from crown to sole it was all that we could do to hold still and keep from making fatal exposure of our feelings  she was to be set free in three months that was what she meant we saw it the voices had told her so and told her truetrue to the very daymay 30th but we know now that they had mercifully hidden from her how she was to be set free but left her in ignorance home again  that day was our understanding of itnoels and mine that was our dream and now we would count the days the hours the minutes they would fly lightly along they would soon be over  yes we would carry our idol home and there far from the pomps and tumults of the world we would take up our happy life again and live it out as we had begun it in the free air and the sunshine with the friendly sheep and the friendly people for comrades and the grace and charm of the meadows the woods and the river always before our eyes and their deep peace in our hearts yes that was our dream the dream that carried us bravely through that three months to an exact and awful fulfilment the thought of which would have killed us i think if we had foreknown it and been obliged to bear the burden of it upon our hearts the half of those weary days  our reading of the prophecy was this we believed the kings soul was going to be smitten with remorse and that he would privately plan a rescue with joans old lieutenants dalencon and the bastard and la hire and that this rescue would take place at the end of the three months so we made up our minds to be ready and take a hand in it  in the present and also in later sittings joan was urged to name the exact day of her deliverance but she could not do that she had not the permission of her voices moreover the voices themselves did not name the precise day ever since the fulfilment of the prophecy i have believed that joan had the idea that her deliverance was going to come in the form of death but not that death divine as she was dauntless as she was in battle she was human also she was not solely a saint an angel she was a claymade girl alsoas human a girl as any in the world and full of a human girls sensitiveness and tenderness and delicacies and so that death no she could not have lived the three months with that one before her i think you remember that the first time she was wounded she was frightened and cried just as any other girl of seventeen would have done although she had known for eighteen days that she was going to be wounded on that very day no she was not afraid of any ordinary death and an ordinary death was what she believed the prophecy of deliverance meant i think for her face showed happiness not horror when she uttered it  now i will explain why i think as i do five weeks before she was captured in the battle of compiegne her voices told her what was coming they did not tell her the day or the place but said she would be taken prisoner and that it would be before the feast of st john she begged that death certain and swift should be her fate and the captivity brief for she was a free spirit and dreaded the confinement the voices made no promise but only told her to bear whatever came now as they did not refuse the swift death a hopeful young thing like joan would naturally cherish that fact and make the most of it allowing it to grow and establish itself in her mind and so now that she was told she was to be delivered in three months i think she believed it meant that she would die in her bed in the prison and that that was why she looked happy and contentthe gates of paradise standing open for her the time so short you see her troubles so soon to be over her reward so close at hand yes that would make her look happy that would make her patient and bold and able to fight her fight out like a soldier save herself if she could of course and try for the best for that was the way she was made but die with her face to the front if die she must  then later when she charged cauchon with trying to kill her with a poisoned fish her notion that she was to be delivered by death in the prisonif she had it and i believe she hadwould naturally be greatly strengthened you see  but i am wandering from the trial joan was asked to definitely name the time that she would be delivered from prison  i have always said that i was not permitted to tell you everything i am to be set free and i desire to ask leave of my voices to tell you the day that is why i wish for delay  do your voices forbid you to tell the truth  is it that you wish to know matters concerning the king of france i tell you again that he will regain his kingdom and that i know it as well as i know that you sit here before me in this tribunal she sighed and after a little pause added i should be dead but for this revelation which comforts me always  some trivial questions were asked her about st michaels dress and appearance she answered them with dignity but one saw that they gave her pain after a little she said  i have great joy in seeing him for when i see him i have the feeling that i am not in mortal sin  she added sometimes st marguerite and st catherine have allowed me to confess myself to them  here was a possible chance to set a successful snare for her innocence  when you confessed were you in mortal sin do you think  but her reply did her no hurt so the inquiry was shifted once more to the revelations made to the kingsecrets which the court had tried again and again to force out of joan but without success  now as to the sign given to the king  i have already told you that i will tell you nothing about it  do you know what the sign was  as to that you will not find out from me  all this refers to joans secret interview with the kingheld apart though two or three others were present it was knownthrough loyseleur of coursethat this sign was a crown and was a pledge of the verity of joans mission but that is all a mystery until this daythe nature of the crown i meanand will remain a mystery to the end of time we can never know whether a real crown descended upon the kings head or only a symbol the mystic fabric of a vision  did you see a crown upon the kings head when he received the revelation  i cannot tell you as to that without perjury  did the king have that crown at rheims  i think the king put upon his head a crown which he found there but a much richer one was brought him afterward  have you seen that one  i cannot tell you without perjury but whether i have seen it or not i have heard say that it was rich and magnificent  they went on and pestered her to weariness about that mysterious crown but they got nothing more out of her the sitting closed a long hard day for all of us      10 the inquisitors at their wits end  the court rested a day then took up work again on saturday the third of march  this was one of our stormiest sessions the whole court was out of patience and with good reason these threescore distinguished churchmen illustrious tacticians veteran legal gladiators had left important posts where their supervision was needed to journey hither from various regions and accomplish a most simple and easy mattercondemn and send to death a countrylass of nineteen who could neither read nor write knew nothing of the wiles and perplexities of legal procedure could not call a single witness in her defense was allowed no advocate or adviser and must conduct her case by herself against a hostile judge and a packed jury in two hours she would be hopelessly entangled routed defeated convicted nothing could be more certain that thisso they thought but it was a mistake the two hours had strung out into days what promised to be a skirmish had expanded into a siege the thing which had looked so easy had proven to be surprisingly difficult the light victim who was to have been puffed away like a feather remained planted like a rock and on top of all this if anybody had a right to laugh it was the countrylass and not the court  she was not doing that for that was not her spirit but others were doing it the whole town was laughing in its sleeve and the court knew it and its dignity was deeply hurt the members could not hide their annoyance  and so as i have said the session was stormy it was easy to see that these men had made up their minds to force words from joan today which should shorten up her case and bring it to a prompt conclusion it shows that after all their experience with her they did not know her yet  they went into the battle with energy they did not leave the questioning to a particular member no everybody helped they volleyed questions at joan from all over the house and sometimes so many were talking at once that she had to ask them to deliver their fire one at a time and not by platoons the beginning was as usual  you are once more required to take the oath pure and simple  i will answer to what is in the proces verbal when i do more i will choose the occasion for myself  that old ground was debated and fought over inch by inch with great bitterness and many threats but joan remained steadfast and the questionings had to shift to other matters half an hour was spent over joans apparitionstheir dress hair general appearance and so onin the hope of fishing something of a damaging sort out of the replies but with no result  next the male attire was reverted to of course after many wellworn questions had been reasked one or two new ones were put forward  did not the king or the queen sometimes ask you to quit the male dress  that is not in your proces  do you think you would have sinned if you had taken the dress of your sex  i have done best to serve and obey my sovereign lord and master  after a while the matter of joans standard was taken up in the hope of connecting magic and witchcraft with it  did not your men copy your banner in their pennons  the lancers of my guard did it it was to distinguish them from the rest of the forces it was their own idea  were they often renewed  yes when the lances were broken they were renewed  the purpose of the question unveils itself in the next one  did you not say to your men that pennons made like your banner would be lucky  the soldierspirit in joan was offended at this puerility she drew herself up and said with dignity and fire what i said to them was ride those english down and i did it myself  whenever she flung out a scornful speech like that at these french menials in english livery it lashed them into a rage and that is what happened this time there were ten twenty sometimes even thirty of them on their feet at a time storming at the prisoner minute after minute but joan was not disturbed  by and by there was peace and the inquiry was resumed  it was now sought to turn against joan the thousand loving honors which had been done her when she was raising france out of the dirt and shame of a century of slavery and castigation  did you not cause paintings and images of yourself to be made  no at arras i saw a painting of myself kneeling in armor before the king and delivering him a letter but i caused no such things to be made  were not masses and prayers said in your honor  if it was done it was not by my command but if any prayed for me i think it was no harm  did the french people believe you were sent of god  as to that i know not but whether they believed it or not i was not the less sent of god  if they thought you were sent of god do you think it was well thought  if they believed it their trust was not abused  what impulse was it think you that moved the people to kiss your hands your feet and your vestments  they were glad to see me and so they did those things and i could not have prevented them if i had had the heart those poor people came lovingly to me because i had not done them any hurt but had done the best i could for them according to my strength  see what modest little words she uses to describe that touching spectacle her marches about france walled in on both sides by the adoring multitudes they were glad to see me glad  why they were transported with joy to see her when they could not kiss her hands or her feet they knelt in the mire and kissed the hoofprints of her horse they worshiped her and that is what these priests were trying to prove it was nothing to them that she was not to blame for what other people did no if she was worshiped it was enough she was guilty of mortal sin  curious logic one must say  did you not stand sponsor for some children baptized at rheims  at troyes i did and at st denis and i named the boys charles in honor of the king and the girls i named joan  did not women touch their rings to those which you wore  yes many did but i did not know their reason for it  at rheims was your standard carried into the church did you stand at the altar with it in your hand at the coronation  yes  in passing through the country did you confess yourself in the churches and receive the sacrament  yes  in the dress of a man  yes but i do not remember that i was in armor  it was almost a concession almost a halfsurrender of the permission granted her by the church at poitiers to dress as a man the wily court shifted to another matter to pursue this one at this time might call joans attention to her small mistake and by her native cleverness she might recover her lost ground the tempestuous session had worn her and drowsed her alertness  it is reported that you brought a dead child to life in the church at lagny was that in answer to your prayers  as to that i have no knowledge other young girls were praying for the child and i joined them and prayed also doing no more than they  continue  while we prayed it came to life and cried it had been dead three days and was as black as my doublet it was straight way baptized then it passed from life again and was buried in holy ground  why did you jump from the tower of beaurevoir by night and try to escape  i would go to the succor of compiegne  it was insinuated that this was an attempt to commit the deep crime of suicide to avoid falling into the hands of the english  did you not say that you would rather die than be delivered into the power of the english  joan answered frankly without perceiving the trap  yes my words were that i would rather that my soul be returned unto god than that i should fall into the hands of the english  it was now insinuated that when she came to after jumping from the tower she was angry and blasphemed the name of god and that she did it again when she heard of the defection of the commandant of soissons she was hurt and indignant at this and said  it is not true i have never cursed it is not my custom to swear      11 the court reorganized for assassination  a halt was called it was time cauchon was losing ground in the fight joan was gaining it  there were signs that here and there in the court a judge was being softened toward joan by her courage her presence of mind her fortitude her constancy her piety her simplicity and candor her manifest purity the nobility of her character her fine intelligence and the good brave fight she was making all friendless and alone against unfair odds and there was grave room for fear that this softening process would spread further and presently bring cauchons plans in danger  something must be done and it was done cauchon was not distinguished for compassion but he now gave proof that he had it in his character he thought it pity to subject so many judges to the prostrating fatigues of this trial when it could be conducted plenty well enough by a handful of them oh gentle judge but he did not remember to modify the fatigues for the little captive  he would let all the judges but a handful go but he would select the handful himself and he did  he chose tigers if a lamb or two got in it was by oversight not intention and he knew what to do with lambs when discovered  he called a small council now and during five days they sifted the huge bulk of answers thus far gathered from joan they winnowed it of all chaff all useless matterthat is all matter favorable to joan they saved up all matter which could be twisted to her hurt and out of this they constructed a basis for a new trial which should have the semblance of a continuation of the old one another change it was plain that the public trial had wrought damage its proceedings had been discussed all over the town and had moved many to pity the abused prisoner there should be no more of that the sittings should be secret hereafter and no spectators admitted so noel could come no more i sent this news to him i had not the heart to carry it myself i would give the pain a chance to modify before i should see him in the evening  on the 10th of march the secret trial began a week had passed since i had seen joan her appearance gave me a great shock she looked tired and weak she was listless and far away and her answers showed that she was dazed and not able to keep perfect run of all that was done and said another court would not have taken advantage of her state seeing that her life was at stake here but would have adjourned and spared her did this one no it worried her for hours and with a glad and eager ferocity making all it could out of this great chance the first one it had had  she was tortured into confusing herself concerning the sign which had been given the king and the next day this was continued hour after hour as a result she made partial revealments of particulars forbidden by her voices and seemed to me to state as facts things which were but allegories and visions mixed with facts  the third day she was brighter and looked less worn she was almost her normal self again and did her work well many attempts were made to beguile her into saying indiscreet things but she saw the purpose in view and answered with tact and wisdom  do you know if st catherine and st marguerite hate the english  they love whom our lord loves and hate whom he hates  does god hate the english  of the love or the hatred of god toward the english i know nothing then she spoke up with the old martial ring in her voice and the old audacity in her words and added but i know thisthat god will send victory to the french and that all the english will be flung out of france but the dead ones  was god on the side of the english when they were prosperous in france  i do not know if god hates the french but i think that he allowed them to be chastised for their sins  it was a sufficiently naive way to account for a chastisement which had now strung out for ninetysix years but nobody found fault with it there was nobody there who would not punish a sinner ninetysix years if he could nor anybody there who would ever dream of such a thing as the lords being any shade less stringent than men  have you ever embraced st marguerite and st catherine  yes both of them  the evil face of cauchon betrayed satisfaction when she said that  when you hung garlands upon larbre fee bourlemont did you do it in honor of your apparitions  no  satisfaction again no doubt cauchon would take it for granted that she hung them there out of sinful love for the fairies  when the saints appeared to you did you bow did you make reverence did you kneel  yes i did them the most honor and reverence that i could  a good point for cauchon if he could eventually make it appear that these were no saints to whom she had done reverence but devils in disguise  now there was the matter of joans keeping her supernatural commerce a secret from her parents much might be made of that in fact particular emphasis had been given to it in a private remark written in the margin of the proces she concealed her visions from her parents and from every one possibly this disloyalty to her parents might itself be the sign of the satanic source of her mission  do you think it was right to go away to the wars without getting your parents leave it is written one must honor his father and his mother  i have obeyed them in all things but that and for that i have begged their forgiveness in a letter and gotten it  ah you asked their pardon so you knew you were guilty of sin in going without their leave  joan was stirred her eyes flashed and she exclaimed  i was commanded of god and it was right to go if i had had a hundred fathers and mothers and been a kings daughter to boot i would have gone  did you never ask your voices if you might tell your parents  they were willing that i should tell them but i would not for anything have given my parents that pain  to the minds of the questioners this headstrong conduct savored of pride that sort of pride would move one to see sacrilegious adorations  did not your voices call you daughter of god  joan answered with simplicity and unsuspiciously  yes before the siege of orleans and since they have several times called me daughter of god  further indications of pride and vanity were sought  what horse were you riding when you were captured who gave it you  the king  you had other thingsrichesof the king  for myself i had horses and arms and money to pay the service in my household  had you not a treasury  yes ten or twelve thousand crowns then she said with naivete it was not a great sum to carry on a war with  you have it yet  no it is the kings money my brothers hold it for him  what were the arms which you left as an offering in the church of st denis  my suit of silver mail and a sword  did you put them there in order that they might be adored  no it was but an act of devotion and it is the custom of men of war who have been wounded to make such offering there i had been wounded before paris  nothing appealed to these stony hearts those dull imaginationsnot even this pretty picture so simply drawn of the wounded girlsoldier hanging her toy harness there in curious companionship with the grim and dusty iron mail of the historic defenders of france no there was nothing in it for them nothing unless evil and injury for that innocent creature could be gotten out of it somehow  which aided mostyou the standard or the standard you  whether it was the standard or whether it was i is nothingthe victories came from god  but did you base your hopes of victory in yourself or in your standard  in neither in god and not otherwise  was not your standard waved around the kings head at the coronation  no it was not  why was it that your standard had place at the crowning of the king in the cathedral of rheims rather than those of the other captains  then soft and low came that touching speech which will live as long as language lives and pass into all tongues and move all gentle hearts wheresoever it shall come down to the latest day  it had borne the burden it had earned the honor 1 how simple it is and how beautiful and how it beggars the studies eloquence of the masters of oratory eloquence was a native gift of joan of arc it came from her lips without effort and without preparation her words were as sublime as her deeds as sublime as her character they had their source in a great heart and were coined in a great brain  1 what she said has been many times translated but never with success there is a haunting pathos about the original which eludes all efforts to convey it into our tongue it is as subtle as an odor and escapes in the transmission her words were these  il avait a la peine cetait bien raison quil fut a lhonneur  monseigneur ricard honorary vicargeneral to the archbishop of aix finely speaks of it jeanne darc la venerable page 197 as that sublime reply enduring in the history of celebrated sayings like the cry of a french and christian soul wounded unto death in its patriotism and its faith  translator      12 joans masterstroke diverted  now as a next move this small secret court of holy assassins did a thing so base that even at this day in my old age it is hard to speak of it with patience  in the beginning of her commerce with her voices there at domremy the child joan solemnly devoted her life to god vowing her pure body and her pure soul to his service you will remember that her parents tried to stop her from going to the wars by haling her to the court at toul to compel her to make a marriage which she had never promised to makea marriage with our poor good windy big hardfighting and most dear and lamented comrade the standardbearer who fell in honorable battle and sleeps with god these sixty years peace to his ashes and you will remember how joan sixteen years old stood up in that venerable court and conducted her case all by herself and tore the poor paladins case to rags and blew it away with a breath and how the astonished old judge on the bench spoke of her as this marvelous child  you remember all that then think what i felt to see these false priests here in the tribunal wherein joan had fought a fourth lone fight in three years deliberately twist that matter entirely around and try to make out that joan haled the paladin into court and pretended that he had promised to marry her and was bent on making him do it  certainly there was no baseness that those people were ashamed to stoop to in their hunt for that friendless girls life what they wanted to show was thisthat she had committed the sin of relapsing from her vow and trying to violate it  joan detailed the true history of the case but lost her temper as she went along and finished with some words for cauchon which he remembers yet whether he is fanning himself in the world he belongs in or has swindled his way into the other  the rest of this day and part of the next the court labored upon the old themethe male attire it was shabby work for those grave men to be engaged in for they well knew one of joans reasons for clinging to the male dress was that soldiers of the guard were always present in her room whether she was asleep or awake and that the male dress was a better protection for her modesty than the other  the court knew that one of joans purposes had been the deliverance of the exiled duke of orleans and they were curious to know how she had intended to manage it her plan was characteristically businesslike and her statement of it as characteristically simple and straightforward  i would have taken english prisoners enough in france for his ransom and failing that i would have invaded england and brought him out by force  that was just her way if a thing was to be done it was love first and hammer and tongs to follow but no shillyshallying between she added with a little sigh  if i had had my freedom three years i would have delivered him  have you the permission of your voices to break out of prison whenever you can  i have asked their leave several times but they have not given it  i think it is as i have said she expected the deliverance of death and within the prison walls before the three months should expire  would you escape if you saw the doors open  she spoke up frankly and said  yesfor i should see in that the permission of our lord god helps who help themselves the proverb says but except i thought i had permission i would not go  now then at this point something occurred which convinces me every time i think of itand it struck me so at the timethat for a moment at least her hopes wandered to the king and put into her mind the same notion about her deliverance which noel and i had settled upona rescue by her old soldiers i think the idea of the rescue did occur to her but only as a passing thought and that it quickly passed away  some remark of the bishop of beauvais moved her to remind him once more that he was an unfair judge and had no right to preside there and that he was putting himself in great danger  what danger he asked  i do not know st catherine has promised me help but i do not know the form of it i do not know whether i am to be delivered from this prison or whether when you sent me to the scaffold there will happen a trouble by which i shall be set free without much thought as to this matter i am of the opinion that it may be one or the other after a pause she added these words memorable foreverwords whose meaning she may have miscaught misunderstood as to that we can never know words which she may have rightly understood as to that also we can never know but words whose mystery fell away from them many a year ago and revealed their meaning to all the world  but what my voices have said clearest is that i shall be delivered by a great victory she paused my heart was beating fast for to me that great victory meant the sudden bursting in of our old soldiers with the warcry and clash of steel at the last moment and the carrying off of joan of arc in triumph but oh that thought had such a short life for now she raised her head and finished with those solemn words which men still so often quote and dwell uponwords which filled me with fear they sounded so like a prediction and always they say submit to whatever comes do not grieve for your martyrdom from it you will ascend into the kingdom of paradise  was she thinking of fire and the stake i think not i thought of it myself but i believe she was only thinking of this slow and cruel martyrdom of chains and captivity and insult surely martyrdom was the right name for it  it was jean de la fontaine who was asking the questions he was willing to make the most he could out of what she had said  as the voices have told you you are going to paradise you feel certain that that will happen and that you will not be damned in hell is that so  i believe what they told me i know that i shall be saved  it is a weighty answer  to me the knowledge that i shall be saved is a great treasure  do you think that after that revelation you could be able to commit mortal sin  as to that i do not know my hope for salvation is in holding fast to my oath to keep by body and my soul pure  since you know you are to be saved do you think it necessary to go to confession  the snare was ingeniously devised but joans simple and humble answer left it empty  one cannot keep his conscience too clean  we were now arriving at the last day of this new trial joan had come through the ordeal well it had been a long and wearisome struggle for all concerned all ways had been tried to convict the accused and all had failed thus far the inquisitors were thoroughly vexed and dissatisfied  however they resolved to make one more effort put in one more days work this was donemarch 17th early in the sitting a notable trap was set for joan  will you submit to the determination of the church all your words and deeds whether good or bad  that was well planned joan was in imminent peril now if she should heedlessly say yes it would put her mission itself upon trial and one would know how to decide its source and character promptly if she should say no she would render herself chargeable with the crime of heresy  but she was equal to the occasion she drew a distinct line of separation between the churchs authority over her as a subject member and the matter of her mission she said she loved the church and was ready to support the christian faith with all her strength but as to the works done under her mission those must be judged by god alone who had commanded them to be done  the judge still insisted that she submit them to the decision of the church she said  i will submit them to our lord who sent me it would seem to me that he and his church are one and that there should be no difficulty about this matter then she turned upon the judge and said why do you make a difficulty when there is no room for any  then jean de la fontaine corrected her notion that there was but one church there were twothe church triumphant which is god the saints the angels and the redeemed and has its seat in heaven and the church militant which is our holy father the pope vicar of god the prelates the clergy and all good christians and catholics the which church has its seat in the earth is governed by the holy spirit and cannot err will you not submit those matters to the church militant  i am come to the king of france from the church triumphant on high by its commandant and to that church i will submit all those things which i have done for the church militant i have no other answer now  the court took note of this straitly worded refusal and would hope to get profit out of it but the matter was dropped for the present and a long chase was then made over the old huntinggroundthe fairies the visions the male attire and all that  in the afternoon the satanic bishop himself took the chair and presided over the closing scenes of the trial along toward the finish this question was asked by one of the judges  you have said to my lord the bishop that you would answer him as you would answer before our holy father the pope and yet there are several questions which you continually refuse to answer would you not answer the pope more fully than you have answered before my lord of beauvais would you not feel obliged to answer the pope who is the vicar of god more fully  now a thunderclap fell out of a clear sky  take me to the pope i will answer to everything that i ought to  it made the bishops purple face fairly blanch with consternation if joan had only known if she had only know she had lodged a mine under this black conspiracy able to blow the bishops schemes to the four winds of heaven and she didnt know it she had made that speech by mere instinct not suspecting what tremendous forces were hidden in it and there was none to tell her what she had done i knew and manchon knew and if she had known how to read writing we could have hoped to get the knowledge to her somehow but speech was the only way and none was allowed to approach her near enough for that so there she sat once more joan of arc the victorious but all unconscious of it she was miserably worn and tired by the long days struggle and by illness or she must have noticed the effect of that speech and divined the reason of it  she had made many masterstrokes but this was the masterstroke it was an appeal to rome it was her clear right and if she had persisted in it cauchons plot would have tumbled about his ears like a house of cards and he would have gone from that place the worstbeaten man of the century he was daring but he was not daring enough to stand up against that demand if joan had urged it but no she was ignorant poor thing and did not know what a blow she had struck for life and liberty  france was not the church rome had no interest in the destruction of this messenger of god  rome would have given her a fair trial and that was all that her cause needed from that trial she would have gone forth free and honored and blessed  but it was not so fated cauchon at once diverted the questions to other matters and hurried the trial quickly to an end  as joan moved feebly away dragging her chains i felt stunned and dazed and kept saying to myself such a little while ago she said the saving word and could have gone free and now there she goes to her death yes it is to her death i know it i feel it they will double the guards they will never let any come near her now between this and her condemnation lest she get a hint and speak that word again this is the bitterest day that has come to me in all this miserable time      13 the third trial fails  so the second trial in the prison was over over and no definite result the character of it i have described to you it was baser in one particular than the previous one for this time the charges had not been communicated to joan therefore she had been obliged to fight in the dark  there was no opportunity to do any thinking beforehand there was no foreseeing what traps might be set and no way to prepare for them truly it was a shabby advantage to take of a girl situated as this one was one day during the course of it an able lawyer of normandy maetre lohier happened to be in rouen and i will give you his opinion of that trial so that you may see that i have been honest with you and that my partisanship has not made me deceive you as to its unfair and illegal character cauchon showed lohier the proces and asked his opinion about the trial now this was the opinion which he gave to cauchon he said that the whole thing was null and void for these reasons 1 because the trial was secret and full freedom of speech and action on the part of those present not possible 2 because the trial touched the honor of the king of france yet he was not summoned to defend himself nor any one appointed to represent him 3 because the charges against the prisoner were not communicated to her 4 because the accused although young and simple had been forced to defend her cause without help of counsel notwithstanding she had so much at stake  did that please bishop cauchon it did not he burst out upon lohier with the most savage cursings and swore he would have him drowned lohier escaped from rouen and got out of france with all speed and so saved his life  well as i have said the second trial was over without definite result but cauchon did not give up he could trump up another and still another and another if necessary he had the halfpromise of an enormous prizethe archbishopric of rouenif he should succeed in burning the body and damning to hell the soul of this young girl who had never done him any harm and such a prize as that to a man like the bishop of beauvais was worth the burning and damning of fifty harmless girls let alone one  so he set to work again straight off next day and with high confidence too intimating with brutal cheerfulness that he should succeed this time it took him and the other scavengers nine days to dig matter enough out of joans testimony and their own inventions to build up the new mass of charges and it was a formidable mass indeed for it numbered sixtysix articles  this huge document was carried to the castle the next day march 27th and there before a dozen carefully selected judges the new trial was begun  opinions were taken and the tribunal decided that joan should hear the articles read this time  maybe that was on account of lohiers remark upon that head or maybe it was hoped that the reading would kill the prisoner with fatiguefor as it turned out this reading occupied several days it was also decided that joan should be required to answer squarely to every article and that if she refused she should be considered convicted you see cauchon was managing to narrow her chances more and more all the time he was drawing the toils closer and closer  joan was brought in and the bishop of beauvais opened with a speech to her which ought to have made even himself blush so laden it was with hypocrisy and lies he said that this court was composed of holy and pious churchmen whose hearts were full of benevolence and compassion toward her and that they had no wish to hurt her body but only a desire to instruct her and lead her into the way of truth and salvation  why this man was born a devil now think of his describing himself and those hardened slaves of his in such language as that  and yet worse was to come for now having in mind another of loviers hints he had the cold effrontery to make to joan a proposition which i think will surprise you when you hear it he said that this court recognizing her untaught estate and her inability to deal with the complex and difficult matters which were about to be considered had determined out of their pity and their mercifulness to allow her to choose one or more persons out of their own number to help her with counsel and advice  think of thata court made up of loyseleur and his breed of reptiles it was granting leave to a lamb to ask help of a wolf joan looked up to see if he was serious and perceiving that he was at least pretending to be she declined of course  the bishop was not expecting any other reply he had made a show of fairness and could have it entered on the minutes therefore he was satisfied  then he commanded joan to answer straitly to every accusation and threatened to cut her off from the church if she failed to do that or delayed her answers beyond a given length of time  yes he was narrowing her chances down step by step  thomas de courcelles began the reading of that interminable document article by article joan answered to each article in its turn sometimes merely denying its truth sometimes by saying her answer would be found in the records of the previous trials  what a strange document that was and what an exhibition and exposure of the heart of man the one creature authorized to boast that he is made in the image of god to know joan of arc was to know one who was wholly noble pure truthful brave compassionate generous pious unselfish modest blameless as the very flowers in the fieldsa nature fine and beautiful a character supremely great to know her from that document would be to know her as the exact reverse of all that nothing that she was appears in it everything that she was not appears there in detail  consider some of the things it charges against her and remember who it is it is speaking of it calls her a sorceress a false prophet an invoker and companion of evil spirits a dealer in magic a person ignorant of the catholic faith a schismatic she is sacrilegious an idolater an apostate a blasphemer of god and his saints scandalous seditious a disturber of the peace she incites men to war and to the spilling of human blood she discards the decencies and proprieties of her sex irreverently assuming the dress of a man and the vocation of a soldier she beguiles both princes and people she usurps divine honors and has caused herself to be adored and venerated offering her hands and her vestments to be kissed  there it isevery fact of her life distorted perverted reversed as a child she had loved the fairies she had spoken a pitying word for them when they were banished from their home she had played under their tree and around their fountainhence she was a comrade of evil spirits  she had lifted france out of the mud and moved her to strike for freedom and led her to victory after victoryhence she was a disturber of the peaceas indeed she was and a provoker of waras indeed she was again and france will be proud of it and grateful for it for many a century to come and she had been adoredas if she could help that poor thing or was in any way to blame for it the cowed veteran and the wavering recruit had drunk the spirit of war from her eyes and touched her sword with theirs and moved forward invinciblehence she was a sorceress  and so the document went on detail by detail turning these waters of life to poison this gold to dross these proofs of a noble and beautiful life to evidences of a foul and odious one  of course the sixtysix articles were just a rehash of the things which had come up in the course of the previous trials so i will touch upon this new trial but lightly in fact joan went but little into detail herself usually merely saying that is not truepassez outre or i have answered that beforelet the clerk read it in his record or saying some other brief thing  she refused to have her mission examined and tried by the earthly church the refusal was taken note of  she denied the accusation of idolatry and that she had sought mens homage she said  if any kissed my hands and my vestments it was not by my desire and i did what i could to prevent it  she had the pluck to say to that deadly tribunal that she did not know the fairies to be evil beings she knew it was a perilous thing to say but it was not in her nature to speak anything but the truth when she spoke at all danger had no weight with her in such things note was taken of her remark  she refused as always before when asked if she would put off the male attire if she were given permission to commune and she added this  when one receives the sacrament the manner of his dress is a small thing and of no value in the eyes of our lord  she was charge with being so stubborn in clinging to her male dress that she would not lay it off even to get the blessed privilege of hearing mass she spoke out with spirit and said  i would rather die than be untrue to my oath to god  she was reproached with doing mans work in the wars and thus deserting the industries proper to her sex she answered with some little touch of soldierly disdain  as to the matter of womens work theres plenty to do it  it was always a comfort to me to see the soldier spirit crop up in her while that remained in her she would be joan of arc and able to look trouble and fate in the face  it appears that this mission of yours which you claim you had from god was to make war and pour out human blood  joan replied quite simply contenting herself with explaining that war was not her first move but her second  to begin with i demanded that peace should be made if it was refused then i would fight  the judge mixed the burgundians and english together in speaking of the enemy which joan had come to make war upon but she showed that she made a distinction between them by act and word the burgundians being frenchmen and therefore entitled to less brusque treatment than the english she said  as to the duke of burgundy i required of him both by letters and by his ambassadors that he make peace with the king as to the english the only peace for them was that they leave the country and go home  then she said that even with the english she had shown a pacific disposition since she had warned them away by proclamation before attacking them  if they had listened to me said she they would have done wisely at this point she uttered her prophecy again saying with emphasis before seven years they will see it themselves  then they presently began to pester her again about her male costume and tried to persuade her to voluntarily promise to discard it i was never deep so i think it no wonder that i was puzzled by their persistency in what seemed a thing of no consequence and could not make out what their reason could be but we all know now we all know now that it was another of their treacherous projects yes if they could but succeed in getting her to formally discard it they could play a game upon her which would quickly destroy her so they kept at their evil work until at last she broke out and said  peace without the permission of god i will not lay it off though you cut off my head  at one point she corrected the proces verbal saying  it makes me say that everything which i have done was done by the counsel of our lord i did not say that i said all which i have well done  doubt was cast upon the authenticity of her mission because of the ignorance and simplicity of the messenger chosen joan smiled at that she could have reminded these people that our lord who is no respecter of persons had chosen the lowly for his high purposes even oftener than he had chosen bishops and cardinals but she phrased her rebuke in simpler terms  it is the prerogative of our lord to choose his instruments where he will  she was asked what form of prayer she used in invoking counsel from on high she said the form was brief and simple then she lifted her pallid face and repeated it clasping her chained hands  most dear god in honor of your holy passion i beseech you if you love me that you will reveal to me what i am to answer to these churchmen as concerns my dress i know by what command i have put it on but i know not in what manner i am to lay it off i pray you tell me what to do  she was charged with having dared against the precepts of god and his saints to assume empire over men and make herself commanderinchief that touched the soldier in her she had a deep reverence for priests but the soldier in her had but small reverence for a priests opinions about war so in her answer to this charge she did not condescend to go into any explanations or excuses but delivered herself with bland indifference and military brevity  if i was commanderinchief it was to thrash the english  death was staring her in the face here all the time but no matter she dearly loved to make these englishhearted frenchmen squirm and whenever they gave her an opening she was prompt to jab her sting into it she got great refreshment out of these little episodes her days were a desert these were the oases in it  her being in the wars with men was charged against her as an indelicacy she said  i had a woman with me when i couldin towns and lodgings in the field i always slept in my armor  that she and her family had been ennobled by the king was charged against her as evidence that the source of her deeds were sordid selfseeking she answered that she had not asked this grace of the king it was his own act  this third trial was ended at last and once again there was no definite result  possibly a fourth trial might succeed in defeating this apparently unconquerable girl so the malignant bishop set himself to work to plan it  he appointed a commission to reduce the substance of the sixtysix articles to twelve compact lies as a basis for the new attempt this was done it took several days  meantime cauchon went to joans cell one day with manchon and two of the judges isambard de la pierre and martin ladvenue to see if he could not manage somehow to beguile joan into submitting her mission to the examination and decision of the church militantthat is to say to that part of the church militant which was represented by himself and his creatures  joan once more positively refused isambard de la pierre had a heart in his body and he so pitied this persecuted poor girl that he ventured to do a very daring thing for he asked her if she would be willing to have her case go before the council of basel and said it contained as many priests of her party as of the english party  joan cried out that she would gladly go before so fairly constructed a tribunal as that but before isambard could say another word cauchon turned savagely upon him and exclaimed  shut up in the devils name  then manchon ventured to do a brave thing too though he did it in great fear for his life he asked cauchon if he should enter joans submission to the council of basel upon the minutes  no it is not necessary  ah said poor joan reproachfully you set down everything that is against me but you will not set down what is for me  it was piteous it would have touched the heart of a brute but cauchon was more than that      14 joan struggles with her twelve lies  we were now in the first days of april joan was ill she had fallen ill the 29th of march the day after the close of the third trial and was growing worse when the scene which i have just described occurred in her cell it was just like cauchon to go there and try to get some advantage out of her weakened state  let us note some of the particulars in the new indictmentthe twelve lies  part of the first one says joan asserts that she has found her salvation she never said anything of the kind it also says she refuses to submit herself to the church not true she was willing to submit all her acts to this rouen tribunal except those done by the command of god in fulfilment of her mission those she reserved for the judgment of god she refused to recognize cauchon and his serfs as the church but was willing to go before the pope or the council of basel  a clause of another of the twelve says she admits having threatened with death those who would not obey her distinctly false another clause says she declares that all she has done has been done by command of god what she really said was all that she had done wella correction made by herself as you have already seen  another of the twelve says she claims that she has never committed any sin she never made any such claim  another makes the wearing of the male dress a sin if it was she had high catholic authority for committing itthat of the archbishop of rheims and the tribunal of poitiers  the tenth article was resentful against her for pretending that st catherine and st  marguerite spoke french and not english and were french in their politics  the twelve were to be submitted first to the learned doctors of theology of the university of paris for approval they were copied out and ready by the night of april 4th then manchon did another bold thing he wrote in the margin that many of the twelve put statements in joans mouth which were the exact opposite of what she had said that fact would not be considered important by the university of paris and would not influence its decision or stir its humanity in case it had anywhich it hadnt when acting in a political capacity as at presentbut it was a brave thing for that good manchon to do all the same  the twelve were sent to paris next day april 5th that afternoon there was a great tumult in rouen and excited crowds were flocking through all the chief streets chattering and seeking for news for a report had gone abroad that joan of arc was sick until death in truth these long seances had worn her out and she was ill indeed the heads of the english party were in a state of consternation for if joan should die uncondemned by the church and go to the grave unsmirched the pity and the love of the people would turn her wrongs and sufferings and death into a holy martyrdom and she would be even a mightier power in france dead than she had been when alive  the earl of warwick and the english cardinal winchester hurried to the castle and sent messengers flying for physicians warwick was a hard man a rude coarse man a man without compassion there lay the sick girl stretched in her chains in her iron cagenot an object to move man to ungentle speech one would think yet warwick spoke right out in her hearing and said to the physicians  mind you take good care of her the king of england has no mind to have her die a natural death she is dear to him for he bought her dear and he does not want her to die save at the stake now then mind you cure her  the doctors asked joan what had made her ill she said the bishop of beauvais had sent her a fish and she thought it was that  then jean destivet burst out on her and called her names and abused her he understood joan to be charging the bishop with poisoning her you see and that was not pleasing to him for he was one of cauchons most loving and conscienceless slaves and it outraged him to have joan injure his master in the eyes of these great english chiefs these being men who could ruin cauchon and would promptly do it if they got the conviction that he was capable of saving joan from the stake by poisoning her and thus cheating the english out of all the real value gainable by her purchase from the duke of burgundy  joan had a high fever and the doctors proposed to bleed her warwick said  be careful about that she is smart and is capable of killing herself  he meant that to escape the stake she might undo the bandage and let herself bleed to death  but the doctors bled her anyway and then she was better  not for long though jean destivet could not hold still he was so worried and angry about the suspicion of poisoning which joan had hinted at so he came back in the evening and stormed at her till he brought the fever all back again  when warwick heard of this he was in a fine temper you may be sure for here was his prey threatening to escape again and all through the overzeal of this meddling fool warwick gave destivet a quite admirable cursingadmirable as to strength i mean for it was said by persons of culture that the art of it was not goodand after that the meddler kept still  joan remained ill more than two weeks then she grew better she was still very weak but she could bear a little persecution now without much danger to her life it seemed to cauchon a good time to furnish it so he called together some of his doctors of theology and went to her dungeon manchon and i went along to keep the recordthat is to set down what might be useful to cauchon and leave out the rest  the sight of joan gave me a shock why she was but a shadow it was difficult for me to realize that this frail little creature with the sad face and drooping form was the same joan of arc that i had so often seen all fire and enthusiasm charging through a hail of death and the lightning and thunder of the guns at the head of her battalions it wrung my heart to see her looking like this  but cauchon was not touched he made another of those conscienceless speeches of his all dripping with hypocrisy and guile he told joan that among her answers had been some which had seemed to endanger religion and as she was ignorant and without knowledge of the scriptures he had brought some good and wise men to instruct her if she desired it said he we are churchmen and disposed by our good will as well as by our vocation to procure for you the salvation of your soul and your body in every way in our power just as we would do the like for our nearest kin or for ourselves in this we but follow the example of holy church who never closes the refuge of her bosom against any that are willing to return  joan thanked him for these sayings and said  i seem to be in danger of death from this malady if it be the pleasure of god that i die here i beg that i may be heard in confession and also receive my saviour and that i may be buried in consecrated ground  cauchon thought he saw his opportunity at last this weakened body had the fear of an unblessed death before it and the pains of hell to follow this stubborn spirit would surrender now so he spoke out and said  then if you want the sacraments you must do as all good catholics do and submit to the church  he was eager for her answer but when it came there was no surrender in it she still stood to her guns she turned her head away and said wearily  i have nothing more to say  cauchons temper was stirred and he raised his voice threateningly and said that the more she was in danger of death the more she ought to amend her life and again he refused the things she begged for unless she would submit to the church joan said  if i die in this prison i beg you to have me buried in holy ground if you will not i cast myself upon my saviour  there was some more conversation of the like sort then cauchon demanded again and imperiously that she submit herself and all her deeds to the church his threatening and storming went for nothing that body was weak but the spirit in it was the spirit of joan of arc and out of that came the steadfast answer which these people were already so familiar with and detested so sincerely  let come what may i will neither do nor say any otherwise than i have said already in your tribunals  then the good theologians took turn about and worried her with reasonings and arguments and scriptures and always they held the lure of the sacraments before her famishing soul and tried to bribe her with them to surrender her mission to the churchs judgmentthat is to their judgmentas if they were the church but it availed nothing i could have told them that beforehand if they had asked me but they never asked me anything i was too humble a creature for their notice  then the interview closed with a threat a threat of fearful import a threat calculated to make a catholic christian feel as if the ground were sinking from under him  the church calls upon you to submit disobey and she will abandon you as if you were a pagan  think of being abandoned by the churchthat august power in whose hands is lodged the fate of the human race whose scepter stretches beyond the furthest constellation that twinkles in the sky whose authority is over millions that live and over the billions that wait trembling in purgatory for ransom or doom whose smile opens the gates of heaven to you whose frown delivers you to the fires of everlasting hell a power whose dominion overshadows and belittles the pomps and shows of a village to be abandoned by ones kingyes that is death and death is much but to be abandoned by rome to be abandoned by the church ah death is nothing to that for that is consignment to endless lifeand such a life  i could see the red waves tossing in that shoreless lake of fire i could see the black myriads of the damned rise out of them and struggle and sink and rise again and i knew that joan was seeing what i saw while she paused musing and i believed that she must yield now and in truth i hoped she would for these men were able to make the threat good and deliver her over to eternal suffering and i knew that it was in their natures to do it  but i was foolish to think that thought and hope that hope joan of arc was not made as others are made fidelity to principle fidelity to truth fidelity to her word all these were in her bone and in her fleshthey were parts of her she could not change she could not cast them out she was the very genius of fidelity she was steadfastness incarnated where she had taken her stand and planted her foot there she would abide hell itself could not move her from that place  her voices had not given her permission to make the sort of submission that was required therefore she would stand fast she would wait in perfect obedience let come what might  my heart was like lead in my body when i went out from that dungeon but sheshe was serene she was not troubled she had done what she believed to be her duty and that was sufficient the consequences were not her affair the last thing she said that time was full of this serenity full of contented repose  i am a good christian born and baptized and a good christian i will die      15 undaunted by threat of burning  two weeks went by the second of may was come the chill was departed out of the air the wild flowers were springing in the glades and glens the birds were piping in the woods all nature was brilliant with sunshine all spirits were renewed and refreshed all hearts glad the world was alive with hope and cheer the plain beyond the seine stretched away soft and rich and green the river was limpid and lovely the leafy islands were dainty to see and flung still daintier reflections of themselves upon the shining water and from the tall bluffs above the bridge rouen was become again a delight to the eye the most exquisite and satisfying picture of a town that nestles under the arch of heaven anywhere  when i say that all hearts were glad and hopeful i mean it in a general sense there were exceptionswe who were the friends of joan of arc also joan of arc herself that poor girl shut up there in that frowning stretch of mighty walls and towers brooding in darkness so close to the flooding downpour of sunshine yet so impossibly far away from it so longing for any little glimpse of it yet so implacably denied it by those wolves in the black gowns who were plotting her death and the blackening of her good name  cauchon was ready to go on with his miserable work he had a new scheme to try now he would see what persuasion could doargument eloquence poured out upon the incorrigible captive from the mouth of a trained expert that was his plan but the reading of the twelve articles to her was not a part of it no even cauchon was ashamed to lay that monstrosity before her even he had a remnant of shame in him away down deep a million fathoms deep and that remnant asserted itself now and prevailed  on this fair second of may then the black company gathered itself together in the spacious chamber at the end of the great hall of the castlethe bishop of beauvais on his throne and sixtytwo minor judges massed before him with the guards and recorders at their stations and the orator at his desk  then we heard the far clank of chains and presently joan entered with her keepers and took her seat upon her isolated bench she was looking well now and most fair and beautiful after her fortnights rest from wordy persecution  she glanced about and noted the orator doubtless she divined the situation  the orator had written his speech all out and had it in his hand though he held it back of him out of sight it was so thick that it resembled a book he began flowing but in the midst of a flowery period his memory failed him and he had to snatch a furtive glance at his manuscriptwhich much injured the effect again this happened and then a third time the poor mans face was red with embarrassment the whole great house was pitying him which made the matter worse then joan dropped in a remark which completed the trouble she said  read your bookand then i will answer you  why it was almost cruel the way those moldy veterans laughed and as for the orator he looked so flustered and helpless that almost anybody would have pitied him and i had difficulty to keep from doing it myself yes joan was feeling very well after her rest and the native mischief that was in her lay near the surface it did not show when she made the remark but i knew it was close in there back of the words  when the orator had gotten back his composure he did a wise thing for he followed joans advice he made no more attempts at sham impromptu oratory but read his speech straight from his book in the speech he compressed the twelve articles into six and made these his text  every now and then he stopped and asked questions and joan replied the nature of the church militant was explained and once more joan was asked to submit herself to it  she gave her usual answer  then she was asked  do you believe the church can err  i believe it cannot err but for those deeds and words of mine which were done and uttered by command of god i will answer to him alone  will you say that you have no judge upon earth is not our holy father the pope your judge  i will say nothing about it i have a good master who is our lord and to him i will submit all  then came these terrible words  if you do not submit to the church you will be pronounced a heretic by these judges here present and burned at the stake  ah that would have smitten you or me dead with fright but it only roused the lion heart of joan of arc and in her answer rang that martial note which had used to stir her soldiers like a buglecall  i will not say otherwise than i have said already and if i saw the fire before me i would say it again  it was uplifting to hear her battlevoice once more and see the battlelight burn in her eye many there were stirred every man that was a man was stirred whether friend or foe and manchon risked his life again good soul for he wrote in the margin of the record in good plain letters these brave words superba responsio and there they have remained these sixty years and there you may read them to this day  superba responsio yes it was just that for this superb answer came from the lips of a girl of nineteen with death and hell staring her in the face  of course the matter of the male attire was gone over again and as usual at wearisome length also as usual the customary bribe was offered if she would discard that dress voluntarily they would let her hear mass but she answered as she had often answered before  i will go in a womans robe to all services of the church if i may be permitted but i will resume the other dress when i return to my cell  they set several traps for her in a tentative form that is to say they placed suppositious propositions before her and cunningly tried to commit her to one end of the propositions without committing themselves to the other but she always saw the game and spoiled it the trap was in this form  would you be willing to do so and so if we should give you leave  her answer was always in this form or to this effect  when you give me leave then you will know  yes joan was at her best that second of may she had all her wits about her and they could not catch her anywhere it was a long long session and all the old ground was fought over again foot by foot and the oratorexpert worked all his persuasions all his eloquence but the result was the familiar onea drawn battle the sixtytwo retiring upon their base the solitary enemy holding her original position within her original lines      16 joan stands defiant before the rack  the brilliant weather the heavenly weather the bewitching weather made everybodys heart to sing as i have told you yes rouen was feeling lighthearted and gay and most willing and ready to break out and laugh upon the least occasion and so when the news went around that the young girl in the tower had scored another defeat against bishop cauchon there was abundant laughterabundant laughter among the citizens of both parties for they all hated the bishop it is true the englishhearted majority of the people wanted joan burned but that did not keep them from laughing at the man they hated it would have been perilous for anybody to laugh at the english chiefs or at the majority of cauchons assistant judges but to laugh at cauchon or destivet and loyseleur was safenobody would report it  the difference between cauchon and cochon 1 was not noticeable in speech and so there was plenty of opportunity for puns the opportunities were not thrown away  some of the jokes got well worn in the course of two or three months from repeated use for every time cauchon started a new trial the folk said the sow has littered 2 again and every time the trial failed they said it over again with its other meaning the hog has made a mess of it  and so on the third of may noel and i drifting about the town heard many a widemouthed lout let go his joke and his laugh and then move to the next group proud of his wit and happy to work it off again  ods blood the sow has littered five times and five times has made a mess of it  and now and then one was bold enough to saybut he said it softly  sixtythree and the might of england against a girl and she camps on the field five times  cauchon lived in the great palace of the archbishop and it was guarded by english soldiery but no matter there was never a dark night but the walls showed next morning that the rude joker had been there with his paint and brush yes he had been there and had smeared the sacred walls with pictures of hogs in all attitudes except flattering ones hogs clothed in a bishops vestments and wearing a bishops miter irreverently cocked on the side of their heads  cauchon raged and cursed over his defeats and his impotence during seven says then he conceived a new scheme you shall see what it was for you have not cruel hearts and you would never guess it  on the ninth of may there was a summons and manchon and i got out materials together and started but this time we were to go to one of the other towersnot the one which was joans prison it was round and grim and massive and built of the plainest and thickest and solidest masonrya dismal and forbidding structure 3 we entered the circular room on the ground floor and i saw what turned me sickthe instruments of torture and the executioners standing ready here you have the black heart of cauchon at the blackest here you have the proof that in his nature there was no such thing as pity one wonders if he ever knew his mother or ever had a sister  cauchon was there and the viceinquisitor and the abbot of st corneille also six others among them that false loyseleur the guards were in their places the rack was there and by it stood the executioner and his aids in their crimson hose and doublets meet color for their bloody trade the picture of joan rose before me stretched upon the rack her feet tied to one end of it her wrists to the other and those red giants turning the windlass and pulling her limbs out of their sockets it seemed to me that i could hear the bones snap and the flesh tear apart and i did not see how that body of anointed servants of the merciful jesus could sit there and look so placid and indifferent  after a little joan arrived and was brought in she saw the rack she saw the attendants and the same picture which i had been seeing must have risen in her mind but do you think she quailed do you think she shuddered no there was no sign of that sort she straightened herself up and there was a slight curl of scorn about her lip but as for fear she showed not a vestige of it  this was a memorable session but it was the shortest one of all the list when joan had taken her seat a resume of her crimes was read to her then cauchon made a solemn speech it in he said that in the course of her several trials joan had refused to answer some of the questions and had answered others with lies but that now he was going to have the truth out of her and the whole of it  her manner was full of confidence this time he was sure he had found a way at last to break this childs stubborn spirit and make her beg and cry he would score a victory this time and stop the mouths of the jokers of rouen you see he was only just a man after all and couldnt stand ridicule any better than other people he talked high and his splotchy face lighted itself up with all the shifting tints and signs of evil pleasure and promised triumphpurple yellow red greenthey were all there with sometimes the dull and spongy blue of a drowned man the uncanniest of them all and finally he burst out in a great passion and said  there is the rack and there are its ministers you will reveal all now or be put to the torture  speak  then she made that great answer which will live forever made it without fuss or bravado and yet how fine and noble was the sound of it  i will tell you nothing more than i have told you no not even if you tear the limbs from my body and even if in my pain i did say something otherwise i would always say afterward that it was the torture that spoke and not i  there was no crushing that spirit you should have seen cauchon defeated again and he had not dreamed of such a thing i heard it said the next day around the town that he had a full confession all written out in his pocket and all ready for joan to sign i do not know that that was true but it probably was for her mark signed at the bottom of a confession would be the kind of evidence for effect with the public which cauchon and his people were particularly value you know  no there was no crushing that spirit and no beclouding that clear mind consider the depth the wisdom of that answer coming from an ignorant girl why there were not six men in the world who had ever reflected that words forced out of a person by horrible tortures were not necessarily words of verity and truth yet this unlettered peasantgirl put her finger upon that flaw with an unerring instinct i had always supposed that torture brought out the trutheverybody supposed it and when joan came out with those simple commonsense words they seemed to flood the place with light it was like a lightningflash at midnight which suddenly reveals a fair valley sprinkled over with silver streams and gleaming villages and farmsteads where was only an impenetrable world of darkness before manchon stole a sidewise look at me and his face was full of surprise and there was the like to be seen in other faces there considerthey were old and deeply cultured yet here was a village maid able to teach them something which they had not known before i heard one of them mutter  verily it is a wonderful creature she has laid her hand upon an accepted truth that is as old as the world and it has crumbled to dust and rubbish under her touch now whence got she that marvelous insight  the judges laid their heads together and began to talk now it was plain from chance words which one caught now and then that cauchon and loyseleur were insisting upon the application of the torture and that most of the others were urgently objecting  finally cauchon broke out with a good deal of asperity in his voice and ordered joan back to her dungeon that was a happy surprise for me i was not expecting that the bishop would yield  when manchon came home that night he said he had found out why the torture was not applied  there were two reasons one was a fear that joan might die under the torture which would not suit the english at all the other was that the torture would effect nothing if joan was going to take back everything she said under its pains and as to putting her mark to a confession it was believed that not even the rack would ever make her do that  so all rouen laughed again and kept it up for three days saying  the sow has littered six times and made six messes of it  and the palace walls got a new decorationa mitered hog carrying a discarded rack home on its shoulder and loyseleur weeping in its wake many rewards were offered for the capture of these painters but nobody applied even the english guard feigned blindness and would not see the artists at work  the bishops anger was very high now he could not reconcile himself to the idea of giving up the torture it was the pleasantest idea he had invented yet and he would not cast it by so he called in some of his satellites on the twelfth and urged the torture again but it was a failure  with some joans speech had wrought an effect others feared she might die under torture others did not believe that any amount of suffering could make her put her mark to a lying confession there were fourteen men present including the bishop eleven of them voted dead against the torture and stood their ground in spite of cauchons abuse two voted with the bishop and insisted upon the torture these two were loyseleur and the oratorthe man whom joan had bidden to read his bookthomas de courcelles the renowned pleader and master of eloquence  age has taught me charity of speech but it fails me when i think of those three namescauchon courcelles loyseleur  1 hog pig  2 cochonner to litter to farrow also to make a mess of  3 the lower half of it remains today just as it was then the upper half is of a later date  translator      17 supreme in direst peril  another ten days wait the great theologians of that treasury of all valuable knowledge and all wisdom the university of paris were still weighing and considering and discussing the twelve lies  i had had but little to do these ten days so i spent them mainly in walks about the town with noel but there was no pleasure in them our spirits being so burdened with cares and the outlook for joan growing steadily darker and darker all the time and then we naturally contrasted our circumstances with hers this freedom and sunshine with her darkness and chains our comradeship with her lonely estate our alleviations of one sort and another with her destitution in all she was used to liberty but now she had none she was an outofdoor creature by nature and habit but now she was shut up day and night in a steel cage like an animal she was used to the light but now she was always in a gloom where all objects about her were dim and spectral she was used to the thousand various sounds which are the cheer and music of a busy life but now she heard only the monotonous footfall of the sentry pacing his watch she had been fond of talking with her mates but now there was no one to talk to she had had an easy laugh but it was gone dumb now she had been born for comradeship and blithe and busy work and all manner of joyous activities but here were only dreariness and leaden hours and weary inaction and brooding stillness and thoughts that travel by day and night and night and day round and round in the same circle and wear the brain and break the heart with weariness it was death in life yes death in life that is what it must have been and there was another hard thing about it all a young girl in trouble needs the soothing solace and support and sympathy of persons of her own sex and the delicate offices and gentle ministries which only these can furnish yet in all these months of gloomy captivity in her dungeon joan never saw the face of a girl or a woman think how her heart would have leaped to see such a face  consider if you would realize how great joan of arc was remember that it was out of such a place and such circumstances that she came week after week and month after month and confronted the master intellects of france singlehanded and baffled their cunningest schemes defeated their ablest plans detected and avoided their secretest traps and pitfalls broke their lines repelled their assaults and camped on the field after every engagement steadfast always true to her faith and her ideals defying torture defying the stake and answering threats of eternal death and the pains of hell with a simple let come what may here i take my stand and will abide  yes if you would realize how great was the soul how profound the wisdom and how luminous the intellect of joan of arc you must study her there where she fought out that long fight all aloneand not merely against the subtlest brains and deepest learning of france but against the ignoble deceits the meanest treacheries and the hardest hearts to be found in any land pagan or christian  she was great in battlewe all know that great in foresight great in loyalty and patriotism great in persuading discontented chiefs and reconciling conflicting interests and passions great in the ability to discover merit and genius wherever it lay hidden great in picturesque and eloquent speech supremely great in the gift of firing the hearts of hopeless men and noble enthusiasms the gift of turning hares into heroes slaves and skulkers into battalions that march to death with songs on their lips but all these are exalting activities they keep hand and heart and brain keyed up to their work there is the joy of achievement the inspiration of stir and movement the applause which hails success the soul is overflowing with life and energy the faculties are at white heat weariness despondency inertiathese do not exist  yes joan of arc was great always great everywhere but she was greatest in the rouen trials  there she rose above the limitations and infirmities of our human nature and accomplished under blighting and unnerving and hopeless conditions all that her splendid equipment of moral and intellectual forces could have accomplished if they had been supplemented by the mighty helps of hope and cheer and light the presence of friendly faces and a fair and equal fight with the great world looking on and wondering      18 condemned yet unafraid  toward the end of the tenday interval the university of paris rendered its decision concerning the twelve articles by this finding joan was guilty upon all the counts she must renounce her errors and make satisfaction or be abandoned to the secular arm for punishment  the universitys mind was probably already made up before the articles were laid before it yet it took it from the fifth to the eighteenth to produce its verdict i think the delay may have been caused by temporary difficulties concerning two points  1 as to who the fiends were who were represented in joans voices 2 as to whether her saints spoke french only  you understand the university decided emphatically that it was fiends who spoke in those voices it would need to prove that and it did it found out who those fiends were and named them in the verdict belial satan and behemoth this has always seemed a doubtful thing to me and not entitled to much credit i think so for this reason if the university had actually known it was those three it would for very consistencys sake have told how it knew it and not stopped with the mere assertion since it had made joan explain how she knew they were not fiends does not that seem reasonable to my mind the universitys position was weak and i will tell you why it had claimed that joans angels were devils in disguise and we all know that devils do disguise themselves as angels up to that point the universitys position was strong but you see yourself that it eats its own argument when it turns around and pretends that it can tell who such apparitions are while denying the like ability to a person with as good a head on her shoulders as the best one the university could produce  the doctors of the university had to see those creatures in order to know and if joan was deceived it is argument that they in their turn could also be deceived for their insight and judgment were surely not clearer than hers  as to the other point which i have thought may have proved a difficulty and cost the university delay i will touch but a moment upon that and pass on the university decided that it was blasphemy for joan to say that her saints spoke french and not english and were on the french side in political sympathies i think that the thing which troubled the doctors of theology was this they had decided that the three voices were satan and two other devils but they had also decided that these voices were not on the french sidethereby tacitly asserting that they were on the english side and if on the english side then they must be angels and not devils otherwise the situation was embarrassing you see the university being the wisest and deepest and most erudite body in the world it would like to be logical if it could for the sake of its reputation therefore it would study and study days and days trying to find some good commonsense reason for proving the voices to be devils in article no 1 and proving them to be angels in article no 10 however they had to give it up they found no way out and so to this day the universitys verdict remains just sodevils in no 1 angels in no 10 and no way to reconcile the discrepancy  the envoys brought the verdict to rouen and with it a letter for cauchon which was full of fervid praise the university complimented him on his zeal in hunting down this woman whose venom had infected the faithful of the whole west and as recompense it as good as promised him a crown of imperishable glory in heaven only thata crown in heaven a promissory note and no indorser always something away off yonder not a word about the archbishopric of rouen which was the thing cauchon was destroying his soul for a crown in heaven it must have sounded like a sarcasm to him after all his hard work what should he do in heaven he did not know anybody there  on the nineteenth of may a court of fifty judges sat in the archiepiscopal palace to discuss joans fate a few wanted her delivered over to the secular arm at once for punishment but the rest insisted that she be once more charitably admonished first  so the same court met in the castle on the twentythird and joan was brought to the bar pierre maurice a canon of rouen made a speech to joan in which he admonished her to save her life and her soul by renouncing her errors and surrendering to the church he finished with a stern threat if she remained obstinate the damnation of her soul was certain the destruction of her body probable but joan was immovable she said  if i were under sentence and saw the fire before me and the executioner ready to light itmore if i were in the fire itself i would say none but the things which i have said in these trials and i would abide by them till i died  a deep silence followed now which endured some moments it lay upon me like a weight i knew it for an omen then cauchon grave and solemn turned to pierre maurice  have you anything further to say  the priest bowed low and said  nothing my lord  prisoner at the bar have you anything further to say  nothing  then the debate is closed tomorrow sentence will be pronounced remove the prisoner  she seemed to go from the place erect and noble but i do not know my sight was dim with tears  tomorrowtwentyfourth of may exactly a year since i saw her go speeding across the plain at the head of her troops her silver helmet shining her silvery cape fluttering in the wind her white plumes flowing her sword held aloft saw her charge the burgundian camp three times and carry it saw her wheel to the right and spur for the dukes reserves saw her fling herself against it in the last assault she was ever to make and now that fatal day was come againand see what it was bringing      19 our last hopes of rescue fail  joan had been adjudged guilty of heresy sorcery and all the other terrible crimes set forth in the twelve articles and her life was in cauchons hands at last he could send her to the stake at once his work was finished now you think he was satisfied not at all what would his archbishopric be worth if the people should get the idea into their heads that this faction of interested priests slaving under the english lash had wrongly condemned and burned joan of arc deliverer of france that would be to make of her a holy martyr then her spirit would rise from her bodys ashes a thousandfold reinforced and sweep the english domination into the sea and cauchon along with it no the victory was not complete yet joans guilt must be established by evidence which would satisfy the people where was that evidence to be found there was only one person in the world who could furnish itjoan of arc herself she must condemn herself and in publicat least she must seem to do it  but how was this to be managed weeks had been spent already in trying to get her to surrendertime wholly wasted what was to persuade her now torture had been threatened the fire had been threatened what was left illness deadly fatigue and the sight of the fire the presence of the fire that was left  now that was a shrewd thought she was but a girl after all and under illness and exhaustion subject to a girls weaknesses  yes it was shrewdly thought she had tacitly said herself that under the bitter pains of the rack they would be able to extort a false confession from her it was a hint worth remembering and it was remembered  she had furnished another hint at the same time that as soon as the pains were gone she would retract the confession that hint was also remembered  she had herself taught them what to do you see first they must wear out her strength then frighten her with the fire second while the fright was on her she must be made to sign a paper  but she would demand a reading of the paper they could not venture to refuse this with the public there to hear suppose that during the reading her courage should returnshe would refuse to sign then very well even that difficulty could be got over they could read a short paper of no importance then slip a long and deadly one into its place and trick her into signing that  yet there was still one other difficulty if they made her seem to abjure that would free her from the deathpenalty they could keep her in a prison of the church but they could not kill her  that would not answer for only her death would content the english alive she was a terror in a prison or out of it she had escaped from two prisons already  but even that difficulty could be managed cauchon would make promises to her in return she would promise to leave off the male dress he would violate his promises and that would so situate her that she would not be able to keep hers her lapse would condemn her to the stake and the stake would be ready  these were the several moves there was nothing to do but to make them each in its order and the game was won one might almost name the day that the betrayed girl the most innocent creature in france and the noblest would go to her pitiful death  the world knows now that cauchons plan was as i have sketched it to you but the world did not know it at that time there are sufficient indications that warwick and all the other english chiefs except the highest onethe cardinal of winchesterwere not let into the secret also that only loyseleur and beaupere on the french side knew the scheme sometimes i have doubted if even loyseleur and beaupere knew the whole of it at first however if any did it was these two  it is usual to let the condemned pass their last night of life in peace but this grace was denied to poor joan if one may credit the rumors of the time loyseleur was smuggled into her presence and in the character of priest friend and secret partisan of france and hater of england he spent some hours in beseeching her to do the only right an righteous thingsubmit to the church as a good christian should and that then she would straightway get out of the clutches of the dreaded english and be transferred to the churchs prison where she would be honorably used and have women about her for jailers he knew where to touch her he knew how odious to her was the presence of her rough and profane english guards he knew that her voices had vaguely promised something which she interpreted to be escape rescue release of some sort and the chance to burst upon france once more and victoriously complete the great work which she had been commissioned of heaven to do also there was that other thing if her failing body could be further weakened by loss of rest and sleep now her tired mind would be dazed and drowsy on the morrow and in ill condition to stand out against persuasions threats and the sight of the stake and also be purblind to traps and snares which it would be swift to detect when in its normal estate  i do not need to tell you that there was no rest for me that night nor for noel we went to the main gate of the city before nightfall with a hope in our minds based upon that vague prophecy of joans voices which seemed to promise a rescue by force at the last moment the immense news had flown swiftly far and wide that at last joan of arc was condemned and would be sentenced and burned alive on the morrow and so crowds of people were flowing in at the gate and other crowds were being refused admission by the soldiery these being people who brought doubtful passes or none at all we scanned these crowds eagerly but there was nothing about them to indicate that they were our old warcomrades in disguise and certainly there were no familiar faces among them and so when the gate was closed at last we turned away grieved and more disappointed than we cared to admit either in speech or thought  the streets were surging tides of excited men it was difficult to make ones way toward midnight our aimless tramp brought us to the neighborhood of the beautiful church of st ouen and there all was bustle and work the square was a wilderness of torches and people and through a guarded passage dividing the pack laborers were carrying planks and timbers and disappearing with them through the gate of the churchyard we asked what was going forward the answer was  scaffolds and the stake dont you know that the french witch is to be burned in the morning  then we went away we had no heart for that place  at dawn we were at the city gate again this time with a hope which our wearied bodies and fevered minds magnified into a large probability we had heard a report that the abbot of jumieges with all his monks was coming to witness the burning our desire abetted by our imagination turned those nine hundred monks into joans old campaigners and their abbot into la hire or the bastard or dalencon and we watched them file in unchallenged the multitude respectfully dividing and uncovering while they passed with our hearts in our throats and our eyes swimming with tears of joy and pride and exultation and we tried to catch glimpses of the faces under the cowls and were prepared to give signal to any recognized face that we were joans men and ready and eager to kill and be killed in the good cause how foolish we were  but we were young you know and youth hopeth all things believeth all things      20 the betrayal  in the morning i was at my official post it was on a platform raised the height of a man in the churchyard under the eaves of st ouen on this same platform was a crowd of priests and important citizens and several lawyers abreast it with a small space between was another and larger platform handsomely canopied against sun and rain and richly carpeted also it was furnished with comfortable chairs and with two which were more sumptuous than the others and raised above the general level one of these two was occupied by a prince of the royal blood of england his eminence the cardinal of winchester the other by cauchon bishop of beauvais in the rest of the chairs sat three bishops the viceinquisitor eight abbots and the sixtytwo friars and lawyers who had sat as joans judges in her late trials  twenty steps in front of the platforms was anothera tabletopped pyramid of stone built up in retreating courses thus forming steps out of this rose that grisly thing the stake about the stake bundles of fagots and firewood were piled on the ground at the base of the pyramid stood three crimson figures the executioner and his assistants at their feet lay what had been a goodly heap of brands but was now a smokeless nest of ruddy coals a foot or two from this was a supplemental supply of wood and fagots compacted into a pile shoulderhigh and containing as much as six packhorse loads think of that we seem so delicately made so destructible so insubstantial yet it is easier to reduce a granite statue to ashes than it is to do that with a mans body  the sight of the stake sent physical pains tingling down the nerves of my body and yet turn as i would my eyes would keep coming back t it such fascination has the gruesome and the terrible for us  the space occupied by the platforms and the stake was kept open by a wall of english soldiery standing elbow to elbow erect and stalwart figures fine and sightly in their polished steel while from behind them on every hand stretched far away a level plain of human heads and there was no window and no housetop within our view howsoever distant but was black with patches and masses of people  but there was no noise no stir it was as if the world was dead the impressiveness of this silence and solemnity was deepened by a leaden twilight for the sky was hidden by a pall of lowhanging stormclouds and above the remote horizon faint winkings of heatlightning played and now and then one caught the dull mutterings and complainings of distant thunder  at last the stillness was broken from beyond the square rose an indistinct sound but familiarcourt crisp phrases of command next i saw the plain of heads dividing and the steady swing of a marching host was glimpsed between my heart leaped for a moment was it la hire and his hellions nothat was not their gait no it was the prisoner and her escort it was joan of arc under guard that was coming my spirits sank as low as they had been before weak as she was they made her walk they would increase her weakness all they could the distance was not greatit was but a few hundred yardsbut short as it was it was a heavy tax upon one who had been lying chained in one spot for months and whose feet had lost their powers from inaction yes and for a year joan had known only the cool damps of a dungeon and now she was dragging herself through this sultry summer heat this airless and suffocating void as she entered the gate drooping with exhaustion there was that creature loyseleur at her side with his head bent to her ear we knew afterward that he had been with her again this morning in the prison wearying her with his persuasions and enticing her with false promises and that he was now still at the same work at the gate imploring her to yield everything that would be required of her and assuring her that if she would do this all would be well with her she would be rid of the dreaded english and find safety in the powerful shelter and protection of the church a miserable man a stonyhearted man  the moment joan was seated on the platform she closed her eyes and allowed her chin to fall and so sat with her hands nestling in her lap indifferent to everything caring for nothing but rest and she was so white againwhite as alabaster  how the faces of that packed mass of humanity lighted up with interest and with what intensity all eyes gazed upon this fragile girl and how natural it was for these people realized that at last they were looking upon that person whom they had so long hungered to see a person whose name and fame filled all europe and made all other names and all other renowns insignificant by comparisons joan of arc the wonder of the time and destined to be the wonder of all times  and i could read as by print in their marveling countenances the words that were drifting through their minds can it be true is it believable that it is this little creature this girl this child with the good face the sweet face the beautiful face the dear and bonny face that has carried fortresses by storm charged at the head of victorious armies blown the might of england out of her path with a breath and fought a long campaign solitary and alone against the massed brains and learning of franceand had won it if the fight had been fair  evidently cauchon had grown afraid of manchon because of his pretty apparent leanings toward joan for another recorder was in the chief place here which left my master and me nothing to do but sit idle and look on  well i suppose that everything had been done which could be thought of to tire joans body and mind but it was a mistake one more device had been invented this was to preach a long sermon to her in that oppressive heat  when the preacher began she cast up one distressed and disappointed look then dropped her head again this preacher was guillaume erard an oratorical celebrity he got his text from the twelve lies he emptied upon joan al the calumnies in detail that had been bottled up in that mass of venom and called her all the brutal names that the twelve were labeled with working himself into a whirlwind of fury as he went on but his labors were wasted she seemed lost in dreams she made no sign she did not seem to hear at last he launched this apostrophe  o france how hast thou been abused thou hast always been the home of christianity but now charles who calls himself thy king and governor indorses like the heretic and schismatic that he is the words and deeds of a worthless and infamous woman joan raised her head and her eyes began to burn and flash the preacher turned to her it is to you joan that i speak and i tell you that your king is schismatic and a heretic  ah he might abuse her to his hearts content she could endure that but to her dying moment she could never hear in patience a word against that ingrate that treacherous dog our king whose proper place was here at this moment sword in hand routing these reptiles and saving this most noble servant that ever king had in this worldand he would have been there if he had not been what i have called him joans loyal soul was outraged and she turned upon the preacher and flung out a few words with a spirit which the crowd recognized as being in accordance with the joan of arc traditions  by my faith sir i make bold to say and swear on pain of death that he is the most noble christian of all christians and the best lover of the faith and the church  there was an explosion of applause from the crowdwhich angered the preacher for he had been aching long to hear an expression like this and now that it was come at last it had fallen to the wrong person he had done all the work the other had carried off all the spoil he stamped his foot and shouted to the sheriff  make her shut up  that made the crowd laugh  a mob has small respect for a grown man who has to call on a sheriff to protect him from a sick girl  joan had damaged the preachers cause more with one sentence than he had helped it with a hundred so he was much put out and had trouble to get a good start again but he neednt have bothered there was no occasion it was mainly an englishfeeling mob it had but obeyed a law of our naturean irresistible lawto enjoy and applaud a spirited and promptly delivered retort no matter who makes it the mob was with the preacher it had been beguiled for a moment but only that it would soon return it was there to see this girl burnt so that it got that satisfactionwithout too much delayit would be content  presently the preacher formally summoned joan to submit to the church he made the demand with confidence for he had gotten the idea from loyseleur and beaupere that she was worn to the bone exhausted and would not be able to put forth any more resistance and indeed to look at her it seemed that they must be right nevertheless she made one more effort to hold her ground and said wearily  as to that matter i have answered my judges before i have told them to report all that i have said and done to our holy father the popeto whom and to god first i appeal  again out of her native wisdom she had brought those words of tremendous import but was ignorant of their value but they could have availed her nothing in any case now with the stake there and these thousands of enemies about her yet they made every churchman there blench and the preacher changed the subject with all haste well might those criminals blench for joans appeal of her case to the pope stripped cauchon at once of jurisdiction over it and annulled all that he and his judges had already done in the matter and all that they should do in it henceforth  joan went on presently to reiterate after some further talk that she had acted by command of god in her deeds and utterances then when an attempt was made to implicate the king and friends of hers and his she stopped that she said  i charge my deeds and words upon no one neither upon my king nor any other if there is any fault in them i am responsible and no other  she was asked if she would not recant those of her words and deeds which had been pronounced evil by her judges here answer made confusion and damage again  i submit them to god and the pope  the pope once more it was very embarrassing here was a person who was asked to submit her case to the church and who frankly consentsoffers to submit it to the very head of it what more could any one require how was one to answer such a formidably unanswerable answer as that  the worried judges put their heads together and whispered and planned and discussed then they brought forth this sufficiently shambling conclusionbut it was the best they could do in so close a place they said the pope was so far away and it was not necessary to go to him anyway because the present judges had sufficient power and authority to deal with the present case and were in effect the church to that extent at another time they could have smiled at this conceit but not now they were not comfortable enough now  the mob was getting impatient it was beginning to put on a threatening aspect it was tired of standing tired of the scorching heat and the thunder was coming nearer the lightning was flashing brighter it was necessary to hurry this matter to a close erard showed joan a written form which had been prepared and made all ready beforehand and asked her to abjure  abjure what is abjure  she did not know the word it was explained to her by massieu she tried to understand but she was breaking under exhaustion and she could not gather the meaning it was all a jumble and confusion of strange words in her despair she sent out this beseeching cry  i appeal to the church universal whether i ought to abjure or not  erard exclaimed  you shall abjure instantly or instantly be burnt  she glanced up at those awful words and for the first time she saw the stake and the mass of red coalsredder and angrier than ever now under the constantly deepening stormgloom she gasped and staggered up out of her seat muttering and mumbling incoherently and gazed vacantly upon the people and the scene about her like one who is dazed or thinks he dreams and does not know where he is  the priests crowded about her imploring her to sign the paper there were many voices beseeching and urging her at once there was great turmoil and shouting and excitement among the populace and everywhere  sign sign from the priests signsign and be saved and loyseleur was urging at her ear do as i told youdo not destroy yourself  joan said plaintively to these people  ah you do not do well to seduce me  the judges joined their voices to the others yes even the iron in their hearts melted and they said  o joan we pity you so take back what you have said or we must deliver you up to punishment  and now there was another voiceit was from the other platformpealing solemnly above the din cauchonsreading the sentence of death  joans strength was all spent she stood looking about her in a bewildered way a moment then slowly she sank to her knees and bowed her head and said  i submit  they gave her no time to reconsiderthey knew the peril of that the moment the words were out of her mouth massieu was reading to her the abjuration and she was repeating the words after him mechanically unconsciouslyand smiling for her wandering mind was far away in some happier world  then this short paper of six lines was slipped aside and a long one of many pages was smuggled into its place and she noting nothing put her mark on it saying in pathetic apology that she did not know how to write but a secretary of the king of england was there to take care of that defect he guided her hand with his own and wrote her namejehanne  the great crime was accomplished she had signedwhat she did not knowbut the others knew she had signed a paper confessing herself a sorceress a dealer with devils a liar a blasphemer of god and his angels a lover of blood a promoter of sedition cruel wicked commissioned of satan and this signature of hers bound her to resume the dress of a woman  there were other promises but that one would answer without the others and that one could be made to destroy her  loyseleur pressed forward and praised her for having done such a good days work  but she was still dreamy she hardly heard  then cauchon pronounced the words which dissolved the excommunication and restored her to her beloved church with all the dear privileges of worship ah she heard that you could see it in the deep gratitude that rose in her face and transfigured it with joy  but how transient was that happiness for cauchon without a tremor of pity in his voice added these crushing words  and that she may repent of her crimes and repeat them no more she is sentenced to perpetual imprisonment with the bread of affliction and the water of anguish  perpetual imprisonment she had never dreamed of thatsuch a thing had never been hinted to her by loyseleur or by any other loyseleur had distinctly said and promised that all would be well with her and the very last words spoken to her by erard on that very platform when he was urging her to abjure was a straight unqualified promisedthat if she would do it she should go free from captivity  she stood stunned and speechless a moment then she remembered with such solacement as the thought could furnish that by another clear promise made by cauchon himselfshe would at least be the churchs captive and have women about her in place of a brutal foreign soldiery so she turned to the body of priests and said with a sad resignation  now you men of the church take me to your prison and leave me no longer in the hands of the english and she gathered up her chains and prepared to move  but alas now came these shameful words from cauchonand with them a mocking laugh  take her to the prison whence she came  poor abused girl she stood dumb smitten paralyzed it was pitiful to see she had been beguiled lied to betrayed she saw it all now  the rumbling of a drum broke upon the stillness and for just one moment she thought of the glorious deliverance promised by her voicesi read it in the rapture that lit her face then she saw what it washer prison escortand that light faded never to revive again and now her head began a piteous rocking motion swaying slowly this way and that as is the way when one is suffering unwordable pain or when ones heart is broken then drearily she went from us with her face in her hands and sobbing bitterly      21 respited only for torture  there is no certainty that any one in all rouen was in the secret of the deep game which cauchon was playing except the cardinal of winchester then you can imagine the astonishment and stupefaction of that vast mob gathered there and those crowds of churchmen assembled on the two platforms when they saw joan of arc moving away alive and wholeslipping out of their grip at last after all this tedious waiting all this tantalizing expectancy  nobody was able to stir or speak for a while so paralyzing was the universal astonishment so unbelievable the fact that the stake was actually standing there unoccupied and its prey gone  then suddenly everybody broke into a fury of rage maledictions and charges of treachery began to fly freely yes and even stones a stone came near killing the cardinal of winchesterit just missed his head but the man who threw it was not to blame for he was excited and a person who is excited never can throw straight  the tumult was very great indeed for a while in the midst of it a chaplain of the cardinal even forgot the proprieties so far as to opprobriously assail the august bishop of beauvais himself shaking his fist in his face and shouting  by god you are a traitor  you lie responded the bishop  he a traitor oh far from it he certainly was the last frenchman that any briton had a right to bring that charge against  the earl of warwick lost his temper too he was a doughty soldier but when it came to the intellectualswhen it came to delicate chicane and scheming and trickeryhe couldnt see any further through a millstone than another so he burst out in his frank warrior fashion and swore that the king of england was being treacherously used and that joan of arc was going to be allowed to cheat the stake but they whispered comfort into his ear  give yourself no uneasiness my lord we shall soon have her again  perhaps the like tidings found their way all around for good news travels fast as well as bad at any rate the ragings presently quieted down and the huge concourse crumbled apart and disappeared and thus we reached the noon of that fearful thursday  we two youths were happy happier than any words can tellfor we were not in the secret any more than the rest joans life was saved we knew that and that was enough france would hear of this days infamous workand then why then her gallant sons would flock to her standard by thousands and thousands multitudes upon multitudes and their wrath would be like the wrath of the ocean when the stormwinds sweep it and they would hurl themselves against this doomed city and overwhelm it like the resistless tides of that ocean and joan of arc would march again  in six daysseven daysone short weeknoble france grateful france indignant france would be thundering at these gateslet us count the hours let us count the minutes let us count the seconds o happy day o day of ecstasy how our hearts sang in our bosoms  for we were young then yes we were very young  do you think the exhausted prisoner was allowed to rest and sleep after she had spent the small remnant of her strength in dragging her tired body back to the dungeon  no there was no rest for her with those sleuthhounds on her track cauchon and some of his people followed her to her lair straightway they found her dazed and dull her mental and physical forces in a state of prostration they told her she had abjured that she had made certain promisesamong them to resume the apparel of her sex and that if she relapsed the church would cast her out for good and all she heard the words but they had no meaning to her she was like a person who has taken a narcotic and is dying for sleep dying for rest from nagging dying to be let alone and who mechanically does everything the persecutor asks taking but dull note of the things done and but dully recording them in the memory and so joan put on the gown which cauchon and his people had brought and would come to herself by and by and have at first but a dim idea as to when and how the change had come about  cauchon went away happy and content joan had resumed womans dress without protest also she had been formally warned against relapsing he had witnesses to these facts how could matters be better  but suppose she should not relapse  why then she must be forced to do it  did cauchon hint to the english guards that thenceforth if they chose to make their prisoners captivity crueler and bitterer than ever no official notice would be taken of it perhaps so since the guards did begin that policy at once and no official notice was taken of it yes from that moment joans life in that dungeon was made almost unendurable do not ask me to enlarge upon it i will not do it      22 joan gives the fatal answer  friday and saturday were happy days for noel and me our minds were full of our splendid dream of france arousedfrance shaking her manefrance on the marchfrance at the gatesrouen in ashes and joan free our imagination was on fire we were delirious with pride and joy for we were very young as i have said  we knew nothing about what had been happening in the dungeon in the yesterafternoon we supposed that as joan had abjured and been taken back into the forgiving bosom of the church she was being gently used now and her captivity made as pleasant and comfortable for her as the circumstances would allow so in high contentment we planned out our share in the great rescue and fought our part of the fight over and over again during those two happy daysas happy days as ever i have known  sunday morning came i was awake enjoying the balmy lazy weather and thinking thinking of the rescuewhat else i had no other thought now i was absorbed in that drunk with the happiness of it  i heard a voice shouting far down the street and soon it came nearer and i caught the words  joan of arc has relapsed the witchs time has come  it stopped my heart it turned my blood to ice that was more than sixty years ago but that triumphant note rings as clear in my memory today as it rang in my ear that longvanished summer morning we are so strangely made the memories that could make us happy pass away it is the memories that break our hearts that abide  soon other voices took up that crytens scores hundreds of voices all the world seemed filled with the brutal joy of it and there were other clamorsthe clatter of rushing feet merry congratulations bursts of coarse laughter the rolling of drums the boom and crash of distant bands profaning the sacred day with the music of victory and thanksgiving  about the middle of the afternoon came a summons for manchon and me to go to joans dungeona summons from cauchon but by that time distrust had already taken possession of the english and their soldiery again and all rouen was in an angry and threatening mood we could see plenty of evidences of this from our own windowsfistshaking black looks tumultuous tides of furious men billowing by along the street  and we learned that up at the castle things were going very badly indeed that there was a great mob gathered there who considered the relapse a lie and a priestly trick and among them many halfdrunk english soldiers moreover these people had gone beyond words they had laid hands upon a number of churchmen who were trying to enter the castle and it had been difficult work to rescue them and save their lives  and so manchon refused to go he said he would not go a step without a safeguard from warwick so next morning warwick sent an escort of soldiers and then we went matters had not grown peacefuler meantime but worse the soldiers protected us from bodily damage but as we passed through the great mob at the castle we were assailed with insults and shameful epithets i bore it well enough though and said to myself with secret satisfaction in three or four short days my lads you will be employing your tongues in a different sort from thisand i shall be there to hear  to my mind these were as good as dead men how many of them would still be alive after the rescue that was coming not more than enough to amuse the executioner a short halfhour certainly  it turned out that the report was true joan had relapsed she was sitting there in her chains clothed again in her male attire  she accused nobody that was her way it was not in her character to hold a servant to account for what his master had made him do and her mind had cleared now and she knew that the advantage which had been taken of her the previous morning had its origin not in the subordinate but in the mastercauchon  here is what had happened while joan slept in the early morning of sunday one of the guards stole her female apparel and put her male attire in its place when she woke she asked for the other dress but the guards refused to give it back she protested and said she was forbidden to wear the male dress but they continued to refuse she had to have clothing for modestys sake moreover she saw that she could not save her life if she must fight for it against treacheries like this so she put on the forbidden garments knowing what the end would be she was weary of the struggle poor thing  we had followed in the wake of cauchon the viceinquisitor and the otherssix or eightand when i saw joan sitting there despondent forlorn and still in chains when i was expecting to find her situation so different i did not know what to make of it the shock was very great i had doubted the relapse perhaps possibly i had believed in it but had not realized it  cauchons victory was complete he had had a harassed and irritated and disgusted look for a long time but that was all gone now and contentment and serenity had taken its place his purple face was full of tranquil and malicious happiness he went trailing his robes and stood grandly in front of joan with his legs apart and remained so more than a minute gloating over her and enjoying the sight of this poor ruined creature who had won so lofty a place for him in the service of the meek and merciful jesus saviour of the world lord of the universein case england kept her promise to him who kept no promises himself  presently the judges began to question joan one of them named marguerie who was a man with more insight than prudence remarked upon joans change of clothing and said  there is something suspicious about this how could it have come about without connivance on the part of others perhaps even something worse  thousand devils screamed cauchon in a fury will you shut your mouth  armagnac traitor shouted the soldiers on guard and made a rush for marguerie with their lances leveled it was with the greatest difficulty that he was saved from being run through the body he made no more attempts to help the inquiry poor man the other judges proceeded with the questionings  why have you resumed this male habit  i did not quite catch her answer for just then a soldiers halberd slipped from his fingers and fell on the stone floor with a crash but i thought i understood joan to say that she had resumed it of her own motion  but you have promised and sworn that you would not go back to it  i was full of anxiety to hear her answer to that question and when it came it was just what i was expecting she saidquiet quietly  i have never intended and never understood myself to swear i would not resume it  therei had been sure all along that she did not know what she was doing and saying on the platform thursday and this answer of hers was proof that i had not been mistaken then she went on to add this  but i had a right to resume it because the promises made to me have not been keptpromises that i should be allowed to go to mass and receive the communion and that i should be freed from the bondage of these chainsbut they are still upon me as you see  nevertheless you have abjured and have especially promised to return no more to the dress of a man  then joan held out her fettered hands sorrowfully toward these unfeeling men and said  i would rather die than continue so but if they may be taken off and if i may hear mass and be removed to a penitential prison and have a woman about me i will be good and will do what shall seem good to you that i do  cauchon sniffed scoffingly at that honor the compact which he and his had made with her  fulfil its conditions what need of that conditions had been a good thing to concede temporarily and for advantage but they have served their turnlet something of a fresher sort and of more consequence be considered the resumption of the male dress was sufficient for all practical purposes but perhaps joan could be led to add something to that fatal crime so cauchon asked her if her voices had spoken to her since thursdayand he reminded her of her abjuration  yes she answered and then it came out that the voices had talked with her about the abjurationtold her about it i suppose she guilelessly reasserted the heavenly origin of her mission and did it with the untroubled mien of one who was not conscious that she had ever knowingly repudiated it so i was convinced once more that she had had no notion of what she was doing that thursday morning on the platform finally she said my voices told me i did very wrong to confess that what i had done was not well then she sighed and said with simplicity but it was the fear of the fire that made me do so  that is fear of the fire had made her sign a paper whose contents she had not understood then but understood now by revelation of her voices and by testimony of her persecutors  she was sane now and not exhausted her courage had come back and with it her inborn loyalty to the truth she was bravely and serenely speaking it again knowing that it would deliver her body up to that very fire which had such terrors for her  that answer of hers was quite long quite frank wholly free from concealments or palliations it made me shudder i knew she was pronouncing sentence of death upon herself so did poor manchon and he wrote in the margin abreast of it  responsio mortifera fatal answer yes all present knew that it was indeed a fatal answer then there fell a silence such as falls in a sickroom when the watchers of the dying draw a deep breath and say softly one to another all is over  here likewise all was over but after some moments cauchon wishing to clinch this matter and make it final put this question  do you still believe that your voices are st marguerite and st catherine  yesand that they come from god  yet you denied them on the scaffold  then she made direct and clear affirmation that she had never had any intention to deny them and that ifi noted the ifif she had made some retractions and revocations on the scaffold it was from fear of the fire and it was a violation of the truth  there it is again you see she certainly never knew what it was she had done on the scaffold until she was told of it afterward by these people and by her voices  and now she closed this most painful scene with these words and there was a weary note in them that was pathetic  i would rather do my penance all at once let me die i cannot endure captivity any longer  the spirit born for sunshine and liberty so longed for release that it would take it in any form even that  several among the company of judges went from the place troubled and sorrowful the others in another mood in the court of the castle we found the earl of warwick and fifty english waiting impatient for news as soon as cauchon saw them he shoutedlaughingthink of a man destroying a friendless poor girl and then having the heart to laugh at it  make yourselves comfortableits all over with her      23 the time is at hand  the young can sink into abysses of despondency and it was so with noel and me now but the hopes of the young are quick to rise again and it was so with ours we called back that vague promise of the voices and said the one to the other that the glorious release was to happen at the last momentthat other time was not the last moment but this is it will happen now the king will come la hire will come and with them our veterans and behind them all france and so we were full of heart again and could already hear in fancy that stirring music the clash of steel and the warcries and the uproar of the onset and in fancy see our prisoner free her chains gone her sword in her hand  but this dream was to pass also and come to nothing late at night when manchon came in he said  i am come from the dungeon and i have a message for you from that poor child  a message to me if he had been noticing i think he would have discovered mediscovered that my indifference concerning the prisoner was a pretense for i was caught off my guard and was so moved and so exalted to be so honored by her that i must have shown my feeling in my face and manner  a message for me your reverence  yes it is something she wishes done she said she had noticed the young man who helps me and that he had a good face and did i think he would do a kindness for her i said i knew you would and asked her what it was and she said a letterwould you write a letter to her mother  and i said you would but i said i would do it myself and gladly but she said no that my labors were heavy and she thought the young man would not mind the doing of this service for one not able to do it for herself she not knowing how to write then i would have sent for you and at that the sadness vanished out of her face why it was as if she was going to see a friend poor friendless thing but i was not permitted i did my best but the orders remain as strict as ever the doors are closed against all but officials as before none but officials may speak to her so i went back and told her and she sighed and was sad again now this is what she begs you to write to her mother it is partly a strange message and to me means nothing but she said her mother would understand you will convey her adoring love to her family and her village friends and say there will be no rescue for that this nightand it is the third time in the twelvemonth and is finalshe has seen the vision of the tree  how strange  yes it is strange but that is what she said and said her parents would understand and for a little time she was lost in dreams and thinkings and her lips moved and i caught in her muttering these lines which she said over two or three times and they seemed to bring peace and contentment to her i set them down thinking they might have some connection with her letter and be useful but it was not so they were a mere memory floating idly in a tired mind and they have no meaning at least no relevancy  i took the piece of paper and found what i knew i should find  and when in exile wandring we shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee oh rise upon our sight  there was no hope any more i knew it now i knew that joans letter was a message to noel and me as well as to her family and that its object was to banish vain hopes from our minds and tell us from her own mouth of the blow that was going to fall upon us so that we being her soldiers would know it for a command to bear it as became us and her and so submit to the will of god and in thus obeying find assuagement of our grief it was like her for she was always thinking of others not of herself yes her heart was sore for us she could find time to think of us the humblest of her servants and try to soften our pain lighten the burden of our troublesshe that was drinking of the bitter waters she that was walking in the valley of the shadow of death  i wrote the letter you will know what it cost me without my telling you i wrote it with the same wooden stylus which had put upon parchment the first words ever dictated by joan of arcthat high summons to the english to vacate france two years past when she was a lass of seventeen it had now set down the last ones which she was ever to dictate then i broke it for the pen that had served joan of arc could not serve any that would come after her in this earth without abasement  the next day may 29th cauchon summoned his serfs and fortytwo responded it is charitable to believe that the other twenty were ashamed to come the fortytwo pronounced her a relapsed heretic and condemned her to be delivered over to the secular arm cauchon thanked them  then he sent orders that joan of arc be conveyed the next morning to the place known as the old market and that she be then delivered to the civil judge and by the civil judge to the executioner that meant she would be burnt  all the afternoon and evening of tuesday the 29th the news was flying and the people of the countryside flocking to rouen to see the tragedyall at least who could prove their english sympathies and count upon admission the press grew thicker and thicker in the streets the excitement grew higher and higher and now a thing was noticeable again which had been noticeable more than once beforethat there was pity for joan in the hearts of many of these people whenever she had been in great danger it had manifested itself and now it was apparent againmanifest in a pathetic dumb sorrow which was visible in many faces  early the next morning wednesday martin ladvenu and another friar were sent to joan to prepare her for death and manchon and i went with thema hard service for me we tramped through the dim corridors winding this way and that and piercing ever deeper and deeper into that vast heart of stone and at last we stood before joan but she did not know it she sat with her hands in her lap and her head bowed thinking and her face was very sad one might not know what she was thinking of of her home and the peaceful pastures and the friends she was no more to see of her wrongs and her forsaken estate and the cruelties which had been put upon her or was it of deaththe death which she had longed for and which was now so close  or was it of the kind of death she must suffer i hoped not for she feared only one kind and that one had for her unspeakable terrors i believed she so feared that one that with her strong will she would shut the thought of it wholly out of her mind and hope and believe that god would take pity on her and grant her an easier one and so it might chance that the awful news which we were bringing might come as a surprise to her at last  we stood silent awhile but she was still unconscious of us still deep in her sad musings and far away then martin ladvenu said softly  joan  she looked up then with a little start and a wan smile and said  speak have you a message for me  yes my poor child try to bear it do you think you can bear it  yesvery softly and her head drooped again  i am come to prepare you for death  a faint shiver trembled through her wasted body there was a pause in the stillness we could hear our breathings then she said still in that low voice  when will it be  the muffled notes of a tolling bell floated to our ears out of the distance  now the time is at hand  that slight shiver passed again  it is so soonah it is so soon  there was a long silence the distant throbbings of the bell pulsed through it and we stood motionless and listening but it was broken at last  what death is it  by fire  oh i knew it i knew it she sprang wildly to her feet and wound her hands in her hair and began to writhe and sob oh so piteously and mourn and grieve and lament and turn to first one and then another of us and search our faces beseechingly as hoping she might find help and friendliness there poor thingshe that had never denied these to any creature even her wounded enemy on the battlefield  oh cruel cruel to treat me so and must my body that has never been defiled be consumed today and turned to ashes ah sooner would i that my head were cut off seven times than suffer this woeful death i had the promise of the churchs prison when i submitted and if i had but been there and not left here in the hands of my enemies this miserable fate had not befallen me  oh i appeal to god the great judge against the injustice which has been done me  there was none there that could endure it they turned away with the tears running down their faces in a moment i was on my knees at her feet at once she thought only of my danger and bent and whispered in my hear updo not peril yourself good heart theregod bless you always and i felt the quick clasp of her hand mine was the last hand she touched with hers in life none saw it history does not know of it or tell of it yet it is true just as i have told it the next moment she saw cauchon coming and she went and stood before him and reproached him saying  bishop it is by you that i die  he was not shamed not touched but said smoothly  ah be patient joan you die because you have not kept your promise but have returned to your sins  alas she said if you had put me in the churchs prison and given me right and proper keepers as you promised this would not have happened and for this i summon you to answer before god  then cauchon winced and looked less placidly content than before and he turned him about and went away  joan stood awhile musing she grew calmer but occasionally she wiped her eyes and now and then sobs shook her body but their violence was modifying now and the intervals between them were growing longer finally she looked up and saw pierre maurice who had come in with the bishop and she said to him  master peter where shall i be this night  have you not good hope in god  yesand by his grace i shall be in paradise  now martin ladvenu heard her in confession then she begged for the sacrament but how grant the communion to one who had been publicly cut off from the church and was now no more entitled to its privileges than an unbaptized pagan the brother could not do this but he sent to cauchon to inquire what he must do all laws human and divine were alike to that manhe respected none of them he sent back orders to grant joan whatever she wished her last speech to him had reached his fears perhaps it could not reach his heart for he had none  the eucharist was brought now to that poor soul that had yearned for it with such unutterable longing all these desolate months it was a solemn moment while we had been in the deeps of the prison the public courts of the castle had been filling up with crowds of the humbler sort of men and women who had learned what was going on in joans cell and had come with softened hearts to dothey knew not what to hearthey knew not what we knew nothing of this for they were out of our view and there were other great crowds of the like caste gathered in masses outside the castle gates and when the lights and the other accompaniments of the sacrament passed by coming to joan in the prison all those multitudes kneeled down and began to pray for her and many wept and when the solemn ceremony of the communion began in joans cell out of the distance a moving sound was borne moaning to our earsit was those invisible multitudes chanting the litany for a departing soul  the fear of the fiery death was gone from joan of arc now to come again no more except for one fleeting instantthen it would pass and serenity and courage would take its place and abide till the end      24 joan the martyr  at nine oclock the maid of orleans deliverer of france went forth in the grace of her innocence and her youth to lay down her life for the country she loved with such devotion and for the king that had abandoned her she sat in the cart that is used only for felons in one respect she was treated worse than a felon for whereas she was on her way to be sentenced by the civil arm she already bore her judgment inscribed in advance upon a mitershaped cap which she wore  heretic relapsed apostate idolater in the cart with her sat the friar martin ladvenu and maetre jean massieu she looked girlishly fair and sweet and saintly in her long white robe and when a gush of sunlight flooded her as she emerged from the gloom of the prison and was yet for a moment still framed in the arch of the somber gate the massed multitudes of poor folk murmured a vision a vision and sank to their knees praying and many of the women weeping and the moving invocation for the dying arose again and was taken up and borne along a majestic wave of sound which accompanied the doomed solacing and blessing her all the sorrowful way to the place of death christ have pity saint margaret have pity pray for her all ye saints archangels and blessed martyrs pray for her saints and angels intercede for her from thy wrath good lord deliver her o lord god save her have mercy on her we beseech thee good lord  it is just and true what one of the histories has said the poor and the helpless had nothing but their prayers to give joan of arc but these we may believe were not unavailing there are few more pathetic events recorded in history than this weeping helpless praying crowd holding their lighted candles and kneeling on the pavement beneath the prison walls of the old fortress  and it was so all the way thousands upon thousands massed upon their knees and stretching far down the distances thicksown with the faint yellow candleflames like a field starred with golden flowers  but there were some that did not kneel these were the english soldiers they stood elbow to elbow on each side of joans road and walled it in all the way and behind these living walls knelt the multitudes  by and by a frantic man in priests garb came wailing and lamenting and tore through the crowd and the barriers of soldiers and flung himself on his knees by joans cart and put up his hands in supplication crying out  o forgive forgive  it was loyseleur  and joan forgave him forgave him out of a heart that knew nothing but forgiveness nothing but compassion nothing but pity for all that suffer let their offense be what it might and she had no word of reproach for this poor wretch who had wrought day and night with deceits and treacheries and hypocrisies to betray her to her death  the soldiers would have killed him but the earl of warwick saved his life what became of him is not known he hid himself from the world somewhere to endure his remorse as he might  in the square of the old market stood the two platforms and the stake that had stood before in the churchyard of st ouen the platforms were occupied as before the one by joan and her judges the other by great dignitaries the principal being cauchon and the english cardinalwinchester the square was packed with people the windows and roofs of the blocks of buildings surrounding it were black with them  when the preparations had been finished all noise and movement gradually ceased and a waiting stillness followed which was solemn and impressive  and now by order of cauchon an ecclesiastic named nicholas midi preached a sermon wherein he explained that when a branch of the vinewhich is the churchbecomes diseased and corrupt it must be cut away or it will corrupt and destroy the whole vine he made it appear that joan through her wickedness was a menace and a peril to the churchs purity and holiness and her death therefore necessary when he was come to the end of his discourse he turned toward her and paused a moment then he said  joan the church can no longer protect you go in peace  joan had been placed wholly apart and conspicuous to signify the churchs abandonment of her and she sat there in her loneliness waiting in patience and resignation for the end cauchon addressed her now he had been advised to read the form of her abjuration to her and had brought it with him but he changed his mind fearing that she would proclaim the truththat she had never knowingly abjuredand so bring shame upon him and eternal infamy he contented himself with admonishing her to keep in mind her wickednesses and repent of them and think of her salvation then he solemnly pronounced her excommunicate and cut off from the body of the church with a final word he delivered her over to the secular arm for judgment and sentence  joan weeping knelt and began to pray for whom herself oh nofor the king of france her voice rose sweet and clear and penetrated all hearts with its passionate pathos she never thought of his treacheries to her she never thought of his desertion of her she never remembered that it was because he was an ingrate that she was here to die a miserable death she remembered only that he was her king that she was his loyal and loving subject and that his enemies had undermined his cause with evil reports and false charges and he not by to defend himself and so in the very presence of death she forgot her own troubles to implore all in her hearing to be just to him to believe that he was good and noble and sincere and not in any way to blame for any acts of hers neither advising them nor urging them but being wholly clear and free of all responsibility for them then closing she begged in humble and touching words that all here present would pray for her and would pardon her both her enemies and such as might look friendly upon her and feel pity for her in their hearts  there was hardly one heart there that was not touchedeven the english even the judges showed it and there was many a lip that trembled and many an eye that was blurred with tears yes even the english cardinalsthat man with a political heart of stone but a human heart of flesh  the secular judge who should have delivered judgment and pronounced sentence was himself so disturbed that he forgot his duty and joan went to her death unsentencedthus completing with an illegality what had begun illegally and had so continued to the end he only saidto the guards  take her and to the executioner do your duty  joan asked for a cross none was able to furnish one but an english soldier broke a stick in two and crossed the pieces and tied them together and this cross he gave her moved to it by the good heart that was in him and she kissed it and put it in her bosom then isambard de la pierre went to the church near by and brought her a consecrated one and this one also she kissed and pressed it to her bosom with rapture and then kissed it again and again covering it with tears and pouring out her gratitude to god and the saints  and so weeping and with her cross to her lips she climbed up the cruel steps to the face of the stake with the friar isambard at her side then she was helped up to the top of the pile of wood that was built around the lower third of the stake and stood upon it with her back against the stake and the world gazing up at her breathless the executioner ascended to her side and wound chains around her slender body and so fastened her to the stake then he descended to finish his dreadful office and there she remained aloneshe that had had so many friends in the days when she was free and had been so loved and so dear  all these things i saw albeit dimly and blurred with tears but i could bear no more i continued in my place but what i shall deliver to you now i got by others eyes and others mouths tragic sounds there were that pierced my ears and wounded my heart as i sat there but it is as i tell you the latest image recorded by my eyes in that desolating hour was joan of arc with the grace of her comely youth still unmarred and that image untouched by time or decay has remained with me all my days now i will go on  if any thought that now in that solemn hour when all transgressors repent and confess she would revoke her revocation and say her great deeds had been evil deeds and satan and his fiends their source they erred no such thought was in her blameless mind she was not thinking of herself and her troubles but of others and of woes that might befall them and so turning her grieving eyes about her where rose the towers and spires of that fair city she said  oh rouen rouen must i die here and must you be my tomb ah rouen rouen i have great fear that you will suffer for my death  a whiff of smoke swept upward past her face and for one moment terror seized her and she cried out water give me holy water but the next moment her fears were gone and they came no more to torture her  she heard the flames crackling below her and immediately distress for a fellowcreature who was in danger took possession of her it was the friar isambard she had given him her cross and begged him to raise it toward her face and let her eyes rest in hope and consolation upon it till she was entered into the peace of god she made him go out from the danger of the fire then she was satisfied and said  now keep it always in my sight until the end  not even yet could cauchon that man without shame endure to let her die in peace but went toward her all black with crimes and sins as he was and cried out  i am come joan to exhort you for the last time to repent and seek the pardon of god  i die through you she said and these were the last words she spoke to any upon earth  then the pitchy smoke shot through with red flashes of flame rolled up in a thick volume and hid her from sight and from the heart of this darkness her voice rose strong and eloquent in prayer and when by moments the wind shredded somewhat of the smoke aside there were veiled glimpses of an upturned face and moving lips at last a mercifully swift tide of flame burst upward and none saw that face any more nor that form and the voice was still  yes she was gone from us joan of arc what little words they are to tell of a rich world made empty and poor      conclusion  joans brother jacques died in domremy during the great trial at rouen this was according to the prophecy which joan made that day in the pastures the time that she said the rest of us would go to the great wars  when her poor old father heard of the martyrdom it broke his heart and he died  the mother was granted a pension by the city of orleans and upon this she lived out her days which were many twentyfour years after her illustrious childs death she traveled all the way to paris in the wintertime and was present at the opening of the discussion in the cathedral of notre dame which was the first step in the rehabilitation paris was crowded with people from all about france who came to get sight of the venerable dame and it was a touching spectacle when she moved through these reverent weteyed multitudes on her way to the grand honors awaiting her at the cathedral with her were jean and pierre no longer the lighthearted youths who marched with us from vaucouleurs but wartorn veterans with hair beginning to show frost  after the martyrdom noel and i went back to domremy but presently when the constable richemont superseded la tremouille as the kings chief adviser and began the completion of joans great work we put on our harness and returned to the field and fought for the king all through the wars and skirmishes until france was freed of the english it was what joan would have desired of us and dead or alive her desire was law for us all the survivors of the personal staff were faithful to her memory and fought for the king to the end mainly we were well scattered but when paris fell we happened to be together it was a great day and a joyous but it was a sad one at the same time because joan was not there to march into the captured capital with us  noel and i remained always together and i was by his side when death claimed him it was in the last great battle of the war in that battle fell also joans sturdy old enemy talbot he was eightyfive years old and had spent his whole life in battle a fine old lion he was with his flowing white mane and his tameless spirit yes and his indestructible energy as well for he fought as knightly and vigorous a fight that day as the best man there  la hire survived the martyrdom thirteen years and always fighting of course for that was all he enjoyed in life i did not see him in all that time for we were far apart but one was always hearing of him  the bastard of orleans and dalencon and daulon lived to see france free and to testify with jean and pierre darc and pasquerel and me at the rehabilitation but they are all at rest now these many years i alone am left of those who fought at the side of joan of arc in the great wars  she said i would live until those wars were forgottena prophecy which failed if i should live a thousand years it would still fail for whatsoever had touch with joan of arc that thing is immortal  members of joans family married and they have left descendants their descendants are of the nobility but their family name and blood bring them honors which no other nobles receive or may hope for you have seen how everybody along the way uncovered when those children came yesterday to pay their duty to me it was not because they are noble it is because they are grandchildren of the brothers of joan of arc  now as to the rehabilitation joan crowned the king at rheims for reward he allowed her to be hunted to her death without making one effort to save her during the next twentythree years he remained indifferent to her memory indifferent to the fact that her good name was under a damning blot put there by the priest because of the deeds which she had done in saving him and his scepter indifferent to the fact that france was ashamed and longed to have the deliverers fair fame restored indifferent all that time then he suddenly changed and was anxious to have justice for poor joan himself why had he become grateful at last had remorse attacked his hard heart no he had a better reasona better one for his sort of man this better reason was that now that the english had been finally expelled from the country they were beginning to call attention to the fact that this king had gotten his crown by the hands of a person proven by the priests to have been in league with satan and burned for it by them as a sorceresstherefore of what value or authority was such a kingship as that of no value at all no nation could afford to allow such a king to remain on the throne  it was high time to stir now and the king did it that is how charles vii came to be smitten with anxiety to have justice done the memory of his benefactress  he appealed to the pope and the pope appointed a great commission of churchmen to examine into the facts of joans life and award judgment the commission sat at paris at domremy at rouen at orleans and at several other places and continued its work during several months it examined the records of joans trials it examined the bastard of orleans and the duke dalencon and daulon and pasquerel and courcelles and isambard de la pierre and manchon and me and many others whose names i have made familiar to you also they examined more than a hundred witnesses whose names are less familiar to youthe friends of joan in domremy vaucouleurs orleans and other places and a number of judges and other people who had assisted at the rouen trials the abjuration and the martyrdom and out of this exhaustive examination joans character and history came spotless and perfect and this verdict was placed upon record to remain forever  i was present upon most of these occasions and saw again many faces which i have not seen for a quarter of a century among them some wellbeloved facesthose of our generals and that of catherine boucher married alas and also among them certain other faces that filled me with bitternessthose of beaupere and courcelles and a number of their fellowfiends i saw haumette and little mengetteedging along toward fifty now and mothers of many children i saw noels father and the parents of the paladin and the sunflower  it was beautiful to hear the duke dalencon praise joans splendid capacities as a general and to hear the bastard indorse these praises with his eloquent tongue and then go on and tell how sweet and good joan was and how full of pluck and fire and impetuosity and mischief and mirthfulness and tenderness and compassion and everything that was pure and fine and noble and lovely he made her live again before me and wrung my heart  i have finished my story of joan of arc that wonderful child that sublime personality that spirit which in one regard has had no peer and will have nonethis its purity from all alloy of selfseeking selfinterest personal ambition in it no trace of these motives can be found search as you may and this cannot be said of any
