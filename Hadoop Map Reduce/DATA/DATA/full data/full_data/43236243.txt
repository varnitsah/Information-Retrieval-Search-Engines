of dreams     chapter 1  in the garret of green gables  thanks be im done with geometry learning or teaching it said anne shirley a trifle vindictively as she thumped a somewhat battered volume of euclid into a big chest of books banged the lid in triumph and sat down upon it looking at diana wright across the green gables garret with gray eyes that were like a morning sky  the garret was a shadowy suggestive delightful place as all garrets should be through the open window by which anne sat blew the sweet scented sunwarm air of the august afternoon outside poplar boughs rustled and tossed in the wind beyond them were the woods where lovers lane wound its enchanted path and the old apple orchard which still bore its rosy harvests munificently  and over all was a great mountain range of snowy clouds in the blue southern sky  through the other window was glimpsed a distant whitecapped blue seathe beautiful st lawrence gulf on which floats like a jewel abegweit whose softer sweeter indian name has long been forsaken for the more prosaic one of prince edward island  diana wright three years older than when we last saw her had grown somewhat matronly in the intervening time  but her eyes were as black and brilliant her cheeks as rosy and her dimples as enchanting as in the longago days when she and anne shirley had vowed eternal friendship in the garden at orchard slope  in her arms she held a small sleeping blackcurled creature who for two happy years had been known to the world of avonlea as small anne cordelia  avonlea folks knew why diana had called her anne of course but avonlea folks were puzzled by the cordelia  there had never been a cordelia in the wright or barry connections  mrs harmon andrews said she supposed diana had found the name in some trashy novel and wondered that fred hadnt more sense than to allow it  but diana and anne smiled at each other  they knew how small anne cordelia had come by her name  you always hated geometry said diana with a retrospective smile  i should think youd be real glad to be through with teaching anyhow  oh ive always liked teaching apart from geometry  these past three years in summerside have been very pleasant ones mrs harmon andrews told me when i came home that i wouldnt likely find married life as much better than teaching as i expected  evidently mrs harmon is of hamlets opinion that it may be better to bear the ills that we have than fly to others that we know not of  annes laugh as blithe and irresistible as of yore with an added note of sweetness and maturity rang through the garret  marilla in the kitchen below compounding blue plum preserve heard it and smiled then sighed to think how seldom that dear laugh would echo through green gables in the years to come  nothing in her life had ever given marilla so much happiness as the knowledge that anne was going to marry gilbert blythe but every joy must bring with it its little shadow of sorrow  during the three summerside years anne had been home often for vacations and weekends but after this a biannual visit would be as much as could be hoped for  you neednt let what mrs harmon says worry you said diana with the calm assurance of the fouryears matron  married life has its ups and downs of course  you mustnt expect that everything will always go smoothly  but i can assure you anne that its a happy life when youre married to the right man  anne smothered a smile  dianas airs of vast experience always amused her a little  i daresay ill be putting them on too when ive been married four years she thought  surely my sense of humor will preserve me from it though  is it settled yet where you are going to live asked diana cuddling small anne cordelia with the inimitable gesture of motherhood which always sent through annes heart filled with sweet unuttered dreams and hopes a thrill that was half pure pleasure and half a strange ethereal pain  yes that was what i wanted to tell you when i phoned to you to come down today  by the way i cant realize that we really have telephones in avonlea now  it sounds so preposterously uptodate and modernish for this darling leisurely old place  we can thank the a v i s for them said diana  we should never have got the line if they hadnt taken the matter up and carried it through  there was enough cold water thrown to discourage any society but they stuck to it nevertheless  you did a splendid thing for avonlea when you founded that society anne  what fun we did have at our meetings  will you ever forget the blue hall and judson parkers scheme for painting medicine advertisements on his fence  i dont know that im wholly grateful to the a v i  s in the matter of the telephone said anne  oh i know its most convenienteven more so than our old device of signalling to each other by flashes of candlelight  and as mrs rachel says avonlea must keep up with the procession thats what  but somehow i feel as if i didnt want avonlea spoiled by what mr harrison when he wants to be witty calls modern inconveniences  i should like to have it kept always just as it was in the dear old years thats foolishand sentimentaland impossible  so i shall immediately become wise and practical and possible  the telephone as mr harrison concedes is a buster of a good thingeven if you do know that probably half a dozen interested people are listening along the line  thats the worst of it sighed diana  its so annoying to hear the receivers going down whenever you ring anyone up  they say mrs harmon andrews insisted that their phone should be put in their kitchen just so that she could listen whenever it rang and keep an eye on the dinner at the same time  today when you called me i distinctly heard that queer clock of the pyes striking  so no doubt josie or gertie was listening  oh so that is why you said youve got a new clock at green gables havent you  i couldnt imagine what you meant  i heard a vicious click as soon as you had spoken  i suppose it was the pye receiver being hung up with profane energy  well never mind the pyes  as mrs rachel says pyes they always were and pyes they always will be world without end amen  i want to talk of pleasanter things  its all settled as to where my new home shall be  oh anne where  i do hope its near here  nooo thats the drawback gilbert is going to settle at four winds harborsixty miles from here  sixty  it might as well be six hundred sighed diana  i never can get further from home now than charlottetown  youll have to come to four winds its the most beautiful harbor on the island  theres a little village called glen st mary at its head and dr david blythe has been practicing there for fifty years  he is gilberts greatuncle you know  he is going to retire and gilbert is to take over his practice  dr blythe is going to keep his house though so we shall have to find a habitation for ourselves  i dont know yet what it is or where it will be in reality but i have a little house odreams all furnished in my imaginationa tiny delightful castle in spain  where are you going for your wedding tour asked diana  nowhere  dont look horrified diana dearest  you suggest mrs harmon andrews  she no doubt will remark condescendingly that people who cant afford wedding towers are real sensible not to take them and then shell remind me that jane went to europe for hers  i want to spend my honeymoon at four winds in my own dear house of dreams  and youve decided not to have any bridesmaid  there isnt any one to have  you and phil and priscilla and jane all stole a march on me in the matter of marriage and stella is teaching in vancouver  i have no other kindred soul and i wont have a bridesmaid who isnt  but you are going to wear a veil arent you asked diana anxiously  yes indeedy  i shouldnt feel like a bride without one  i remember telling matthew that evening when he brought me to green gables that i never expected to be a bride because i was so homely no one would ever want to marry meunless some foreign missionary did  i had an idea then that foreign missionaries couldnt afford to be finicky in the matter of looks if they wanted a girl to risk her life among cannibals  you should have seen the foreign missionary priscilla married  he was as handsome and inscrutable as those daydreams we once planned to marry ourselves diana he was the best dressed man i ever met and he raved over priscillas ethereal golden beauty  but of course there are no cannibals in japan  your wedding dress is a dream anyhow sighed diana rapturously youll look like a perfect queen in ityoure so tall and slender how do you keep so slim anne  im fatter than everill soon have no waist at all  stoutness and slimness seem to be matters of predestination said anne  at all events mrs harmon andrews cant say to you what she said to me when i came home from summerside well anne youre just about as skinny as ever  it sounds quite romantic to be slender but skinny has a very different tang  mrs harmon has been talking about your trousseau  she admits its as nice as janes although she says jane married a millionaire and you are only marrying a poor young doctor without a cent to his name  anne laughed  my dresses are nice  i love pretty things  i remember the first pretty dress i ever hadthe brown gloria matthew gave me for our school concert  before that everything i had was so ugly  it seemed to me that i stepped into a new world that night  that was the night gilbert recited bingen on the rhine and looked at you when he said theres another not a sister  and you were so furious because he put your pink tissue rose in his breast pocket  you didnt much imagine then that you would ever marry him  oh well thats another instance of predestination laughed anne as they went down the garret stairs    chapter 2  the house of dreams  there was more excitement in the air of green gables than there had ever been before in all its history  even marilla was so excited that she couldnt help showing itwhich was little short of being phenomenal  theres never been a wedding in this house she said half apologetically to mrs rachel lynde  when i was a child i heard an old minister say that a house was not a real home until it had been consecrated by a birth a wedding and a death  weve had deaths heremy father and mother died here as well as matthew and weve even had a birth here  long ago just after we moved into this house we had a married hired man for a little while and his wife had a baby here  but theres never been a wedding before  it does seem so strange to think of anne being married  in a way she just seems to me the little girl matthew brought home here fourteen years ago  i cant realize that shes grown up  i shall never forget what i felt when i saw matthew bringing in a girl  i wonder what became of the boy we would have got if there hadnt been a mistake  i wonder what his fate was  well it was a fortunate mistake said mrs rachel lynde though mind you there was a time i didnt think sothat evening i came up to see anne and she treated us to such a scene  many things have changed since then thats what  mrs rachel sighed and then brisked up again  when weddings were in order mrs rachel was ready to let the dead past bury its dead  im going to give anne two of my cotton warp spreads she resumed a tobaccostripe one and an appleleaf one  she tells me theyre getting to be real fashionable again  well fashion or no fashion i dont believe theres anything prettier for a spareroom bed than a nice appleleaf spread thats what  i must see about getting them bleached  ive had them sewed up in cotton bags ever since thomas died and no doubt theyre an awful color  but theres a month yet and dewbleaching will work wonders  only a month  marilla sighed and then said proudly  im giving anne that half dozen braided rugs i have in the garret i never supposed shed want themtheyre so oldfashioned and nobody seems to want anything but hooked mats now  but she asked me for themsaid shed rather have them than anything else for her floors they are pretty  i made them of the nicest rags and braided them in stripes  it was such company these last few winters  and ill make her enough blue plum preserve to stock her jam closet for a year  it seems real strange  those blue plum trees hadnt even a blossom for three years and i thought they might as well be cut down  and this last spring they were white and such a crop of plums i never remember at green gables  well thank goodness that anne and gilbert really are going to be married after all  its what ive always prayed for said mrs rachel in the tone of one who is comfortably sure that her prayers have availed much  it was a great relief to find out that she really didnt mean to take the kingsport man  he was rich to be sure and gilbert is poorat least to begin with but then hes an island boy  hes gilbert blythe said marilla contentedly  marilla would have died the death before she would have put into words the thought that was always in the background of her mind whenever she had looked at gilbert from his childhood upthe thought that had it not been for her own wilful pride long long ago he might have been her son marilla felt that in some strange way his marriage with anne would put right that old mistake  good had come out of the evil of the ancient bitterness  as for anne herself she was so happy that she almost felt frightened the gods so says the old superstition do not like to behold too happy mortals  it is certain at least that some human beings do not  two of that ilk descended upon anne one violet dusk and proceeded to do what in them lay to prick the rainbow bubble of her satisfaction  if she thought she was getting any particular prize in young dr blythe or if she imagined that he was still as infatuated with her as he might have been in his salad days it was surely their duty to put the matter before her in another light  yet these two worthy ladies were not enemies of anne on the contrary they were really quite fond of her and would have defended her as their own young had anyone else attacked her  human nature is not obliged to be consistent  mrs inglisnee jane andrews to quote from the daily enterprisecame with her mother and mrs jasper bell  but in jane the milk of human kindness had not been curdled by years of matrimonial bickerings  her lines had fallen in pleasant places  in spite of the factas mrs rachel lynde would saythat she had married a millionaire her marriage had been happy  wealth had not spoiled her  she was still the placid amiable pinkcheeked jane of the old quartette sympathising with her old chums happiness and as keenly interested in all the dainty details of annes trousseau as if it could rival her own silken and bejewelled splendors  jane was not brilliant and had probably never made a remark worth listening to in her life but she never said anything that would hurt anyones feelingswhich may be a negative talent but is likewise a rare and enviable one  so gilbert didnt go back on you after all said mrs harmon andrews contriving to convey an expression of surprise in her tone  well the blythes generally keep their word when theyve once passed it no matter what happens  let me seeyoure twentyfive arent you anne when i was a girl twentyfive was the first corner  but you look quite young  redheaded people always do  red hair is very fashionable now said anne trying to smile but speaking rather coldly  life had developed in her a sense of humor which helped her over many difficulties but as yet nothing had availed to steel her against a reference to her hair  so it isso it is conceded mrs harmon  theres no telling what queer freaks fashion will take  well anne your things are very pretty and very suitable to your position in life arent they jane i hope youll be very happy  you have my best wishes im sure  a long engagement doesnt often turn out well  but of course in your case it couldnt be helped  gilbert looks very young for a doctor  im afraid people wont have much confidence in him said mrs jasper bell gloomily  then she shut her mouth tightly as if she had said what she considered it her duty to say and held her conscience clear  she belonged to the type which always has a stringy black feather in its hat and straggling locks of hair on its neck  annes surface pleasure in her pretty bridal things was temporarily shadowed but the deeps of happiness below could not thus be disturbed and the little stings of mesdames bell and andrews were forgotten when gilbert came later and they wandered down to the birches of the brook which had been saplings when anne had come to green gables but were now tall ivory columns in a fairy palace of twilight and stars  in their shadows anne and gilbert talked in loverfashion of their new home and their new life together  ive found a nest for us anne  oh where  not right in the village i hope  i wouldnt like that altogether  no  there was no house to be had in the village  this is a little white house on the harbor shore half way between glen st mary and four winds point  its a little out of the way but when we get a phone in that wont matter so much  the situation is beautiful  it looks to the sunset and has the great blue harbor before it  the sanddunes arent very far awaythe sea winds blow over them and the sea spray drenches them  but the house itself gilbertour first home  what is it like  not very large but large enough for us  theres a splendid living room with a fireplace in it downstairs and a dining room that looks out on the harbor and a little room that will do for my office  it is about sixty years oldthe oldest house in four winds  but it has been kept in pretty good repair and was all done over about fifteen years agoshingled plastered and refloored  it was well built to begin with  i understand that there was some romantic story connected with its building but the man i rented it from didnt know it  he said captain jim was the only one who could spin that old yarn now  who is captain jim  the keeper of the lighthouse on four winds point  youll love that four winds light anne  its a revolving one and it flashes like a magnificent star through the twilights  we can see it from our living room windows and our front door  who owns the house  well its the property of the glen st mary presbyterian church now and i rented it from the trustees  but it belonged until lately to a very old lady miss elizabeth russell  she died last spring and as she had no near relatives she left her property to the glen st mary church  her furniture is still in the house and i bought most of itfor a mere song you might say because it was all so oldfashioned that the trustees despaired of selling it  glen st mary folks prefer plush brocade and sideboards with mirrors and ornamentations i fancy but miss russells furniture is very good and i feel sure youll like it anne  so far good said anne nodding cautious approval  but gilbert people cannot live by furniture alone  you havent yet mentioned one very important thing  are there trees about this house  heaps of them oh dryad  there is a big grove of fir trees behind it two rows of lombardy poplars down the lane and a ring of white birches around a very delightful garden  our front door opens right into the garden but there is another entrancea little gate hung between two firs  the hinges are on one trunk and the catch on the other  their boughs form an arch overhead  oh im so glad  i couldnt live where there were no treessomething vital in me would starve  well after that theres no use asking you if theres a brook anywhere near  that would be expecting too much  but there is a brookand it actually cuts across one corner of the garden  then said anne with a long sigh of supreme satisfaction this house you have found is my house of dreams and none other    chapter 3  the land of dreams among  have you made up your mind who youre going to have to the wedding anne asked mrs rachel lynde as she hemstitched table napkins industriously  its time your invitations were sent even if they are to be only informal ones  i dont mean to have very many said anne  we just want those we love best to see us married  gilberts people and mr and mrs allan and mr and mrs harrison  there was a time when youd hardly have numbered mr harrison among your dearest friends said marilla drily  well i wasnt very strongly attracted to him at our first meeting acknowledged anne with a laugh over the recollection  but mr harrison has improved on acquaintance and mrs harrison is really a dear  then of course there are miss lavendar and paul  have they decided to come to the island this summer  i thought they were going to europe  they changed their minds when i wrote them i was going to be married i had a letter from paul today  he says he must come to my wedding no matter what happens to europe  that child always idolised you remarked mrs rachel  that child is a young man of nineteen now mrs lynde  how time does fly was mrs lyndes brilliant and original response  charlotta the fourth may come with them  she sent word by paul that she would come if her husband would let her  i wonder if she still wears those enormous blue bows and whether her husband calls her charlotta or leonora  i should love to have charlotta at my wedding charlotta and i were at a wedding long syne  they expect to be at echo lodge next week  then there are phil and the reverend jo  it sounds awful to hear you speaking of a minister like that anne said mrs rachel severely  his wife calls him that  she should have more respect for his holy office then retorted mrs rachel  ive heard you criticise ministers pretty sharply yourself teased anne  yes but i do it reverently protested mrs lynde  you never heard me nickname a minister  anne smothered a smile  well there are diana and fred and little fred and small anne cordeliaand jane andrews  i wish i could have miss stacey and aunt jamesina and priscilla and stella  but stella is in vancouver and pris is in japan and miss stacey is married in california and aunt jamesina has gone to india to explore her daughters mission field in spite of her horror of snakes  its really dreadfulthe way people get scattered over the globe  the lord never intended it thats what said mrs rachel authoritatively  in my young days people grew up and married and settled down where they were born or pretty near it  thank goodness youve stuck to the island anne  i was afraid gilbert would insist on rushing off to the ends of the earth when he got through college and dragging you with him  if everybody stayed where he was born places would soon be filled up mrs lynde  oh im not going to argue with you anne  i am not a ba  what time of the day is the ceremony to be  we have decided on noonhigh noon as the society reporters say that will give us time to catch the evening train to glen st mary  and youll be married in the parlor  nonot unless it rains  we mean to be married in the orchardwith the blue sky over us and the sunshine around us  do you know when and where id like to be married if i could  it would be at dawna june dawn with a glorious sunrise and roses blooming in the gardens and i would slip down and meet gilbert and we would go together to the heart of the beech woodsand there under the green arches that would be like a splendid cathedral we would be married  marilla sniffed scornfully and mrs lynde looked shocked  but that would be terrible queer anne  why it wouldnt really seem legal  and what would mrs harmon andrews say  ah theres the rub sighed anne  there are so many things in life we cannot do because of the fear of what mrs harmon andrews would say tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true  what delightful things we might do were it not for mrs harmon andrews  by times anne i dont feel quite sure that i understand you altogether complained mrs lynde  anne was always romantic you know said marilla apologetically  well married life will most likely cure her of that mrs rachel responded comfortingly  anne laughed and slipped away to lovers lane where gilbert found her and neither of them seemed to entertain much fear or hope that their married life would cure them of romance  the echo lodge people came over the next week and green gables buzzed with the delight of them  miss lavendar had changed so little that the three years since her last island visit might have been a watch in the night but anne gasped with amazement over paul  could this splendid six feet of manhood be the little paul of avonlea schooldays  you really make me feel old paul said anne  why i have to look up to you  youll never grow old teacher said paul  you are one of the fortunate mortals who have found and drunk from the fountain of youthyou and mother lavendar  see here  when youre married i wont call you mrs blythe  to me youll always be teacherthe teacher of the best lessons i ever learned  i want to show you something  the something was a pocketbook full of poems  paul had put some of his beautiful fancies into verse and magazine editors had not been as unappreciative as they are sometimes supposed to be  anne read pauls poems with real delight  they were full of charm and promise  youll be famous yet paul  i always dreamed of having one famous pupil  he was to be a college presidentbut a great poet would be even better  some day ill be able to boast that i whipped the distinguished paul irving  but then i never did whip you did i paul what an opportunity lost  i think i kept you in at recess however  you may be famous yourself teacher  ive seen a good deal of your work these last three years  no  i know what i can do  i can write pretty fanciful little sketches that children love and editors send welcome cheques for  but i can do nothing big  my only chance for earthly immortality is a corner in your memoirs  charlotta the fourth had discarded the blue bows but her freckles were not noticeably less  i never did think id come down to marrying a yankee miss shirley maam she said  but you never know whats before you and it isnt his fault  he was born that way  youre a yankee yourself charlotta since youve married one  miss shirley maam im not  and i wouldnt be if i was to marry a dozen yankees  toms kind of nice  and besides i thought id better not be too hard to please for i mightnt get another chance  tom dont drink and he dont growl because he has to work between meals and when alls said and done im satisfied miss shirley maam  does he call you leonora asked anne  goodness no miss shirley maam  i wouldnt know who he meant if he did  of course when we got married he had to say i take thee leonora and i declare to you miss shirley maam ive had the most dreadful feeling ever since that it wasnt me he was talking to and i havent been rightly married at all  and so youre going to be married yourself miss shirley maam  i always thought id like to marry a doctor  it would be so handy when the children had measles and croup tom is only a bricklayer but hes real goodtempered  when i said to him says i tom can i go to miss shirleys wedding  i mean to go anyhow but id like to have your consent he just says suit yourself charlotta and youll suit me  thats a real pleasant kind of husband to have miss shirley maam  philippa and her reverend jo arrived at green gables the day before the wedding  anne and phil had a rapturous meeting which presently simmered down to a cosy confidential chat over all that had been and was about to be  queen anne youre as queenly as ever  ive got fearfully thin since the babies came  im not half so goodlooking but i think jo likes it  theres not such a contrast between us you see  and oh its perfectly magnificent that youre going to marry gilbert  roy gardner wouldnt have done at all at all  i can see that now though i was horribly disappointed at the time  you know anne you did treat roy very badly  he has recovered i understand smiled anne  oh yes  he is married and his wife is a sweet little thing and theyre perfectly happy  everything works together for good  jo and the bible say that and they are pretty good authorities  are alec and alonzo married yet  alec is but alonzo isnt  how those dear old days at pattys place come back when im talking to you anne  what fun we had  have you been to pattys place lately  oh yes i go often  miss patty and miss maria still sit by the fireplace and knit  and that reminds meweve brought you a wedding gift from them anne  guess what it is  i never could  how did they know i was going to be married  oh i told them  i was there last week  and they were so interested two days ago miss patty wrote me a note asking me to call and then she asked if i would take her gift to you  what would you wish most from pattys place anne  you cant mean that miss patty has sent me her china dogs  go up head  theyre in my trunk this very moment  and ive a letter for you  wait a moment and ill get it  dear miss shirley miss patty had written maria and i were very much interested in hearing of your approaching nuptials  we send you our best wishes  maria and i have never married but we have no objection to other people doing so  we are sending you the china dogs i intended to leave them to you in my will because you seemed to have sincere affection for them  but maria and i expect to live a good while yet dv so i have decided to give you the dogs while you are young  you will not have forgotten that gog looks to the right and magog to the left  just fancy those lovely old dogs sitting by the fireplace in my house of dreams said anne rapturously  i never expected anything so delightful  that evening green gables hummed with preparations for the following day but in the twilight anne slipped away  she had a little pilgrimage to make on this last day of her girlhood and she must make it alone  she went to matthews grave in the little poplarshaded avonlea graveyard and there kept a silent tryst with old memories and immortal loves  how glad matthew would be tomorrow if he were here she whispered but i believe he does know and is glad of itsomewhere else  ive read somewhere that our dead are never dead until we have forgotten them matthew will never be dead to me for i can never forget him  she left on his grave the flowers she had brought and walked slowly down the long hill  it was a gracious evening full of delectable lights and shadows  in the west was a sky of mackerel cloudscrimson and ambertinted with long strips of applegreen sky between  beyond was the glimmering radiance of a sunset sea and the ceaseless voice of many waters came up from the tawny shore  all around her lying in the fine beautiful country silence were the hills and fields and woods she had known and loved so long  history repeats itself said gilbert joining her as she passed the blythe gate  do you remember our first walk down this hill anneour first walk together anywhere for that matter  i was coming home in the twilight from matthews graveand you came out of the gate and i swallowed the pride of years and spoke to you  and all heaven opened before me supplemented gilbert  from that moment i looked forward to tomorrow  when i left you at your gate that night and walked home i was the happiest boy in the world  anne had forgiven me  i think you had the most to forgive  i was an ungrateful little wretchand after you had really saved my life that day on the pond too  how i loathed that load of obligation at first  i dont deserve the happiness that has come to me  gilbert laughed and clasped tighter the girlish hand that wore his ring  annes engagement ring was a circlet of pearls  she had refused to wear a diamond  ive never really liked diamonds since i found out they werent the lovely purple i had dreamed  they will always suggest my old disappointment  but pearls are for tears the old legend says gilbert had objected  im not afraid of that  and tears can be happy as well as sad  my very happiest moments have been when i had tears in my eyeswhen marilla told me i might stay at green gableswhen matthew gave me the first pretty dress i ever hadwhen i heard that you were going to recover from the fever  so give me pearls for our troth ring gilbert and ill willingly accept the sorrow of life with its joy  but tonight our lovers thought only of joy and never of sorrow  for the morrow was their wedding day and their house of dreams awaited them on the misty purple shore of four winds harbor    chapter 4  the first bride of green gables  anne wakened on the morning of her wedding day to find the sunshine winking in at the window of the little porch gable and a september breeze frolicking with her curtains  im so glad the sun will shine on me she thought happily  she recalled the first morning she had wakened in that little porch room when the sunshine had crept in on her through the blossomdrift of the old snow queen  that had not been a happy wakening for it brought with it the bitter disappointment of the preceding night  but since then the little room had been endeared and consecrated by years of happy childhood dreams and maiden visions  to it she had come back joyfully after all her absences at its window she had knelt through that night of bitter agony when she believed gilbert dying and by it she had sat in speechless happiness the night of her betrothal  many vigils of joy and some of sorrow had been kept there and today she must leave it forever  henceforth it would be hers no more fifteenyearold dora was to inherit it when she had gone  nor did anne wish it otherwise the little room was sacred to youth and girlhoodto the past that was to close today before the chapter of wifehood opened  green gables was a busy and joyous house that forenoon  diana arrived early with little fred and small anne cordelia to lend a hand  davy and dora the green gables twins whisked the babies off to the garden  dont let small anne cordelia spoil her clothes warned diana anxiously  you neednt be afraid to trust her with dora said marilla  that child is more sensible and careful than most of the mothers ive known shes really a wonder in some ways  not much like that other harumscarum i brought up  marilla smiled across her chicken salad at anne  it might even be suspected that she liked the harumscarum best after all  those twins are real nice children said mrs rachel when she was sure they were out of earshot  dora is so womanly and helpful and davy is developing into a very smart boy  he isnt the holy terror for mischief he used to be  i never was so distracted in my life as i was the first six months he was here acknowledged marilla  after that i suppose i got used to him  hes taken a great notion to farming lately and wants me to let him try running the farm next year  i may for mr barry doesnt think hell want to rent it much longer and some new arrangement will have to be made  well you certainly have a lovely day for your wedding anne said diana as she slipped a voluminous apron over her silken array  you couldnt have had a finer one if youd ordered it from eatons  indeed theres too much money going out of this island to that same eatons said mrs lynde indignantly  she had strong views on the subject of octopuslike department stores and never lost an opportunity of airing them  and as for those catalogues of theirs theyre the avonlea girls bible now thats what  they pore over them on sundays instead of studying the holy scriptures  well theyre splendid to amuse children with said diana  fred and small anne look at the pictures by the hour  i amused ten children without the aid of eatons catalogue said mrs rachel severely  come you two dont quarrel over eatons catalogue said anne gaily this is my day of days you know  im so happy i want every one else to be happy too  im sure i hope your happiness will last child sighed mrs rachel she did hope it truly and believed it but she was afraid it was in the nature of a challenge to providence to flaunt your happiness too openly  anne for her own good must be toned down a trifle  but it was a happy and beautiful bride who came down the old homespuncarpeted stairs that september noonthe first bride of green gables slender and shiningeyed in the mist of her maiden veil with her arms full of roses  gilbert waiting for her in the hall below looked up at her with adoring eyes  she was his at last this evasive longsought anne won after years of patient waiting  it was to him she was coming in the sweet surrender of the bride  was he worthy of her  could he make her as happy as he hoped  if he failed herif he could not measure up to her standard of manhoodthen as she held out her hand their eyes met and all doubt was swept away in a glad certainty  they belonged to each other and no matter what life might hold for them it could never alter that  their happiness was in each others keeping and both were unafraid  they were married in the sunshine of the old orchard circled by the loving and kindly faces of longfamiliar friends  mr allan married them and the reverend jo made what mrs rachel lynde afterwards pronounced to be the most beautiful wedding prayer she had ever heard  birds do not often sing in september but one sang sweetly from some hidden bough while gilbert and anne repeated their deathless vows anne heard it and thrilled to it gilbert heard it and wondered only that all the birds in the world had not burst into jubilant song paul heard it and later wrote a lyric about it which was one of the most admired in his first volume of verse charlotta the fourth heard it and was blissfully sure it meant good luck for her adored miss shirley the bird sang until the ceremony was ended and then it wound up with one mad little glad little trill  never had the old graygreen house among its enfolding orchards known a blither merrier afternoon  all the old jests and quips that must have done duty at weddings since eden were served up and seemed as new and brilliant and mirthprovoking as if they had never been uttered before  laughter and joy had their way and when anne and gilbert left to catch the carmody train with paul as driver the twins were ready with rice and old shoes in the throwing of which charlotta the fourth and mr harrison bore a valiant part marilla stood at the gate and watched the carriage out of sight down the long lane with its banks of goldenrod  anne turned at its end to wave her last goodbye  she was gonegreen gables was her home no more marillas face looked very gray and old as she turned to the house which anne had filled for fourteen years and even in her absence with light and life  but diana and her small fry the echo lodge people and the allans had stayed to help the two old ladies over the loneliness of the first evening and they contrived to have a quietly pleasant little supper time sitting long around the table and chatting over all the details of the day  while they were sitting there anne and gilbert were alighting from the train at glen st mary    chapter 5  the home coming  dr david blythe had sent his horse and buggy to meet them and the urchin who had brought it slipped away with a sympathetic grin leaving them to the delight of driving alone to their new home through the radiant evening  anne never forgot the loveliness of the view that broke upon them when they had driven over the hill behind the village  her new home could not yet be seen but before her lay four winds harbor like a great shining mirror of rose and silver  far down she saw its entrance between the bar of sand dunes on one side and a steep high grim red sandstone cliff on the other  beyond the bar the sea calm and austere dreamed in the afterlight  the little fishing village nestled in the cove where the sanddunes met the harbor shore looked like a great opal in the haze  the sky over them was like a jewelled cup from which the dusk was pouring the air was crisp with the compelling tang of the sea and the whole landscape was infused with the subtleties of a sea evening  a few dim sails drifted along the darkening firclad harbor shores  a bell was ringing from the tower of a little white church on the far side mellowly and dreamily sweet the chime floated across the water blent with the moan of the sea  the great revolving light on the cliff at the channel flashed warm and golden against the clear northern sky a trembling quivering star of good hope  far out along the horizon was the crinkled gray ribbon of a passing steamers smoke  oh beautiful beautiful murmured anne  i shall love four winds gilbert  where is our house  we cant see it yetthe belt of birch running up from that little cove hides it  its about two miles from glen st mary and theres another mile between it and the lighthouse  we wont have many neighbors anne  theres only one house near us and i dont know who lives in it  shall you be lonely when im away  not with that light and that loveliness for company  who lives in that house gilbert  i dont know  it doesnt lookexactlyas if the occupants would be kindred spirits anne does it  the house was a large substantial affair painted such a vivid green that the landscape seemed quite faded by contrast  there was an orchard behind it and a nicely kept lawn before it but somehow there was a certain bareness about it  perhaps its neatness was responsible for this the whole establishment house barns orchard garden lawn and lane was so starkly neat  it doesnt seem probable that anyone with that taste in paint could be very kindred acknowledged anne unless it were an accidentlike our blue hall  i feel certain there are no children there at least  its even neater than the old copp place on the tory road and i never expected to see anything neater than that  they had not met anybody on the moist red road that wound along the harbor shore  but just before they came to the belt of birch which hid their home anne saw a girl who was driving a flock of snowwhite geese along the crest of a velvety green hill on the right  great scattered firs grew along it  between their trunks one saw glimpses of yellow harvest fields gleams of golden sandhills and bits of blue sea  the girl was tall and wore a dress of pale blue print  she walked with a certain springiness of step and erectness of bearing  she and her geese came out of the gate at the foot of the hill as anne and gilbert passed  she stood with her hand on the fastening of the gate and looked steadily at them with an expression that hardly attained to interest but did not descend to curiosity  it seemed to anne for a fleeting moment that there was even a veiled hint of hostility in it but it was the girls beauty which made anne give a little gaspa beauty so marked that it must have attracted attention anywhere  she was hatless but heavy braids of burnished hair the hue of ripe wheat were twisted about her head like a coronet her eyes were blue and starlike her figure in its plain print gown was magnificent and her lips were as crimson as the bunch of bloodred poppies she wore at her belt  gilbert who is the girl we have just passed asked anne in a low voice  i didnt notice any girl said gilbert who had eyes only for his bride  she was standing by that gateno dont look back  she is still watching us  i never saw such a beautiful face  i dont remember seeing any very handsome girls while i was here there are some pretty girls up at the glen but i hardly think they could be called beautiful  this girl is  you cant have seen her or you would remember her nobody could forget her  i never saw such a face except in pictures and her hair  it made me think of brownings cord of gold and gorgeous snake  probably shes some visitor in four windslikely some one from that big summer hotel over the harbor  she wore a white apron and she was driving geese  she might do that for amusement  look annetheres our house  anne looked and forgot for a time the girl with the splendid resentful eyes  the first glimpse of her new home was a delight to eye and spiritit looked so like a big creamy seashell stranded on the harbor shore  the rows of tall lombardy poplars down its lane stood out in stately purple silhouette against the sky  behind it sheltering its garden from the too keen breath of sea winds was a cloudy fir wood in which the winds might make all kinds of weird and haunting music  like all woods it seemed to be holding and enfolding secrets in its recessessecrets whose charm is only to be won by entering in and patiently seeking  outwardly dark green arms keep them inviolate from curious or indifferent eyes  the night winds were beginning their wild dances beyond the bar and the fishing hamlet across the harbor was gemmed with lights as anne and gilbert drove up the poplar lane  the door of the little house opened and a warm glow of firelight flickered out into the dusk  gilbert lifted anne from the buggy and led her into the garden through the little gate between the ruddytipped firs up the trim red path to the sandstone step  welcome home he whispered and hand in hand they stepped over the threshold of their house of dreams    chapter 6  captain jim  old doctor dave and mrs doctor dave had come down to the little house to greet the bride and groom  doctor dave was a big jolly whitewhiskered old fellow and mrs doctor was a trim rosycheeked silverhaired little lady who took anne at once to her heart literally and figuratively  im so glad to see you dear  you must be real tired  weve got a bite of supper ready and captain jim brought up some trout for you captain jimwhere are you  oh hes slipped out to see to the horse i suppose  come upstairs and take your things off  anne looked about her with bright appreciative eyes as she followed mrs doctor dave upstairs  she liked the appearance of her new home very much  it seemed to have the atmosphere of green gables and the flavor of her old traditions  i think i would have found miss elizabeth russell a kindred spirit she murmured when she was alone in her room  there were two windows in it the dormer one looked out on the lower harbor and the sandbar and the four winds light      a magic casement opening on the foam     of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn  quoted anne softly  the gable window gave a view of a little harvesthued valley through which a brook ran  half a mile up the brook was the only house in sightan old rambling gray one surrounded by huge willows through which its windows peered like shy seeking eyes into the dusk  anne wondered who lived there they would be her nearest neighbors and she hoped they would be nice  she suddenly found herself thinking of the beautiful girl with the white geese  gilbert thought she didnt belong here mused anne but i feel sure she does  there was something about her that made her part of the sea and the sky and the harbor  four winds is in her blood  when anne went downstairs gilbert was standing before the fireplace talking to a stranger  both turned as anne entered  anne this is captain boyd  captain boyd my wife  it was the first time gilbert had said my wife to anybody but anne and he narrowly escaped bursting with the pride of it  the old captain held out a sinewy hand to anne they smiled at each other and were friends from that moment  kindred spirit flashed recognition to kindred spirit  im right down pleased to meet you mistress blythe and i hope youll be as happy as the first bride was who came here  i cant wish you no better than that  but your husband doesnt introduce me jest exactly right  captain jim is my weekaday name and you might as well begin as youre sartain to end upcalling me that  you sartainly are a nice little bride mistress blythe  looking at you sorter makes me feel that ive jest been married myself  amid the laughter that followed mrs doctor dave urged captain jim to stay and have supper with them  thank you kindly  twill be a real treat mistress doctor  i mostly has to eat my meals alone with the reflection of my ugly old phiz in a lookingglass opposite for company  tisnt often i have a chance to sit down with two such sweet purty ladies  captain jims compliments may look very bald on paper but he paid them with such a gracious gentle deference of tone and look that the woman upon whom they were bestowed felt that she was being offered a queens tribute in a kingly fashion  captain jim was a highsouled simpleminded old man with eternal youth in his eyes and heart  he had a tall rather ungainly figure somewhat stooped yet suggestive of great strength and endurance a cleanshaven face deeply lined and bronzed a thick mane of irongray hair falling quite to his shoulders and a pair of remarkably blue deepset eyes which sometimes twinkled and sometimes dreamed and sometimes looked out seaward with a wistful quest in them as of one seeking something precious and lost  anne was to learn one day what it was for which captain jim looked  it could not be denied that captain jim was a homely man  his spare jaws rugged mouth and square brow were not fashioned on the lines of beauty and he had passed through many hardships and sorrows which had marked his body as well as his soul but though at first sight anne thought him plain she never thought anything more about itthe spirit shining through that rugged tenement beautified it so wholly  they gathered gaily around the supper table  the hearth fire banished the chill of the september evening but the window of the dining room was open and sea breezes entered at their own sweet will  the view was magnificent taking in the harbor and the sweep of low purple hills beyond  the table was heaped with mrs doctors delicacies but the piece de resistance was undoubtedly the big platter of sea trout  thought theyd be sorter tasty after travelling said captain jim theyre fresh as trout can be mistress blythe  two hours ago they were swimming in the glen pond  who is attending to the light tonight captain jim asked doctor dave  nephew alec  he understands it as well as i do  well now im real glad you asked me to stay to supper  im proper hungrydidnt have much of a dinner today  i believe you half starve yourself most of the time down at that light said mrs doctor dave severely  you wont take the trouble to get up a decent meal  oh i do mistress doctor i do protested captain jim  why i live like a king genrally  last night i was up to the glen and took home two pounds of steak  i meant to have a spanking good dinner today  and what happened to the steak asked mrs doctor dave  did you lose it on the way home  no  captain jim looked sheepish  just at bedtime a poor ornery sort of dog came along and asked for a nights lodging  guess he belonged to some of the fishermen long shore  i couldnt turn the poor cur outhe had a sore foot  so i shut him in the porch with an old bag to lie on and went to bed  but somehow i couldnt sleep come to think it over i sorter remembered that the dog looked hungry  and you got up and gave him that steakall that steak said mrs doctor dave with a kind of triumphant reproof  well there wasnt anything else to give him said captain jim deprecatingly  nothing a dogd care for that is  i reckon he was hungry for he made about two bites of it  i had a fine sleep the rest of the night but my dinner had to be sorter scantypotatoes and point as you might say  the dog he lit out for home this morning  i reckon he werent a vegetarian  the idea of starving yourself for a worthless dog sniffed mrs doctor  you dont know but he may be worth a lot to somebody protested captain jim  he didnt look of much account but you cant go by looks in jedging a dog  like meself he might be a real beauty inside the first mate didnt approve of him ill allow  his language was right down forcible but the first mate is prejudiced  no use in taking a cats opinion of a dog  tennyrate i lost my dinner so this nice spread in this deelightful company is real pleasant its a great thing to have good neighbors  who lives in the house among the willows up the brook asked anne  mrs dick moore said captain jimand her husband he added as if by way of an afterthought  anne smiled and deduced a mental picture of mrs dick moore from captain jims way of putting it evidently a second mrs rachel lynde  you havent many neighbors mistress blythe captain jim went on this side of the harbor is mighty thinly settled  most of the land belongs to mr howard up yander past the glen and he rents it out for pasture  the other side of the harbor now is thick with folksspecially macallisters  theres a whole colony of macallisters you cant throw a stone but you hit one  i was talking to old leon blacquiere the other day  hes been working on the harbor all summer deyre nearly all macallisters over thar he told me  dares neil macallister and sandy macallister and william macallister and alec macallister and angus macallisterand i believe dares de devil macallister  there are nearly as many elliotts and crawfords said doctor dave after the laughter had subsided  you know gilbert we folk on this side of four winds have an old sayingfrom the conceit of the elliotts the pride of the macallisters and the vainglory of the crawfords good lord deliver us  theres a plenty of fine people among them though said captain jim i sailed with william crawford for many a year and for courage and endurance and truth that man hadnt an equal  theyve got brains over on that side of four winds  mebbe thats why this side is sorter inclined to pick on em  strange aint it how folks seem to resent anyone being born a mite cleverer than they be  doctor dave who had a forty years feud with the overharbor people laughed and subsided  who lives in that brilliant emerald house about half a mile up the road asked gilbert  captain jim smiled delightedly  miss cornelia bryant  shell likely be over to see you soon seeing youre presbyterians  if you were methodists she wouldnt come at all cornelia has a holy horror of methodists  shes quite a character chuckled doctor dave  a most inveterate manhater  sour grapes queried gilbert laughing  no tisnt sour grapes answered captain jim seriously  cornelia could have had her pick when she was young  even yet shes only to say the word to see the old widowers jump  she jest seems to have been born with a sort of chronic spite agin men and methodists  shes got the bitterest tongue and the kindest heart in four winds  wherever theres any trouble that woman is there doing everything to help in the tenderest way  she never says a harsh word about another woman and if she likes to card us poor scalawags of men down i reckon our tough old hides can stand it  she always speaks well of you captain jim said mrs doctor  yes im afraid so  i dont half like it  it makes me feel as if there must be something sorter unnateral about me    chapter 7  the schoolmasters bride  who was the first bride who came to this house captain jim anne asked as they sat around the fireplace after supper  was she a part of the story ive heard was connected with this house asked gilbert  somebody told me you could tell it captain jim  well yes i know it  i reckon im the only person living in four winds now that can remember the schoolmasters bride as she was when she come to the island  shes been dead this thirty year but she was one of them women you never forget  tell us the story pleaded anne  i want to find out all about the women who have lived in this house before me  well theres jest been threeelizabeth russell and mrs ned russell and the schoolmasters bride  elizabeth russell was a nice clever little critter and mrs ned was a nice woman too  but they werent ever like the schoolmasters bride  the schoolmasters name was john selwyn  he came out from the old country to teach school at the glen when i was a boy of sixteen  he wasnt much like the usual run of derelicts who used to come out to pei to teach school in them days  most of them were clever drunken critters who taught the children the three rs when they were sober and lambasted them when they wasnt  but john selwyn was a fine handsome young fellow  he boarded at my fathers and he and me were cronies though he was ten years oldern me  we read and walked and talked a heap together  he knew about all the poetry that was ever written i reckon and he used to quote it to me along shore in the evenings  dad thought it an awful waste of time but he sorter endured it hoping itd put me off the notion of going to sea  well nothing could do thatmother come of a race of seagoing folk and it was born in me  but i loved to hear john read and recite  its almost sixty years ago but i could repeat yards of poetry i learned from him nearly sixty years  captain jim was silent for a space gazing into the glowing fire in a quest of the bygones  then with a sigh he resumed his story  i remember one spring evening i met him on the sandhills  he looked sorter upliftedjest like you did dr blythe when you brought mistress blythe in tonight  i thought of him the minute i seen you and he told me that he had a sweetheart back home and that she was coming out to him  i wasnt moren half pleased ornery young lump of selfishness that i was i thought he wouldnt be as much my friend after she came  but id enough decency not to let him see it  he told me all about her  her name was persis leigh and she would have come out with him if it hadnt been for her old uncle  he was sick and hed looked after her when her parents died and she wouldnt leave him and now he was dead and she was coming out to marry john selwyn twasnt no easy journey for a woman in them days  there werent no steamers you must ricollect  when do you expect her says i  she sails on the royal william the 20th of june says he and so she should be here by midjuly  i must set carpenter johnson to building me a home for her  her letter come today  i know before i opened it that it had good news for me  i saw her a few nights ago  i didnt understand him and then he explainedthough i didnt understand that much better  he said he had a giftor a curse  them was his words mistress blythea gift or a curse  he didnt know which it was  he said a greatgreatgrandmother of his had had it and they burned her for a witch on account of it  he said queer spellstrances i think was the name he give emcome over him now and again  are there such things doctor  there are people who are certainly subject to trances answered gilbert  the matter is more in the line of psychical research than medical  what were the trances of this john selwyn like  like dreams said the old doctor skeptically  he said he could see things in them said captain jim slowly  mind you im telling you jest what he saidthings that were happeningthings that were going to happen  he said they were sometimes a comfort to him and sometimes a horror  four nights before this hed been in onewent into it while he was sitting looking at the fire  and he saw an old room he knew well in england and persis leigh in it holding out her hands to him and looking glad and happy  so he knew he was going to hear good news of her  a dreama dream scoffed the old doctor  likelylikely conceded captain jim  thats what i said to him at the time  it was a vast more comfortable to think so  i didnt like the idea of him seeing things like thatit was real uncanny  no says he i didnt dream it  but we wont talk of this again you wont be so much my friend if you think much about it  i told him nothing could make me any less his friend  but he jest shook his head and says says he  lad i know  ive lost friends before because of this  i dont blame them  there are times when i feel hardly friendly to myself because of it  such a power has a bit of divinity in itwhether of a good or an evil divinity who shall say  and we mortals all shrink from too close contact with god or devil  them was his words  i remember them as if twas yesterday though i didnt know jest what he meant  what do you spose he did mean doctor  i doubt if he knew what he meant himself said doctor dave testily  i think i understand whispered anne  she was listening in her old attitude of clasped lips and shining eyes  captain jim treated himself to an admiring smile before he went on with his story  well purty soon all the glen and four winds people knew the schoolmasters bride was coming and they were all glad because they thought so much of him  and everybody took an interest in his new housethis house  he picked this site for it because you could see the harbor and hear the sea from it  he made the garden out there for his bride but he didnt plant the lombardies  mrs ned russell planted them  but theres a double row of rosebushes in the garden that the little girls who went to the glen school set out there for the schoolmasters bride  he said they were pink for her cheeks and white for her brow and red for her lips  hed quoted poetry so much that he sorter got into the habit of talking it too i reckon  almost everybody sent him some little present to help out the furnishing of the house  when the russells came into it they were welltodo and furnished it real handsome as you can see but the first furniture that went into it was plain enough  this little house was rich in love though  the women sent in quilts and tablecloths and towels and one man made a chest for her and another a table and so on  even blind old aunt margaret boyd wove a little basket for her out of the sweetscented sandhill grass  the schoolmasters wife used it for years to keep her handkerchiefs in  well at last everything was readyeven to the logs in the big fireplace ready for lighting  twasnt exactly this fireplace though twas in the same place  miss elizabeth had this put in when she made the house over fifteen years ago  it was a big oldfashioned fireplace where you could have roasted an ox  manys the time ive sat here and spun yarns sames im doing tonight  again there was a silence while captain jim kept a passing tryst with visitants anne and gilbert could not seethe folks who had sat with him around that fireplace in the vanished years with mirth and bridal joy shining in eyes long since closed forever under churchyard sod or heaving leagues of sea  here on olden nights children had tossed laughter lightly to and fro  here on winter evenings friends had gathered  dance and music and jest had been here  here youths and maidens had dreamed  for captain jim the little house was tenanted with shapes entreating remembrance  it was the first of july when the house was finished  the schoolmaster began to count the days then  we used to see him walking along the shore and wed say to each other shell soon be with him now  she was expected the middle of july but she didnt come then  nobody felt anxious  vessels were often delayed for days and mebbe weeks the royal william was a week overdueand then twoand then three and at last we began to be frightened and it got worse and worse finlly i couldnt bear to look into john selwyns eyes  dye know mistress blythecaptain jim lowered his voicei used to think that they looked just like what his old greatgreatgrandmothers must have been when they were burning her to death  he never said much but he taught school like a man in a dream and then hurried to the shore many a night he walked there from dark to dawn  people said he was losing his mind  everybody had given up hopethe royal william was eight weeks overdue  it was the middle of september and the schoolmasters bride hadnt comenever would come we thought  there was a big storm then that lasted three days and on the evening after it died away i went to the shore  i found the schoolmaster there leaning with his arms folded against a big rock gazing out to sea  i spoke to him but he didnt answer  his eyes seemed to be looking at something i couldnt see  his face was set like a dead mans  johnjohn i called outjest like thatjest like a frightened child wake upwake up  that strange awful look seemed to sorter fade out of his eyes  he turned his head and looked at me  ive never forgot his facenever will forget it till i ships for my last voyage  all is well lad he says  ive seen the royal william coming around east point  she will be here by dawn  tomorrow night i shall sit with my bride by my own hearthfire  do you think he did see it demanded captain jim abruptly  god knows said gilbert softly  great love and great pain might compass we know not what marvels  i am sure he did see it said anne earnestly  folderol said doctor dave but he spoke with less conviction than usual  because you know said captain jim solemnly the royal william came into four winds harbor at daylight the next morning  every soul in the glen and along the shore was at the old wharf to meet her  the schoolmaster had been watching there all night  how we cheered as she sailed up the channel  captain jims eyes were shining  they were looking at the four winds harbor of sixty years agone with a battered old ship sailing through the sunrise splendor  and persis leigh was on board asked anne  yesher and the captains wife  theyd had an awful passagestorm after stormand their provisions give out too  but there they were at last  when persis leigh stepped onto the old wharf john selwyn took her in his armsand folks stopped cheering and begun to cry  i cried myself though twas years mind you afore id admit it  aint it funny how ashamed boys are of tears  was persis leigh beautiful asked anne  well i dont know that youd call her beautiful exactlyidontknow said captain jim slowly  somehow you never got so far along as to wonder if she was handsome or not  it jest didnt matter  there was something so sweet and winsome about her that you had to love her that was all  but she was pleasant to look atbig clear hazel eyes and heaps of glossy brown hair and an english skin  john and her were married at our house that night at early candlelighting everybody from far and near was there to see it and we all brought them down here afterwards  mistress selwyn lighted the fire and we went away and left them sitting here jest as john had seen in that vision of his  a strange thinga strange thing  but ive seen a turrible lot of strange things in my time  captain jim shook his head sagely  its a dear story said anne feeling that for once she had got enough romance to satisfy her  how long did they live here  fifteen years  i ran off to sea soon after they were married like the young scalawag i was  but every time i come back from a voyage id head for here even before i went home and tell mistress selwyn all about it  fifteen happy years  they had a sort of talent for happiness them two  some folks are like that if youve noticed they couldnt be unhappy for long no matter what happened  they quarrelled once or twice for they was both highsperrited  but mistress selwyn says to me once says she laughing in that pretty way of hers i felt dreadful when john and i quarrelled but underneath it all i was very happy because i had such a nice husband to quarrel with and make it up with  then they moved to charlottetown and ned russell bought this house and brought his bride here  they were a gay young pair as i remember them  miss elizabeth russell was alecs sister  she came to live with them a year or so later and she was a creature of mirth too  the walls of this house must be sorter soaked with laughing and good times  youre the third bride ive seen come here mistress blytheand the handsomest  captain jim contrived to give his sunflower compliment the delicacy of a violet and anne wore it proudly  she was looking her best that night with the bridal rose on her cheeks and the lovelight in her eyes even gruff old doctor dave gave her an approving glance and told his wife as they drove home together that that redheaded wife of the boys was something of a beauty  i must be getting back to the light announced captain jim  ive enjyed this evening something tremenjus  you must come often to see us said anne  i wonder if youd give that invitation if you knew how likely ill be to accept it captain jim remarked whimsically  which is another way of saying you wonder if i mean it smiled anne i do cross my heart as we used to say at school  then ill come  youre likely to be pestered with me at any hour and ill be proud to have you drop down and visit me now and then too ginrally i havent anyone to talk to but the first mate bless his sociable heart  hes a mighty good listener and has forgot moren any macallister of them all ever knew but he isnt much of a conversationalist  youre young and im old but our souls are about the same age i reckon  we both belong to the race that knows joseph as cornelia bryant would say  the race that knows joseph puzzled anne  yes  cornelia divides all the folks in the world into two kindsthe race that knows joseph and the race that dont  if a person sorter sees eye to eye with you and has pretty much the same ideas about things and the same taste in jokeswhy then he belongs to the race that knows joseph  oh i understand exclaimed anne light breaking in upon her  its what i used to calland still call in quotation marks kindred spirits  jest sojest so agreed captain jim  were it whatever it is when you come in tonight mistress blythe i says to myself says i yes shes of the race that knows joseph  and mighty glad i was for if it wasnt so we couldnt have had any real satisfaction in each others company  the race that knows joseph is the salt of the airth i reckon  the moon had just risen when anne and gilbert went to the door with their guests  four winds harbor was beginning to be a thing of dream and glamour and enchantmenta spellbound haven where no tempest might ever ravin  the lombardies down the lane tall and sombre as the priestly forms of some mystic band were tipped with silver  always liked lombardies said captain jim waving a long arm at them theyre the trees of princesses  theyre out of fashion now  folks complain that they die at the top and get raggedlooking  so they doso they do if you dont risk your neck every spring climbing up a light ladder to trim them out  i always did it for miss elizabeth so her lombardies never got outatelbows  she was especially fond of them  she liked their dignity and standoffishness  they dont hobnob with every tom dick and harry  if its maples for company mistress blythe its lombardies for society  what a beautiful night said mrs doctor dave as she climbed into the doctors buggy  most nights are beautiful said captain jim  but i low that moonlight over four winds makes me sorter wonder whats left for heaven  the moons a great friend of mine mistress blythe  ive loved her ever since i can remember  when i was a little chap of eight i fell asleep in the garden one evening and wasnt missed  i woke up along in the night and i was most scared to death  what shadows and queer noises there was  i dursnt move  jest crouched there quaking poor small mite  seemed s if there werent anyone in the world but meself and it was mighty big  then all at once i saw the moon looking down at me through the apple boughs jest like an old friend  i was comforted right off  got up and walked to the house as brave as a lion looking at her  manys the night ive watched her from the deck of my vessel on seas far away from here  why dont you folks tell me to take in the slack of my jaw and go home  the laughter of the goodnights died away  anne and gilbert walked hand in hand around their garden  the brook that ran across the corner dimpled pellucidly in the shadows of the birches  the poppies along its banks were like shallow cups of moonlight  flowers that had been planted by the hands of the schoolmasters bride flung their sweetness on the shadowy air like the beauty and blessing of sacred yesterdays anne paused in the gloom to gather a spray  i love to smell flowers in the dark she said  you get hold of their soul then  oh gilbert this little house is all ive dreamed it  and im so glad that we are not the first who have kept bridal tryst here    chapter 8  miss cornelia bryant comes to call  that september was a month of golden mists and purple hazes at four winds harbora month of sunsteeped days and of nights that were swimming in moonlight or pulsating with stars  no storm marred it no rough wind blew  anne and gilbert put their nest in order rambled on the shores sailed on the harbor drove about four winds and the glen or through the ferny sequestered roads of the woods around the harbor head in short had such a honeymoon as any lovers in the world might have envied them  if life were to stop short just now it would still have been richly worth while just for the sake of these past four weeks wouldnt it said anne  i dont suppose we will ever have four such perfect weeks againbut weve had them  everythingwind weather folks house of dreamshas conspired to make our honeymoon delightful  there hasnt even been a rainy day since we came here  and we havent quarrelled once teased gilbert  well thats a pleasure all the greater for being deferred quoted anne  im so glad we decided to spend our honeymoon here  our memories of it will always belong here in our house of dreams instead of being scattered about in strange places  there was a certain tang of romance and adventure in the atmosphere of their new home which anne had never found in avonlea  there although she had lived in sight of the sea it had not entered intimately into her life  in four winds it surrounded her and called to her constantly  from every window of her new home she saw some varying aspect of it  its haunting murmur was ever in her ears  vessels sailed up the harbor every day to the wharf at the glen or sailed out again through the sunset bound for ports that might be half way round the globe  fishing boats went whitewinged down the channel in the mornings and returned laden in the evenings  sailors and fisherfolk travelled the red winding harbor roads lighthearted and content there was always a certain sense of things going to happenof adventures and faringsforth  the ways of four winds were less staid and settled and grooved than those of avonlea winds of change blew over them the sea called ever to the dwellers on shore and even those who might not answer its call felt the thrill and unrest and mystery and possibilities of it  i understand now why some men must go to sea said anne  that desire which comes to us all at timesto sail beyond the bourne of sunsetmust be very imperious when it is born in you  i dont wonder captain jim ran away because of it  i never see a ship sailing out of the channel or a gull soaring over the sandbar without wishing i were on board the ship or had wings not like a dove to fly away and be at rest but like a gull to sweep out into the very heart of a storm  youll stay right here with me annegirl said gilbert lazily  i wont have you flying away from me into the hearts of storms  they were sitting on their red sandstone doorstep in the late afternoon  great tranquillities were all about them in land and sea and sky  silvery gulls were soaring over them  the horizons were laced with long trails of frail pinkish clouds  the hushed air was threaded with a murmurous refrain of minstrel winds and waves  pale asters were blowing in the sere and misty meadows between them and the harbor  doctors who have to be up all night waiting on sick folk dont feel very adventurous i suppose anne said indulgently  if you had had a good sleep last night gilbert youd be as ready as i am for a flight of imagination  i did good work last night anne said gilbert quietly  under god i saved a life  this is the first time i could ever really claim that in other cases i may have helped but anne if i had not stayed at allonbys last night and fought death hand to hand that woman would have died before morning  i tried an experiment that was certainly never tried in four winds before  i doubt if it was ever tried anywhere before outside of a hospital  it was a new thing in kingsport hospital last winter  i could never have dared try it here if i had not been absolutely certain that there was no other chance  i risked itand it succeeded  as a result a good wife and mother is saved for long years of happiness and usefulness  as i drove home this morning while the sun was rising over the harbor i thanked god that i had chosen the profession i did  i had fought a good fight and wonthink of it anne won against the great destroyer  its what i dreamed of doing long ago when we talked together of what we wanted to do in life that dream of mine came true this morning  was that the only one of your dreams that has come true asked anne who knew perfectly well what the substance of his answer would be but wanted to hear it again  you know annegirl said gilbert smiling into her eyes  at that moment there were certainly two perfectly happy people sitting on the doorstep of a little white house on the four winds harbor shore  presently gilbert said with a change of tone do i or do i not see a fullrigged ship sailing up our lane  anne looked and sprang up  that must be either miss cornelia bryant or mrs moore coming to call she said  im going into the office and if it is miss cornelia i warn you that ill eavesdrop said gilbert  from all ive heard regarding miss cornelia i conclude that her conversation will not be dull to say the least  it may be mrs moore  i dont think mrs moore is built on those lines  i saw her working in her garden the other day and though i was too far away to see clearly i thought she was rather slender  she doesnt seem very socially inclined when she has never called on you yet although shes your nearest neighbor  she cant be like mrs lynde after all or curiosity would have brought her said anne  this caller is i think miss cornelia  miss cornelia it was moreover miss cornelia had not come to make any brief and fashionable wedding call  she had her work under her arm in a substantial parcel and when anne asked her to stay she promptly took off her capacious sunhat which had been held on her head despite irreverent september breezes by a tight elastic band under her hard little knob of fair hair  no hat pins for miss cornelia an it please ye  elastic bands had been good enough for her mother and they were good enough for her  she had a fresh round pinkandwhite face and jolly brown eyes  she did not look in the least like the traditional old maid and there was something in her expression which won anne instantly  with her old instinctive quickness to discern kindred spirits she knew she was going to like miss cornelia in spite of uncertain oddities of opinion and certain oddities of attire  nobody but miss cornelia would have come to make a call arrayed in a striped blueandwhite apron and a wrapper of chocolate print with a design of huge pink roses scattered over it  and nobody but miss cornelia could have looked dignified and suitably garbed in it  had miss cornelia been entering a palace to call on a princes bride she would have been just as dignified and just as wholly mistress of the situation  she would have trailed her rosespattered flounce over the marble floors just as unconcernedly and she would have proceeded just as calmly to disabuse the mind of the princess of any idea that the possession of a mere man be he prince or peasant was anything to brag of  ive brought my work mrs blythe dearie she remarked unrolling some dainty material  im in a hurry to get this done and there isnt any time to lose  anne looked in some surprise at the white garment spread over miss cornelias ample lap  it was certainly a babys dress and it was most beautifully made with tiny frills and tucks  miss cornelia adjusted her glasses and fell to embroidering with exquisite stitches  this is for mrs fred proctor up at the glen she announced  shes expecting her eighth baby any day now and not a stitch has she ready for it  the other seven have wore out all she made for the first and shes never had time or strength or spirit to make any more  that woman is a martyr mrs blythe believe me  when she married fred proctor i knew how it would turn out  he was one of your wicked fascinating men  after he got married he left off being fascinating and just kept on being wicked  he drinks and he neglects his family isnt that like a man  i dont know how mrs proctor would ever keep her children decently clothed if her neighbors didnt help her out  as anne was afterwards to learn miss cornelia was the only neighbor who troubled herself much about the decency of the young proctors  when i heard this eighth baby was coming i decided to make some things for it miss cornelia went on  this is the last and i want to finish it today  its certainly very pretty said anne  ill get my sewing and well have a little thimble party of two  you are a beautiful sewer miss bryant  yes im the best sewer in these parts said miss cornelia in a matteroffact tone  i ought to be  lord ive done more of it than if id had a hundred children of my own believe me  i spose im a fool to be putting hand embroidery on this dress for an eighth baby but lord mrs blythe dearie it isnt to blame for being the eighth and i kind of wished it to have one real pretty dress just as if it was wanted  nobodys wanting the poor miteso i put some extra fuss on its little things just on that account  any baby might be proud of that dress said anne feeling still more strongly that she was going to like miss cornelia  i spose youve been thinking i was never coming to call on you resumed miss cornelia  but this is harvest month you know and ive been busyand a lot of extra hands hanging round eating moren they work just like the men  id have come yesterday but i went to mrs roderick macallisters funeral  at first i thought my head was aching so badly i couldnt enjoy myself if i did go  but she was a hundred years old and id always promised myself that id go to her funeral  was it a successful function asked anne noticing that the office door was ajar  whats that  oh yes it was a tremendous funeral  she had a very large connection  there was over one hundred and twenty carriages in the procession  there was one or two funny things happened  i thought that die i would to see old joe bradshaw who is an infidel and never darkens the door of a church singing safe in the arms of jesus with great gusto and fervor  he glories in singingthats why he never misses a funeral  poor mrs bradshaw didnt look much like singingall wore out slaving  old joe starts out once in a while to buy her a present and brings home some new kind of farm machinery isnt that like a man  but what else would you expect of a man who never goes to church even a methodist one  i was real thankful to see you and the young doctor in the presbyterian church your first sunday no doctor for me who isnt a presbyterian  we were in the methodist church last sunday evening said anne wickedly  oh i spose dr blythe has to go to the methodist church once in a while or he wouldnt get the methodist practice  we liked the sermon very much declared anne boldly  and i thought the methodist minsters prayer was one of the most beautiful i ever heard  oh ive no doubt he can pray  i never heard anyone make more beautiful prayers than old simon bentley who was always drunk or hoping to be and the drunker he was the better he prayed  the methodist minister is very fine looking said anne for the benefit of the office door  yes hes quite ornamental agreed miss cornelia  oh and very ladylike  and he thinks that every girl who looks at him falls in love with himas if a methodist minister wandering about like any jew was such a prize  if you and the young doctor take my advice you wont have much to do with the methodists  my motto isif you are a presbyterian be a presbyterian  dont you think that methodists go to heaven as well as presbyterians asked anne smilelessly  that isnt for us to decide  its in higher hands than ours said miss cornelia solemnly  but i aint going to associate with them on earth whatever i may have to do in heaven  this methodist minister isnt married  the last one they had was and his wife was the silliest flightiest little thing i ever saw  i told her husband once that he should have waited till she was grown up before he married her he said he wanted to have the training of her  wasnt that like a man  its rather hard to decide just when people are grown up laughed anne  thats a true word dearie  some are grown up when theyre born and others aint grown up when theyre eighty believe me that same mrs roderick i was speaking of never grew up  she was as foolish when she was a hundred as when she was ten  perhaps that was why she lived so long suggested anne  maybe twas  id rather live fifty sensible years than a hundred foolish ones  but just think what a dull world it would be if everyone was sensible pleaded anne  miss cornelia disdained any skirmish of flippant epigram  mrs roderick was a milgrave and the milgraves never had much sense her nephew ebenezer milgrave used to be insane for years  he believed he was dead and used to rage at his wife because she wouldnt bury him  id adone it  miss cornelia looked so grimly determined that anne could almost see her with a spade in her hand  dont you know any good husbands miss bryant  oh yes lots of themover yonder said miss cornelia waving her hand through the open window towards the little graveyard of the church across the harbor  but livinggoing about in the flesh persisted anne  oh theres a few just to show that with god all things are possible acknowledged miss cornelia reluctantly  i dont deny that an odd man here and there if hes caught young and trained up proper and if his mother has spanked him well beforehand may turn out a decent being  your husband now isnt so bad as men go from all i hear  i sposemiss cornelia looked sharply at anne over her glassesyou think theres nobody like him in the world  there isnt said anne promptly  ah well i heard another bride say that once sighed miss cornelia jennie dean thought when she married that there wasnt anybody like her husband in the world  and she was rightthere wasnt  and a good thing too believe me  he led her an awful lifeand he was courting his second wife while jennie was dying  wasnt that like a man  however i hope your confidence will be better justified dearie  the young doctor is taking real well  i was afraid at first he mightnt for folks hereabouts have always thought old doctor dave the only doctor in the world  doctor dave hadnt much tact to be surehe was always talking of ropes in houses where someone had hanged himself  but folks forgot their hurt feelings when they had a pain in their stomachs  if hed been a minister instead of a doctor theyd never have forgiven him  soulache doesnt worry folks near as much as stomachache  seeing as were both presbyterians and no methodists around will you tell me your candid opinion of our minister  whyreallyiwell hesitated anne  miss cornelia nodded  exactly  i agree with you dearie  we made a mistake when we called him  his face just looks like one of those long narrow stones in the graveyard doesnt it  sacred to the memory ought to be written on his forehead  i shall never forget the first sermon he preached after he came  it was on the subject of everyone doing what they were best fitted fora very good subject of course but such illustrations as he used  he said if you had a cow and an apple tree and if you tied the apple tree in your stable and planted the cow in your orchard with her legs up how much milk would you get from the apple tree or how many apples from the cow  did you ever hear the like in your born days dearie  i was so thankful there were no methodists there that daytheyd never have been done hooting over it  but what i dislike most in him is his habit of agreeing with everybody no matter what is said  if you said to him youre a scoundrel hed say with that smooth smile of his yes thats so  a minister should have more backbone  the long and the short of it is i consider him a reverend jackass  but of course this is just between you and me  when there are methodists in hearing i praise him to the skies  some folks think his wife dresses too gay but i say when she has to live with a face like that she needs something to cheer her up  youll never hear me condemning a woman for her dress  im only too thankful when her husband isnt too mean and miserly to allow it  not that i bother much with dress myself  women just dress to please the men and id never stoop to that  i have had a real placid comfortable life dearie and its just because i never cared a cent what the men thought  why do you hate the men so miss bryant  lord dearie i dont hate them  they arent worth it  i just sort of despise them  i think ill like your husband if he keeps on as he has begun  but apart from him about the only men in the world ive much use for are the old doctor and captain jim  captain jim is certainly splendid agreed anne cordially  captain jim is a good man but hes kind of vexing in one way  you cant make him mad  ive tried for twenty years and he just keeps on being placid  it does sort of rile me  and i spose the woman he should have married got a man who went into tantrums twice a day  who was she  oh i dont know dearie  i never remember of captain jim making up to anybody  he was edging on old as far as my memory goes  hes seventysix you know  i never heard any reason for his staying a bachelor but there must be one believe me  he sailed all his life till five years ago and theres no corner of the earth he hasnt poked his nose into  he and elizabeth russell were great cronies all their lives but they never had any notion of sweethearting  elizabeth never married though she had plenty of chances  she was a great beauty when she was young  the year the prince of wales came to the island she was visiting her uncle in charlottetown and he was a government official and so she got invited to the great ball  she was the prettiest girl there and the prince danced with her and all the other women he didnt dance with were furious about it because their social standing was higher than hers and they said he shouldnt have passed them over  elizabeth was always very proud of that dance  mean folks said that was why she never marriedshe couldnt put up with an ordinary man after dancing with a prince  but that wasnt so  she told me the reason onceit was because she had such a temper that she was afraid she couldnt live peaceably with any man  she had an awful tempershe used to have to go upstairs and bite pieces out of her bureau to keep it down by times  but i told her that wasnt any reason for not marrying if she wanted to  theres no reason why we should let the men have a monopoly of temper is there mrs blythe dearie  ive a bit of temper myself sighed anne  its well you have dearie  you wont be half so likely to be trodden on believe me  my how that golden glow of yours is blooming  your garden looks fine  poor elizabeth always took such care of it  i love it said anne  im glad its so full of oldfashioned flowers  speaking of gardening we want to get a man to dig up that little lot beyond the fir grove and set it out with strawberry plants for us  gilbert is so busy he will never get time for it this fall do you know anyone we can get  well henry hammond up at the glen goes out doing jobs like that hell do maybe  hes always a heap more interested in his wages than in his work just like a man and hes so slow in the uptake that he stands still for five minutes before it dawns on him that hes stopped his father threw a stump at him when he was small  nice gentle missile wasnt it  so like a man  course the boy never got over it  but hes the only one i can recommend at all  he painted my house for me last spring  it looks real nice now dont you think  anne was saved by the clock striking five  lord is it that late exclaimed miss cornelia  how time does slip by when youre enjoying yourself  well i must betake myself home  no indeed  you are going to stay and have tea with us said anne eagerly  are you asking me because you think you ought to or because you really want to demanded miss cornelia  because i really want to  then ill stay  you belong to the race that knows joseph  i know we are going to be friends said anne with the smile that only they of the household of faith ever saw  yes we are dearie  thank goodness we can choose our friends  we have to take our relatives as they are and be thankful if there are no penitentiary birds among them  not that ive manynone nearer than second cousins  im a kind of lonely soul mrs blythe  there was a wistful note in miss cornelias voice  i wish you would call me anne exclaimed anne impulsively  it would seem more homey  everyone in four winds except my husband calls me mrs blythe and it makes me feel like a stranger  do you know that your name is very near being the one i yearned after when i was a child  i hated anne and i called myself cordelia in imagination  i like anne  it was my mothers name  oldfashioned names are the best and sweetest in my opinion  if youre going to get tea you might send the young doctor to talk to me  hes been lying on the sofa in that office ever since i came laughing fit to kill over what ive been saying  how did you know cried anne too aghast at this instance of miss cornelias uncanny prescience to make a polite denial  i saw him sitting beside you when i came up the lane and i know mens tricks retorted miss cornelia  there ive finished my little dress dearie and the eighth baby can come as soon as it pleases    chapter 9  an evening at four winds point  it was late september when anne and gilbert were able to pay four winds light their promised visit  they had often planned to go but something always occurred to prevent them  captain jim had dropped in several times at the little house  i dont stand on ceremony mistress blythe he told anne  its a real pleasure to me to come here and im not going to deny myself jest because you havent got down to see me  there oughtnt to be no bargaining like that among the race that knows joseph  ill come when i can and you come when you can and so longs we have our pleasant little chat it dont matter a mite what roofs over us  captain jim took a great fancy to gog and magog who were presiding over the destinies of the hearth in the little house with as much dignity and aplomb as they had done at pattys place  arent they the cutest little cusses he would say delightedly and he bade them greeting and farewell as gravely and invariably as he did his host and hostess  captain jim was not going to offend household deities by any lack of reverence and ceremony  youve made this little house just about perfect he told anne  it never was so nice before  mistress selwyn had your taste and she did wonders but folks in those days didnt have the pretty little curtains and pictures and nicknacks you have  as for elizabeth she lived in the past  youve kinder brought the future into it so to speak  id be real happy even if we couldnt talk at all when i come herejest to sit and look at you and your pictures and your flowers would be enough of a treat  its beautifulbeautiful  captain jim was a passionate worshipper of beauty  every lovely thing heard or seen gave him a deep subtle inner joy that irradiated his life  he was quite keenly aware of his own lack of outward comeliness and lamented it  folks say im good he remarked whimsically upon one occasion but i sometimes wish the lord had made me only half as good and put the rest of it into looks  but there i reckon he knew what he was about as a good captain should  some of us have to be homely or the purty oneslike mistress blythe herewouldnt show up so well  one evening anne and gilbert finally walked down to the four winds light  the day had begun sombrely in gray cloud and mist but it had ended in a pomp of scarlet and gold  over the western hills beyond the harbor were amber deeps and crystalline shallows with the fire of sunset below  the north was a mackerel sky of little fiery golden clouds  the red light flamed on the white sails of a vessel gliding down the channel bound to a southern port in a land of palms  beyond her it smote upon and incarnadined the shining white grassless faces of the sand dunes  to the right it fell on the old house among the willows up the brook and gave it for a fleeting space casements more splendid than those of an old cathedral  they glowed out of its quiet and grayness like the throbbing bloodred thoughts of a vivid soul imprisoned in a dull husk of environment  that old house up the brook always seems so lonely said anne  i never see visitors there  of course its lane opens on the upper roadbut i dont think theres much coming and going  it seems odd weve never met the moores yet when they live within fifteen minutes walk of us  i may have seen them in church of course but if so i didnt know them  im sorry they are so unsociable when they are our only near neighbors  evidently they dont belong to the race that knows joseph laughed gilbert  have you ever found out who that girl was whom you thought so beautiful  no  somehow i have never remembered to ask about her  but ive never seen her anywhere so i suppose she must have been a stranger  oh the sun has just vanishedand theres the light  as the dusk deepened the great beacon cut swathes of light through it sweeping in a circle over the fields and the harbor the sandbar and the gulf  i feel as if it might catch me and whisk me leagues out to sea said anne as one drenched them with radiance and she felt rather relieved when they got so near the point that they were inside the range of those dazzling recurrent flashes  as they turned into the little lane that led across the fields to the point they met a man coming out of ita man of such extraordinary appearance that for a moment they both frankly stared  he was a decidedly finelooking persontall broadshouldered wellfeatured with a roman nose and frank gray eyes he was dressed in a prosperous farmers sunday best in so far he might have been any inhabitant of four winds or the glen  but flowing over his breast nearly to his knees was a river of crinkly brown beard and adown his back beneath his commonplace felt hat was a corresponding cascade of thick wavy brown hair  anne murmured gilbert when they were out of earshot you didnt put what uncle dave calls a little of the scott act in that lemonade you gave me just before we left home did you  no i didnt said anne stifling her laughter lest the retreating enigma should hear here  who in the world can he be  i dont know but if captain jim keeps apparitions like that down at this point im going to carry cold iron in my pocket when i come here he wasnt a sailor or one might pardon his eccentricity of appearance he must belong to the overharbor clans  uncle dave says they have several freaks over there  uncle dave is a little prejudiced i think  you know all the overharbor people who come to the glen church seem very nice  oh gilbert isnt this beautiful  the four winds light was built on a spur of red sandstone cliff jutting out into the gulf  on one side across the channel stretched the silvery sand shore of the bar on the other extended a long curving beach of red cliffs rising steeply from the pebbled coves  it was a shore that knew the magic and mystery of storm and star  there is a great solitude about such a shore  the woods are never solitarythey are full of whispering beckoning friendly life  but the sea is a mighty soul forever moaning of some great unshareable sorrow which shuts it up into itself for all eternity  we can never pierce its infinite mysterywe may only wander awed and spellbound on the outer fringe of it  the woods call to us with a hundred voices but the sea has one onlya mighty voice that drowns our souls in its majestic music  the woods are human but the sea is of the company of the archangels  anne and gilbert found uncle jim sitting on a bench outside the lighthouse putting the finishing touches to a wonderful fullrigged toy schooner  he rose and welcomed them to his abode with the gentle unconscious courtesy that became him so well  this has been a purty nice day all through mistress blythe and now right at the last its brought its best  would you like to sit down here outside a bit while the light lasts  ive just finished this bit of a plaything for my little grand nephew joe up at the glen  after i promised to make it for him i was kinder sorry for his mother was vexed  shes afraid hell be wanting to go to sea later on and she doesnt want the notion encouraged in him  but what could i do mistress blythe  id promised him and i think its sorter real dastardly to break a promise you make to a child  come sit down  it wont take long to stay an hour  the wind was off shore and only broke the seas surface into long silvery ripples and sent sheeny shadows flying out across it from every point and headland like transparent wings  the dusk was hanging a curtain of violet gloom over the sand dunes and the headlands where gulls were huddling  the sky was faintly filmed over with scarfs of silken vapor  cloud fleets rode at anchor along the horizons  an evening star was watching over the bar  isnt that a view worth looking at said captain jim with a loving proprietary pride  nice and far from the marketplace aint it  no buying and selling and getting gain  you dont have to pay anythingall that sea and sky freewithout money and without price theres going to be a moonrise purty soon tooim never tired of finding out what a moonrise can be over them rocks and sea and harbor theres a surprise in it every time  they had their moonrise and watched its marvel and magic in a silence that asked nothing of the world or each other  then they went up into the tower and captain jim showed and explained the mechanism of the great light  finally they found themselves in the dining room where a fire of driftwood was weaving flames of wavering elusive seaborn hues in the open fireplace  i put this fireplace in myself remarked captain jim  the government dont give lighthouse keepers such luxuries  look at the colors that wood makes  if youd like some driftwood for your fire mistress blythe ill bring you up a load some day  sit down  im going to make you a cup of tea  captain jim placed a chair for anne having first removed therefrom a huge orangecolored cat and a newspaper  get down matey  the sofa is your place  i must put this paper away safe till i can find time to finish the story in it  its called a mad love  tisnt my favorite brand of fiction but im reading it jest to see how long she can spin it out  its at the sixtysecond chapter now and the wedding aint any nearer than when it begun fars i can see  when little joe comes i have to read him pirate yarns  aint it strange how innocent little creatures like children like the bloodthirstiest stories  like my lad davy at home said anne  he wants tales that reek with gore  captain jims tea proved to be nectar  he was pleased as a child with annes compliments but he affected a fine indifference  the secret is i dont skimp the cream he remarked airily  captain jim had never heard of oliver wendell holmes but he evidently agreed with that writers dictum that big heart never liked little cream pot  we met an oddlooking personage coming out of your lane said gilbert as they sipped  who was he  captain jim grinned  thats marshall elliotta mighty fine man with jest one streak of foolishness in him  i spose you wondered what his object was in turning himself into a sort of dime museum freak  is he a modern nazarite or a hebrew prophet left over from olden times asked anne  neither of them  its politics thats at the bottom of his freak all those elliotts and crawfords and macallisters are dyedinthewool politicians  theyre born grit or tory as the case may be and they live grit or tory and they die grit or tory and what theyre going to do in heaven where theres probably no politics is more than i can fathom  this marshall elliott was born a grit  im a grit myself in moderation but theres no moderation about marshall  fifteen years ago there was a specially bitter general election  marshall fought for his party tooth and nail  he was dead sure the liberals would winso sure that he got up at a public meeting and vowed that he wouldnt shave his face or cut his hair until the grits were in power  well they didnt go inand theyve never got in yetand you saw the result today for yourselves  marshall stuck to his word  what does his wife think of it asked anne  hes a bachelor  but if he had a wife i reckon she couldnt make him break that vow  that family of elliotts has always been more stubborn than natteral  marshalls brother alexander had a dog he set great store by and when it died the man actilly wanted to have it buried in the graveyard along with the other christians he said  course he wasnt allowed to so he buried it just outside the graveyard fence and never darkened the church door again  but sundays hed drive his family to church and sit by that dogs grave and read his bible all the time service was going on  they say when he was dying he asked his wife to bury him beside the dog she was a meek little soul but she fired up at that  she said she wasnt going to be buried beside no dog and if hed rather have his last resting place beside the dog than beside her jest to say so  alexander elliott was a stubborn mule but he was fond of his wife so he give in and said well durn it bury me where you please  but when gabriels trump blows i expect my dog to rise with the rest of us for he had as much soul as any durned elliott or crawford or macallister that ever strutted  them was his parting words  as for marshall were all used to him but he must strike strangers as right down peculiarlooking  ive known him ever since he was tenhes about fifty nowand i like him  him and me was out codfishing today  thats about all im good for nowcatching trout and cod occasional  but twerent always sonot by no manner of means  i used to do other things as youd admit if you saw my lifebook  anne was just going to ask what his lifebook was when the first mate created a diversion by springing upon captain jims knee  he was a gorgeous beastie with a face as round as a full moon vivid green eyes and immense white double paws  captain jim stroked his velvet back gently  i never fancied cats much till i found the first mate he remarked to the accompaniment of the mates tremendous purrs  i saved his life and when youve saved a creatures life youre bound to love it its next thing to giving life  theres some turrible thoughtless people in the world mistress blythe  some of them city folks who have summer homes over the harbor are so thoughtless that theyre cruel its the worst kind of crueltythe thoughtless kind  you cant cope with it  they keep cats there in the summer and feed and pet em and doll em up with ribbons and collars  and then in the fall they go off and leave em to starve or freeze  it makes my blood boil mistress blythe  one day last winter i found a poor old mother cat dead on the shore lying against the skinandbone bodies of her three little kittens  shed died trying to shelter em  she had her poor stiff paws around em  master i cried  then i swore  then i carried them poor little kittens home and fed em up and found good homes for em i knew the woman who left the cat and when she come back this summer i jest went over the harbor and told her my opinion of her  it was rank meddling but i do love meddling in a good cause  how did she take it asked gilbert  cried and said she didnt think  i says to her says i do you spose thatll be held for a good excuse in the day of jedgment when youll have to account for that poor old mothers life  the lordll ask you what he give you your brains for if it wasnt to think i reckon  i dont fancy shell leave cats to starve another time  was the first mate one of the forsaken asked anne making advances to him which were responded to graciously if condescendingly  yes  i found him one bitter cold day in winter caught in the branches of a tree by his durnfool ribbon collar  he was almost starving  if you could have seen his eyes mistress blythe  he was nothing but a kitten and hed got his living somehow since hed been left until he got hung up  when i loosed him he gave my hand a pitiful swipe with his little red tongue  he wasnt the able seaman you see now  he was meek as moses  that was nine years ago  his life has been long in the land for a cat  hes a good old pal the first mate is  i should have expected you to have a dog said gilbert  captain jim shook his head  i had a dog once  i thought so much of him that when he died i couldnt bear the thought of getting another in his place  he was a friendyou understand mistress blythe  mateys only a pal  im fond of mateyall the fonder on account of the spice of devilment thats in himlike there is in all cats  but i loved my dog  i always had a sneaking sympathy for alexander elliott about his dog  there isnt any devil in a good dog  thats why theyre more lovable than cats i reckon  but im darned if theyre as interesting  here i am talking too much  why dont you check me  when i do get a chance to talk to anyone i run on turrible  if youve done your tea ive a few little things you might like to look atpicked em up in the queer corners i used to be poking my nose into  captain jims few little things turned out to be a most interesting collection of curios hideous quaint and beautiful  and almost every one had some striking story attached to it  anne never forgot the delight with which she listened to those old tales that moonlit evening by that enchanted driftwood fire while the silver sea called to them through the open window and sobbed against the rocks below them  captain jim never said a boastful word but it was impossible to help seeing what a hero the man had beenbrave true resourceful unselfish  he sat there in his little room and made those things live again for his hearers  by a lift of the eyebrow a twist of the lip a gesture a word he painted a whole scene or character so that they saw it as it was  some of captain jims adventures had such a marvellous edge that anne and gilbert secretly wondered if he were not drawing a rather long bow at their credulous expense  but in this as they found later they did him injustice  his tales were all literally true  captain jim had the gift of the born storyteller whereby unhappy faroff things can be brought vividly before the hearer in all their pristine poignancy  anne and gilbert laughed and shivered over his tales and once anne found herself crying  captain jim surveyed her tears with pleasure shining from his face  i like to see folks cry that way he remarked  its a compliment but i cant do justice to the things ive seen or helped to do  ive em all jotted down in my lifebook but i havent got the knack of writing them out properly  if i could hit on jest the right words and string em together proper on paper i could make a great book  it would beat a mad love holler and i believe joed like it as well as the pirate yarns  yes ive had some adventures in my time and do you know mistress blythe i still lust after em  yes old and useless as i be theres an awful longing sweeps over me at times to sail outoutout thereforever and ever  like ulysses you would      sail beyond the sunset and the baths      of all the western stars until you die  said anne dreamily  ulysses  ive read of him  yes thats just how i feeljest how all us old sailors feel i reckon  ill die on land after all i spose well what is to be will be  there was old william ford at the glen who never went on the water in his life cause he was afraid of being drowned  a fortuneteller had predicted he would be  and one day he fainted and fell with his face in the barn trough and was drowned must you go  well come soon and come often  the doctor is to do the talking next time  he knows a heap of things i want to find out  im sorter lonesome here by times  its been worse since elizabeth russell died  her and me was such cronies  captain jim spoke with the pathos of the aged who see their old friends slipping from them one by onefriends whose place can never be quite filled by those of a younger generation even of the race that knows joseph  anne and gilbert promised to come soon and often  hes a rare old fellow isnt he said gilbert as they walked home  somehow i cant reconcile his simple kindly personality with the wild adventurous life he has lived mused anne  you wouldnt find it so hard if you had seen him the other day down at the fishing village  one of the men of peter gautiers boat made a nasty remark about some girl along the shore  captain jim fairly scorched the wretched fellow with the lightning of his eyes  he seemed a man transformed  he didnt say muchbut the way he said it  youd have thought it would strip the flesh from the fellows bones  i understand that captain jim will never allow a word against any woman to be said in his presence  i wonder why he never married said anne  he should have sons with their ships at sea now and grandchildren climbing over him to hear his storieshes that kind of a man  instead he has nothing but a magnificent cat  but anne was mistaken  captain jim had more than that  he had a memory    chapter 10  leslie moore  im going for a walk to the outside shore tonight anne told gog and magog one october evening  there was no one else to tell for gilbert had gone over the harbor  anne had her little domain in the speckless order one would expect of anyone brought up by marilla cuthbert and felt that she could gad shoreward with a clear conscience  many and delightful had been her shore rambles sometimes with gilbert sometimes with captain jim sometimes alone with her own thoughts and new poignantlysweet dreams that were beginning to span life with their rainbows  she loved the gentle misty harbor shore and the silvery windhaunted sand shore but best of all she loved the rock shore with its cliffs and caves and piles of surfworn boulders and its coves where the pebbles glittered under the pools and it was to this shore she hied herself tonight  there had been an autumn storm of wind and rain lasting for three days  thunderous had been the crash of billows on the rocks wild the white spray and spume that blew over the bar troubled and misty and tempesttorn the erstwhile blue peace of four winds harbor  now it was over and the shore lay cleanwashed after the storm not a wind stirred but there was still a fine surf on dashing on sand and rock in a splendid white turmoilthe only restless thing in the great pervading stillness and peace  oh this is a moment worth living through weeks of storm and stress for anne exclaimed delightedly sending her far gaze across the tossing waters from the top of the cliff where she stood  presently she scrambled down the steep path to the little cove below where she seemed shut in with rocks and sea and sky  im going to dance and sing she said  theres no one here to see methe seagulls wont carry tales of the matter  i may be as crazy as i like  she caught up her skirt and pirouetted along the hard strip of sand just out of reach of the waves that almost lapped her feet with their spent foam  whirling round and round laughing like a child she reached the little headland that ran out to the east of the cove then she stopped suddenly blushing crimson she was not alone there had been a witness to her dance and laughter  the girl of the golden hair and seablue eyes was sitting on a boulder of the headland halfhidden by a jutting rock  she was looking straight at anne with a strange expressionpart wonder part sympathy partcould it beenvy  she was bareheaded and her splendid hair more than ever like brownings gorgeous snake was bound about her head with a crimson ribbon  she wore a dress of some dark material very plainly made but swathed about her waist outlining its fine curves was a vivid girdle of red silk  her hands clasped over her knee were brown and somewhat workhardened but the skin of her throat and cheeks was as white as cream  a flying gleam of sunset broke through a lowlying western cloud and fell across her hair  for a moment she seemed the spirit of the sea personifiedall its mystery all its passion all its elusive charm  youyou must think me crazy stammered anne trying to recover her selfpossession  to be seen by this stately girl in such an abandon of childishnessshe mrs dr blythe with all the dignity of the matron to keep upit was too bad  no said the girl i dont  she said nothing more her voice was expressionless her manner slightly repellent but there was something in her eyeseager yet shy defiant yet pleadingwhich turned anne from her purpose of walking away  instead she sat down on the boulder beside the girl  lets introduce ourselves she said with the smile that had never yet failed to win confidence and friendliness  i am mrs blytheand i live in that little white house up the harbor shore  yes i know said the girl  i am leslie mooremrs dick moore she added stiffly  anne was silent for a moment from sheer amazement  it had not occurred to her that this girl was marriedthere seemed nothing of the wife about her  and that she should be the neighbor whom anne had pictured as a commonplace four winds housewife  anne could not quickly adjust her mental focus to this astonishing change  thenthen you live in that gray house up the brook she stammered  yes  i should have gone over to call on you long ago said the other  she did not offer any explanation or excuse for not having gone  i wish you would come said anne recovering herself somewhat were such near neighbors we ought to be friends  that is the sole fault of four windsthere arent quite enough neighbors  otherwise it is perfection  you like it  like it  i love it  it is the most beautiful place i ever saw  ive never seen many places said leslie moore slowly but ive always thought it was very lovely here  ii love it too  she spoke as she looked shyly yet eagerly  anne had an odd impression that this strange girlthe word girl would persistcould say a good deal if she chose  i often come to the shore she added  so do i said anne  its a wonder we havent met here before  probably you come earlier in the evening than i do  it is generally latealmost darkwhen i come  and i love to come just after a stormlike this  i dont like the sea so well when its calm and quiet  i like the struggleand the crashand the noise  i love it in all its moods declared anne  the sea at four winds is to me what lovers lane was at home  tonight it seemed so freeso untamedsomething broke loose in me too out of sympathy  that was why i danced along the shore in that wild way  i didnt suppose anybody was looking of course  if miss cornelia bryant had seen me she would have forboded a gloomy prospect for poor young dr blythe  you know miss cornelia said leslie laughing  she had an exquisite laugh it bubbled up suddenly and unexpectedly with something of the delicious quality of a babys  anne laughed too  oh yes  she has been down to my house of dreams several times  your house of dreams  oh thats a dear foolish little name gilbert and i have for our home  we just call it that between ourselves  it slipped out before i thought  so miss russells little white house is your house of dreams said leslie wonderingly  i had a house of dreams oncebut it was a palace she added with a laugh the sweetness of which was marred by a little note of derision  oh i once dreamed of a palace too said anne  i suppose all girls do  and then we settle down contentedly in eightroom houses that seem to fulfill all the desires of our heartsbecause our prince is there you should have had your palace really thoughyou are so beautiful you must let me say itit has to be saidim nearly bursting with admiration  you are the loveliest thing i ever saw mrs moore  if we are to be friends you must call me leslie said the other with an odd passion  of course i will  and my friends call me anne  i suppose i am beautiful leslie went on looking stormily out to sea  i hate my beauty  i wish i had always been as brown and plain as the brownest and plainest girl at the fishing village over there well what do you think of miss cornelia  the abrupt change of subject shut the door on any further confidences  miss cornelia is a darling isnt she said anne  gilbert and i were invited to her house to a state tea last week  youve heard of groaning tables  i seem to recall seeing the expression in the newspaper reports of weddings said leslie smiling  well miss cornelias groanedat least it creakedpositively  you couldnt have believed she would have cooked so much for two ordinary people  she had every kind of pie you could name i thinkexcept lemon pie  she said she had taken the prize for lemon pies at the charlottetown exhibition ten years ago and had never made any since for fear of losing her reputation for them  were you able to eat enough pie to please her  i wasnt  gilbert won her heart by eatingi wont tell you how much  she said she never knew a man who didnt like pie better than his bible  do you know i love miss cornelia  so do i said leslie  she is the best friend i have in the world  anne wondered secretly why if this were so miss cornelia had never mentioned mrs dick moore to her  miss cornelia had certainly talked freely about every other individual in or near four winds  isnt that beautiful said leslie after a brief silence pointing to the exquisite effect of a shaft of light falling through a cleft in the rock behind them across a dark green pool at its base  if i had come hereand seen nothing but just thati would go home satisfied  the effects of light and shadow all along these shores are wonderful agreed anne  my little sewing room looks out on the harbor and i sit at its window and feast my eyes  the colors and shadows are never the same two minutes together  and you are never lonely asked leslie abruptly  neverwhen you are alone  no  i dont think ive ever been really lonely in my life answered anne  even when im alone i have real good companydreams and imaginations and pretendings  i like to be alone now and then just to think over things and taste them  but i love friendshipand nice jolly little times with people  oh wont you come to see meoften please do  i believe anne added laughing that youd like me if you knew me  i wonder if you would like me said leslie seriously  she was not fishing for a compliment  she looked out across the waves that were beginning to be garlanded with blossoms of moonlit foam and her eyes filled with shadows  im sure i would said anne  and please dont think im utterly irresponsible because you saw me dancing on the shore at sunset  no doubt i shall be dignified after a time  you see i havent been married very long  i feel like a girl and sometimes like a child yet  i have been married twelve years said leslie  here was another unbelievable thing  why you cant be as old as i am exclaimed anne  you must have been a child when you were married  i was sixteen said leslie rising and picking up the cap and jacket lying beside her  i am twentyeight now  well i must go back  so must i  gilbert will probably be home  but im so glad we both came to the shore tonight and met each other  leslie said nothing and anne was a little chilled  she had offered friendship frankly but it had not been accepted very graciously if it had not been absolutely repelled  in silence they climbed the cliffs and walked across a pasturefield of which the feathery bleached wild grasses were like a carpet of creamy velvet in the moonlight  when they reached the shore lane leslie turned  i go this way mrs blythe  you will come over and see me some time wont you  anne felt as if the invitation had been thrown at her  she got the impression that leslie moore gave it reluctantly  i will come if you really want me to she said a little coldly  oh i doi do exclaimed leslie with an eagerness which seemed to burst forth and beat down some restraint that had been imposed on it  then ill come  goodnightleslie  goodnight mrs blythe  anne walked home in a brown study and poured out her tale to gilbert  so mrs dick moore isnt one of the race that knows joseph said gilbert teasingly  nooo not exactly  and yeti think she was one of them once but has gone or got into exile said anne musingly  she is certainly very different from the other women about here  you cant talk about eggs and butter to her  to think ive been imagining her a second mrs rachel lynde  have you ever seen dick moore gilbert  no  ive seen several men working about the fields of the farm but i dont know which was moore  she never mentioned him  i know she isnt happy  from what you tell me i suppose she was married before she was old enough to know her own mind or heart and found out too late that she had made a mistake  its a common tragedy enough anne  a fine woman would have made the best of it  mrs moore has evidently let it make her bitter and resentful  dont let us judge her till we know pleaded anne  i dont believe her case is so ordinary  you will understand her fascination when you meet her gilbert  it is a thing quite apart from her beauty  i feel that she possesses a rich nature into which a friend might enter as into a kingdom but for some reason she bars every one out and shuts all her possibilities up in herself so that they cannot develop and blossom  there ive been struggling to define her to myself ever since i left her and that is the nearest i can get to it  im going to ask miss cornelia about her    chapter 11  the story of leslie moore  yes the eighth baby arrived a fortnight ago said miss cornelia from a rocker before the fire of the little house one chilly october afternoon  its a girl  fred was ranting madsaid he wanted a boywhen the truth is he didnt want it at all  if it had been a boy hed have ranted because it wasnt a girl  they had four girls and three boys before so i cant see that it made much difference what this one was but of course hed have to be cantankerous just like a man  the baby is real pretty dressed up in its nice little clothes it has black eyes and the dearest tiny hands  i must go and see it  i just love babies said anne smiling to herself over a thought too dear and sacred to be put into words  i dont say but what theyre nice admitted miss cornelia  but some folks seem to have more than they really need believe me  my poor cousin flora up at the glen had eleven and such a slave as she is her husband suicided three years ago  just like a man  what made him do that asked anne rather shocked  couldnt get his way over something so he jumped into the well  a good riddance  he was a born tyrant  but of course it spoiled the well  flora could never abide the thought of using it again poor thing  so she had another dug and a frightful expense it was and the water as hard as nails  if he had to drown himself there was plenty of water in the harbor wasnt there  ive no patience with a man like that  weve only had two suicides in four winds in my recollection the other was frank westleslie moores father  by the way has leslie ever been over to call on you yet  no but i met her on the shore a few nights ago and we scraped an acquaintance said anne pricking up her ears  miss cornelia nodded  im glad dearie  i was hoping youd foregather with her  what do you think of her  i thought her very beautiful  oh of course  there was never anybody about four winds could touch her for looks  did you ever see her hair  it reaches to her feet when she lets it down  but i meant how did you like her  i think i could like her very much if shed let me said anne slowly  but she wouldnt let youshe pushed you off and kept you at arms length  poor leslie  you wouldnt be much surprised if you knew what her life has been  its been a tragedya tragedy repeated miss cornelia emphatically  i wish you would tell me all about herthat is if you can do so without betraying any confidence  lord dearie everybody in four winds knows poor leslies story  its no secretthe outside that is  nobody knows the inside but leslie herself and she doesnt take folks into her confidence  im about the best friend she has on earth i reckon and shes never uttered a word of complaint to me  have you ever seen dick moore  no  well i may as well begin at the beginning and tell you everything straight through so youll understand it  as i said leslies father was frank west  he was clever and shiftlessjust like a man  oh he had heaps of brainsand much good they did him  he started to go to college and he went for two years and then his health broke down the wests were all inclined to be consumptive  so frank came home and started farming  he married rose elliott from over harbor  rose was reckoned the beauty of four windsleslie takes her looks from her mother but she has ten times the spirit and go that rose had and a far better figure  now you know anne i always take the ground that us women ought to stand by each other  weve got enough to endure at the hands of the men the lord knows so i hold we hadnt ought to clapperclaw one another and it isnt often youll find me running down another woman  but i never had much use for rose elliott  she was spoiled to begin with believe me and she was nothing but a lazy selfish whining creature  frank was no hand to work so they were poor as jobs turkey  poor  they lived on potatoes and point believe me  they had two childrenleslie and kenneth  leslie had her mothers looks and her fathers brains and something she didnt get from either of them  she took after her grandmother westa splendid old lady  she was the brightest friendliest merriest thing when she was a child anne  everybody liked her  she was her fathers favorite and she was awful fond of him  they were chums as she used to say she couldnt see any of his faultsand he was a taking sort of man in some ways  well when leslie was twelve years old the first dreadful thing happened  she worshipped little kennethhe was four years younger than her and he was a dear little chap  and he was killed one dayfell off a big load of hay just as it was going into the barn and the wheel went right over his little body and crushed the life out of it  and mind you anne leslie saw it  she was looking down from the loft  she gave one screechthe hired man said he never heard such a sound in all his lifehe said it would ring in his ears till gabriels trump drove it out  but she never screeched or cried again about it she jumped from the loft onto the load and from the load to the floor and caught up the little bleeding warm dead body annethey had to tear it from her before she would let it go  they sent for mei cant talk of it  miss cornelia wiped the tears from her kindly brown eyes and sewed in bitter silence for a few minutes  well she resumed it was all overthey buried little kenneth in that graveyard over the harbor and after a while leslie went back to her school and her studies  she never mentioned kenneths nameive never heard it cross her lips from that day to this  i reckon that old hurt still aches and burns at times but she was only a child and time is real kind to children anne dearie  after a while she began to laugh againshe had the prettiest laugh  you dont often hear it now  i heard it once the other night said anne  it is a beautiful laugh  frank west began to go down after kenneths death  he wasnt strong and it was a shock to him because he was real fond of the child though as ive said leslie was his favorite  he got mopy and melancholy and couldnt or wouldnt work  and one day when leslie was fourteen years of age he hanged himselfand in the parlor too mind you anne right in the middle of the parlor from the lamp hook in the ceiling  wasnt that like a man  it was the anniversary of his wedding day too  nice tasty time to pick for it wasnt it  and of course that poor leslie had to be the one to find him  she went into the parlor that morning singing with some fresh flowers for the vases and there she saw her father hanging from the ceiling his face as black as a coal  it was something awful believe me  oh how horrible said anne shuddering  the poor poor child  leslie didnt cry at her fathers funeral any more then she had cried at kenneths  rose whooped and howled for two however and leslie had all she could do trying to calm and comfort her mother  i was disgusted with rose and so was everyone else but leslie never got out of patience  she loved her mother  leslie is clannishher own could never do wrong in her eyes  well they buried frank west beside kenneth and rose put up a great big monument to him  it was bigger than his character believe me  anyhow it was bigger than rose could afford for the farm was mortgaged for more than its value  but not long after leslies old grandmother west died and she left leslie a little moneyenough to give her a year at queens academy  leslie had made up her mind to pass for a teacher if she could and then earn enough to put herself through redmond college  that had been her fathers pet schemehe wanted her to have what he had lost  leslie was full of ambition and her head was chock full of brains  she went to queens and she took two years work in one year and got her first and when she came home she got the glen school  she was so happy and hopeful and full of life and eagerness  when i think of what she was then and what she is now i saydrat the men  miss cornelia snipped her thread off as viciously as if nerolike she was severing the neck of mankind by the stroke  dick moore came into her life that summer  his father abner moore kept store at the glen but dick had a seagoing streak in him from his mother he used to sail in summer and clerk in his fathers store in winter  he was a big handsome fellow with a little ugly soul  he was always wanting something till he got it and then he stopped wanting itjust like a man  oh he didnt growl at the weather when it was fine and he was mostly real pleasant and agreeable when everything went right  but he drank a good deal and there were some nasty stories told of him and a girl down at the fishing village  he wasnt fit for leslie to wipe her feet on thats the long and short of it  and he was a methodist  but he was clean mad about herbecause of her good looks in the first place and because she wouldnt have anything to say to him in the second  he vowed hed have herand he got her  how did he bring it about  oh it was an iniquitous thing  ill never forgive rose west  you see dearie abner moore held the mortgage on the west farm and the interest was overdue some years and dick just went and told mrs west that if leslie wouldnt marry him hed get his father to foreclose the mortgage  rose carried on terriblefainted and wept and pleaded with leslie not to let her be turned out of her home  she said it would break her heart to leave the home shed come to as a bride  i wouldnt have blamed her for feeling dreadful bad over itbut you wouldnt have thought shed be so selfish as to sacrifice her own flesh and blood because of it would you  well she was  and leslie gave inshe loved her mother so much she would have done anything to save her pain  she married dick moore  none of us knew why at the time  it wasnt till long afterward that i found out how her mother had worried her into it  i was sure there was something wrong though because i knew how she had snubbed him time and again and it wasnt like leslie to turn faceabout like that  besides i knew that dick moore wasnt the kind of man leslie could ever fancy in spite of his good looks and dashing ways  of course there was no wedding but rose asked me to go and see them married  i went but i was sorry i did  id seen leslies face at her brothers funeral and at her fathers funeraland now it seemed to me i was seeing it at her own funeral  but rose was smiling as a basket of chips believe me  leslie and dick settled down on the west placerose couldnt bear to part with her dear daughterand lived there for the winter  in the spring rose took pneumonia and dieda year too late  leslie was heartbroken enough over it  isnt it terrible the way some unworthy folks are loved while others that deserve it far more youd think never get much affection  as for dick hed had enough of quiet married lifejust like a man  he was for up and off  he went over to nova scotia to visit his relationshis father had come from nova scotiaand he wrote back to leslie that his cousin george moore was going on a voyage to havana and he was going too  the name of the vessel was the four sisters and they were to be gone about nine weeks  it must have been a relief to leslie  but she never said anything from the day of her marriage she was just what she is nowcold and proud and keeping everyone but me at a distance  i wont be kept at a distance believe me  ive just stuck to leslie as close as i knew how in spite of everything  she told me you were the best friend she had said anne  did she exclaimed miss cornelia delightedly  well im real thankful to hear it  sometimes ive wondered if she really did want me around at allshe never let me think so  you must have thawed her out more than you think or she wouldnt have said that much itself to you oh that poor heartbroken girl  i never see dick moore but i want to run a knife clean through him  miss cornelia wiped her eyes again and having relieved her feelings by her bloodthirsty wish took up her tale  well leslie was left over there alone  dick had put in the crop before he went and old abner looked after it  the summer went by and the four sisters didnt come back  the nova scotia moores investigated and found she had got to havana and discharged her cargo and took on another and left for home and that was all they ever found out about her  by degrees people began to talk of dick moore as one that was dead  almost everyone believed that he was though no one felt certain for men have turned up here at the harbor after theyd been gone for years  leslie never thought he was deadand she was right  a thousand pities too  the next summer captain jim was in havanathat was before he gave up the sea of course  he thought hed poke round a bitcaptain jim was always meddlesome just like a manand he went to inquiring round among the sailors boarding houses and places like that to see if he could find out anything about the crew of the four sisters  hed better have let sleeping dogs lie in my opinion  well he went to one outoftheway place and there he found a man he knew at first sight it was dick moore though he had a big beard  captain jim got it shaved off and then there was no doubtdick moore it washis body at least  his mind wasnt thereas for his soul in my opinion he never had one  what had happened to him  nobody knows the rights of it  all the folks who kept the boarding house could tell was that about a year before they had found him lying on their doorstep one morning in an awful conditionhis head battered to a jelly almost  they supposed hed got hurt in some drunken row and likely thats the truth of it  they took him in never thinking he could live  but he didand he was just like a child when he got well he hadnt memory or intellect or reason  they tried to find out who he was but they never could  he couldnt even tell them his namehe could only say a few simple words  he had a letter on him beginning dear dick and signed leslie but there was no address on it and the envelope was gone  they let him stay onhe learned to do a few odd jobs about the placeand there captain jim found him  he brought him homeive always said it was a bad days work though i spose there was nothing else he could do  he thought maybe when dick got home and saw his old surroundings and familiar faces his memory would wake up but it hadnt any effect  there hes been at the house up the brook ever since  hes just like a child no more nor less  takes fractious spells occasionally but mostly hes just vacant and good humored and harmless  hes apt to run away if he isnt watched  thats the burden leslie has had to carry for eleven yearsand all alone  old abner moore died soon after dick was brought home and it was found he was almost bankrupt  when things were settled up there was nothing for leslie and dick but the old west farm  leslie rented it to john ward and the rent is all she has to live on  sometimes in summer she takes a boarder to help out  but most visitors prefer the other side of the harbor where the hotels and summer cottages are  leslies house is too far from the bathing shore  shes taken care of dick and shes never been away from him for eleven yearsshes tied to that imbecile for life  and after all the dreams and hopes she once had  you can imagine what it has been like for her anne deariewith her beauty and spirit and pride and cleverness  its just been a living death  poor poor girl said anne again  her own happiness seemed to reproach her  what right had she to be so happy when another human soul must be so miserable  will you tell me just what leslie said and how she acted the night you met her on the shore asked miss cornelia  she listened intently and nodded her satisfaction  you thought she was stiff and cold anne dearie but i can tell you she thawed out wonderful for her  she must have taken to you real strong  im so glad  you may be able to help her a good deal  i was thankful when i heard that a young couple was coming to this house for i hoped it would mean some friends for leslie especially if you belonged to the race that knows joseph  you will be her friend wont you anne dearie  indeed i will if shell let me said anne with all her own sweet impulsive earnestness  no you must be her friend whether shell let you or not said miss cornelia resolutely  dont you mind if shes stiff by timesdont notice it  remember what her life has beenand isand must always be i suppose for creatures like dick moore live forever i understand  you should see how fat hes got since he came home  he used to be lean enough  just make her be friendsyou can do ityoure one of those who have the knack  only you mustnt be sensitive  and dont mind if she doesnt seem to want you to go over there much  she knows that some women dont like to be where dick isthey complain he gives them the creeps  just get her to come over here as often as she can  she cant get away so very muchshe cant leave dick long for the lord knows what hed doburn the house down most likely  at nights after hes in bed and asleep is about the only time shes free  he always goes to bed early and sleeps like the dead till next morning  that is how you came to meet her at the shore likely  she wanders there considerable  i will do everything i can for her said anne  her interest in leslie moore which had been vivid ever since she had seen her driving her geese down the hill was intensified a thousand fold by miss cornelias narration  the girls beauty and sorrow and loneliness drew her with an irresistible fascination  she had never known anyone like her her friends had hitherto been wholesome normal merry girls like herself with only the average trials of human care and bereavement to shadow their girlish dreams  leslie moore stood apart a tragic appealing figure of thwarted womanhood  anne resolved that she would win entrance into the kingdom of that lonely soul and find there the comradeship it could so richly give were it not for the cruel fetters that held it in a prison not of its own making  and mind you this anne dearie said miss cornelia who had not yet wholly relieved her mind you mustnt think leslie is an infidel because she hardly ever goes to churchor even that shes a methodist she cant take dick to church of coursenot that he ever troubled church much in his best days  but you just remember that shes a real strong presbyterian at heart anne dearie    chapter 12  leslie comes over  leslie came over to the house of dreams one frosty october night when moonlit mists were hanging over the harbor and curling like silver ribbons along the seaward glens  she looked as if she repented coming when gilbert answered her knock but anne flew past him pounced on her and drew her in  im so glad you picked tonight for a call she said gaily  i made up a lot of extra good fudge this afternoon and we want someone to help us eat itbefore the firewhile we tell stories  perhaps captain jim will drop in too  this is his night  no  captain jim is over home said leslie  hehe made me come here she added half defiantly  ill say a thankyou to him for that when i see him said anne pulling easy chairs before the fire  oh i dont mean that i didnt want to come protested leslie flushing a little  iive been thinking of comingbut it isnt always easy for me to get away  of course it must be hard for you to leave mr moore said anne in a matteroffact tone  she had decided that it would be best to mention dick moore occasionally as an accepted fact and not give undue morbidness to the subject by avoiding it  she was right for leslies air of constraint suddenly vanished  evidently she had been wondering how much anne knew of the conditions of her life and was relieved that no explanations were needed  she allowed her cap and jacket to be taken and sat down with a girlish snuggle in the big armchair by magog  she was dressed prettily and carefully with the customary touch of color in the scarlet geranium at her white throat  her beautiful hair gleamed like molten gold in the warm firelight  her seablue eyes were full of soft laughter and allurement for the moment under the influence of the little house of dreams she was a girl againa girl forgetful of the past and its bitterness  the atmosphere of the many loves that had sanctified the little house was all about her the companionship of two healthy happy young folks of her own generation encircled her she felt and yielded to the magic of her surroundingsmiss cornelia and captain jim would scarcely have recognized her anne found it hard to believe that this was the cold unresponsive woman she had met on the shorethis animated girl who talked and listened with the eagerness of a starved soul  and how hungrily leslies eyes looked at the bookcases between the windows  our library isnt very extensive said anne but every book in it is a friend  weve picked our books up through the years here and there never buying one until we had first read it and knew that it belonged to the race of joseph  leslie laughedbeautiful laughter that seemed akin to all the mirth that had echoed through the little house in the vanished years  i have a few books of fathersnot many she said  ive read them until i know them almost by heart  i dont get many books  theres a circulating library at the glen storebut i dont think the committee who pick the books for mr parker know what books are of josephs raceor perhaps they dont care  it was so seldom i got one i really liked that i gave up getting any  i hope youll look on our bookshelves as your own said anne  you are entirely and wholeheartedly welcome to the loan of any book on them  you are setting a feast of fat things before me said leslie joyously  then as the clock struck ten she rose half unwillingly  i must go  i didnt realise it was so late  captain jim is always saying it doesnt take long to stay an hour  but ive stayed twoand oh but ive enjoyed them she added frankly  come often said anne and gilbert  they had risen and stood together in the firelights glow  leslie looked at themyouthful hopeful happy typifying all she had missed and must forever miss  the light went out of her face and eyes the girl vanished it was the sorrowful cheated woman who answered the invitation almost coldly and got herself away with a pitiful haste  anne watched her until she was lost in the shadows of the chill and misty night  then she turned slowly back to the glow of her own radiant hearthstone  isnt she lovely gilbert  her hair fascinates me  miss cornelia says it reaches to her feet  ruby gillis had beautiful hairbut leslies is aliveevery thread of it is living gold  she is very beautiful agreed gilbert so heartily that anne almost wished he were a little less enthusiastic  gilbert would you like my hair better if it were like leslies she asked wistfully  i wouldnt have your hair any color but just what it is for the world said gilbert with one or two convincing accompaniments  you wouldnt be anne if you had golden hairor hair of any color but  red said anne with gloomy satisfaction  yes redto give warmth to that milkwhite skin and those shining graygreen eyes of yours  golden hair wouldnt suit you at all queen annemy queen annequeen of my heart and life and home  then you may admire leslies all you like said anne magnanimously    chapter 13  a ghostly evening  one evening a week later anne decided to run over the fields to the house up the brook for an informal call  it was an evening of gray fog that had crept in from the gulf swathed the harbor filled the glens and valleys and clung heavily to the autumnal meadows  through it the sea sobbed and shuddered  anne saw four winds in a new aspect and found it weird and mysterious and fascinating but it also gave her a little feeling of loneliness  gilbert was away and would be away until the morrow attending a medical powwow in charlottetown  anne longed for an hour of fellowship with some girl friend  captain jim and miss cornelia were good fellows each in their own way but youth yearned to youth  if only diana or phil or pris or stella could drop in for a chat she said to herself how delightful it would be  this is such a ghostly night  im sure all the ships that ever sailed out of four winds to their doom could be seen tonight sailing up the harbor with their drowned crews on their decks if that shrouding fog could suddenly be drawn aside  i feel as if it concealed innumerable mysteriesas if i were surrounded by the wraiths of old generations of four winds people peering at me through that gray veil  if ever the dear dead ladies of this little house came back to revisit it they would come on just such a night as this  if i sit here any longer ill see one of them there opposite me in gilberts chair  this place isnt exactly canny tonight  even gog and magog have an air of pricking up their ears to hear the footsteps of unseen guests  ill run over to see leslie before i frighten myself with my own fancies as i did long ago in the matter of the haunted wood  ill leave my house of dreams to welcome back its old inhabitants  my fire will give them my goodwill and greetingthey will be gone before i come back and my house will be mine once more  tonight i am sure it is keeping a tryst with the past  laughing a little over her fancy yet with something of a creepy sensation in the region of her spine anne kissed her hand to gog and magog and slipped out into the fog with some of the new magazines under her arm for leslie  leslies wild for books and magazines miss cornelia had told her and she hardly ever sees one  she cant afford to buy them or subscribe for them  shes really pitifully poor anne  i dont see how she makes out to live at all on the little rent the farm brings in she never even hints a complaint on the score of poverty but i know what it must be  shes been handicapped by it all her life  she didnt mind it when she was free and ambitious but it must gall now believe me  im glad she seemed so bright and merry the evening she spent with you  captain jim told me he had fairly to put her cap and coat on and push her out of the door  dont be too long going to see her either  if you are shell think its because you dont like the sight of dick and shell crawl into her shell again  dicks a great big harmless baby but that silly grin and chuckle of his do get on some peoples nerves  thank goodness ive no nerves myself  i like dick moore better now than i ever did when he was in his right sensesthough the lord knows that isnt saying much  i was down there one day in housecleaning time helping leslie a bit and i was frying doughnuts  dick was hanging round to get one as usual and all at once he picked up a scalding hot one id just fished out and dropped it on the back of my neck when i was bending over  then he laughed and laughed  believe me anne it took all the grace of god in my heart to keep me from just whisking up that stewpan of boiling fat and pouring it over his head  anne laughed over miss cornelias wrath as she sped through the darkness  but laughter accorded ill with that night  she was sober enough when she reached the house among the willows  everything was very silent  the front part of the house seemed dark and deserted so anne slipped round to the side door which opened from the veranda into a little sitting room  there she halted noiselessly  the door was open  beyond in the dimly lighted room sat leslie moore with her arms flung out on the table and her head bent upon them  she was weeping horriblywith low fierce choking sobs as if some agony in her soul were trying to tear itself out  an old black dog was sitting by her his nose resting on his lap his big doggish eyes full of mute imploring sympathy and devotion  anne drew back in dismay  she felt that she could not intermeddle with this bitterness her heart ached with a sympathy she might not utter  to go in now would be to shut the door forever on any possible help or friendship some instinct warned anne that the proud bitter girl would never forgive the one who thus surprised her in her abandonment of despair  anne slipped noiselessly from the veranda and found her way across the yard  beyond she heard voices in the gloom and saw the dim glow of a light  at the gate she met two mencaptain jim with a lantern and another who she knew must be dick moorea big man badly gone to fat with a broad round red face and vacant eyes  even in the dull light anne got the impression that there was something unusual about his eyes  is this you mistress blythe said captain jim  now now you hadnt oughter be roaming about alone on a night like this  you could get lost in this fog easier than not  jest you wait till i see dick safe inside the door and ill come back and light you over the fields i aint going to have dr blythe coming home and finding that you walked clean over cape leforce in the fog  a woman did that once forty years ago  so youve been over to see leslie he said when he rejoined her  i didnt go in said anne and told what she had seen  captain jim sighed  poor poor little girl  she dont cry often mistress blytheshes too brave for that  she must feel terrible when she does cry  a night like this is hard on poor women who have sorrows  theres something about it that kinder brings up all weve sufferedor feared  its full of ghosts said anne with a shiver  that was why i came overi wanted to clasp a human hand and hear a human voice  there seem to be so many inhuman presences about tonight  even my own dear house was full of them  they fairly elbowed me out  so i fled over here for companionship of my kind  you were right not to go in though mistress blythe  leslie wouldnt have liked it  she wouldnt have liked me going in with dick as id have done if i hadnt met you  i had dick down with me all day  i keep him with me as much as i can to help leslie a bit  isnt there something odd about his eyes asked anne  you noticed that  yes one is blue and tother is hazelhis father had the same  its a moore peculiarity  that was what told me he was dick moore when i saw him first down in cuby  if it hadnt abin for his eyes i mightnt aknown him with his beard and fat  you know i reckon that it was me found him and brought him home  miss cornelia always says i shouldnt have done it but i cant agree with her  it was the right thing to doand so twas the only thing  there aint no question in my mind about that  but my old heart aches for leslie shes only twentyeight and shes eaten more bread with sorrow than most women do in eighty years  they walked on in silence for a little while  presently anne said do you know captain jim i never like walking with a lantern  i have always the strangest feeling that just outside the circle of light just over its edge in the darkness i am surrounded by a ring of furtive sinister things watching me from the shadows with hostile eyes  ive had that feeling from childhood  what is the reason  i never feel like that when im really in the darknesswhen it is close all around meim not the least frightened  ive something of that feeling myself admitted captain jim  i reckon when the darkness is close to us it is a friend  but when we sorter push it away from usdivorce ourselves from it so to speak with lantern lightit becomes an enemy  but the fog is lifting  theres a smart west wind rising if you notice  the stars will be out when you get home  they were out and when anne reentered her house of dreams the red embers were still glowing on the hearth and all the haunting presences were gone    chapter 14  november days  the splendor of color which had glowed for weeks along the shores of four winds harbor had faded out into the soft grayblue of late autumnal hills  there came many days when fields and shores were dim with misty rain or shivering before the breath of a melancholy seawindnights too of storm and tempest when anne sometimes wakened to pray that no ship might be beating up the grim north shore for if it were so not even the great faithful light whirling through the darkness unafraid could avail to guide it into safe haven  in november i sometimes feel as if spring could never come again she sighed grieving over the hopeless unsightliness of her frosted and bedraggled flowerplots  the gay little garden of the schoolmasters bride was rather a forlorn place now and the lombardies and birches were under bare poles as captain jim said  but the firwood behind the little house was forever green and staunch and even in november and december there came gracious days of sunshine and purple hazes when the harbor danced and sparkled as blithely as in midsummer and the gulf was so softly blue and tender that the storm and the wild wind seemed only things of a longpast dream  anne and gilbert spent many an autumn evening at the lighthouse  it was always a cheery place  even when the east wind sang in minor and the sea was dead and gray hints of sunshine seemed to be lurking all about it  perhaps this was because the first mate always paraded it in panoply of gold  he was so large and effulgent that one hardly missed the sun and his resounding purrs formed a pleasant accompaniment to the laughter and conversation which went on around captain jims fireplace  captain jim and gilbert had many long discussions and high converse on matters beyond the ken of cat or king  i like to ponder on all kinds of problems though i cant solve em said captain jim  my father held that we should never talk of things we couldnt understand but if we didnt doctor the subjects for conversation would be mighty few  i reckon the gods laugh many a time to hear us but what matters so long as we remember that were only men and dont take to fancying that were gods ourselves really knowing good and evil  i reckon our powwows wont do us or anyone much harm so lets have another whack at the whence why and whither this evening doctor  while they whacked anne listened or dreamed  sometimes leslie went to the lighthouse with them and she and anne wandered along the shore in the eerie twilight or sat on the rocks below the lighthouse until the darkness drove them back to the cheer of the driftwood fire  then captain jim would brew them tea and tell them      tales of land and sea     and whatsoever might betide     the great forgotten world outside  leslie seemed always to enjoy those lighthouse carousals very much and bloomed out for the time being into ready wit and beautiful laughter or glowingeyed silence  there was a certain tang and savor in the conversation when leslie was present which they missed when she was absent  even when she did not talk she seemed to inspire others to brilliancy  captain jim told his stories better gilbert was quicker in argument and repartee anne felt little gushes and trickles of fancy and imagination bubbling to her lips under the influence of leslies personality  that girl was born to be a leader in social and intellectual circles far away from four winds she said to gilbert as they walked home one night  shes just wasted herewasted  werent you listening to captain jim and yours truly the other night when we discussed that subject generally  we came to the comforting conclusion that the creator probably knew how to run his universe quite as well as we do and that after all there are no such things as wasted lives saving and except when an individual wilfully squanders and wastes his own lifewhich leslie moore certainly hasnt done  and some people might think that a redmond ba whom editors were beginning to honor was wasted as the wife of a struggling country doctor in the rural community of four winds  gilbert  if you had married roy gardner now continued gilbert mercilessly you could have been a leader in social and intellectual circles far away from four winds  gilbert blythe  you know you were in love with him at one time anne  gilbert thats meanpisen mean just like all the men as miss cornelia says  i never was in love with him  i only imagined i was you know that  you know id rather be your wife in our house of dreams and fulfillment than a queen in a palace  gilberts answer was not in words but i am afraid that both of them forgot poor leslie speeding her lonely way across the fields to a house that was neither a palace nor the fulfillment of a dream  the moon was rising over the sad dark sea behind them and transfiguring it  her light had not yet reached the harbor the further side of which was shadowy and suggestive with dim coves and rich glooms and jewelling lights  how the home lights shine out tonight through the dark said anne that string of them over the harbor looks like a necklace  and what a coruscation there is up at the glen  oh look gilbert there is ours im so glad we left it burning  i hate to come home to a dark house our homelight gilbert  isnt it lovely to see  just one of earths many millions of homes annegirlbut oursoursour beacon in a naughty world  when a fellow has a home and a dear little redhaired wife in it what more need he ask of life  well he might ask one thing more whispered anne happily  oh gilbert it seems as if i just couldnt wait for the spring    chapter 15  christmas at four winds  at first anne and gilbert talked of going home to avonlea for christmas but eventually they decided to stay in four winds  i want to spend the first christmas of our life together in our own home decreed anne  so it fell out that marilla and mrs rachel lynde and the twins came to four winds for christmas  marilla had the face of a woman who had circumnavigated the globe  she had never been sixty miles away from home before and she had never eaten a christmas dinner anywhere save at green gables  mrs rachel had made and brought with her an enormous plum pudding nothing could have convinced mrs rachel that a college graduate of the younger generation could make a christmas plum pudding properly but she bestowed approval on annes house  annes a good housekeeper she said to marilla in the spare room the night of their arrival  ive looked into her bread box and her scrap pail  i always judge a housekeeper by those thats what  theres nothing in the pail that shouldnt have been thrown away and no stale pieces in the bread box  of course she was trained up with youbut then she went to college afterwards  i notice shes got my tobacco stripe quilt on the bed here and that big round braided mat of yours before her livingroom fire  it makes me feel right at home  annes first christmas in her own house was as delightful as she could have wished  the day was fine and bright the first skim of snow had fallen on christmas eve and made the world beautiful the harbor was still open and glittering  captain jim and miss cornelia came to dinner  leslie and dick had been invited but leslie made excuse they always went to her uncle isaac wests for christmas she said  shed rather have it so miss cornelia told anne  she cant bear taking dick where there are strangers  christmas is always a hard time for leslie  she and her father used to make a lot of it  miss cornelia and mrs rachel did not take a very violent fancy to each other  two suns hold not their courses in one sphere  but they did not clash at all for mrs rachel was in the kitchen helping anne and marilla with the dinner and it fell to gilbert to entertain captain jim and miss corneliaor rather to be entertained by them for a dialogue between those two old friends and antagonists was assuredly never dull  its many a year since there was a christmas dinner here mistress blythe said captain jim  miss russell always went to her friends in town for christmas  but i was here to the first christmas dinner that was ever eaten in this houseand the schoolmasters bride cooked it that was sixty years ago today mistress blytheand a day very like thisjust enough snow to make the hills white and the harbor as blue as june  i was only a lad and id never been invited out to dinner before and i was too shy to eat enough  ive got all over that  most men do said miss cornelia sewing furiously  miss cornelia was not going to sit with idle hands even on christmas  babies come without any consideration for holidays and there was one expected in a povertystricken household at glen st mary  miss cornelia had sent that household a substantial dinner for its little swarm and so meant to eat her own with a comfortable conscience  well you know the way to a mans heart is through his stomach cornelia explained captain jim  i believe youwhen he has a heart retorted miss cornelia  i suppose thats why so many women kill themselves cookingjust as poor amelia baxter did  she died last christmas morning and she said it was the first christmas since she was married that she didnt have to cook a big twentyplate dinner  it must have been a real pleasant change for her  well shes been dead a year so youll soon hear of horace baxter taking notice  i heard he was taking notice already said captain jim winking at gilbert  wasnt he up to your place one sunday lately with his funeral blacks on and a boiled collar  no he wasnt  and he neednt come neither  i could have had him long ago when he was fresh  i dont want any secondhand goods believe me  as for horace baxter he was in financial difficulties a year ago last summer and he prayed to the lord for help and when his wife died and he got her life insurance he said he believed it was the answer to his prayer  wasnt that like a man  have you really proof that he said that cornelia  i have the methodist ministers word for itif you call that proof robert baxter told me the same thing too but i admit that isnt evidence  robert baxter isnt often known to tell the truth  come come cornelia i think he generally tells the truth but he changes his opinion so often it sometimes sounds as if he didnt  it sounds like it mighty often believe me  but trust one man to excuse another  i have no use for robert baxter  he turned methodist just because the presbyterian choir happened to be singing behold the bridegroom cometh for a collection piece when him and margaret walked up the aisle the sunday after they were married  served him right for being late  he always insisted the choir did it on purpose to insult him as if he was of that much importance  but that family always thought they were much bigger potatoes than they really were  his brother eliphalet imagined the devil was always at his elbowbut i never believed the devil wasted that much time on him  idontknow said captain jim thoughtfully  eliphalet baxter lived too much alonehadnt even a cat or dog to keep him human  when a man is alone hes mighty apt to be with the devilif he aint with god  he has to choose which company hell keep i reckon  if the devil always was at life baxters elbow it must have been because life liked to have him there  manlike said miss cornelia and subsided into silence over a complicated arrangement of tucks until captain jim deliberately stirred her up again by remarking in a casual way  i was up to the methodist church last sunday morning  youd better have been home reading your bible was miss cornelias retort  come now cornelia i cant see any harm in going to the methodist church when theres no preaching in your own  ive been a presbyterian for seventysix years and it isnt likely my theology will hoist anchor at this late day  its setting a bad example said miss cornelia grimly  besides continued wicked captain jim i wanted to hear some good singing  the methodists have a good choir and you cant deny cornelia that the singing in our church is awful since the split in the choir  what if the singing isnt good  theyre doing their best and god sees no difference between the voice of a crow and the voice of a nightingale  come come cornelia said captain jim mildly ive a better opinion of the almightys ear for music than that  what caused the trouble in our choir asked gilbert who was suffering from suppressed laughter  it dates back to the new church three years ago answered captain jim  we had a fearful time over the building of that churchfell out over the question of a new site  the two sites wasnt moren two hundred yards apart but youd have thought they was a thousand by the bitterness of that fight  we was split up into three factionsone wanted the east site and one the south and one held to the old  it was fought out in bed and at board and in church and at market  all the old scandals of three generations were dragged out of their graves and aired  three matches was broken up by it  and the meetings we had to try to settle the question  cornelia will you ever forget the one when old luther burns got up and made a speech  he stated his opinions forcibly  call a spade a spade captain  you mean he got redmad and raked them all fore and aft  they deserved it tooa pack of incapables  but what would you expect of a committee of men  that building committee held twentyseven meetings and at the end of the twentyseventh werent no nearer having a church than when they begunnot so near for a fact for in one fit of hurrying things along theyd gone to work and tore the old church down so there we were without a church and no place but the hall to worship in  the methodists offered us their church cornelia  the glen st mary church wouldnt have been built to this day went on miss cornelia ignoring captain jim if we women hadnt just started in and took charge  we said we meant to have a church if the men meant to quarrel till doomsday and we were tired of being a laughingstock for the methodists  we held one meeting and elected a committee and canvassed for subscriptions  we got them too  when any of the men tried to sass us we told them theyd tried for two years to build a church and it was our turn now  we shut them up close believe me and in six months we had our church  of course when the men saw we were determined they stopped fighting and went to work manlike as soon as they saw they had to or quit bossing  oh women cant preach or be elders but they can build churches and scare up the money for them  the methodists allow women to preach said captain jim  miss cornelia glared at him  i never said the methodists hadnt common sense captain what i say is i doubt if they have much religion  i suppose you are in favor of votes for women miss cornelia said gilbert  im not hankering after the vote believe me said miss cornelia scornfully  i know what it is to clean up after the men  but some of these days when the men realize theyve got the world into a mess they cant get it out of theyll be glad to give us the vote and shoulder their troubles over on us  thats their scheme  oh its well that women are patient believe me  what about job suggested captain jim  job  it was such a rare thing to find a patient man that when one was really discovered they were determined he shouldnt be forgotten retorted miss cornelia triumphantly  anyhow the virtue doesnt go with the name  there never was such an impatient man born as old job taylor over harbor  well you know he had a good deal to try him cornelia  even you cant defend his wife  i always remember what old william macallister said of her at her funeral theres nae doot she was a chreestian wumman but she had the deils own temper  i suppose she was trying admitted miss cornelia reluctantly but that didnt justify what job said when she died  he rode home from the graveyard the day of the funeral with my father  he never said a word till they got near home  then he heaved a big sigh and said you may not believe it stephen but this is the happiest day of my life wasnt that like a man  i spose poor old mrs job did make life kinder uneasy for him reflected captain jim  well theres such a thing as decency isnt there  even if a man is rejoicing in his heart over his wife being dead he neednt proclaim it to the four winds of heaven  and happy day or not job taylor wasnt long in marrying again you might notice  his second wife could manage him  she made him walk spanish believe me  the first thing she did was to make him hustle round and put up a tombstone to the first mrs joband she had a place left on it for her own name  she said thered be nobody to make job put up a monument to her  speaking of taylors how is mrs lewis taylor up at the glen doctor asked captain jim  shes getting better slowlybut she has to work too hard replied gilbert  her husband works hard tooraising prize pigs said miss cornelia hes noted for his beautiful pigs  hes a heap prouder of his pigs than of his children  but then to be sure his pigs are the best pigs possible while his children dont amount to much  he picked a poor mother for them and starved her while she was bearing and rearing them  his pigs got the cream and his children got the skim milk  there are times cornelia when i have to agree with you though it hurts me said captain jim  thats just exactly the truth about lewis taylor  when i see those poor miserable children of his robbed of all children ought to have it pisens my own bite and sup for days afterwards  gilbert went out to the kitchen in response to annes beckoning  anne shut the door and gave him a connubial lecture  gilbert you and captain jim must stop baiting miss cornelia  oh ive been listening to youand i just wont allow it  anne miss cornelia is enjoying herself hugely  you know she is  well never mind  you two neednt egg her on like that  dinner is ready now and gilbert dont let mrs rachel carve the geese  i know she means to offer to do it because she doesnt think you can do it properly  show her you can  i ought to be able to  ive been studying abcd diagrams of carving for the past month said gilbert  only dont talk to me while im doing it anne for if you drive the letters out of my head ill be in a worse predicament than you were in old geometry days when the teacher changed them  gilbert carved the geese beautifully  even mrs rachel had to admit that  and everybody ate of them and enjoyed them  annes first christmas dinner was a great success and she beamed with housewifely pride  merry was the feast and long and when it was over they gathered around the cheer of the red hearth flame and captain jim told them stories until the red sun swung low over four winds harbor and the long blue shadows of the lombardies fell across the snow in the lane  i must be getting back to the light he said finally  ill jest have time to walk home before sundown  thank you for a beautiful christmas mistress blythe  bring master davy down to the light some night before he goes home  i want to see those stone gods said davy with a relish    chapter 16  new years eve at the light  the green gables folk went home after christmas marilla under solemn covenant to return for a month in the spring  more snow came before new years and the harbor froze over but the gulf still was free beyond the white imprisoned fields  the last day of the old year was one of those bright cold dazzling winter days which bombard us with their brilliancy and command our admiration but never our love  the sky was sharp and blue the snow diamonds sparkled insistently the stark trees were bare and shameless with a kind of brazen beauty the hills shot assaulting lances of crystal  even the shadows were sharp and stiff and clearcut as no proper shadows should be  everything that was handsome seemed ten times handsomer and less attractive in the glaring splendor and everything that was ugly seemed ten times uglier and everything was either handsome or ugly  there was no soft blending or kind obscurity or elusive mistiness in that searching glitter  the only things that held their own individuality were the firsfor the fir is the tree of mystery and shadow and yields never to the encroachments of crude radiance  but finally the day began to realise that she was growing old  then a certain pensiveness fell over her beauty which dimmed yet intensified it sharp angles glittering points melted away into curves and enticing gleams  the white harbor put on soft grays and pinks the faraway hills turned amethyst  the old year is going away beautifully said anne  she and leslie and gilbert were on their way to the four winds point having plotted with captain jim to watch the new year in at the light the sun had set and in the southwestern sky hung venus glorious and golden having drawn as near to her earthsister as is possible for her  for the first time anne and gilbert saw the shadow cast by that brilliant star of evening that faint mysterious shadow never seen save when there is white snow to reveal it and then only with averted vision vanishing when you gaze at it directly  its like the spirit of a shadow isnt it whispered anne  you can see it so plainly haunting your side when you look ahead but when you turn and look at itits gone  i have heard that you can see the shadow of venus only once in a lifetime and that within a year of seeing it your lifes most wonderful gift will come to you said leslie  but she spoke rather hardly perhaps she thought that even the shadow of venus could bring her no gift of life  anne smiled in the soft twilight she felt quite sure what the mystic shadow promised her  they found marshall elliott at the lighthouse  at first anne felt inclined to resent the intrusion of this longhaired longbearded eccentric into the familiar little circle  but marshall elliott soon proved his legitimate claim to membership in the household of joseph he was a witty intelligent wellread man rivalling captain jim himself in the knack of telling a good story  they were all glad when he agreed to watch the old year out with them  captain jims small nephew joe had come down to spend new years with his greatuncle and had fallen asleep on the sofa with the first mate curled up in a huge golden ball at his feet  aint he a dear little man said captain jim gloatingly  i do love to watch a little child asleep mistress blythe  its the most beautiful sight in the world i reckon  joe does love to get down here for a night because i have him sleep with me  at home he has to sleep with the other two boys and he doesnt like it  why cant i sleep with father uncle jim says he  everybody in the bible slept with their fathers  as for the questions he asks the minister himself couldnt answer them  they fair swamp me  uncle jim if i wasnt me whod i be and uncle jim what would happen if god died  he fired them two off at me tonight afore he went to sleep  as for his imagination it sails away from everything  he makes up the most remarkable yarnsand then his mother shuts him up in the closet for telling stories  and he sits down and makes up another one and has it ready to relate to her when she lets him out  he had one for me when he come down tonight  uncle jim says he solemn as a tombstone i had a venture in the glen today  yes what was it says i expecting something quite startling but nowise prepared for what i really got  i met a wolf in the street says he a normous wolf with a big red mouf and awful long teeth uncle jim  i didnt know there was any wolves up at the glen says i  oh he comed there from far far away says joe and i fought he was going to eat me up uncle jim  were you scared says i  no cause i had a big gun says joe and i shot the wolf dead uncle jimsolid deadand then he went up to heaven and bit god says he  well i was fair staggered mistress blythe  the hours bloomed into mirth around the driftwood fire  captain jim told tales and marshall elliott sang old scotch ballads in a fine tenor voice finally captain jim took down his old brown fiddle from the wall and began to play  he had a tolerable knack of fiddling which all appreciated save the first mate who sprang from the sofa as if he had been shot emitted a shriek of protest and fled wildly up the stairs  cant cultivate an ear for music in that cat nohow said captain jim he wont stay long enough to learn to like it  when we got the organ up at the glen church old elder richards bounced up from his seat the minute the organist began to play and scuttled down the aisle and out of the church at the rate of nomansbusiness  it reminded me so strong of the first mate tearing loose as soon as i begin to fiddle that i come nearer to laughing out loud in church than i ever did before or since  there was something so infectious in the rollicking tunes which captain jim played that very soon marshall elliotts feet began to twitch  he had been a noted dancer in his youth  presently he started up and held out his hands to leslie  instantly she responded  round and round the firelit room they circled with a rhythmic grace that was wonderful leslie danced like one inspired the wild sweet abandon of the music seemed to have entered into and possessed her  anne watched her in fascinated admiration  she had never seen her like this  all the innate richness and color and charm of her nature seemed to have broken loose and overflowed in crimson cheek and glowing eye and grace of motion  even the aspect of marshall elliott with his long beard and hair could not spoil the picture  on the contrary it seemed to enhance it  marshall elliott looked like a viking of elder days dancing with one of the blueeyed goldenhaired daughters of the northland  the purtiest dancing i ever saw and ive seen some in my time declared captain jim when at last the bow fell from his tired hand leslie dropped into her chair laughing breathless  i love dancing she said apart to anne  i havent danced since i was sixteenbut i love it  the music seems to run through my veins like quicksilver and i forget everythingeverythingexcept the delight of keeping time to it  there isnt any floor beneath me or walls about me or roof over meim floating amid the stars  captain jim hung his fiddle up in its place beside a large frame enclosing several banknotes  is there anybody else of your acquaintance who can afford to hang his walls with banknotes for pictures he asked  theres twenty tendollar notes there not worth the glass over them  theyre old bank of p e  island notes  had them by me when the bank failed and i had em framed and hung up partly as a reminder not to put your trust in banks and partly to give me a real luxurious millionairy feeling  hullo matey dont be scared  you can come back now  the music and revelry is over for tonight  the old year has just another hour to stay with us  ive seen seventysix new years come in over that gulf yonder mistress blythe  youll see a hundred said marshall elliott  captain jim shook his head  no and i dont want toat least i think i dont  death grows friendlier as we grow older  not that one of us really wants to die though marshall  tennyson spoke truth when he said that  theres old mrs wallace up at the glen  shes had heaps of trouble all her life poor soul and shes lost almost everyone she cared about  shes always saying that shell be glad when her time comes and she doesnt want to sojourn any longer in this vale of tears  but when she takes a sick spell theres a fuss  doctors from town and a trained nurse and enough medicine to kill a dog  life may be a vale of tears all right but there are some folks who enjoy weeping i reckon  they spent the old years last hour quietly around the fire  a few minutes before twelve captain jim rose and opened the door  we must let the new year in he said  outside was a fine blue night  a sparkling ribbon of moonlight garlanded the gulf  inside the bar the harbor shone like a pavement of pearl  they stood before the door and waitedcaptain jim with his ripe full experience marshall elliott in his vigorous but empty middle life gilbert and anne with their precious memories and exquisite hopes leslie with her record of starved years and her hopeless future  the clock on the little shelf above the fireplace struck twelve  welcome new year said captain jim bowing low as the last stroke died away  i wish you all the best year of your lives mates  i reckon that whatever the new year brings us will be the best the great captain has for usand somehow or other well all make port in a good harbor    chapter 17  a four winds winter  winter set in vigorously after new years  big white drifts heaped themselves about the little house and palms of frost covered its windows  the harbor ice grew harder and thicker until the four winds people began their usual winter travelling over it  the safe ways were bushed by a benevolent government and night and day the gay tinkle of the sleighbells sounded on it  on moonlit nights anne heard them in her house of dreams like fairy chimes  the gulf froze over and the four winds light flashed no more  during the months when navigation was closed captain jims office was a sinecure  the first mate and i will have nothing to do till spring except keep warm and amuse ourselves  the last lighthouse keeper used always to move up to the glen in winter but id rather stay at the point  the first mate might get poisoned or chewed up by dogs at the glen  its a mite lonely to be sure with neither the light nor the water for company but if our friends come to see us often well weather it through  captain jim had an ice boat and many a wild glorious spin gilbert and anne and leslie had over the glib harbor ice with him  anne and leslie took long snowshoe tramps together too over the fields or across the harbor after storms or through the woods beyond the glen  they were very good comrades in their rambles and their fireside communings each had something to give the othereach felt life the richer for friendly exchange of thought and friendly silence each looked across the white fields between their homes with a pleasant consciousness of a friend beyond  but in spite of all this anne felt that there was always a barrier between leslie and herselfa constraint that never wholly vanished  i dont know why i cant get closer to her anne said one evening to captain jim  i like her so muchi admire her so muchi want to take her right into my heart and creep right into hers  but i can never cross the barrier  youve been too happy all your life mistress blythe said captain jim thoughtfully  i reckon thats why you and leslie cant get real close together in your souls  the barrier between you is her experience of sorrow and trouble  she aint responsible for it and you aint but its there and neither of you can cross it  my childhood wasnt very happy before i came to green gables said anne gazing soberly out of the window at the still sad dead beauty of the leafless treeshadows on the moonlit snow  mebbe notbut it was just the usual unhappiness of a child who hasnt anyone to look after it properly  there hasnt been any tragedy in your life mistress blythe  and poor leslies has been almost all tragedy  she feels i reckon though mebbe she hardly knows she feels it that theres a vast deal in her life you cant enter nor understandand so she has to keep you back from ithold you off so to speak from hurting her  you know if weve got anything about us that hurts we shrink from anyones touch on or near it  it holds good with our souls as well as our bodies i reckon  leslies soul must be near rawits no wonder she hides it away  if that were really all i wouldnt mind captain jim  i would understand  but there are timesnot always but now and againwhen i almost have to believe that leslie doesntdoesnt like me  sometimes i surprise a look in her eyes that seems to show resentment and dislikeit goes so quicklybut ive seen it im sure of that  and it hurts me captain jim  im not used to being dislikedand ive tried so hard to win leslies friendship  you have won it mistress blythe  dont you go cherishing any foolish notion that leslie dont like you  if she didnt she wouldnt have anything to do with you much less chumming with you as she does  i know leslie moore too well not to be sure of that  the first time i ever saw her driving her geese down the hill on the day i came to four winds she looked at me with the same expression persisted anne  i felt it even in the midst of my admiration of her beauty  she looked at me resentfullyshe did indeed captain jim  the resentment must have been about something else mistress blythe and you jest come in for a share of it because you happened past leslie does take sullen spells now and again poor girl  i cant blame her when i know what she has to put up with  i dont know why its permitted  the doctor and i have talked a lot abut the origin of evil but we havent quite found out all about it yet  theres a vast of onunderstandable things in life aint there mistress blythe sometimes things seem to work out real properlike same as with you and the doctor  and then again they all seem to go catawampus theres leslie so clever and beautiful youd think she was meant for a queen and instead shes cooped up over there robbed of almost everything a womand value with no prospect except waiting on dick moore all her life  though mind you mistress blythe i daresay shed choose her life now such as it is rather than the life she lived with dick before he went away  thats something a clumsy old sailors tongue mustnt meddle with  but youve helped leslie a lotshes a different creature since you come to four winds  us old friends see the difference in her as you cant  miss cornelia and me was talking it over the other day and its one of the mighty few pints that we see eye to eye on  so jest you throw overboard any idea of her not liking you  anne could hardly discard it completely for there were undoubtedly times when she felt with an instinct that was not to be combated by reason that leslie harbored a queer indefinable resentment towards her  at times this secret consciousness marred the delight of their comradeship at others it was almost forgotten but anne always felt the hidden thorn was there and might prick her at any moment  she felt a cruel sting from it on the day when she told leslie of what she hoped the spring would bring to the little house of dreams  leslie looked at her with hard bitter unfriendly eyes  so you are to have that too she said in a choked voice  and without another word she had turned and gone across the fields homeward  anne was deeply hurt for the moment she felt as if she could never like leslie again  but when leslie came over a few evenings later she was so pleasant so friendly so frank and witty and winsome that anne was charmed into forgiveness and forgetfulness only she never mentioned her darling hope to leslie again nor did leslie ever refer to it  but one evening when late winter was listening for the word of spring she came over to the little house for a twilight chat and when she went away she left a small white box on the table  anne found it after she was gone and opened it wonderingly in it was a tiny white dress of exquisite workmanshipdelicate embroidery wonderful tucking sheer loveliness  every stitch in it was handwork and the little frills of lace at neck and sleeves were of real valenciennes  lying on it was a cardwith leslies love  what hours of work she must have put on it said anne  and the material must have cost more than she could really afford  it is very sweet of her  but leslie was brusque and curt when anne thanked her and again the latter felt thrown back upon herself  leslies gift was not alone in the little house  miss cornelia had for the time being given up sewing for unwanted unwelcome eighth babies and fallen to sewing for a very much wanted first one whose welcome would leave nothing to be desired  philippa blake and diana wright each sent a marvellous garment and mrs rachel lynde sent several in which good material and honest stitches took the place of embroidery and frills  anne herself made many desecrated by no touch of machinery spending over them the happiest hours of the happy winter  captain jim was the most frequent guest of the little house and none was more welcome  every day anne loved the simplesouled truehearted old sailor more and more  he was as refreshing as a sea breeze as interesting as some ancient chronicle  she was never tired of listening to his stories and his quaint remarks and comments were a continual delight to her  captain jim was one of those rare and interesting people who never speak but they say something  the milk of human kindness and the wisdom of the serpent were mingled in his composition in delightful proportions  nothing ever seemed to put captain jim out or depress him in any way  ive kind of contracted a habit of enjying things he remarked once when anne had commented on his invariable cheerfulness  its got so chronic that i believe i even enjy the disagreeable things  its great fun thinking they cant last  old rheumatiz says i when it grips me hard youve got to stop aching sometime  the worse you are the sooner youll stop mebbe  im bound to get the better of you in the long run whether in the body or out of the body  one night by the fireside at the light anne saw captain jims lifebook  he needed no coaxing to show it and proudly gave it to her to read  i writ it to leave to little joe he said  i dont like the idea of everything ive done and seen being clean forgot after ive shipped for my last vyage  joe hell remember it and tell the yarns to his children  it was an old leatherbound book filled with the record of his voyages and adventures  anne thought what a treasure trove it would be to a writer  every sentence was a nugget  in itself the book had no literary merit captain jims charm of storytelling failed him when he came to pen and ink he could only jot roughly down the outline of his famous tales and both spelling and grammar were sadly askew  but anne felt that if anyone possessed of the gift could take that simple record of a brave adventurous life reading between the bald lines the tales of dangers staunchly faced and duty manfully done a wonderful story might be made from it  rich comedy and thrilling tragedy were both lying hidden in captain jims lifebook waiting for the touch of the master hand to waken the laughter and grief and horror of thousands  anne said something of this to gilbert as they walked home  why dont you try your hand at it yourself anne  anne shook her head  no  i only wish i could  but its not in the power of my gift  you know what my forte is gilbertthe fanciful the fairylike the pretty  to write captain jims lifebook as it should be written one should be a master of vigorous yet subtle style a keen psychologist a born humorist and a born tragedian  a rare combination of gifts is needed  paul might do it if he were older  anyhow im going to ask him to come down next summer and meet captain jim  come to this shore wrote anne to paul  i am afraid you cannot find here nora or the golden lady or the twin sailors but you will find one old sailor who can tell you wonderful stories  paul however wrote back saying regretfully that he could not come that year  he was going abroad for two years study  when i return ill come to four winds dear teacher he wrote  but meanwhile captain jim is growing old said anne sorrowfully and there is nobody to write his lifebook    chapter 18  spring days  the ice in the harbor grew black and rotten in the march suns in april there were blue waters and a windy whitecapped gulf again and again the four winds light begemmed the twilights  im so glad to see it once more said anne on the first evening of its reappearance  ive missed it so all winter  the northwestern sky has seemed blank and lonely without it  the land was tender with brandnew goldengreen baby leaves  there was an emerald mist on the woods beyond the glen  the seaward valleys were full of fairy mists at dawn  vibrant winds came and went with salt foam in their breath  the sea laughed and flashed and preened and allured like a beautiful coquettish woman  the herring schooled and the fishing village woke to life  the harbor was alive with white sails making for the channel the ships began to sail outward and inward again  on a spring day like this said anne i know exactly what my soul will feel like on the resurrection morning  there are times in spring when i sorter feel that i might have been a poet if id been caught young remarked captain jim  i catch myself conning over old lines and verses i heard the schoolmaster reciting sixty years ago  they dont trouble me at other times  now i feel as if i had to get out on the rocks or the fields or the water and spout them  captain jim had come up that afternoon to bring anne a load of shells for her garden and a little bunch of sweetgrass which he had found in a ramble over the sand dunes  its getting real scarce along this shore now he said  when i was a boy there was aplenty of it  but now its only once in a while youll find a plotand never when youre looking for it  you jest have to stumble on ityoure walking along on the sand hills never thinking of sweetgrassand all at once the air is full of sweetnessand theres the grass under your feet  i favor the smell of sweetgrass  it always makes me think of my mother  she was fond of it asked anne  not that i knows on  dunnos she ever saw any sweetgrass  no its because it has a kind of motherly perfumenot too young you understandsomething kind of seasoned and wholesome and dependablejest like a mother  the schoolmasters bride always kept it among her handkerchiefs  you might put that little bunch among yours mistress blythe  i dont like these boughten scentsbut a whiff of sweetgrass belongs anywhere a lady does  anne had not been especially enthusiastic over the idea of surrounding her flower beds with quahog shells as a decoration they did not appeal to her on first thought  but she would not have hurt captain jims feelings for anything so she assumed a virtue she did not at first feel and thanked him heartily  and when captain jim had proudly encircled every bed with a rim of the big milkwhite shells anne found to her surprise that she liked the effect  on a town lawn or even up at the glen they would not have been in keeping but here in the oldfashioned seabound garden of the little house of dreams they belonged  they do look nice she said sincerely  the schoolmasters bride always had cowhawks round her beds said captain jim  she was a master hand with flowers  she looked at emand touched emsoand they grew like mad  some folks have that knacki reckon you have it too mistress blythe  oh i dont knowbut i love my garden and i love working in it  to potter with green growing things watching each day to see the dear new sprouts come up is like taking a hand in creation i think  just now my garden is like faiththe substance of things hoped for  but bide a wee  it always amazes me to look at the little wrinkled brown seeds and think of the rainbows in em said captain jim  when i ponder on them seeds i dont find it nowise hard to believe that weve got souls thatll live in other worlds  you couldnt hardly believe there was life in them tiny things some no bigger than grains of dust let alone color and scent if you hadnt seen the miracle could you  anne who was counting her days like silver beads on a rosary could not now take the long walk to the lighthouse or up the glen road  but miss cornelia and captain jim came very often to the little house miss cornelia was the joy of annes and gilberts existence  they laughed sidesplittingly over her speeches after every visit  when captain jim and she happened to visit the little house at the same time there was much sport for the listening  they waged wordy warfare she attacking he defending  anne once reproached the captain for his baiting of miss cornelia  oh i do love to set her going mistress blythe chuckled the unrepentant sinner  its the greatest amusement i have in life  that tongue of hers would blister a stone  and you and that young dog of a doctor enjy listening to her as much as i do  captain jim came along another evening to bring anne some mayflowers the garden was full of the moist scented air of a maritime spring evening  there was a milkwhite mist on the edge of the sea with a young moon kissing it and a silver gladness of stars over the glen the bell of the church across the harbor was ringing dreamily sweet the mellow chime drifted through the dusk to mingle with the soft springmoan of the sea  captain jims mayflowers added the last completing touch to the charm of the night  i havent seen any this spring and ive missed them said anne burying her face in them  they aint to be found around four winds only in the barrens away behind the glen up yander  i took a little trip today to the landofnothingtodo and hunted these up for you  i reckon theyre the last youll see this spring for theyre nearly done  how kind and thoughtful you are captain jim  nobody elsenot even gilbertwith a shake of her head at himremembered that i always long for mayflowers in spring  well i had another errand tooi wanted to take mr howard back yander a mess of trout  he likes one occasional and its all i can do for a kindness he did me once  i stayed all the afternoon and talked to him  he likes to talk to me though hes a highly eddicated man and im only an ignorant old sailor because hes one of the folks thats got to talk or theyre miserable and he finds listeners scarce around here  the glen folks fight shy of him because they think hes an infidel  he aint that far gone exactlyfew men is i reckonbut hes what you might call a heretic  heretics are wicked but theyre mighty intresting  its jest that theyve got sorter lost looking for god being under the impression that hes hard to findwhich he aint never  most of em blunder to him after awhile i guess  i dont think listening to mr howards arguments is likely to do me much harm mind you i believe what i was brought up to believe  it saves a vast of botherand back of it all god is good  the trouble with mr howard is that hes a leetle too clever  he thinks that hes bound to live up to his cleverness and that its smarter to thrash out some new way of getting to heaven than to go by the old track the common ignorant folks is travelling  but hell get there sometime all right and then hell laugh at himself  mr howard was a methodist to begin with said miss cornelia as if she thought he had not far to go from that to heresy  do you know cornelia said captain jim gravely ive often thought that if i wasnt a presbyterian id be a methodist  oh well conceded miss cornelia if you werent a presbyterian it wouldnt matter much what you were  speaking of heresy reminds me doctorive brought back that book you lent methat natural law in the spiritual worldi didnt read moren a third of it  i can read sense and i can read nonsense but that book is neither the one nor the other  it is considered rather heretical in some quarters admitted gilbert but i told you that before you took it miss cornelia  oh i wouldnt have minded its being heretical  i can stand wickedness but i cant stand foolishness said miss cornelia calmly and with the air of having said the last thing there was to say about natural law  speaking of books a mad love come to an end at last two weeks ago remarked captain jim musingly  it run to one hundred and three chapters  when they got married the book stopped right off so i reckon their troubles were all over  its real nice that thats the way in books anyhow isnt it even if tistnt so anywhere else  i never read novels said miss cornelia  did you hear how geordie russell was today captain jim  yes i called in on my way home to see him  hes getting round all rightbut stewing in a broth of trouble as usual poor man  course he brews up most of it for himself but i reckon that dont make it any easier to bear  hes an awful pessimist said miss cornelia  well no he aint a pessimist exactly cornelia  he only jest never finds anything that suits him  and isnt that a pessimist  no no  a pessimist is one who never expects to find anything to suit him  geordie haint got that far yet  youd find something good to say of the devil himself jim boyd  well youve heard the story of the old lady who said he was persevering  but no cornelia ive nothing good to say of the devil  do you believe in him at all asked miss cornelia seriously  how can you ask that when you know what a good presbyterian i am cornelia  how could a presbyterian get along without a devil  do you persisted miss cornelia  captain jim suddenly became grave  i believe in what i heard a minister once call a mighty and malignant and intelligent power of evil working in the universe he said solemnly  i do that cornelia  you can call it the devil or the principle of evil or the old scratch or any name you like  its there and all the infidels and heretics in the world cant argue it away any moren they can argue god away  its there and its working  but mind you cornelia i believe its going to get the worst of it in the long run  i am sure i hope so said miss cornelia none too hopefully but speaking of the devil i am positive that billy booth is possessed by him now  have you heard of billys latest performance  no what was that  hes gone and burned up his wifes new brown broadcloth suit that she paid twentyfive dollars for in charlottetown because he declares the men looked too admiring at her when she wore it to church the first time  wasnt that like a man  mistress booth is mighty pretty and browns her color said captain jim reflectively  is that any good reason why he should poke her new suit into the kitchen stove  billy booth is a jealous fool and he makes his wifes life miserable  shes cried all the week about her suit  oh anne i wish i could write like you believe me  wouldnt i score some of the men round here  those booths are all a mite queer said captain jim  billy seemed the sanest of the lot till he got married and then this queer jealous streak cropped out in him  his brother daniel now was always odd  took tantrums every few days or so and wouldnt get out of bed said miss cornelia with a relish  his wife would have to do all the barn work till he got over his spell  when he died people wrote her letters of condolence if id written anything it would have been one of congratulation  their father old abram booth was a disgusting old sot  he was drunk at his wifes funeral and kept reeling round and hiccuping i didnt driiink much but i feel aaawfully queeer  i gave him a good jab in the back with my umbrella when he came near me and it sobered him up until they got the casket out of the house  young johnny booth was to have been married yesterday but he couldnt be because hes gone and got the mumps  wasnt that like a man  how could he help getting the mumps poor fellow  id poor fellow him believe me if i was kate sterns  i dont know how he could help getting the mumps but i do know the wedding supper was all prepared and everything will be spoiled before hes well again such a waste  he should have had the mumps when he was a boy  come come cornelia dont you think youre a mite unreasonable  miss cornelia disdained to reply and turned instead to susan baker a grimfaced kindhearted elderly spinster of the glen who had been installed as maidofallwork at the little house for some weeks susan had been up to the glen to make a sick call and had just returned  how is poor old aunt mandy tonight asked miss cornelia  susan sighed  very poorlyvery poorly cornelia  i am afraid she will soon be in heaven poor thing  oh surely its not so bad as that exclaimed miss cornelia sympathetically  captain jim and gilbert looked at each other  then they suddenly rose and went out  there are times said captain jim between spasms when it would be a sin not to laugh  them two excellent women    chapter 19  dawn and dusk  in early june when the sand hills were a great glory of pink wild roses and the glen was smothered in apple blossoms marilla arrived at the little house accompanied by a black horsehair trunk patterned with brass nails which had reposed undisturbed in the green gables garret for half a century  susan baker who during her few weeks sojourn in the little house had come to worship young mrs doctor as she called anne with blind fervor looked rather jealously askance at marilla at first  but as marilla did not try to interfere in kitchen matters and showed no desire to interrupt susans ministrations to young mrs doctor the good handmaiden became reconciled to her presence and told her cronies at the glen that miss cuthbert was a fine old lady and knew her place  one evening when the skys limpid bowl was filled with a red glory and the robins were thrilling the golden twilight with jubilant hymns to the stars of evening there was a sudden commotion in the little house of dreams  telephone messages were sent up to the glen doctor dave and a whitecapped nurse came hastily down marilla paced the garden walks between the quahog shells murmuring prayers between her set lips and susan sat in the kitchen with cotton wool in her ears and her apron over her head  leslie looking out from the house up the brook saw that every window of the little house was alight and did not sleep that night  the june night was short but it seemed an eternity to those who waited and watched  oh will it never end said marilla then she saw how grave the nurse and doctor dave looked and she dared ask no more questions  suppose annebut marilla could not suppose it  do not tell me said susan fiercely answering the anguish in marillas eyes that god could be so cruel as to take that darling lamb from us when we all love her so much  he has taken others as well beloved said marilla hoarsely  but at dawn when the rising sun rent apart the mists hanging over the sandbar and made rainbows of them joy came to the little house  anne was safe and a wee white lady with her mothers big eyes was lying beside her  gilbert his face gray and haggard from his nights agony came down to tell marilla and susan  thank god shuddered marilla  susan got up and took the cotton wool out of her ears  now for breakfast she said briskly  i am of the opinion that we will all be glad of a bite and sup  you tell young mrs doctor not to worry about a single thingsusan is at the helm  you tell her just to think of her baby  gilbert smiled rather sadly as he went away  anne her pale face blanched with its baptism of pain her eyes aglow with the holy passion of motherhood did not need to be told to think of her baby  she thought of nothing else  for a few hours she tasted of happiness so rare and exquisite that she wondered if the angels in heaven did not envy her  little joyce she murmured when marilla came in to see the baby we planned to call her that if she were a girlie  there were so many we would have liked to name her for we couldnt choose between them so we decided on joycewe can call her joy for shortjoyit suits so well  oh marilla i thought i was happy before  now i know that i just dreamed a pleasant dream of happiness  this is the reality  you mustnt talk annewait till youre stronger said marilla warningly  you know how hard it is for me not to talk smiled anne  at first she was too weak and too happy to notice that gilbert and the nurse looked grave and marilla sorrowful  then as subtly and coldly and remorselessly as a seafog stealing landward fear crept into her heart  why was not gilbert gladder  why would he not talk about the baby  why would they not let her have it with her after that first heavenlyhappy hour  waswas there anything wrong  gilbert whispered anne imploringly the babyis all rightisnt she  tell metell me  gilbert was a long while in turning round then he bent over anne and looked in her eyes  marilla listening fearfully outside the door heard a pitiful heartbroken moan and fled to the kitchen where susan was weeping  oh the poor lambthe poor lamb  how can she bear it miss cuthbert i am afraid it will kill her  she has been that built up and happy longing for that baby and planning for it  cannot anything be done nohow miss cuthbert  im afraid not susan  gilbert says there is no hope  he knew from the first the little thing couldnt live  and it is such a sweet baby sobbed susan  i never saw one so whitethey are mostly red or yallow  and it opened its big eyes as if it was months old  the little little thing  oh the poor young mrs doctor  at sunset the little soul that had come with the dawning went away leaving heartbreak behind it  miss cornelia took the wee white lady from the kindly but stranger hands of the nurse and dressed the tiny waxen form in the beautiful dress leslie had made for it  leslie had asked her to do that  then she took it back and laid it beside the poor broken tearblinded little mother  the lord has given and the lord has taken away dearie she said through her own tears  blessed be the name of the lord  then she went away leaving anne and gilbert alone together with their dead  the next day the small white joy was laid in a velvet casket which leslie had lined with appleblossoms and taken to the graveyard of the church across the harbor  miss cornelia and marilla put all the little lovemade garments away together with the ruffled basket which had been befrilled and belaced for dimpled limbs and downy head  little joy was never to sleep there she had found a colder narrower bed  this has been an awful disappointment to me sighed miss cornelia ive looked forward to this babyand i did want it to be a girl too  i can only be thankful that annes life was spared said marilla with a shiver recalling those hours of darkness when the girl she loved was passing through the valley of the shadow  poor poor lamb  her heart is broken said susan  i envy anne said leslie suddenly and fiercely and id envy her even if she had died  she was a mother for one beautiful day  id gladly give my life for that  i wouldnt talk like that leslie dearie said miss cornelia deprecatingly  she was afraid that the dignified miss cuthbert would think leslie quite terrible  annes convalescence was long and made bitter for her by many things the bloom and sunshine of the four winds world grated harshly on her and yet when the rain fell heavily she pictured it beating so mercilessly down on that little grave across the harbor and when the wind blew around the eaves she heard sad voices in it she had never heard before  kindly callers hurt her too with the wellmeant platitudes with which they strove to cover the nakedness of bereavement  a letter from phil blake was an added sting  phil had heard of the babys birth but not of its death and she wrote anne a congratulatory letter of sweet mirth which hurt her horribly  i would have laughed over it so happily if i had my baby she sobbed to marilla  but when i havent it just seems like wanton crueltythough i know phil wouldnt hurt me for the world  oh marilla i dont see how i can ever be happy againeverything will hurt me all the rest of my life  time will help you said marilla who was racked with sympathy but could never learn to express it in other than ageworn formulas  it doesnt seem fair said anne rebelliously  babies are born and live where they are not wantedwhere they will be neglectedwhere they will have no chance  i would have loved my baby soand cared for it so tenderlyand tried to give her every chance for good  and yet i wasnt allowed to keep her  it was gods will anne said marilla helpless before the riddle of the universethe why of undeserved pain  and little joy is better off  i cant believe that cried anne bitterly  then seeing that marilla looked shocked she added passionately why should she be born at allwhy should any one be born at allif shes better off dead  i dont believe it is better for a child to die at birth than to live its life outand love and be lovedand enjoy and sufferand do its workand develop a character that would give it a personality in eternity  and how do you know it was gods will  perhaps it was just a thwarting of his purpose by the power of evil  we cant be expected to be resigned to that  oh anne dont talk so said marilla genuinely alarmed lest anne were drifting into deep and dangerous waters  we cant understandbut we must have faithwe must believe that all is for the best  i know you find it hard to think so just now  but try to be bravefor gilberts sake  hes so worried about you  you arent getting strong as fast as you should  oh i know ive been very selfish sighed anne  i love gilbert more than everand i want to live for his sake  but it seems as if part of me was buried over there in that little harbor graveyardand it hurts so much that im afraid of life  it wont hurt so much always anne  the thought that it may stop hurting sometimes hurts me worse than all else marilla  yes i know ive felt that too about other things  but we all love you anne  captain jim has been up every day to ask for youand mrs moore haunts the placeand miss bryant spends most of her time i think cooking up nice things for you  susan doesnt like it very well  she thinks she can cook as well as miss bryant  dear susan  oh everybody has been so dear and good and lovely to me marilla  im not ungratefuland perhapswhen this horrible ache grows a little lessill find that i can go on living    chapter 20  lost margaret  anne found that she could go on living the day came when she even smiled again over one of miss cornelias speeches  but there was something in the smile that had never been in annes smile before and would never be absent from it again  on the first day she was able to go for a drive gilbert took her down to four winds point and left her there while he rowed over the channel to see a patient at the fishing village  a rollicking wind was scudding across the harbor and the dunes whipping the water into whitecaps and washing the sandshore with long lines of silvery breakers  im real proud to see you here again mistress blythe said captain jim  sit downsit down  im afeared its mighty dusty here todaybut theres no need of looking at dust when you can look at such scenery is there  i dont mind the dust said anne but gilbert says i must keep in the open air  i think ill go and sit on the rocks down there  would you like company or would you rather be alone  if by company you mean yours id much rather have it than be alone said anne smiling  then she sighed  she had never before minded being alone  now she dreaded it  when she was alone now she felt so dreadfully alone  heres a nice little spot where the wind cant get at you said captain jim when they reached the rocks  i often sit here  its a great place jest to sit and dream  ohdreams sighed anne  i cant dream now captain jimim done with dreams  oh no youre not mistress blytheoh no youre not said captain jim meditatively  i know how you feel jest nowbut if you keep on living youll get glad again and the first thing you know youll be dreaming againthank the good lord for it  if it wasnt for our dreams they might as well bury us  howd we stand living if it wasnt for our dream of immortality  and thats a dream thats bound to come true mistress blythe  youll see your little joyce again some day  but she wont be my baby said anne with trembling lips  oh she may be as longfellow says a fair maiden clothed with celestial gracebut shell be a stranger to me  god will manage bettern that i believe said captain jim  they were both silent for a little time  then captain jim said very softly  mistress blythe may i tell you about lost margaret  of course said anne gently  she did not know who lost margaret was but she felt that she was going to hear the romance of captain jims life  ive often wanted to tell you about her captain jim went on  do you know why mistress blythe  its because i want somebody to remember and think of her sometime after im gone  i cant bear that her name should be forgotten by all living souls  and now nobody remembers lost margaret but me  then captain jim told the storyan old old forgotten story for it was over fifty years since margaret had fallen asleep one day in her fathers dory and driftedor so it was supposed for nothing was ever certainly known as to her fateout of the channel beyond the bar to perish in the black thundersquall which had come up so suddenly that longago summer afternoon  but to captain jim those fifty years were but as yesterday when it is past  i walked the shore for months after that he said sadly looking to find her dear sweet little body but the sea never give her back to me  but ill find her sometime mistress blytheill find her sometime  shes waiting for me  i wish i could tell you jest how she looked but i cant  ive seen a fine silvery mist hanging over the bar at sunrise that seemed like herand then again ive seen a white birch in the woods back yander that made me think of her  she had pale brown hair and a little white sweet face and long slender fingers like yours mistress blythe only browner for she was a shore girl  sometimes i wake up in the night and hear the sea calling to me in the old way and it seems as if lost margaret called in it  and when theres a storm and the waves are sobbing and moaning i hear her lamenting among them  and when they laugh on a gay day its her laughlost margarets sweet roguish little laugh  the sea took her from me but some day ill find her  mistress blythe  it cant keep us apart forever  i am glad you have told me about her said anne  i have often wondered why you had lived all your life alone  i couldnt ever care for anyone else  lost margaret took my heart with herout there said the old lover who had been faithful for fifty years to his drowned sweetheart  you wont mind if i talk a good deal about her will you mistress blythe  its a pleasure to mefor all the pain went out of her memory years ago and jest left its blessing  i know youll never forget her mistress blythe  and if the years as i hope bring other little folks to your home i want you to promise me that youll tell them the story of lost margaret so that her name wont be forgotten among humankind    chapter 21  barriers swept away   anne said leslie breaking abruptly a short silence you dont know how good it is to be sitting here with you againworkingand talkingand being silent together  they were sitting among the blueeyed grasses on the bank of the brook in annes garden  the water sparkled and crooned past them the birches threw dappled shadows over them roses bloomed along the walks the sun was beginning to be low and the air was full of woven music there was one music of the wind in the firs behind the house and another of the waves on the bar and still another from the distant bell of the church near which the wee white lady slept  anne loved that bell though it brought sorrowful thoughts now  she looked curiously at leslie who had thrown down her sewing and spoken with a lack of restraint that was very unusual with her  on that horrible night when you were so ill leslie went on i kept thinking that perhaps wed have no more talks and walks and works together  and i realised just what your friendship had come to mean to mejust what you meantand just what a hateful little beast i had been  leslie  leslie  i never allow anyone to call my friends names  its true  thats exactly what i ama hateful little beast theres something ive got to tell you anne  i suppose it will make you despise me but i must confess it  anne there have been times this past winter and spring when i have hated you  i knew it said anne calmly  you knew it  yes i saw it in your eyes  and yet you went on liking me and being my friend  well it was only now and then you hated me leslie  between times you loved me i think  i certainly did  but that other horrid feeling was always there spoiling it back in my heart  i kept it downsometimes i forgot itbut sometimes it would surge up and take possession of me  i hated you because i envied youoh i was sick with envy of you at times you had a dear little homeand loveand happinessand glad dreamseverything i wantedand never hadand never could have  oh never could have  that was what stung  i wouldnt have envied you if i had had any hope that life would ever be different for me  but i hadnti hadntand it didnt seem fair  it made me rebelliousand it hurt meand so i hated you at times  oh i was so ashamed of itim dying of shame nowbut i couldnt conquer it  that night when i was afraid you mightnt livei thought i was going to be punished for my wickednessand i loved you so then  anne anne i never had anything to love since my mother died except dicks old dogand its so dreadful to have nothing to lovelife is so emptyand theres nothing worse than emptinessand i might have loved you so muchand that horrible thing had spoiled it  leslie was trembling and growing almost incoherent with the violence of her emotion  dont leslie implored anne oh dont  i understanddont talk of it any more  i musti must  when i knew you were going to live i vowed that i would tell you as soon as you were wellthat i wouldnt go on accepting your friendship and companionship without telling you how unworthy i was of it  and ive been so afraidit would turn you against me  you neednt fear that leslie  oh im so gladso glad anne  leslie clasped her brown workhardened hands tightly together to still their shaking  but i want to tell you everything now ive begun  you dont remember the first time i saw you i supposeit wasnt that night on the shore  no it was the night gilbert and i came home  you were driving your geese down the hill  i should think i do remember it  i thought you were so beautifuli longed for weeks after to find out who you were  i knew who you were although i had never seen either of you before i had heard of the new doctor and his bride who were coming to live in miss russells little house  ii hated you that very moment anne  i felt the resentment in your eyesthen i doubtedi thought i must be mistakenbecause why should it be  it was because you looked so happy  oh youll agree with me now that i am a hateful beastto hate another woman just because she was happyand when her happiness didnt take anything from me  that was why i never went to see you  i knew quite well i ought to goeven our simple four winds customs demanded that  but i couldnt  i used to watch you from my windowi could see you and your husband strolling about your garden in the eveningor you running down the poplar lane to meet him  and it hurt me  and yet in another way i wanted to go over  i felt that if i were not so miserable i could have liked you and found in you what ive never had in my lifean intimate real friend of my own age  and then you remember that night at the shore you were afraid i would think you crazy  you must have thought i was  no but i couldnt understand you leslie  one moment you drew me to youthe next you pushed me back  i was very unhappy that evening  i had had a hard day  dick had been veryvery hard to manage that day  generally he is quite goodnatured and easily controlled you know anne  but some days he is very different  i was so heartsicki ran away to the shore as soon as he went to sleep  it was my only refuge  i sat there thinking of how my poor father had ended his life and wondering if i wouldnt be driven to it some day  oh my heart was full of black thoughts  and then you came dancing along the cove like a glad lighthearted child  ii hated you more then than ive ever done since  and yet i craved your friendship  the one feeling swayed me one moment the other feeling the next  when i got home that night i cried for shame of what you must think of me  but its always been just the same when i came over here  sometimes id be happy and enjoy my visit  and at other times that hideous feeling would mar it all  there were times when everything about you and your house hurt me  you had so many dear little things i couldnt have  do you knowits ridiculousbut i had an especial spite at those china dogs of yours  there were times when i wanted to catch up gog and magog and bang their pert black noses together  oh you smile annebut it was never funny to me  i would come here and see you and gilbert with your books and your flowers and your household gods and your little family jokesand your love for each other showing in every look and word even when you didnt know itand i would go home toyou know what i went home to  oh anne i dont believe im jealous and envious by nature  when i was a girl i lacked many things my schoolmates had but i never caredi never disliked them for it  but i seem to have grown so hateful  leslie dearest stop blaming yourself  you are not hateful or jealous or envious  the life you have to live has warped you a little perhapsbut it would have ruined a nature less fine and noble than yours  im letting you tell me all this because i believe its better for you to talk it out and rid your soul of it  but dont blame yourself any more  well i wont  i just wanted you to know me as i am  that time you told me of your darling hope for the spring was the worst of all anne i shall never forgive myself for the way i behaved then  i repented it with tears  and i did put many a tender and loving thought of you into the little dress i made  but i might have known that anything i made could only be a shroud in the end  now leslie that is bitter and morbidput such thoughts away  i was so glad when you brought the little dress and since i had to lose little joyce i like to think that the dress she wore was the one you made for her when you let yourself love me  anne do you know i believe i shall always love you after this  i dont think ill ever feel that dreadful way about you again  talking it all out seems to have done away with it somehow  its very strangeand i thought it so real and bitter  its like opening the door of a dark room to show some hideous creature youve believed to be thereand when the light streams in your monster turns out to have been just a shadow vanishing when the light comes  it will never come between us again  no we are real friends now leslie and i am very glad  i hope you wont misunderstand me if i say something else  anne i was grieved to the core of my heart when you lost your baby and if i could have saved her for you by cutting off one of my hands i would have done it  but your sorrow has brought us closer together  your perfect happiness isnt a barrier any longer  oh dont misunderstand dearestim not glad that your happiness isnt perfect any longeri can say that sincerely but since it isnt there isnt such a gulf between us  i do understand that too leslie  now well just shut up the past and forget what was unpleasant in it  its all going to be different were both of the race of joseph now  i think youve been wonderfulwonderful  and leslie i cant help believing that life has something good and beautiful for you yet  leslie shook her head  no she said dully  there isnt any hope  dick will never be betterand even if his memory were to come backoh anne it would be worse even worse than it is now  this is something you cant understand you happy bride  anne did miss cornelia ever tell you how i came to marry dick  yes  im gladi wanted you to knowbut i couldnt bring myself to talk of it if you hadnt known  anne it seems to me that ever since i was twelve years old life has been bitter  before that i had a happy childhood  we were very poorbut we didnt mind  father was so splendidso clever and loving and sympathetic  we were chums as far back as i can remember  and mother was so sweet  she was very very beautiful  i look like her but i am not so beautiful as she was  miss cornelia says you are far more beautiful  she is mistakenor prejudiced  i think my figure is bettermother was slight and bent by hard workbut she had the face of an angel  i used just to look up at her in worship  we all worshipped herfather and kenneth and i  anne remembered that miss cornelia had given her a very different impression of leslies mother  but had not love the truer vision still it was selfish of rose west to make her daughter marry dick moore  kenneth was my brother went on leslie  oh i cant tell you how i loved him  and he was cruelly killed  do you know how  yes  anne i saw his little face as the wheel went over him  he fell on his back  anneannei can see it now  i shall always see it  anne all i ask of heaven is that that recollection shall be blotted out of my memory  o my god  leslie dont speak of it  i know the storydont go into details that only harrow your soul up unavailingly  it will be blotted out  after a moments struggle leslie regained a measure of selfcontrol  then fathers health got worse and he grew despondenthis mind became unbalancedyouve heard all that too  yes  after that i had just mother to live for  but i was very ambitious i meant to teach and earn my way through college  i meant to climb to the very topoh i wont talk of that either  its no use  you know what happened  i couldnt see my dear little heartbroken mother who had been such a slave all her life turned out of her home  of course i could have earned enough for us to live on  but mother couldnt leave her home  she had come there as a brideand she had loved father soand all her memories were there  even yet anne when i think that i made her last year happy im not sorry for what i did  as for dicki didnt hate him when i married himi just felt for him the indifferent friendly feeling i had for most of my schoolmates  i knew he drank somebut i had never heard the story of the girl down at the fishing cove  if i had i couldnt have married him even for mothers sake  afterwardsi did hate himbut mother never knew  she diedand then i was alone  i was only seventeen and i was alone dick had gone off in the four sisters  i hoped he wouldnt be home very much more  the sea had always been in his blood  i had no other hope  well captain jim brought him home as you knowand thats all there is to say  you know me now annethe worst of methe barriers are all down  and you still want to be my friend  anne looked up through the birches at the white paperlantern of a half moon drifting downwards to the gulf of sunset  her face was very sweet  i am your friend and you are mine for always she said  such a friend as i never had before  i have had many dear and beloved friendsbut there is a something in you leslie that i never found in anyone else  you have more to offer me in that rich nature of yours and i have more to give you than i had in my careless girlhood  we are both womenand friends forever  they clasped hands and smiled at each other through the tears that filled the gray eyes and the blue    chapter 22  miss cornelia arranges matters  gilbert insisted that susan should be kept on at the little house for the summer  anne protested at first  life here with just the two of us is so sweet gilbert  it spoils it a little to have anyone else  susan is a dear soul but she is an outsider  it wont hurt me to do the work here  you must take your doctors advice said gilbert  theres an old proverb to the effect that shoemakers wives go barefoot and doctors wives die young  i dont mean that it shall be true in my household you will keep susan until the old spring comes back into your step and those little hollows on your cheeks fill out  you just take it easy mrs doctor dear said susan coming abruptly in  have a good time and do not worry about the pantry  susan is at the helm  there is no use in keeping a dog and doing your own barking i am going to take your breakfast up to you every morning  indeed you are not laughed anne  i agree with miss cornelia that its a scandal for a woman who isnt sick to eat her breakfast in bed and almost justifies the men in any enormities  oh cornelia said susan with ineffable contempt  i think you have better sense mrs doctor dear than to heed what cornelia bryant says  i cannot see why she must be always running down the men even if she is an old maid  i am an old maid but you never hear me abusing the men  i like em  i would have married one if i could  is it not funny nobody ever asked me to marry him mrs doctor dear  i am no beauty but i am as goodlooking as most of the married women you see  but i never had a beau  what do you suppose is the reason  it may be predestination suggested anne with unearthly solemnity  susan nodded  that is what i have often thought mrs doctor dear and a great comfort it is  i do not mind nobody wanting me if the almighty decreed it so for his own wise purposes  but sometimes doubt creeps in mrs doctor dear and i wonder if maybe the old scratch has not more to do with it than anyone else  i cannot feel resigned then  but maybe added susan brightening up i will have a chance to get married yet i often and often think of the old verse my aunt used to repeat      there never was a goose so gray but sometime soon or late     some honest gander came her way and took her for his mate  a woman cannot ever be sure of not being married till she is buried mrs doctor dear and meanwhile i will make a batch of cherry pies  i notice the doctor favors em and i do like cooking for a man who appreciates his victuals  miss cornelia dropped in that afternoon puffing a little  i dont mind the world or the devil much but the flesh does rather bother me she admitted  you always look as cool as a cucumber anne dearie  do i smell cherry pie  if i do ask me to stay to tea havent tasted a cherry pie this summer  my cherries have all been stolen by those scamps of gilman boys from the glen  now now cornelia remonstrated captain jim who had been reading a sea novel in a corner of the living room you shouldnt say that about those two poor motherless gilman boys unless youve got certain proof  jest because their father aint none too honest isnt any reason for calling them thieves  its more likely its been the robins took your cherries  theyre turrible thick this year  robins said miss cornelia disdainfully  humph  twolegged robins believe me  well most of the four winds robins are constructed on that principle said captain jim gravely  miss cornelia stared at him for a moment  then she leaned back in her rocker and laughed long and ungrudgingly  well you have got one on me at last jim boyd ill admit  just look how pleased he is anne dearie grinning like a chessycat  as for the robins legs if robins have great big bare sunburned legs with ragged trousers hanging on em such as i saw up in my cherry tree one morning at sunrise last week ill beg the gilman boys pardon  by the time i got down they were gone  i couldnt understand how they had disappeared so quick but captain jim has enlightened me  they flew away of course  captain jim laughed and went away regretfully declining an invitation to stay to supper and partake of cherry pie  im on my way to see leslie and ask her if shell take a boarder miss cornelia resumed  id a letter yesterday from a mrs daly in toronto who boarded a spell with me two years ago  she wanted me to take a friend of hers for the summer  his name is owen ford and hes a newspaper man and it seems hes a grandson of the schoolmaster who built this house  john selwyns oldest daughter married an ontario man named ford and this is her son  he wants to see the old place his grandparents lived in  he had a bad spell of typhoid in the spring and hasnt got rightly over it so his doctor has ordered him to the sea he doesnt want to go to the hotelhe just wants a quiet home place i cant take him for i have to be away in august  ive been appointed a delegate to the wfms  convention in kingsport and im going  i dont know whether lesliell want to be bothered with him either but theres no one else  if she cant take him hell have to go over the harbor  when youve seen her come back and help us eat our cherry pies said anne  bring leslie and dick too if they can come  and so youre going to kingsport  what a nice time you will have  i must give you a letter to a friend of mine theremrs jonas blake  ive prevailed on mrs thomas holt to go with me said miss cornelia complacently  its time she had a little holiday believe me  she has just about worked herself to death  tom holt can crochet beautifully but he cant make a living for his family  he never seems to be able to get up early enough to do any work but i notice he can always get up early to go fishing  isnt that like a man  anne smiled  she had learned to discount largely miss cornelias opinions of the four winds men  otherwise she must have believed them the most hopeless assortment of reprobates and neerdowells in the world with veritable slaves and martyrs for wives  this particular tom holt for example she knew to be a kind husband a much loved father and an excellent neighbor  if he were rather inclined to be lazy liking better the fishing he had been born for than the farming he had not and if he had a harmless eccentricity for doing fancy work nobody save miss cornelia seemed to hold it against him  his wife was a hustler who gloried in hustling his family got a comfortable living off the farm and his strapping sons and daughters inheriting their mothers energy were all in a fair way to do well in the world there was not a happier household in glen st mary than the holts  miss cornelia returned satisfied from the house up the brook  leslies going to take him she announced  she jumped at the chance  she wants to make a little money to shingle the roof of her house this fall and she didnt know how she was going to manage it  i expect captain jimll be more than interested when he hears that a grandson of the selwyns is coming here  leslie said to tell you she hankered after cherry pie but she couldnt come to tea because she has to go and hunt up her turkeys  theyve strayed away  but she said if there was a piece left for you to put it in the pantry and shed run over in the cats light when prowlings in order to get it  you dont know anne dearie what good it did my heart to hear leslie send you a message like that laughing like she used to long ago  theres a great change come over her lately  she laughs and jokes like a girl and from her talk i gather shes here real often  every dayor else im over there said anne  i dont know what id do without leslie especially just now when gilbert is so busy  hes hardly ever home except for a few hours in the wee smas  hes really working himself to death  so many of the overharbor people send for him now  they might better be content with their own doctor said miss cornelia  though to be sure i cant blame them for hes a methodist ever since dr blythe brought mrs allonby round folks think he can raise the dead  i believe dr dave is a mite jealousjust like a man he thinks dr blythe has too many newfangled notions  well i says to him it was a newfangled notion saved rhoda allonby  if youd been attending her shed have died and had a tombstone saying it had pleased god to take her away  oh i do like to speak my mind to dr dave  hes bossed the glen for years and he thinks hes forgotten more than other people ever knew  speaking of doctors i wish dr blythed run over and see to that boil on dick moores neck  its getting past leslies skill  im sure i dont know what dick moore wants to start in having boils foras if he wasnt enough trouble without that  do you know dick has taken quite a fancy to me said anne  he follows me round like a dog and smiles like a pleased child when i notice him  does it make you creepy  not at all  i rather like poor dick moore  he seems so pitiful and appealing somehow  you wouldnt think him very appealing if youd see him on his cantankerous days believe me  but im glad you dont mind himits all the nicer for leslie  shell have more to do when her boarder comes  i hope hell be a decent creature  youll probably like himhes a writer  i wonder why people so commonly suppose that if two individuals are both writers they must therefore be hugely congenial said anne rather scornfully  nobody would expect two blacksmiths to be violently attracted toward each other merely because they were both blacksmiths  nevertheless she looked forward to the advent of owen ford with a pleasant sense of expectation  if he were young and likeable he might prove a very pleasant addition to society in four winds  the latchstring of the little house was always out for the race of joseph    chapter 23  owen ford comes  one evening miss cornelia telephoned down to anne  the writer man has just arrived here  im going to drive him down to your place and you can show him the way over to leslies  its shorter than driving round by the other road and im in a mortal hurry  the reese baby has gone and fallen into a pail of hot water at the glen and got nearly scalded to death and they want me right offto put a new skin on the child i presume  mrs reese is always so careless and then expects other people to mend her mistakes  you wont mind will you dearie  his trunk can go down tomorrow  very well said anne  what is he like miss cornelia  youll see what hes like outside when i take him down  as for what hes like inside only the lord who made him knows that  im not going to say another word for every receiver in the glen is down  miss cornelia evidently cant find much fault with mr fords looks or she would find it in spite of the receivers said anne  i conclude therefore susan that mr ford is rather handsome than otherwise  well mrs doctor dear i do enjoy seeing a welllooking man said susan candidly  had i not better get up a snack for him  there is a strawberry pie that would melt in your mouth  no leslie is expecting him and has his supper ready  besides i want that strawberry pie for my own poor man  he wont be home till late so leave the pie and a glass of milk out for him susan  that i will mrs doctor dear  susan is at the helm  after all it is better to give pie to your own men than to strangers who may be only seeking to devour and the doctor himself is as welllooking a man as you often come across  when owen ford came anne secretly admitted as miss cornelia towed him in that he was very welllooking indeed  he was tall and broadshouldered with thick brown hair finelycut nose and chin large and brilliant darkgray eyes  and did you notice his ears and his teeth mrs doctor dear queried susan later on  he has got the nicestshaped ears i ever saw on a mans head  i am choice about ears  when i was young i was scared that i might have to marry a man with ears like flaps  but i need not have worried for never a chance did i have with any kind of ears  anne had not noticed owen fords ears but she did see his teeth as his lips parted over them in a frank and friendly smile  unsmiling his face was rather sad and absent in expression not unlike the melancholy inscrutable hero of annes own early dreams but mirth and humor and charm lighted it up when he smiled  certainly on the outside as miss cornelia said owen ford was a very presentable fellow  you cannot realise how delighted i am to be here mrs blythe he said looking around him with eager interested eyes  i have an odd feeling of coming home  my mother was born and spent her childhood here you know  she used to talk a great deal to me of her old home i know the geography of it as well as of the one i lived in and of course she told me the story of the building of the house and of my grandfathers agonised watch for the royal william  i had thought that so old a house must have vanished years ago or i should have come to see it before this  old houses dont vanish easily on this enchanted coast smiled anne this is a land where all things always seem the samenearly always at least  john selwyns house hasnt even been much changed and outside the rosebushes your grandfather planted for his bride are blooming this very minute  how the thought links me with them  with your leave i must explore the whole place soon  our latchstring will always be out for you promised anne  and do you know that the old sea captain who keeps the four winds light knew john selwyn and his bride well in his boyhood  he told me their story the night i came herethe third bride of the old house  can it be possible  this is a discovery  i must hunt him up  it wont be difficult we are all cronies of captain jim  he will be as eager to see you as you could be to see him  your grandmother shines like a star in his memory  but i think mrs moore is expecting you  ill show you our crosslots road  anne walked with him to the house up the brook over a field that was as white as snow with daisies  a boatload of people were singing far across the harbor  the sound drifted over the water like faint unearthly music windblown across a starlit sea  the big light flashed and beaconed  owen ford looked around him with satisfaction  and so this is four winds he said  i wasnt prepared to find it quite so beautiful in spite of all mothers praises  what colorswhat scenerywhat charm  i shall get as strong as a horse in no time  and if inspiration comes from beauty i should certainly be able to begin my great canadian novel here  you havent begun it yet asked anne  alackaday no  ive never been able to get the right central idea for it  it lurks beyond meit alluresand beckonsand recedesi almost grasp it and it is gone  perhaps amid this peace and loveliness i shall be able to capture it  miss bryant tells me that you write  oh i do little things for children  i havent done much since i was married  andi have no designs on a great canadian novel laughed anne  that is quite beyond me  owen ford laughed too  i dare say it is beyond me as well  all the same i mean to have a try at it some day if i can ever get time  a newspaper man doesnt have much chance for that sort of thing  ive done a good deal of short story writing for the magazines but ive never had the leisure that seems to be necessary for the writing of a book  with three months of liberty i ought to make a start thoughif i could only get the necessary motif for itthe soul of the book  an idea whisked through annes brain with a suddenness that made her jump  but she did not utter it for they had reached the moore house as they entered the yard leslie came out on the veranda from the side door peering through the gloom for some sign of her expected guest she stood just where the warm yellow light flooded her from the open door  she wore a plain dress of cheap creamtinted cotton voile with the usual girdle of crimson  leslie was never without her touch of crimson  she had told anne that she never felt satisfied without a gleam of red somewhere about her if it were only a flower  to anne it always seemed to symbolise leslies glowing pentup personality denied all expression save in that flaming glint  leslies dress was cut a little away at the neck and had short sleeves  her arms gleamed like ivorytinted marble  every exquisite curve of her form was outlined in soft darkness against the light  her hair shone in it like flame  beyond her was a purple sky flowering with stars over the harbor  anne heard her companion give a gasp  even in the dusk she could see the amazement and admiration on his face  who is that beautiful creature he asked  that is mrs moore said anne  she is very lovely isnt she  ii never saw anything like her he answered rather dazedly  i wasnt preparedi didnt expectgood heavens one doesnt expect a goddess for a landlady why if she were clothed in a gown of seapurple with a rope of amethysts in her hair she would be a veritable seaqueen  and she takes in boarders  even goddesses must live said anne  and leslie isnt a goddess shes just a very beautiful woman as human as the rest of us  did miss bryant tell you about mr moore  yeshes mentally deficient or something of the sort isnt he but she said nothing about mrs moore and i supposed shed be the usual hustling country housewife who takes in boarders to earn an honest penny  well thats just what leslie is doing said anne crisply  and it isnt altogether pleasant for her either  i hope you wont mind dick if you do please dont let leslie see it  it would hurt her horribly hes just a big baby and sometimes a rather annoying one  oh i wont mind him  i dont suppose ill be much in the house anyhow except for meals  but what a shame it all is  her life must be a hard one  it is  but she doesnt like to be pitied  leslie had gone back into the house and now met them at the front door she greeted owen ford with cold civility and told him in a businesslike tone that his room and his supper were ready for him dick with a pleased grin shambled upstairs with the valise and owen ford was installed as an inmate of the old house among the willows    chapter 24  the lifebook of captain jim  i have a little brown cocoon of an idea that may possibly expand into a magnificent moth of fulfilment anne told gilbert when she reached home  he had returned earlier than she had expected and was enjoying susans cherry pie  susan herself hovered in the background like a rather grim but beneficent guardian spirit and found as much pleasure in watching gilbert eat pie as he did in eating it   what is your idea he asked  i shant tell you just yetnot till i see if i can bring the thing about  what sort of a chap is ford  oh very nice and quite goodlooking  such beautiful ears doctor dear interjected susan with a relish  he is about thirty or thirtyfive i think and he meditates writing a novel  his voice is pleasant and his smile delightful and he knows how to dress  he looks as if life hadnt been altogether easy for him somehow  owen ford came over the next evening with a note to anne from leslie they spent the sunset time in the garden and then went for a moonlit sail on the harbor in the little boat gilbert had set up for summer outings  they liked owen immensely and had that feeling of having known him for many years which distinguishes the freemasonry of the house of joseph  he is as nice as his ears mrs doctor dear said susan when he had gone  he had told susan that he had never tasted anything like her strawberry shortcake and susans susceptible heart was his forever  he has got a way with him  she reflected as she cleared up the relics of the supper  it is real queer he is not married for a man like that could have anybody for the asking  well maybe he is like me and has not met the right one yet  susan really grew quite romantic in her musings as she washed the supper dishes  two nights later anne took owen ford down to four winds point to introduce him to captain jim  the clover fields along the harbor shore were whitening in the western wind and captain jim had one of his finest sunsets on exhibition  he himself had just returned from a trip over the harbor  i had to go over and tell henry pollack he was dying  everybody else was afraid to tell him  they expected hed take on turrible for hes been dreadful determined to live and been making no end of plans for the fall  his wife thought he oughter be told and that id be the best one to break it to him that he couldnt get better  henry and me are old cronieswe sailed in the gray gull for years together  well i went over and sat down by henrys bed and i says to him says i jest right out plain and simple for if a things got to be told it may as well be told first as last says i mate i reckon youve got your sailing orders this time i was sorter quaking inside for its an awful thing to have to tell a man who haint any idea hes dying that he is  but lo and behold mistress blythe henry looks up at me with those bright old black eyes of his in his wizened face and says says he tell me something i dont know jim boyd if you want to give me information  ive known that for a week  i was too astonished to speak and henry he chuckled  to see you coming in here says he with your face as solemn as a tombstone and sitting down there with your hands clasped over your stomach and passing me out a bluemouldy old item of news like that  itd make a cat laugh jim boyd says he who told you says i stupid like  nobody says he  a week ago tuesday night i was lying here awakeand i jest knew  id suspicioned it before but then i knew  ive been keeping up for the wifes sake and id like to have got that barn built for ebenll never get it right  but anyhow now that youve eased your mind jim put on a smile and tell me something interesting well there it was  theyd been so scared to tell him and he knew it all the time  strange how nature looks out for us aint it and lets us know what we should know when the time comes  did i never tell you the yarn about henry getting the fish hook in his nose mistress blythe  no  well him and me had a laugh over it today  it happened nigh unto thirty years ago  him and me and several more was out mackerel fishing one day  it was a great daynever saw such a school of mackerel in the gulfand in the general excitement henry got quite wild and contrived to stick a fish hook clean through one side of his nose well there he was there was barb on one end and a big piece of lead on the other so it couldnt be pulled out  we wanted to take him ashore at once but henry was game he said hed be jiggered if hed leave a school like that for anything short of lockjaw then he kept fishing away hauling in hand over fist and groaning between times finlly the school passed and we come in with a load i got a file and begun to try to file through that hook  i tried to be as easy as i could but you should have heard henryno you shouldnt either  it was well no ladies were around  henry wasnt a swearing man but hed heard some few matters of that sort along shore in his time and he fished em all out of his recollection and hurled em at me  finlly he declared he couldnt stand it and i had no bowels of compassion  so we hitched up and i drove him to a doctor in charlottetown thirtyfive milesthere werent none nearer in them dayswith that blessed hook still hanging from his nose  when we got there old dr crabb jest took a file and filed that hook jest the same as id tried to do only he werent a mite particular about doing it easy  captain jims visit to his old friend had revived many recollections and he was now in the full tide of reminiscences  henry was asking me today if i remembered the time old father chiniquy blessed alexander macallisters boat  another odd yarnand true as gospel  i was in the boat myself  we went out him and me in alexander macallisters boat one morning at sunrise  besides there was a french boy in the boatcatholic of course  you know old father chiniquy had turned protestant so the catholics hadnt much use for him  well we sat out in the gulf in the broiling sun till noon and not a bite did we get  when we went ashore old father chiniquy had to go so he said in that polite way of his im very sorry i cannot go out with you dis afternoon mr macallister but i leave you my blessing  you will catch a tousand dis afternoon  well we did not catch a thousand but we caught exactly nine hundred and ninetyninethe biggest catch for a small boat on the whole north shore that summer  curious wasnt it  alexander macallister he says to andrew peters well and what do you think of father chiniquy now vell growled andrew i tink de old devil has got a blessing left yet  laws how henry did laugh over that today  do you know who mr ford is captain jim asked anne seeing that captain jims fountain of reminiscence had run out for the present  i want you to guess  captain jim shook his head  i never was any hand at guessing mistress blythe and yet somehow when i come in i thought where have i seen them eyes beforefor i have seen em  think of a september morning many years ago said anne softly think of a ship sailing up the harbora ship long waited for and despaired of  think of the day the royal william came in and the first look you had at the schoolmasters bride  captain jim sprang up  theyre persis selwyns eyes he almost shouted  you cant be her sonyou must be her  grandson yes i am alice selwyns son  captain jim swooped down on owen ford and shook his hand over again  alice selwyns son  lord but youre welcome  manys the time ive wondered where the descendants of the schoolmaster were living  i knew there was none on the island  alicealicethe first baby ever born in that little house  no baby ever brought more joy  ive dandled her a hundred times  it was from my knee she took her first steps alone cant i see her mothers face watching herand it was near sixty years ago  is she living yet  no she died when i was only a boy  oh it doesnt seem right that i should be living to hear that sighed captain jim  but im heartglad to see you  its brought back my youth for a little while  you dont know yet what a boon that is mistress blythe here has the trickshe does it quite often for me  captain jim was still more excited when he discovered that owen ford was what he called a real writing man  he gazed at him as at a superior being  captain jim knew that anne wrote but he had never taken that fact very seriously  captain jim thought women were delightful creatures who ought to have the vote and everything else they wanted bless their hearts but he did not believe they could write  jest look at a mad love he would protest  a woman wrote that and jest look at itone hundred and three chapters when it could all have been told in ten  a writing woman never knows when to stop thats the trouble  the pint of good writing is to know when to stop  mr ford wants to hear some of your stories captain jim said anne tell him the one about the captain who went crazy and imagined he was the flying dutchman  this was captain jims best story  it was a compound of horror and humor and though anne had heard it several times she laughed as heartily and shivered as fearsomely over it as mr ford did  other tales followed for captain jim had an audience after his own heart he told how his vessel had been run down by a steamer how he had been boarded by malay pirates how his ship had caught fire how he helped a political prisoner escape from a south african republic how he had been wrecked one fall on the magdalens and stranded there for the winter how a tiger had broken loose on board ship how his crew had mutinied and marooned him on a barren islandthese and many other tales tragic or humorous or grotesque did captain jim relate  the mystery of the sea the fascination of far lands the lure of adventure the laughter of the worldhis hearers felt and realised them all  owen ford listened with his head on his hand and the first mate purring on his knee his brilliant eyes fastened on captain jims rugged eloquent face  wont you let mr ford see your lifebook captain jim asked anne when captain jim finally declared that yarnspinning must end for the time  oh he dont want to be bothered with that protested captain jim who was secretly dying to show it  i should like nothing better than to see it captain boyd said owen if it is half as wonderful as your tales it will be worth seeing  with pretended reluctance captain jim dug his lifebook out of his old chest and handed it to owen  i reckon you wont care to wrastle long with my old hand o write  i never had much schooling he observed carelessly  just wrote that there to amuse my nephew joe  hes always wanting stories  comes here yesterday and says to me reproachfullike as i was lifting a twentypound codfish out of my boat uncle jim aint a codfish a dumb animal  id been atelling him you see that he must be real kind to dumb animals and never hurt em in any way  i got out of the scrape by saying a codfish was dumb enough but it wasnt an animal but joe didnt look satisfied and i wasnt satisfied myself  youve got to be mighty careful what you tell them little critters  they can see through you  while talking captain jim watched owen ford from the corner of his eye as the latter examined the lifebook and presently observing that his guest was lost in its pages he turned smilingly to his cupboard and proceeded to make a pot of tea  owen ford separated himself from the lifebook with as much reluctance as a miser wrenches himself from his gold long enough to drink his tea and then returned to it hungrily  oh you can take that thing home with you if you want to said captain jim as if the thing were not his most treasured possession i must go down and pull my boat up a bit on the skids  theres a wind coming  did you notice the sky tonight      mackerel skies and mares tails     make tall ships carry short sails  owen ford accepted the offer of the lifebook gladly  on their way home anne told him the story of lost margaret  that old captain is a wonderful old fellow he said  what a life he has led  why the man had more adventures in one week of his life than most of us have in a lifetime  do you really think his tales are all true  i certainly do  i am sure captain jim could not tell a lie and besides all the people about here say that everything happened as he relates it  there used to be plenty of his old shipmates alive to corroborate him  hes one of the last of the old type of pe island seacaptains  they are almost extinct now    chapter 25  the writing of the book  owen ford came over to the little house the next morning in a state of great excitement  mrs blythe this is a wonderful bookabsolutely wonderful  if i could take it and use the material for a book i feel certain i could make the novel of the year out of it  do you suppose captain jim would let me do it  let you  im sure he would be delighted cried anne  i admit that it was what was in my head when i took you down last night  captain jim has always been wishing he could get somebody to write his lifebook properly for him  will you go down to the point with me this evening mrs blythe  ill ask him about that lifebook myself but i want you to tell him that you told me the story of lost margaret and ask him if he will let me use it as a thread of romance with which to weave the stories of the lifebook into a harmonious whole  captain jim was more excited than ever when owen ford told him of his plan  at last his cherished dream was to be realized and his lifebook given to the world  he was also pleased that the story of lost margaret should be woven into it  it will keep her name from being forgotten he said wistfully  thats why i want it put in  well collaborate cried owen delightedly  you will give the soul and i the body  oh well write a famous book between us captain jim and well get right to work  and to think my book is to be writ by the schoolmasters grandson exclaimed captain jim  lad your grandfather was my dearest friend i thought there was nobody like him  i see now why i had to wait so long  it couldnt be writ till the right man come  you belong hereyouve got the soul of this old north shore in youyoure the only one who could write it  it was arranged that the tiny room off the living room at the lighthouse should be given over to owen for a workshop  it was necessary that captain jim should be near him as he wrote for consultation upon many matters of seafaring and gulf lore of which owen was quite ignorant  he began work on the book the very next morning and flung himself into it heart and soul  as for captain jim he was a happy man that summer he looked upon the little room where owen worked as a sacred shrine owen talked everything over with captain jim but he would not let him see the manuscript  you must wait until it is published he said  then youll get it all at once in its best shape  he delved into the treasures of the lifebook and used them freely  he dreamed and brooded over lost margaret until she became a vivid reality to him and lived in his pages  as the book progressed it took possession of him and he worked at it with feverish eagerness  he let anne and leslie read the manuscript and criticise it and the concluding chapter of the book which the critics later on were pleased to call idyllic was modelled upon a suggestion of leslies  anne fairly hugged herself with delight over the success of her idea  i knew when i looked at owen ford that he was the very man for it she told gilbert  both humor and passion were in his face and that together with the art of expression was just what was necessary for the writing of such a book  as mrs rachel would say he was predestined for the part  owen ford wrote in the mornings  the afternoons were generally spent in some merry outing with the blythes  leslie often went too for captain jim took charge of dick frequently in order to set her free they went boating on the harbor and up the three pretty rivers that flowed into it they had clambakes on the bar and musselbakes on the rocks they picked strawberries on the sanddunes they went out codfishing with captain jim they shot plover in the shore fields and wild ducks in the coveat least the men did  in the evenings they rambled in the lowlying daisied shore fields under a golden moon or they sat in the living room at the little house where often the coolness of the sea breeze justified a driftwood fire and talked of the thousand and one things which happy eager clever young people can find to talk about  ever since the day on which she had made her confession to anne leslie had been a changed creature  there was no trace of her old coldness and reserve no shadow of her old bitterness  the girlhood of which she had been cheated seemed to come back to her with the ripeness of womanhood she expanded like a flower of flame and perfume no laugh was readier than hers no wit quicker in the twilight circles of that enchanted summer  when she could not be with them all felt that some exquisite savor was lacking in their intercourse  her beauty was illumined by the awakened soul within as some rosy lamp might shine through a flawless vase of alabaster  there were hours when annes eyes seemed to ache with the splendor of her  as for owen ford the margaret of his book although she had the soft brown hair and elfin face of the real girl who had vanished so long ago pillowed where lost atlantis sleeps had the personality of leslie moore as it was revealed to him in those halcyon days at four winds harbor  all in all it was a nevertobeforgotten summerone of those summers which come seldom into any life but leave a rich heritage of beautiful memories in their goingone of those summers which in a fortunate combination of delightful weather delightful friends and delightful doings come as near to perfection as anything can come in this world  too good to last anne told herself with a little sigh on the september day when a certain nip in the wind and a certain shade of intense blue on the gulf water said that autumn was hard by  that evening owen ford told them that he had finished his book and that his vacation must come to an end  i have a good deal to do to it yetrevising and pruning and so forth he said but in the main its done  i wrote the last sentence this morning  if i can find a publisher for it it will probably be out next summer or fall  owen had not much doubt that he would find a publisher  he knew that he had written a great booka book that would score a wonderful successa book that would live  he knew that it would bring him both fame and fortune but when he had written the last line of it he had bowed his head on the manuscript and so sat for a long time  and his thoughts were not of the good work he had done    chapter 26  owen fords confession  im so sorry gilbert is away said anne  he had to goallan lyons at the glen has met with a serious accident  he will not likely be home till very late  but he told me to tell you hed be up and over early enough in the morning to see you before you left  its too provoking  susan and i had planned such a nice little jamboree for your last night here  she was sitting beside the garden brook on the little rustic seat gilbert had built  owen ford stood before her leaning against the bronze column of a yellow birch  he was very pale and his face bore the marks of the preceding sleepless night  anne glancing up at him wondered if after all his summer had brought him the strength it should  had he worked too hard over his book  she remembered that for a week he had not been looking well  im rather glad the doctor is away said owen slowly  i wanted to see you alone mrs blythe  there is something i must tell somebody or i think it will drive me mad  ive been trying for a week to look it in the faceand i cant  i know i can trust youand besides you will understand  a woman with eyes like yours always understands  you are one of the folks people instinctively tell things to  mrs blythe i love leslie  love her  that seems too weak a word  his voice suddenly broke with the suppressed passion of his utterance he turned his head away and hid his face on his arm  his whole form shook  anne sat looking at him pale and aghast  she had never thought of this  and yethow was it she had never thought of it  it now seemed a natural and inevitable thing  she wondered at her own blindness  butbutthings like this did not happen in four winds elsewhere in the world human passions might set at defiance human conventions and lawsbut not here surely  leslie had kept summer boarders off and on for ten years and nothing like this had happened but perhaps they had not been like owen ford and the vivid living leslie of this summer was not the cold sullen girl of other years oh somebody should have thought of this  why hadnt miss cornelia thought of it  miss cornelia was always ready enough to sound the alarm where men were concerned anne felt an unreasonable resentment against miss cornelia  then she gave a little inward groan  no matter who was to blame the mischief was done  and lesliewhat of leslie it was for leslie anne felt most concerned  does leslie know this mr ford she asked quietly  nonounless she has guessed it  you surely dont think id be cad and scoundrel enough to tell her mrs blythe  i couldnt help loving herthats alland my misery is greater than i can bear  does she care asked anne  the moment the question crossed her lips she felt that she should not have asked it  owen ford answered it with overeager protest  nono of course not  but i could make her care if she were freei know i could  she does careand he knows it thought anne  aloud she said sympathetically but decidedly  but she is not free mr ford  and the only thing you can do is to go away in silence and leave her to her own life  i knowi know groaned owen  he sat down on the grassy bank and stared moodily into the amber water beneath him  i know theres nothing to donothing but to say conventionally goodbye mrs moore  thank you for all your kindness to me this summer just as i would have said it to the sonsy bustling keeneyed housewife i expected her to be when i came  then ill pay my board money like any honest boarder and go  oh its very simple  no doubtno perplexitya straight road to the end of the world  and ill walk ityou neednt fear that i wont mrs blythe  but it would be easier to walk over redhot ploughshares  anne flinched with the pain of his voice  and there was so little she could say that would be adequate to the situation  blame was out of the questionadvice was not neededsympathy was mocked by the mans stark agony  she could only feel with him in a maze of compassion and regret  her heart ached for leslie  had not that poor girl suffered enough without this  it wouldnt be so hard to go and leave her if she were only happy resumed owen passionately  but to think of her living deathto realise what it is to which i do leave her  that is the worst of all i would give my life to make her happyand i can do nothing even to help hernothing  she is bound forever to that poor wretchwith nothing to look forward to but growing old in a succession of empty meaningless barren years  it drives me mad to think of it  but i must go through my life never seeing her but always knowing what she is enduring  its hideoushideous  it is very hard said anne sorrowfully  weher friends hereall know how hard it is for her  and she is so richly fitted for life said owen rebelliously  her beauty is the least of her dowerand she is the most beautiful woman ive ever known  that laugh of hers  ive angled all summer to evoke that laugh just for the delight of hearing it  and her eyesthey are as deep and blue as the gulf out there  i never saw such bluenessand gold  did you ever see her hair down mrs blythe  no  i didonce  i had gone down to the point to go fishing with captain jim but it was too rough to go out so i came back  she had taken the opportunity of what she expected to be an afternoon alone to wash her hair and she was standing on the veranda in the sunshine to dry it it fell all about her to her feet in a fountain of living gold  when she saw me she hurried in and the wind caught her hair and swirled it all around herdanae in her cloud  somehow just then the knowledge that i loved her came home to meand realised that i had loved her from the moment i first saw her standing against the darkness in that glow of light  and she must live on herepetting and soothing dick pinching and saving for a mere existence while i spend my life longing vainly for her and debarred by that very fact from even giving her the little help a friend might  i walked the shore last night almost till dawn and thrashed it all out over and over again  and yet in spite of everything i cant find it in my heart to be sorry that i came to four winds  it seems to me that bad as everything is it would be still worse never to have known leslie  its burning searing pain to love her and leave herbut not to have loved her is unthinkable  i suppose all this sounds very crazyall these terrible emotions always do sound foolish when we put them into our inadequate words  they are not meant to be spokenonly felt and endured  i shouldnt have spokenbut it has helpedsome  at least it has given me strength to go away respectably tomorrow morning without making a scene  youll write me now and then wont you mrs blythe and give me what news there is to give of her  yes said anne  oh im so sorry you are goingwell miss you soweve all been such friends  if it were not for this you could come back other summers  perhaps even yetbyandbywhen youve forgotten perhaps  i shall never forgetand i shall never come back to four winds said owen briefly  silence and twilight fell over the garden  far away the sea was lapping gently and monotonously on the bar  the wind of evening in the poplars sounded like some sad weird old runesome broken dream of old memories  a slender shapely young aspen rose up before them against the fine maize and emerald and paling rose of the western sky which brought out every leaf and twig in dark tremulous elfin loveliness  isnt that beautiful said owen pointing to it with the air of a man who puts a certain conversation behind him  its so beautiful that it hurts me said anne softly  perfect things like that always did hurt mei remember i called it the queer ache when i was a child  what is the reason that pain like this seems inseparable from perfection  is it the pain of finalitywhen we realise that there can be nothing beyond but retrogression  perhaps said owen dreamily it is the prisoned infinite in us calling out to its kindred infinite as expressed in that visible perfection  you seem to have a cold in the head  better rub some tallow on your nose when you go to bed said miss cornelia who had come in through the little gate between the firs in time to catch owens last remark miss cornelia liked owen but it was a matter of principle with her to visit any highfalutin language from a man with a snub  miss cornelia personated the comedy that ever peeps around the corner at the tragedy of life  anne whose nerves had been rather strained laughed hysterically and even owen smiled  certainly sentiment and passion had a way of shrinking out of sight in miss cornelias presence  and yet to anne nothing seemed quite as hopeless and dark and painful as it had seemed a few moments before  but sleep was far from her eyes that night    chapter 27  on the sand bar  owen ford left four winds the next morning  in the evening anne went over to see leslie but found nobody  the house was locked and there was no light in any window  it looked like a home left soulless leslie did not run over on the following daywhich anne thought a bad sign  gilbert having occasion to go in the evening to the fishing cove anne drove with him to the point intending to stay awhile with captain jim but the great light cutting its swathes through the fog of the autumn evening was in care of alec boyd and captain jim was away  what will you do asked gilbert  come with me  i dont want to go to the covebut ill go over the channel with you and roam about on the sand shore till you come back  the rock shore is too slippery and grim tonight  alone on the sands of the bar anne gave herself up to the eerie charm of the night  it was warm for september and the late afternoon had been very foggy but a full moon had in part lessened the fog and transformed the harbor and the gulf and the surrounding shores into a strange fantastic unreal world of pale silver mist through which everything loomed phantomlike  captain josiah crawfords black schooner sailing down the channel laden with potatoes for bluenose ports was a spectral ship bound for a far uncharted land ever receding never to be reached  the calls of unseen gulls overhead were the cries of the souls of doomed seamen  the little curls of foam that blew across the sand were elfin things stealing up from the seacaves the big roundshouldered sanddunes were the sleeping giants of some old northern tale  the lights that glimmered palely across the harbor were the delusive beacons on some coast of fairyland  anne pleased herself with a hundred fancies as she wandered through the mist  it was delightfulromanticmysterious to be roaming here alone on this enchanted shore  but was she alone  something loomed in the mist before hertook shape and formsuddenly moved towards her across the waverippled sand  leslie exclaimed anne in amazement  whatever are you doingheretonight  if it comes to that whatever are you doing here said leslie trying to laugh  the effort was a failure  she looked very pale and tired but the love locks under her scarlet cap were curling about her face and eyes like little sparkling rings of gold  im waiting for gilberthes over at the cove  i intended to stay at the light but captain jim is away  well i came here because i wanted to walkand walkand walk said leslie restlessly  i couldnt on the rock shorethe tide was too high and the rocks prisoned me  i had to come hereor i should have gone mad i think  i rowed myself over the channel in captain jims flat  ive been here for an hour  comecomelet us walk  i cant stand still  oh anne  leslie dearest what is the trouble asked anne though she knew too well already  i cant tell youdont ask me  i wouldnt mind your knowingi wish you did knowbut i cant tell youi cant tell anyone  ive been such a fool anneand oh it hurts so terribly to be a fool  theres nothing so painful in the world  she laughed bitterly  anne slipped her arm around her  leslie is it that you have learned to care for mr ford  leslie turned herself about passionately  how did you know she cried  anne how did you know  oh is it written in my face for everyone to see  is it as plain as that  no no  ii cant tell you how i knew  it just came into my mind somehow  leslie dont look at me like that  do you despise me demanded leslie in a fierce low tone  do you think im wickedunwomanly  or do you think im just plain fool  i dont think you any of those things  come dear lets just talk it over sensibly as we might talk over any other of the great crises of life  youve been brooding over it and let yourself drift into a morbid view of it  you know you have a little tendency to do that about everything that goes wrong and you promised me that you would fight against it  butoh its soso shameful murmured leslie  to love himunsoughtand when im not free to love anybody  theres nothing shameful about it  but im very sorry that you have learned to care for owen because as things are it will only make you more unhappy  i didnt learn to care said leslie walking on and speaking passionately  if it had been like that i could have prevented it  i never dreamed of such a thing until that day a week ago when he told me he had finished his book and must soon go away  thenthen i knew i felt as if someone had struck me a terrible blow  i didnt say anythingi couldnt speakbut i dont know what i looked like  im so afraid my face betrayed me  oh i would die of shame if i thought he knewor suspected  anne was miserably silent hampered by her deductions from her conversation with owen  leslie went on feverishly as if she found relief in speech  i was so happy all this summer annehappier than i ever was in my life  i thought it was because everything had been made clear between you and me and that it was our friendship which made life seem so beautiful and full once more  and it was in partbut not alloh not nearly all  i know now why everything was so different  and now its all overand he has gone  how can i live anne  when i turned back into the house this morning after he had gone the solitude struck me like a blow in the face  it wont seem so hard by and by dear said anne who always felt the pain of her friends so keenly that she could not speak easy fluent words of comforting  besides she remembered how wellmeant speeches had hurt her in her own sorrow and was afraid  oh it seems to me it will grow harder all the time said leslie miserably  ive nothing to look forward to  morning will come after morningand he will not come backhe will never come back  oh when i think that i will never see him again i feel as if a great brutal hand had twisted itself among my heartstrings and was wrenching them once long ago i dreamed of loveand i thought it must be beautifuland nowits like this  when he went away yesterday morning he was so cold and indifferent  he said goodbye mrs moore in the coldest tone in the worldas if we had not even been friendsas if i meant absolutely nothing to him  i know i donti didnt want him to carebut he might have been a little kinder  oh i wish gilbert would come thought anne  she was racked between her sympathy for leslie and the necessity of avoiding anything that would betray owens confidence  she knew why his goodbye had been so coldwhy it could not have the cordiality that their goodcomradeship demandedbut she could not tell leslie  i couldnt help it annei couldnt help it said poor leslie  i know that  do you blame me so very much  i dont blame you at all  and you wontyou wont tell gilbert  leslie  do you think i would do such a thing  oh i dont knowyou and gilbert are such chums  i dont see how you could help telling him everything  everything about my own concernsyes  but not my friends secrets  i couldnt have him know  but im glad you know  i would feel guilty if there were anything i was ashamed to tell you  i hope miss cornelia wont find out  sometimes i feel as if those terrible kind brown eyes of hers read my very soul  oh i wish this mist would never lifti wish i could just stay in it forever hidden away from every living being  i dont see how i can go on with life  this summer has been so full  i never was lonely for a moment  before owen came there used to be horrible momentswhen i had been with you and gilbertand then had to leave you  you two would walk away together and i would walk away alone  after owen came he was always there to walk home with mewe would laugh and talk as you and gilbert were doingthere were no more lonely envious moments for me  and now  oh yes ive been a fool lets have done talking about my folly  ill never bore you with it again  here is gilbert and you are coming back with us said anne who had no intention of leaving leslie to wander alone on the sandbar on such a night and in such a mood  theres plenty of room in our boat for three and well tie the flat on behind  oh i suppose i must reconcile myself to being the odd one again said poor leslie with another bitter laugh  forgive me annethat was hateful  i ought to be thankfuland i amthat i have two good friends who are glad to count me in as a third  dont mind my hateful speeches  i just seem to be one great pain all over and everything hurts me  leslie seemed very quiet tonight didnt she said gilbert when he and anne reached home  what in the world was she doing over there on the bar alone  oh she was tiredand you know she likes to go to the shore after one of dicks bad days  what a pity she hadnt met and married a fellow like ford long ago ruminated gilbert  theyd have made an ideal couple wouldnt they  for pitys sake gilbert dont develop into a matchmaker  its an abominable profession for a man cried anne rather sharply afraid that gilbert might blunder on the truth if he kept on in this strain  bless us annegirl im not matchmaking protested gilbert rather surprised at her tone  i was only thinking of one of the mighthavebeens  well dont  its a waste of time said anne  then she added suddenly  oh gilbert i wish everybody could be as happy as we are    chapter 28  odds and ends  ive been reading obituary notices said miss cornelia laying down the daily enterprise and taking up her sewing  the harbor was lying black and sullen under a dour november sky the wet dead leaves clung drenched and sodden to the window sills but the little house was gay with firelight and springlike with annes ferns and geraniums  its always summer here anne leslie had said one day and all who were the guests of that house of dreams felt the same  the enterprise seems to run to obituaries these days quoth miss cornelia  it always has a couple of columns of them and i read every line  its one of my forms of recreation especially when theres some original poetry attached to them  heres a choice sample for you      shes gone to be with her maker     never more to roam     she used to play and sing with joy     the song of home sweet home  who says we havent any poetical talent on the island  have you ever noticed what heaps of good people die anne dearie  its kind of pitiful  heres ten obituaries and every one of them saints and models even the men  heres old peter stimson who has left a large circle of friends to mourn his untimely loss lord anne dearie that man was eighty and everybody who knew him had been wishing him dead these thirty years  read obituaries when youre blue anne dearieespecially the ones of folks you know  if youve any sense of humor at all theyll cheer you up believe me  i just wish i had the writing of the obituaries of some people  isnt obituary an awful ugly word  this very peter ive been speaking of had a face exactly like one  i never saw it but i thought of the word obituary then and there  theres only one uglier word that i know of and thats relict lord anne dearie i may be an old maid but theres this comfort in itill never be any mans relict  it is an ugly word said anne laughing  avonlea graveyard was full of old tombstones sacred to the memory of soandso relict of the late soandso  it always made me think of something worn out and moth eaten  why is it that so many of the words connected with death are so disagreeable  i do wish that the custom of calling a dead body the remains could be abolished  i positively shiver when i hear the undertaker say at a funeral all who wish to see the remains please step this way  it always gives me the horrible impression that i am about to view the scene of a cannibal feast  well all i hope said miss cornelia calmly is that when im dead nobody will call me our departed sister  i took a scunner at this sisterandbrothering business five years ago when there was a travelling evangelist holding meetings at the glen  i hadnt any use for him from the start  i felt in my bones that there was something wrong with him  and there was  mind you he was pretending to be a presbyterianpresbytarian he called itand all the time he was a methodist  he brothered and sistered everybody  he had a large circle of relations that man had  he clutched my hand fervently one night and said imploringly my dear sister bryant are you a christian  i just looked him over a bit and then i said calmly the only brother i ever had mr fiske was buried fifteen years ago and i havent adopted any since  as for being a christian i was that i hope and believe when you were crawling about the floor in petticoats  that squelched him believe me  mind you anne dearie im not down on all evangelists  weve had some real fine earnest men who did a lot of good and made the old sinners squirm  but this fiskeman wasnt one of them  i had a good laugh all to myself one evening  fiske had asked all who were christians to stand up  i didnt believe me  i never had any use for that sort of thing  but most of them did and then he asked all who wanted to be christians to stand up  nobody stirred for a spell so fiske started up a hymn at the top of his voice  just in front of me poor little ikey baker was sitting in the millison pew  he was a home boy ten years old and millison just about worked him to death  the poor little creature was always so tired he fell asleep right off whenever he went to church or anywhere he could sit still for a few minutes  hed been sleeping all through the meeting and i was thankful to see the poor child getting a rest believe me  well when fiskes voice went soaring skyward and the rest joined in poor ikey wakened with a start  he thought it was just an ordinary singing and that everybody ought to stand up so he scrambled to his feet mighty quick knowing hed get a combing down from maria millison for sleeping in meeting  fiske saw him stopped and shouted another soul saved glory hallelujah  and there was poor frightened ikey only half awake and yawning never thinking about his soul at all  poor child he never had time to think of anything but his tired overworked little body  leslie went one night and the fiskeman got right after heroh he was especially anxious about the souls of the nicelooking girls believe meand he hurt her feelings so she never went again  and then he prayed every night after that right in public that the lord would soften her hard heart  finally i went to mr leavitt our minister then and told him if he didnt make fiske stop that id just rise up the next night and throw my hymn book at him when he mentioned that beautiful but unrepentant young woman  id have done it too believe me  mr leavitt did put a stop to it but fiske kept on with his meetings until charley douglas put an end to his career in the glen  mrs charley had been out in california all winter  shed been real melancholy in the fallreligious melancholyit ran in her family  her father worried so much over believing that he had committed the unpardonable sin that he died in the asylum  so when rose douglas got that way charley packed her off to visit her sister in los angeles  she got perfectly well and came home just when the fiske revival was in full swing  she stepped off the train at the glen real smiling and chipper and the first thing she saw staring her in the face on the black gableend of the freight shed was the question in big white letters two feet high whither goest thouto heaven or hell that had been one of fiskes ideas and he had got henry hammond to paint it  rose just gave a shriek and fainted and when they got her home she was worse than ever  charley douglas went to mr leavitt and told him that every douglas would leave the church if fiske was kept there any longer  mr leavitt had to give in for the douglases paid half his salary so fiske departed and we had to depend on our bibles once more for instructions on how to get to heaven  after he was gone mr leavitt found out he was just a masquerading methodist and he felt pretty sick believe me  mr leavitt fell short in some ways but he was a good sound presbyterian  by the way i had a letter from mr ford yesterday said anne  he asked me to remember him kindly to you  i dont want his remembrances said miss cornelia curtly  why said anne in astonishment  i thought you liked him  well so i did in a kind of way  but ill never forgive him for what he done to leslie  theres that poor child eating her heart out about himas if she hadnt had trouble enoughand him ranting round toronto ive no doubt enjoying himself same as ever  just like a man  oh miss cornelia how did you find out  lord anne dearie ive got eyes havent i  and ive known leslie since she was a baby  theres been a new kind of heartbreak in her eyes all the fall and i know that writerman was behind it somehow ill never forgive myself for being the means of bringing him here but i never expected hed be like he was  i thought hed just be like the other men leslie had boardedconceited young asses every one of them that she never had any use for  one of them did try to flirt with her once and she froze him outso bad i feel sure hes never got himself thawed since  so i never thought of any danger  dont let leslie suspect you know her secret said anne hurriedly i think it would hurt her  trust me anne dearie  i wasnt born yesterday  oh a plague on all the men  one of them ruined leslies life to begin with and now another of the tribe comes and makes her still more wretched  anne this world is an awful place believe me      theres something in the world amiss     will be unriddled by and by  quoted anne dreamily  if it is itll be in a world where there arent any men said miss cornelia gloomily  what have the men been doing now asked gilbert entering  mischiefmischief  what else did they ever do  it was eve ate the apple miss cornelia  twas a hecreature tempted her retorted miss cornelia triumphantly  leslie after her first anguish was over found it possible to go on with life after all as most of us do no matter what our particular form of torment has been  it is even possible that she enjoyed moments of it when she was one of the gay circle in the little house of dreams  but if anne ever hoped that she was forgetting owen ford she would have been undeceived by the furtive hunger in leslies eyes whenever his name was mentioned  pitiful to that hunger anne always contrived to tell captain jim or gilbert bits of news from owens letters when leslie was with them  the girls flush and pallor at such moments spoke all too eloquently of the emotion that filled her being but she never spoke of him to anne or mentioned that night on the sandbar  one day her old dog died and she grieved bitterly over him  hes been my friend so long she said sorrowfully to anne  he was dicks old dog you knowdick had him for a year or so before we were married  he left him with me when he sailed on the four sisters carlo got very fond of meand his doglove helped me through that first dreadful year after mother died when i was alone  when i heard that dick was coming back i was afraid carlo wouldnt be so much mine but he never seemed to care for dick though he had been so fond of him once  he would snap and growl at him as if he were a stranger  i was glad  it was nice to have one thing whose love was all mine  that old dog has been such a comfort to me anne  he got so feeble in the fall that i was afraid he couldnt live longbut i hoped i could nurse him through the winter  he seemed pretty well this morning  he was lying on the rug before the fire then all at once he got up and crept over to me he put his head on my lap and gave me one loving look out of his big soft dog eyesand then he just shivered and died  i shall miss him so  let me give you another dog leslie said anne  im getting a lovely gordon setter for a christmas present for gilbert  let me give you one too  leslie shook her head  not just now thank you anne  i dont feel like having another dog yet  i dont seem to have any affection left for another  perhapsin timeill let you give me one  i really need one as a kind of protection  but there was something almost human about carloit wouldnt be decent to fill his place too hurriedly dear old fellow  anne went to avonlea a week before christmas and stayed until after the holidays  gilbert came up for her and there was a glad new year celebration at green gables when barrys and blythes and wrights assembled to devour a dinner which had cost mrs rachel and marilla much careful thought and preparation  when they went back to four winds the little house was almost drifted over for the third storm of a winter that was to prove phenomenally stormy had whirled up the harbor and heaped huge snow mountains about everything it encountered but captain jim had shovelled out doors and paths and miss cornelia had come down and kindled the hearthfire  its good to see you back anne dearie  but did you ever see such drifts  you cant see the moore place at all unless you go upstairs lesliell be so glad youre back  shes almost buried alive over there  fortunately dick can shovel snow and thinks its great fun susan sent me word to tell you she would be on hand tomorrow  where are you off to now captain  i reckon ill plough up to the glen and sit a bit with old martin strong  hes not far from his end and hes lonesome  he hasnt many friendsbeen too busy all his life to make any  hes made heaps of money though  well he thought that since he couldnt serve god and mammon hed better stick to mammon said miss cornelia crisply  so he shouldnt complain if he doesnt find mammon very good company now  captain jim went out but remembered something in the yard and turned back for a moment  id a letter from mr ford mistress blythe and he says the lifebook is accepted and is going to be published next fall  i felt fair uplifted when i got the news  to think that im to see it in print at last  that man is clean crazy on the subject of his lifebook said miss cornelia compassionately  for my part i think theres far too many books in the world now    chapter 29  gilbert and anne disagree  gilbert laid down the ponderous medical tome over which he had been poring until the increasing dusk of the march evening made him desist he leaned back in his chair and gazed meditatively out of the window it was early springprobably the ugliest time of the year  not even the sunset could redeem the dead sodden landscape and rotten black harbor ice upon which he looked  no sign of life was visible save a big black crow winging his solitary way across a leaden field  gilbert speculated idly concerning that crow  was he a family crow with a black but comely crow wife awaiting him in the woods beyond the glen or was he a glossy young buck of a crow on courting thoughts intent or was he a cynical bachelor crow believing that he travels the fastest who travels alone  whatever he was he soon disappeared in congenial gloom and gilbert turned to the cheerier view indoors  the firelight flickered from point to point gleaming on the white and green coats of gog and magog on the sleek brown head of the beautiful setter basking on the rug on the picture frames on the walls on the vaseful of daffodils from the window garden on anne herself sitting by her little table with her sewing beside her and her hands clasped over her knee while she traced out pictures in the firecastles in spain whose airy turrets pierced moonlit cloud and sunset barships sailing from the haven of good hopes straight to four winds harbor with precious burthen  for anne was again a dreamer of dreams albeit a grim shape of fear went with her night and day to shadow and darken her visions  gilbert was accustomed to refer to himself as an old married man but he still looked upon anne with the incredulous eyes of a lover  he couldnt wholly believe yet that she was really his  it might be only a dream after all part and parcel of this magic house of dreams  his soul still went on tiptoe before her lest the charm be shattered and the dream dispelled  anne he said slowly lend me your ears  i want to talk with you about something  anne looked across at him through the firelit gloom  what is it she asked gaily  you look fearfully solemn gilbert  i really havent done anything naughty today  ask susan  its not of youor ourselvesi want to talk  its about dick moore  dick moore echoed anne sitting up alertly  why what in the world have you to say about dick moore  ive been thinking a great deal about him lately  do you remember that time last summer i treated him for those carbuncles on his neck  yesyes  i took the opportunity to examine the scars on his head thoroughly ive always thought dick was a very interesting case from a medical point of view  lately ive been studying the history of trephining and the cases where it has been employed  anne i have come to the conclusion that if dick moore were taken to a good hospital and the operation of trephining performed on several places in his skull his memory and faculties might be restored  gilbert annes voice was full of protest  surely you dont mean it  i do indeed  and i have decided that it is my duty to broach the subject to leslie  gilbert blythe you shall not do any such thing cried anne vehemently  oh gilbert you wontyou wont  you couldnt be so cruel  promise me you wont  why annegirl i didnt suppose you would take it like this  be reasonable  i wont be reasonablei cant be reasonablei am reasonable  it is you who are unreasonable  gilbert have you ever once thought what it would mean for leslie if dick moore were to be restored to his right senses  just stop and think  shes unhappy enough now but life as dicks nurse and attendant is a thousand times easier for her than life as dicks wife  i knowi know  its unthinkable  dont you meddle with the matter  leave well enough alone  i have thought over that aspect of the case thoroughly anne  but i believe that a doctor is bound to set the sanctity of a patients mind and body above all other considerations no matter what the consequences may be  i believe it his duty to endeavor to restore health and sanity if there is any hope whatever of it  but dick isnt your patient in that respect cried anne taking another tack  if leslie had asked you if anything could be done for him then it might be your duty to tell her what you really thought but youve no right to meddle  i dont call it meddling  uncle dave told leslie twelve years ago that nothing could be done for dick  she believes that of course  and why did uncle dave tell her that if it wasnt true cried anne triumphantly  doesnt he know as much about it as you  i think notthough it may sound conceited and presumptuous to say it and you know as well as i that he is rather prejudiced against what he calls these newfangled notions of cutting and carving hes even opposed to operating for appendicitis  hes right exclaimed anne with a complete change of front  i believe myself that you modern doctors are entirely too fond of making experiments with human flesh and blood  rhoda allonby would not be a living woman today if i had been afraid of making a certain experiment argued gilbert  i took the riskand saved her life  im sick and tired of hearing about rhoda allonby cried annemost unjustly for gilbert had never mentioned mrs allonbys name since the day he had told anne of his success in regard to her  and he could not be blamed for other peoples discussion of it  gilbert felt rather hurt  i had not expected you to look at the matter as you do anne he said a little stiffly getting up and moving towards the office door  it was their first approach to a quarrel  but anne flew after him and dragged him back  now gilbert you are not going off mad  sit down here and ill apologise beeyewtifully i shouldnt have said that  butoh if you knew  anne checked herself just in time  she had been on the very verge of betraying leslies secret  knew what a woman feels about it she concluded lamely  i think i do know  ive looked at the matter from every point of viewand ive been driven to the conclusion that it is my duty to tell leslie that i believe it is possible that dick can be restored to himself there my responsibility ends  it will be for her to decide what she will do  i dont think youve any right to put such a responsibility on her she has enough to bear  she is poorhow could she afford such an operation  that is for her to decide persisted gilbert stubbornly  you say you think that dick can be cured  but are you sure of it  certainly not  nobody could be sure of such a thing  there may have been lesions of the brain itself the effect of which can never be removed  but if as i believe his loss of memory and other faculties is due merely to the pressure on the brain centers of certain depressed areas of bone then he can be cured  but its only a possibility insisted anne  now suppose you tell leslie and she decides to have the operation  it will cost a great deal  she will have to borrow the money or sell her little property and suppose the operation is a failure and dick remains the same  how will she be able to pay back the money she borrows or make a living for herself and that big helpless creature if she sells the farm  oh i knowi know  but it is my duty to tell her  i cant get away from that conviction  oh i know the blythe stubbornness groaned anne  but dont do this solely on your own responsibility  consult doctor dave  i have done so said gilbert reluctantly  and what did he say  in briefas you sayleave well enough alone  apart from his prejudice against newfangled surgery im afraid he looks at the case from your point of viewdont do it for leslies sake  there now cried anne triumphantly  i do think gilbert that you ought to abide by the judgment of a man nearly eighty who has seen a great deal and saved scores of lives himselfsurely his opinion ought to weigh more than a mere boys  thank you  dont laugh  its too serious  thats just my point  it is serious  here is a man who is a helpless burden  he may be restored to reason and usefulness  he was so very useful before interjected anne witheringly  he may be given a chance to make good and redeem the past  his wife doesnt know this  i do  it is therefore my duty to tell her that there is such a possibility  that boiled down is my decision  dont say decision yet gilbert  consult somebody else  ask captain jim what he thinks about it  very well  but ill not promise to abide by his opinion anne  this is something a man must decide for himself  my conscience would never be easy if i kept silent on the subject  oh your conscience moaned anne  i suppose that uncle dave has a conscience too hasnt he  yes  but i am not the keeper of his conscience  come anne if this affair did not concern leslieif it were a purely abstract case you would agree with meyou know you would  i wouldnt vowed anne trying to believe it herself  oh you can argue all night gilbert but you wont convince me  just you ask miss cornelia what she thinks of it  youre driven to the last ditch anne when you bring up miss cornelia as a reinforcement  she will say just like a man and rage furiously  no matter  this is no affair for miss cornelia to settle leslie alone must decide it  you know very well how she will decide it said anne almost in tears  she has ideals of duty too  i dont see how you can take such a responsibility on your shoulders  i couldnt      because right is right to follow right     were wisdom in the scorn of consequence  quoted gilbert  oh you think a couplet of poetry a convincing argument scoffed anne  that is so like a man  and then she laughed in spite of herself  it sounded so like an echo of miss cornelia  well if you wont accept tennyson as an authority perhaps you will believe the words of a greater than he said gilbert seriously  ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free  i believe that anne with all my heart  its the greatest and grandest verse in the bibleor in any literatureand the truest if there are comparative degrees of trueness  and its the first duty of a man to tell the truth as he sees it and believes it  in this case the truth wont make poor leslie free sighed anne  it will probably end in still more bitter bondage for her  oh gilbert i cant think you are right    chapter 30  leslie decides  a sudden outbreak of a virulent type of influenza at the glen and down at the fishing village kept gilbert so busy for the next fortnight that he had no time to pay the promised visit to captain jim  anne hoped against hope that he had abandoned the idea about dick moore and resolving to let sleeping dogs lie she said no more about the subject but she thought of it incessantly  i wonder if it would be right for me to tell him that leslie cares for owen she thought  he would never let her suspect that he knew so her pride would not suffer and it might convince him that he should let dick moore alone  shall ishall i  no after all i cannot  a promise is sacred and ive no right to betray leslies secret  but oh i never felt so worried over anything in my life as i do over this its spoiling the springits spoiling everything  one evening gilbert abruptly proposed that they go down and see captain jim  with a sinking heart anne agreed and they set forth  two weeks of kind sunshine had wrought a miracle in the bleak landscape over which gilberts crow had flown  the hills and fields were dry and brown and warm ready to break into bud and blossom the harbor was laughtershaken again the long harbor road was like a gleaming red ribbon down on the dunes a crowd of boys who were out smelt fishing were burning the thick dry sandhill grass of the preceding summer the flames swept over the dunes rosily flinging their cardinal banners against the dark gulf beyond and illuminating the channel and the fishing village  it was a picturesque scene which would at other times have delighted annes eyes but she was not enjoying this walk neither was gilbert  their usual goodcomradeship and josephian community of taste and viewpoint were sadly lacking  annes disapproval of the whole project showed itself in the haughty uplift of her head and the studied politeness of her remarks  gilberts mouth was set in all the blythe obstinacy but his eyes were troubled  he meant to do what he believed to be his duty but to be at outs with anne was a high price to pay  altogether both were glad when they reached the lightand remorseful that they should be glad  captain jim put away the fishing net upon which he was working and welcomed them joyfully  in the searching light of the spring evening he looked older than anne had ever seen him  his hair had grown much grayer and the strong old hand shook a little  but his blue eyes were clear and steady and the staunch soul looked out through them gallant and unafraid  captain jim listened in amazed silence while gilbert said what he had come to say  anne who knew how the old man worshipped leslie felt quite sure that he would side with her although she had not much hope that this would influence gilbert  she was therefore surprised beyond measure when captain jim slowly and sorrowfully but unhesitatingly gave it as his opinion that leslie should be told  oh captain jim i didnt think youd say that she exclaimed reproachfully  i thought you wouldnt want to make more trouble for her  captain jim shook his head  i dont want to  i know how you feel about it mistress blythejust as i feel meself  but it aint our feelings we have to steer by through lifeno no wed make shipwreck mighty often if we did that theres only the one safe compass and weve got to set our course by thatwhat its right to do  i agree with the doctor  if theres a chance for dick leslie should be told of it  theres no two sides to that in my opinion  well said anne giving up in despair wait until miss cornelia gets after you two men  corneliall rake us fore and aft no doubt assented captain jim you women are lovely critters mistress blythe but youre just a mite illogical  youre a highly eddicated lady and cornelia isnt but youre like as two peas when it comes to that  i dunnos youre any the worse for it  logic is a sort of hard merciless thing i reckon now ill brew a cup of tea and well drink it and talk of pleasant things jest to calm our minds a bit  at least captain jims tea and conversation calmed annes mind to such an extent that she did not make gilbert suffer so acutely on the way home as she had deliberately intended to do  she did not refer to the burning question at all but she chatted amiably of other matters and gilbert understood that he was forgiven under protest  captain jim seems very frail and bent this spring  the winter has aged him said anne sadly  i am afraid that he will soon be going to seek lost margaret  i cant bear to think of it  four winds wont be the same place when captain jim sets out to sea agreed gilbert  the following evening he went to the house up the brook  anne wandered dismally around until his return  well what did leslie say she demanded when he came in  very little  i think she felt rather dazed  and is she going to have the operation  she is going to think it over and decide very soon  gilbert flung himself wearily into the easy chair before the fire  he looked tired  it had not been an easy thing for him to tell leslie and the terror that had sprung into her eyes when the meaning of what he told her came home to her was not a pleasant thing to remember now when the die was cast he was beset with doubts of his own wisdom  anne looked at him remorsefully then she slipped down on the rug beside him and laid her glossy red head on his arm  gilbert ive been rather hateful over this  i wont be any more please just call me redheaded and forgive me  by which gilbert understood that no matter what came of it there would be no itoldyousos  but he was not wholly comforted  duty in the abstract is one thing duty in the concrete is quite another especially when the doer is confronted by a womans stricken eyes  some instinct made anne keep away from leslie for the next three days on the third evening leslie came down to the little house and told gilbert that she had made up her mind she would take dick to montreal and have the operation  she was very pale and seemed to have wrapped herself in her old mantle of aloofness  but her eyes had lost the look which had haunted gilbert they were cold and bright and she proceeded to discuss details with him in a crisp businesslike way  there were plans to be made and many things to be thought over  when leslie had got the information she wanted she went home  anne wanted to walk part of the way with her  better not said leslie curtly  todays rain has made the ground damp  goodnight  have i lost my friend said anne with a sigh  if the operation is successful and dick moore finds himself again leslie will retreat into some remote fastness of her soul where none of us can ever find her  perhaps she will leave him said gilbert  leslie would never do that gilbert  her sense of duty is very strong  she told me once that her grandmother west always impressed upon her the fact that when she assumed any responsibility she must never shirk it no matter what the consequences might be  that is one of her cardinal rules  i suppose its very oldfashioned  dont be bitter annegirl  you know you dont think it oldfashionedyou know you have the very same idea of sacredness of assumed responsibilities yourself  and you are right  shirking responsibilities is the curse of our modern lifethe secret of all the unrest and discontent that is seething in the world  thus saith the preacher mocked anne  but under the mockery she felt that he was right and she was very sick at heart for leslie  a week later miss cornelia descended like an avalanche upon the little house  gilbert was away and anne was compelled to bear the shock of the impact alone  miss cornelia hardly waited to get her hat off before she began  anne do you mean to tell me its true what ive heardthat dr blythe has told leslie dick can be cured and that she is going to take him to montreal to have him operated on  yes it is quite true miss cornelia said anne bravely  well its inhuman cruelty thats what it is said miss cornelia violently agitated  i did think dr blythe was a decent man  i didnt think he could have been guilty of this  dr blythe thought it was his duty to tell leslie that there was a chance for dick said anne with spirit and she added loyalty to gilbert getting the better of her i agree with him  oh no you dont dearie said miss cornelia  no person with any bowels of compassion could  captain jim does  dont quote that old ninny to me cried miss cornelia  and i dont care who agrees with him  thinkthink what it means to that poor hunted harried girl  we do think of it  but gilbert believes that a doctor should put the welfare of a patients mind and body before all other considerations  thats just like a man  but i expected better things of you anne said miss cornelia more in sorrow than in wrath then she proceeded to bombard anne with precisely the same arguments with which the latter had attacked gilbert and anne valiantly defended her husband with the weapons he had used for his own protection  long was the fray but miss cornelia made an end at last  its an iniquitous shame she declared almost in tears  thats just what it isan iniquitous shame  poor poor leslie  dont you think dick should be considered a little too pleaded anne  dick  dick moore  hes happy enough  hes a better behaved and more reputable member of society now than he ever was before  why he was a drunkard and perhaps worse  are you going to set him loose again to roar and to devour  he may reform said poor anne beset by foe without and traitor within  reform your grandmother retorted miss cornelia  dick moore got the injuries that left him as he is in a drunken brawl  he deserves his fate  it was sent on him for a punishment  i dont believe the doctor has any business to tamper with the visitations of god  nobody knows how dick was hurt miss cornelia  it may not have been in a drunken brawl at all  he may have been waylaid and robbed  pigs may whistle but theyve poor mouths for it said miss cornelia well the gist of what you tell me is that the thing is settled and theres no use in talking  if thats so ill hold my tongue  i dont propose to wear my teeth out gnawing files  when a thing has to be i give in to it  but i like to make mighty sure first that it has to be now ill devote my energies to comforting and sustaining leslie  and after all added miss cornelia brightening up hopefully perhaps nothing can be done for dick    chapter 31  the truth makes free  leslie having once made up her mind what to do proceeded to do it with characteristic resolution and speed  housecleaning must be finished with first whatever issues of life and death might await beyond  the gray house up the brook was put into flawless order and cleanliness with miss cornelias ready assistance  miss cornelia having said her say to anne and later on to gilbert and captain jimsparing neither of them let it be assurednever spoke of the matter to leslie  she accepted the fact of dicks operation referred to it when necessary in a businesslike way and ignored it when it was not  leslie never attempted to discuss it  she was very cold and quiet during these beautiful spring days  she seldom visited anne and though she was invariably courteous and friendly that very courtesy was as an icy barrier between her and the people of the little house the old jokes and laughter and chumminess of common things could not reach her over it  anne refused to feel hurt  she knew that leslie was in the grip of a hideous dreada dread that wrapped her away from all little glimpses of happiness and hours of pleasure  when one great passion seizes possession of the soul all other feelings are crowded aside  never in all her life had leslie moore shuddered away from the future with more intolerable terror  but she went forward as unswervingly in the path she had elected as the martyrs of old walked their chosen way knowing the end of it to be the fiery agony of the stake  the financial question was settled with greater ease than anne had feared  leslie borrowed the necessary money from captain jim and at her insistence he took a mortgage on the little farm  so that is one thing off the poor girls mind miss cornelia told anne and off mine too  now if dick gets well enough to work again hell be able to earn enough to pay the interest on it and if he doesnt i know captain jimll manage someway that leslie wont have to he said as much to me  im getting old cornelia he said and ive no chick or child of my own  leslie wont take a gift from a living man but mebbe she will from a dead one  so it will be all right as far as that goes  i wish everything else might be settled as satisfactorily  as for that wretch of a dick hes been awful these last few days  the devil was in him believe me  leslie and i couldnt get on with our work for the tricks hed play  he chased all her ducks one day around the yard till most of them died  and not one thing would he do for us  sometimes you know hell make himself quite handy bringing in pails of water and wood  but this week if we sent him to the well hed try to climb down into it  i thought once if youd only shoot down there headfirst everything would be nicely settled  oh miss cornelia  now you neednt miss cornelia me anne dearie  anybody would have thought the same  if the montreal doctors can make a rational creature out of dick moore theyre wonders  leslie took dick to montreal early in may  gilbert went with her to help her and make the necessary arrangements for her  he came home with the report that the montreal surgeon whom they had consulted agreed with him that there was a good chance of dicks restoration  very comforting was miss cornelias sarcastic comment  anne only sighed  leslie had been very distant at their parting  but she had promised to write  ten days after gilberts return the letter came  leslie wrote that the operation had been successfully performed and that dick was making a good recovery  what does she mean by successfully asked anne  does she mean that dicks memory is really restored  not likelysince she says nothing of it said gilbert  she uses the word successfully from the surgeons point of view  the operation has been performed and followed by normal results  but it is too soon to know whether dicks faculties will be eventually restored wholly or in part  his memory would not be likely to return to him all at once  the process will be gradual if it occurs at all  is that all she says  yestheres her letter  its very short  poor girl she must be under a terrible strain  gilbert blythe there are heaps of things i long to say to you only it would be mean  miss cornelia says them for you said gilbert with a rueful smile she combs me down every time i encounter her  she makes it plain to me that she regards me as little better than a murderer and that she thinks it a great pity that dr dave ever let me step into his shoes she even told me that the methodist doctor over the harbor was to be preferred before me  with miss cornelia the force of condemnation can no further go  if cornelia bryant was sick it would not be doctor dave or the methodist doctor she would send for sniffed susan  she would have you out of your hardearned bed in the middle of the night doctor dear if she took a spell of misery that she would  and then she would likely say your bill was past all reason  but do not mind her doctor dear  it takes all kinds of people to make a world  no further word came from leslie for some time  the may days crept away in a sweet succession and the shores of four winds harbor greened and bloomed and purpled  one day in late may gilbert came home to be met by susan in the stable yard  i am afraid something has upset mrs doctor doctor dear she said mysteriously  she got a letter this afternoon and since then she has just been walking round the garden and talking to herself  you know it is not good for her to be on her feet so much doctor dear  she did not see fit to tell me what her news was and i am no pry doctor dear and never was but it is plain something has upset her  and it is not good for her to be upset  gilbert hurried rather anxiously to the garden  had anything happened at green gables  but anne sitting on the rustic seat by the brook did not look troubled though she was certainly much excited  her eyes were their grayest and scarlet spots burned on her cheeks  what has happened anne  anne gave a queer little laugh  i think youll hardly believe it when i tell you gilbert  i cant believe it yet  as susan said the other day i feel like a fly coming to live in the sundazedlike  its all so incredible  ive read the letter a score of times and every time its just the samei cant believe my own eyes  oh gilbert you were rightso right  i can see that clearly enough nowand im so ashamed of myselfand will you ever really forgive me  anne ill shake you if you dont grow coherent  redmond would be ashamed of you  what has happened  you wont believe ityou wont believe it  im going to phone for uncle dave said gilbert pretending to start for the house  sit down gilbert  ill try to tell you  ive had a letter and oh gilbert its all so amazingso incredibly amazingwe never thoughtnot one of us ever dreamed  i suppose said gilbert sitting down with a resigned air the only thing to do in a case of this kind is to have patience and go at the matter categorically  whom is your letter from  leslieand oh gilbert  leslie  whew  what has she to say  whats the news about dick  anne lifted the letter and held it out calmly dramatic in a moment  there is no dick  the man we have thought dick moorewhom everybody in four winds has believed for twelve years to be dick mooreis his cousin george moore of nova scotia who it seems always resembled him very strikingly  dick moore died of yellow fever thirteen years ago in cuba    chapter 32  miss cornelia discusses the affair  and do you mean to tell me anne dearie that dick moore has turned out not to be dick moore at all but somebody else  is that what you phoned up to me today  yes miss cornelia  it is very amazing isnt it  itsitsjust like a man said miss cornelia helplessly  she took off her hat with trembling fingers  for once in her life miss cornelia was undeniably staggered  i cant seem to sense it anne she said  ive heard you say itand i believe youbut i cant take it in  dick moore is deadhas been dead all these yearsand leslie is free  yes  the truth has made her free  gilbert was right when he said that verse was the grandest in the bible  tell me everything anne dearie  since i got your phone ive been in a regular muddle believe me  cornelia bryant was never so kerflummuxed before  there isnt a very great deal to tell  leslies letter was short she didnt go into particulars  this mangeorge moorehas recovered his memory and knows who he is  he says dick took yellow fever in cuba and the four sisters had to sail without him  george stayed behind to nurse him  but he died very shortly afterwards  george did not write leslie because he intended to come right home and tell her himself  and why didnt he  i suppose his accident must have intervened  gilbert says it is quite likely that george moore remembers nothing of his accident or what led to it and may never remember it  it probably happened very soon after dicks death  we may find out more particulars when leslie writes again  does she say what she is going to do  when is she coming home  she says she will stay with george moore until he can leave the hospital  she has written to his people in nova scotia  it seems that georges only near relative is a married sister much older than himself  she was living when george sailed on the four sisters but of course we do not know what may have happened since  did you ever see george moore miss cornelia  i did  it is all coming back to me  he was here visiting his uncle abner eighteen years ago when he and dick would be about seventeen they were double cousins you see  their fathers were brothers and their mothers were twin sisters and they did look a terrible lot alike  of course added miss cornelia scornfully it wasnt one of those freak resemblances you read of in novels where two people are so much alike that they can fill each others places and their nearest and dearest cant tell between them  in those days you could tell easy enough which was george and which was dick if you saw them together and near at hand  apart or some distance away it wasnt so easy they played lots of tricks on people and thought it great fun the two scamps  george moore was a little taller and a good deal fatter than dickthough neither of them was what you would call fatthey were both of the lean kind  dick had higher color than george and his hair was a shade lighter  but their features were just alike and they both had that queer freak of eyesone blue and one hazel  they werent much alike in any other way though  george was a real nice fellow though he was a scalawag for mischief and some said he had a liking for a glass even then  but everybody liked him better than dick  he spent about a month here  leslie never saw him she was only about eight or nine then and i remember now that she spent that whole winter over harbor with her grandmother west  captain jim was away toothat was the winter he was wrecked on the magdalens  i dont suppose either he or leslie had ever heard about the nova scotia cousin looking so much like dick  nobody ever thought of him when captain jim brought dickgeorge i should sayhome  of course we all thought dick had changed considerablehed got so lumpish and fat  but we put that down to what had happened to him and no doubt that was the reason for as ive said george wasnt fat to begin with either  and there was no other way we could have guessed for the mans senses were clean gone  i cant see that it is any wonder we were all deceived  but its a staggering thing  and leslie has sacrificed the best years of her life to nursing a man who hadnt any claim on her  oh drat the men  no matter what they do its the wrong thing  and no matter who they are its somebody they shouldnt be  they do exasperate me  gilbert and captain jim are men and it is through them that the truth has been discovered at last said anne  well i admit that conceded miss cornelia reluctantly  im sorry i raked the doctor off so  its the first time in my life ive ever felt ashamed of anything i said to a man  i dont know as i shall tell him so though  hell just have to take it for granted  well anne dearie its a mercy the lord doesnt answer all our prayers  ive been praying hard right along that the operation wouldnt cure dick of course i didnt put it just quite so plain  but that was what was in the back of my mind and i have no doubt the lord knew it  well he has answered the spirit of your prayer  you really wished that things shouldnt be made any harder for leslie  im afraid that in my secret heart ive been hoping the operation wouldnt succeed and i am wholesomely ashamed of it  how does leslie seem to take it  she writes like one dazed  i think that like ourselves she hardly realises it yet  she says it all seems like a strange dream to me anne  that is the only reference she makes to herself  poor child  i suppose when the chains are struck off a prisoner hed feel queer and lost without them for a while  anne dearie heres a thought keeps coming into my mind  what about owen ford  we both know leslie was fond of him  did it ever occur to you that he was fond of her  itdidonce admitted anne feeling that she might say so much  well i hadnt any reason to think he was but it just appeared to me he must be  now anne dearie the lord knows im not a matchmaker and i scorn all such doings  but if i were you and writing to that ford man id just mention casuallike what has happened  that is what id do  of course i will mention it when i write him said anne a trifle distantly  somehow this was a thing she could not discuss with miss cornelia  and yet she had to admit that the same thought had been lurking in her mind ever since she had heard of leslies freedom  but she would not desecrate it by free speech  of course there is no great rush dearie  but dick moores been dead for thirteen years and leslie has wasted enough of her life for him well just see what comes of it  as for this george moore whos gone and come back to life when everyone thought he was dead and done for just like a man im real sorry for him  he wont seem to fit in anywhere  he is still a young man and if he recovers completely as seems likely he will be able to make a place for himself again  it must be very strange for him poor fellow  i suppose all these years since his accident will not exist for him    chapter 33  leslie returns  a fortnight later leslie moore came home alone to the old house where she had spent so many bitter years  in the june twilight she went over the fields to annes and appeared with ghostlike suddenness in the scented garden  leslie cried anne in amazement  where have you sprung from  we never knew you were coming  why didnt you write  we would have met you  i couldnt write somehow anne  it seemed so futile to try to say anything with pen and ink  and i wanted to get back quietly and unobserved  anne put her arms about leslie and kissed her  leslie returned the kiss warmly  she looked pale and tired and she gave a little sigh as she dropped down on the grasses beside a great bed of daffodils that were gleaming through the pale silvery twilight like golden stars  and you have come home alone leslie  yes  george moores sister came to montreal and took him home with her  poor fellow he was sorry to part with methough i was a stranger to him when his memory first came back  he clung to me in those first hard days when he was trying to realise that dicks death was not the thing of yesterday that it seemed to him  it was all very hard for him  i helped him all i could  when his sister came it was easier for him because it seemed to him only the other day that he had seen her last  fortunately she had not changed much and that helped him too  it is all so strange and wonderful leslie  i think we none of us realise it yet  i cannot  when i went into the house over there an hour ago i felt that it must be a dreamthat dick must be there with his childish smile as he had been for so long  anne i seem stunned yet im not glad or sorryor anything  i feel as if something had been torn suddenly out of my life and left a terrible hole  i feel as if i couldnt be ias if i must have changed into somebody else and couldnt get used to it  it gives me a horrible lonely dazed helpless feeling  its good to see you againit seems as if you were a sort of anchor for my drifting soul  oh anne i dread it allthe gossip and wonderment and questioning  when i think of that i wish that i need not have come home at all  dr dave was at the station when i came off the trainhe brought me home  poor old man he feels very badly because he told me years ago that nothing could be done for dick  i honestly thought so leslie he said to me today  but i should have told you not to depend on my opinioni should have told you to go to a specialist  if i had you would have been saved many bitter years and poor george moore many wasted ones  i blame myself very much leslie  i told him not to do thathe had done what he thought right  he has always been so kind to mei couldnt bear to see him worrying over it  and dickgeorge i mean  is his memory fully restored  practically  of course there are a great many details he cant recall yetbut he remembers more and more every day  he went out for a walk on the evening after dick was buried  he had dicks money and watch on him he meant to bring them home to me along with my letter he admits he went to a place where the sailors resortedand he remembers drinkingand nothing else  anne i shall never forget the moment he remembered his own name  i saw him looking at me with an intelligent but puzzled expression  i said do you know me dick he answered i never saw you before  who are you  and my name is not dick  i am george moore and dick died of yellow fever yesterday where am i  what has happened to me  ii fainted anne  and ever since i have felt as if i were in a dream  you will soon adjust yourself to this new state of things leslie and you are younglife is before youyou will have many beautiful years yet  perhaps i shall be able to look at it in that way after a while anne just now i feel too tired and indifferent to think about the future imimanne im lonely  i miss dick  isnt it all very strange do you know i was really fond of poor dickgeorge i suppose i should sayjust as i would have been fond of a helpless child who depended on me for everything  i would never have admitted iti was really ashamed of itbecause you see i had hated and despised dick so much before he went away  when i heard that captain jim was bringing him home i expected i would just feel the same to him  but i never didalthough i continued to loathe him as i remembered him before from the time he came home i felt only pitya pity that hurt and wrung me  i supposed then that it was just because his accident had made him so helpless and changed  but now i believe it was because there was really a different personality there  carlo knew it annei know now that carlo knew it  i always thought it strange that carlo shouldnt have known dick  dogs are usually so faithful  but he knew it was not his master who had come back although none of the rest of us did  i had never seen george moore you know  i remember now that dick once mentioned casually that he had a cousin in nova scotia who looked as much like him as a twin but the thing had gone out of my memory and in any case i would never have thought it of any importance  you see it never occurred to me to question dicks identity  any change in him seemed to me just the result of the accident  oh anne that night in april when gilbert told me he thought dick might be cured  i can never forget it  it seemed to me that i had once been a prisoner in a hideous cage of torture and then the door had been opened and i could get out  i was still chained to the cage but i was not in it  and that night i felt that a merciless hand was drawing me back into the cageback to a torture even more terrible than it had once been  i didnt blame gilbert  i felt he was right and he had been very goodhe said that if in view of the expense and uncertainty of the operation i should decide not to risk it he would not blame me in the least  but i knew how i ought to decideand i couldnt face it  all night i walked the floor like a mad woman trying to compel myself to face it  i couldnt annei thought i couldntand when morning broke i set my teeth and resolved that i wouldnt  i would let things remain as they were  it was very wicked i know  it would have been just punishment for such wickedness if i had just been left to abide by that decision  i kept to it all day that afternoon i had to go up to the glen to do some shopping  it was one of dicks quiet drowsy days so i left him alone  i was gone a little longer than i had expected and he missed me  he felt lonely and when i got home he ran to meet me just like a child with such a pleased smile on his face  somehow anne i just gave way then  that smile on his poor vacant face was more than i could endure  i felt as if i were denying a child the chance to grow and develop  i knew that i must give him his chance no matter what the consequences might be so i came over and told gilbert  oh anne you must have thought me hateful in those weeks before i went away  i didnt mean to bebut i couldnt think of anything except what i had to do and everything and everybody about me were like shadows  i knowi understood leslie  and now it is all overyour chain is brokenthere is no cage  there is no cage repeated leslie absently plucking at the fringing grasses with her slender brown hands  butit doesnt seem as if there were anything else anne  youyou remember what i told you of my folly that night on the sandbar  i find one doesnt get over being a fool very quickly  sometimes i think there are people who are fools forever  and to be a foolof that kindis almost as bad as being aa dog on a chain  you will feel very differently after you get over being tired and bewildered said anne who knowing a certain thing that leslie did not know did not feel herself called upon to waste overmuch sympathy  leslie laid her splendid golden head against annes knee  anyhow i have you she said  life cant be altogether empty with such a friend  anne pat my headjust as if i were a little girlmother me a bitand let me tell you while my stubborn tongue is loosed a little just what you and your comradeship have meant to me since that night i met you on the rock shore    chapter 34  the ship odreams comes to harbor  one morning when a windy golden sunrise was billowing over the gulf in waves of light a certain weary stork flew over the bar of four winds harbor on his way from the land of evening stars  under his wing was tucked a sleepy starryeyed little creature  the stork was tired and he looked wistfully about him  he knew he was somewhere near his destination but he could not yet see it  the big white lighthouse on the red sandstone cliff had its good points but no stork possessed of any gumption would leave a new velvet baby there  an old gray house surrounded by willows in a blossomy brook valley looked more promising but did not seem quite the thing either  the staring green abode further on was manifestly out of the question  then the stork brightened up  he had caught sight of the very placea little white house nestled against a big whispering firwood with a spiral of blue smoke winding up from its kitchen chimneya house which just looked as if it were meant for babies  the stork gave a sigh of satisfaction and softly alighted on the ridgepole  half an hour later gilbert ran down the hall and tapped on the spareroom door  a drowsy voice answered him and in a moment marillas pale scared face peeped out from behind the door  marilla anne has sent me to tell you that a certain young gentleman has arrived here  he hasnt brought much luggage with him but he evidently means to stay  for pitys sake said marilla blankly  you dont mean to tell me gilbert that its all over  why wasnt i called  anne wouldnt let us disturb you when there was no need  nobody was called until about two hours ago  there was no passage perilous this time  andandgilbertwill this baby live  he certainly will  he weighs ten pounds andwhy listen to him nothing wrong with his lungs is there  the nurse says his hair will be red  anne is furious with her and im tickled to death  that was a wonderful day in the little house of dreams  the best dream of all has come true said anne pale and rapturous oh marilla i hardly dare believe it after that horrible day last summer  i have had a heartache ever since thenbut it is gone now  this baby will take joys place said marilla  oh no no no marilla  he cantnothing can ever do that  he has his own place my dear wee manchild  but little joy has hers and always will have it  if she had lived she would have been over a year old  she would have been toddling around on her tiny feet and lisping a few words  i can see her so plainly marilla  oh i know now that captain jim was right when he said god would manage better than that my baby would seem a stranger to me when i found her beyond  ive learned that this past year  ive followed her development day by day and week by weeki always shall  i shall know just how she grows from year to yearand when i meet her again ill know hershe wont be a stranger oh marilla look at his dear darling toes  isnt it strange they should be so perfect  it would be stranger if they werent said marilla crisply  now that all was safely over marilla was herself again  oh i knowbut it seems as if they couldnt be quite finished you knowand they are even to the tiny nails  and his handsjust look at his hands marilla  they appear to be a good deal like hands marilla conceded  see how he clings to my finger  im sure he knows me already  he cries when the nurse takes him away  oh marilla do you thinkyou dont think do youthat his hair is going to be red  i dont see much hair of any color said marilla  i wouldnt worry about it if i were you until it becomes visible  marilla he has hairlook at that fine little down all over his head anyway nurse says his eyes will be hazel and his forehead is exactly like gilberts  and he has the nicest little ears mrs doctor dear said susan the first thing i did was to look at his ears  hair is deceitful and noses and eyes change and you cannot tell what is going to come of them but ears is ears from start to finish and you always know where you are with them  just look at their shapeand they are set right back against his precious head  you will never need to be ashamed of his ears mrs doctor dear  annes convalescence was rapid and happy  folks came and worshipped the baby as people have bowed before the kingship of the newborn since long before the wise men of the east knelt in homage to the royal babe of the bethlehem manger  leslie slowly finding herself amid the new conditions of her life hovered over it like a beautiful goldencrowned madonna  miss cornelia nursed it as knackily as could any mother in israel  captain jim held the small creature in his big brown hands and gazed tenderly at it with eyes that saw the children who had never been born to him  what are you going to call him asked miss cornelia  anne has settled his name answered gilbert  james matthewafter the two finest gentlemen ive ever knownnot even saving your presence said anne with a saucy glance at gilbert  gilbert smiled  i never knew matthew very well he was so shy we boys couldnt get acquainted with himbut i quite agree with you that captain jim is one of the rarest and finest souls god ever clothed in clay  he is so delighted over the fact that we have given his name to our small lad it seems he has no other namesake  well james matthew is a name that will wear well and not fade in the washing said miss cornelia  im glad you didnt load him down with some highfalutin romantic name that hed be ashamed of when he gets to be a grandfather  mrs william drew at the glen has called her baby bertie shakespeare  quite a combination isnt it  and im glad you havent had much trouble picking on a name  some folks have an awful time  when the stanley flaggs first boy was born there was so much rivalry as to who the child should be named for that the poor little soul had to go for two years without a name  then a brother came along and there it wasbig baby and little baby finally they called big baby peter and little baby isaac after the two grandfathers and had them both christened together  and each tried to see if it couldnt howl the other down  you know that highland scotch family of macnabs back of the glen  theyve got twelve boys and the oldest and the youngest are both called neilbig neil and little neil in the same family  well i spose they ran out of names  i have read somewhere laughed anne that the first child is a poem but the tenth is very prosy prose  perhaps mrs macnab thought that the twelfth was merely an old tale retold  well theres something to be said for large families said miss cornelia with a sigh  i was an only child for eight years and i did long for a brother and sister  mother told me to pray for oneand pray i did believe me  well one day aunt nellie came to me and said cornelia there is a little brother for you upstairs in your mas room  you can go up and see him  i was so excited and delighted i just flew upstairs  and old mrs flagg lifted up the baby for me to see  lord anne dearie i never was so disappointed in my life  you see id been praying for a brother two years older than myself  how long did it take you to get over your disappointment asked anne amid her laughter  well i had a spite at providence for a good spell and for weeks i wouldnt even look at the baby  nobody knew why for i never told then he began to get real cute and held out his wee hands to me and i began to get fond of him  but i didnt get really reconciled to him until one day a school chum came to see him and said she thought he was awful small for his age  i just got boiling mad and i sailed right into her and told her she didnt know a nice baby when she saw one and ours was the nicest baby in the world  and after that i just worshipped him  mother died before he was three years old and i was sister and mother to him both  poor little lad he was never strong and he died when he wasnt much over twenty  seems to me id have given anything on earth anne dearie if hed only lived  miss cornelia sighed  gilbert had gone down and leslie who had been crooning over the small james matthew in the dormer window laid him asleep in his basket and went her way  as soon as she was safely out of earshot miss cornelia bent forward and said in a conspirators whisper  anne dearie id a letter from owen ford yesterday  hes in vancouver just now but he wants to know if i can board him for a month later on  you know what that means  well i hope were doing right  weve nothing to do with itwe couldnt prevent him from coming to four winds if he wanted to said anne quickly  she did not like the feeling of matchmaking miss cornelias whispers gave her and then she weakly succumbed herself  dont let leslie know he is coming until he is here she said  if she found out i feel sure she would go away at once  she intends to go in the fall anyhowshe told me so the other day  she is going to montreal to take up nursing and make what she can of her life  oh well anne dearie said miss cornelia nodding sagely that is all as it may be  you and i have done our part and we must leave the rest to higher hands    chapter 35  politics at four winds  when anne came downstairs again the island as well as all canada was in the throes of a campaign preceding a general election  gilbert who was an ardent conservative found himself caught in the vortex being much in demand for speechmaking at the various county rallies  miss cornelia did not approve of his mixing up in politics and told anne so  dr dave never did it  dr blythe will find he is making a mistake believe me  politics is something no decent man should meddle with  is the government of the country to be left solely to the rogues then asked anne  yesso long as its conservative rogues said miss cornelia marching off with the honors of war  men and politicians are all tarred with the same brush  the grits have it laid on thicker than the conservatives thats allconsiderably thicker  but grit or tory my advice to dr blythe is to steer clear of politics  first thing you know hell be running an election himself and going off to ottawa for half the year and leaving his practice to go to the dogs  ah well lets not borrow trouble said anne  the rate of interest is too high  instead lets look at little jem  it should be spelled with a g  isnt he perfectly beautiful  just see the dimples in his elbows  well bring him up to be a good conservative you and i miss cornelia  bring him up to be a good man said miss cornelia  theyre scarce and valuable though mind you i wouldnt like to see him a grit  as for the election you and i may be thankful we dont live over harbor the air there is blue these days  every elliott and crawford and macallister is on the warpath loaded for bear  this side is peaceful and calm seeing theres so few men  captain jims a grit but its my opinion hes ashamed of it for he never talks politics  there isnt any earthly doubt that the conservatives will be returned with a big majority again  miss cornelia was mistaken  on the morning after the election captain jim dropped in at the little house to tell the news  so virulent is the microbe of party politics even in a peaceable old man that captain jims cheeks were flushed and his eyes were flashing with all his oldtime fire  mistress blythe the liberals are in with a sweeping majority  after eighteen years of tory mismanagement this downtrodden country is going to have a chance at last  i never heard you make such a bitter partisan speech before captain jim  i didnt think you had so much political venom in you laughed anne who was not much excited over the tidings  little jem had said wowga that morning  what were principalities and powers the rise and fall of dynasties the overthrow of grit or tory compared with that miraculous occurrence  its been accumulating for a long while said captain jim with a deprecating smile  i thought i was only a moderate grit but when the news came that we were in i found out how gritty i really was  you know the doctor and i are conservatives  ah well its the only bad thing i know of either of you mistress blythe  cornelia is a tory too  i called in on my way from the glen to tell her the news  didnt you know you took your life in your hands  yes but i couldnt resist the temptation  how did she take it  comparatively calm mistress blythe comparatively calm  she says says she well providence sends seasons of humiliation to a country same as to individuals  you grits have been cold and hungry for many a year  make haste to get warmed and fed for you wont be in long well now cornelia i says mebbe providence thinks canada needs a real long spell of humiliation  ah susan have you heard the news the liberals are in  susan had just come in from the kitchen attended by the odor of delectable dishes which always seemed to hover around her  now are they she said with beautiful unconcern  well i never could see but that my bread rose just as light when grits were in as when they were not  and if any party mrs doctor dear will make it rain before the week is out and save our kitchen garden from entire ruination that is the party susan will vote for  in the meantime will you just step out and give me your opinion on the meat for dinner i am fearing that it is very tough and i think that we had better change our butcher as well as our government  one evening a week later anne walked down to the point to see if she could get some fresh fish from captain jim leaving little jem for the first time  it was quite a tragedy  suppose he cried  suppose susan did not know just exactly what to do for him  susan was calm and serene  i have had as much experience with him as you mrs doctor dear have i not  yes with himbut not with other babies  why i looked after three pairs of twins when i was a child susan  when they cried i gave them peppermint or castor oil quite coolly  its quite curious now to recall how lightly i took all those babies and their woes  oh well if little jem cries i will just clap a hot water bag on his little stomach said susan  not too hot you know said anne anxiously  oh was it really wise to go  do not you fret mrs doctor dear  susan is not the woman to burn a wee man  bless him he has no notion of crying  anne tore herself away finally and enjoyed her walk to the point after all through the long shadows of the sunsetting  captain jim was not in the living room of the lighthouse but another man wasa handsome middleaged man with a strong cleanshaven chin who was unknown to anne  nevertheless when she sat down he began to talk to her with all the assurance of an old acquaintance  there was nothing amiss in what he said or the way he said it but anne rather resented such a cool takingforgranted in a complete stranger  her replies were frosty and as few as decency required  nothing daunted her companion talked on for several minutes then excused himself and went away anne could have sworn there was a twinkle in his eye and it annoyed her  who was the creature  there was something vaguely familiar about him but she was certain she had never seen him before  captain jim who was that who just went out she asked as captain jim came in  marshall elliott answered the captain  marshall elliott cried anne  oh captain jimit wasntyes it was his voiceoh captain jim i didnt know himand i was quite insulting to him  why didnt he tell me  he must have seen i didnt know him  he wouldnt say a word about ithed just enjoy the joke  dont worry over snubbing himhell think it fun  yes marshalls shaved off his beard at last and cut his hair  his party is in you know  i didnt know him myself first time i saw him  he was up in carter flaggs store at the glen the night after election day along with a crowd of others waiting for the news  about twelve the phone came throughthe liberals were in  marshall just got up and walked outhe didnt cheer or shouthe left the others to do that and they nearly lifted the roof off carters store i reckon  of course all the tories were over in raymond russells store  not much cheering there marshall went straight down the street to the side door of augustus palmers barber shop  augustus was in bed asleep but marhall hammered on the door until he got up and come down wanting to know what all the racket was about  come into your shop and do the best job you ever did in your life gus said marshall  the liberals are in and youre going to barber a good grit before the sun rises  gus was mad as hopspartly because hed been dragged out of bed but more because hes a tory  he vowed he wouldnt shave any man after twelve at night  youll do what i want you to do sonny said marshall or ill jest turn you over my knee and give you one of those spankings your mother forgot  hed have done it too and gus knew it for marshall is as strong as an ox and gus is only a midget of a man  so he gave in and towed marshall in to the shop and went to work  now says he ill barber you up but if you say one word to me about the grits getting in while im doing it ill cut your throat with this razor says he  you wouldnt have thought mild little gus could be so bloodthirsty would you  shows what party politics will do for a man  marshall kept quiet and got his hair and beard disposed of and went home  when his old housekeeper heard him come upstairs she peeked out of her bedroom door to see whether twas him or the hired boy  and when she saw a strange man striding down the hall with a candle in his hand she screamed blue murder and fainted dead away  they had to send for the doctor before they could bring her to and it was several days before she could look at marshall without shaking all over  captain jim had no fish  he seldom went out in his boat that summer and his long tramping expeditions were over  he spent a great deal of his time sitting by his seaward window looking out over the gulf with his swiftlywhitening head leaning on his hand  he sat there tonight for many silent minutes keeping some tryst with the past which anne would not disturb  presently he pointed to the iris of the west  thats beautiful isnt it mistress blythe  but i wish you could have seen the sunrise this morning  it was a wonderful thingwonderful  ive seen all kinds of sunrises come over that gulf ive been all over the world mistress blythe and take it all in all ive never seen a finer sight than a summer sunrise over the gulf  a man cant pick his time for dying mistress blythejest got to go when the great captain gives his sailing orders  but if i could id go out when the morning comes across that water  ive watched it many a time and thought what a thing it would be to pass out through that great white glory to whatever was waiting beyant on a sea that aint mapped out on any airthly chart  i think mistress blythe that id find lost margaret there  captain jim had often talked to anne of lost margaret since he had told her the old story  his love for her trembled in every tonethat love that had never grown faint or forgetful  anyway i hope when my time comes ill go quick and easy  i dont think im a coward mistress blytheive looked an ugly death in the face more than once without blenching  but the thought of a lingering death does give me a queer sick feeling of horror  dont talk about leaving us dear dear captain jim pleaded anne in a choked voice patting the old brown hand once so strong but now grown very feeble  what would we do without you  captain jim smiled beautifully  oh youd get along nicelynicelybut you wouldnt forget the old man altogether mistress blytheno i dont think youll ever quite forget him  the race of joseph always remembers one another  but itll be a memory that wont hurti like to think that my memory wont hurt my friendsitll always be kind of pleasant to them i hope and believe  it wont be very long now before lost margaret calls me for the last time  ill be all ready to answer  i jest spoke of this because theres a little favor i want to ask you  heres this poor old matey of minecaptain jim reached out a hand and poked the big warm velvety golden ball on the sofa  the first mate uncoiled himself like a spring with a nice throaty comfortable sound half purr half meow stretched his paws in air turned over and coiled himself up again hell miss me when i start on the vyage  i cant bear to think of leaving the poor critter to starve like he was left before  if anything happens to me will you give matey a bite and a corner mistress blythe  indeed i will  then that is all i had on my mind  your little jem is to have the few curious things i picked upive seen to that  and now i dont like to see tears in those pretty eyes mistress blythe  ill mebbe hang on for quite a spell yet  i heard you reading a piece of poetry one day last winterone of tennysons pieces  id sorter like to hear it again if you could recite it for me  softly and clearly while the seawind blew in on them anne repeated the beautiful lines of tennysons wonderful swan songcrossing the bar  the old captain kept time gently with his sinewy hand  yes yes mistress blythe he said when she had finished thats it thats it  he wasnt a sailor you tell mei dunno how he could have put an old sailors feelings into words like that if he wasnt one  he didnt want any sadness o farewells and neither do i mistress blythefor all will be well with me and mine beyant the bar    chapter 36  beauty for ashes  any news from green gables anne  nothing very especial replied anne folding up marillas letter jake donnell has been there shingling the roof  he is a fullfledged carpenter now so it seems he has had his own way in regard to the choice of a lifework  you remember his mother wanted him to be a college professor  i shall never forget the day she came to the school and rated me for failing to call him st clair  does anyone ever call him that now  evidently not  it seems that he has completely lived it down  even his mother has succumbed  i always thought that a boy with jakes chin and mouth would get his own way in the end  diana writes me that dora has a beau  just think of itthat child  dora is seventeen said gilbert  charlie sloane and i were both mad about you when you were seventeen anne  really gilbert we must be getting on in years said anne with a halfrueful smile when children who were six when we thought ourselves grown up are old enough now to have beaux  doras is ralph andrewsjanes brother  i remember him as a little round fat whiteheaded fellow who was always at the foot of his class  but i understand he is quite a finelooking young man now  dora will probably marry young  shes of the same type as charlotta the fourthshell never miss her first chance for fear she might not get another  well if she marries ralph i hope he will be a little more upandcoming than his brother billy mused anne  for instance said gilbert laughing let us hope he will be able to propose on his own account  anne would you have married billy if he had asked you himself instead of getting jane to do it for him  i might have anne went off into a shriek of laughter over the recollection of her first proposal  the shock of the whole thing might have hypnotized me into some such rash and foolish act  let us be thankful he did it by proxy  i had a letter from george moore yesterday said leslie from the corner where she was reading  oh how is he asked anne interestedly yet with an unreal feeling that she was inquiring about some one whom she did not know  he is well but he finds it very hard to adapt himself to all the changes in his old home and friends  he is going to sea again in the spring  its in his blood he says and he longs for it  but he told me something that made me glad for him poor fellow  before he sailed on the four sisters he was engaged to a girl at home  he did not tell me anything about her in montreal because he said he supposed she would have forgotten him and married someone else long ago and with him you see his engagement and love was still a thing of the present it was pretty hard on him but when he got home he found she had never married and still cared for him  they are to be married this fall im going to ask him to bring her over here for a little trip he says he wants to come and see the place where he lived so many years without knowing it  what a nice little romance said anne whose love for the romantic was immortal  and to think she added with a sigh of selfreproach that if i had had my way george moore would never have come up from the grave in which his identity was buried  how i did fight against gilberts suggestion  well i am punished  i shall never be able to have a different opinion from gilberts again  if i try to have he will squelch me by casting george moores case up to me  as if even that would squelch a woman mocked gilbert  at least do not become my echo anne  a little opposition gives spice to life  i do not want a wife like john macallisters over the harbor  no matter what he says she at once remarks in that drab lifeless little voice of hers that is very true john dear me  anne and leslie laughed  annes laughter was silver and leslies golden and the combination of the two was as satisfactory as a perfect chord in music  susan coming in on the heels of the laughter echoed it with a resounding sigh  why susan what is the matter asked gilbert  theres nothing wrong with little jem is there susan cried anne starting up in alarm  no no calm yourself mrs doctor dear  something has happened though  dear me everything has gone catawampus with me this week  i spoiled the bread as you know too welland i scorched the doctors best shirt bosomand i broke your big platter  and now on the top of all this comes word that my sister matilda has broken her leg and wants me to go and stay with her for a spell  oh im very sorrysorry that your sister has met with such an accident i mean exclaimed anne  ah well man was made to mourn mrs doctor dear  that sounds as if it ought to be in the bible but they tell me a person named burns wrote it  and there is no doubt that we are born to trouble as the sparks fly upward  as for matilda i do not know what to think of her none of our family ever broke their legs before  but whatever she has done she is still my sister and i feel that it is my duty to go and wait on her if you can spare me for a few weeks mrs doctor dear  of course susan of course  i can get someone to help me while you are gone  if you cannot i will not go mrs doctor dear matildas leg to the contrary notwithstanding  i will not have you worried and that blessed child upset in consequence for any number of legs  oh you must go to your sister at once susan  i can get a girl from the cove who will do for a time  anne will you let me come and stay with you while susan is away exclaimed leslie  do  id love toand it would be an act of charity on your part  im so horribly lonely over there in that big barn of a house  theres so little to doand at night im worse than lonelyim frightened and nervous in spite of locked doors  there was a tramp around two days ago  anne joyfully agreed and next day leslie was installed as an inmate of the little house of dreams  miss cornelia warmly approved of the arrangement  it seems providential she told anne in confidence  im sorry for matilda clow but since she had to break her leg it couldnt have happened at a better time  leslie will be here while owen ford is in four winds and those old cats up at the glen wont get the chance to meow as they would if she was living over there alone and owen going to see her  they are doing enough of it as it is because she doesnt put on mourning  i said to one of them if you mean she should put on mourning for george moore it seems to me more like his resurrection than his funeral and if its dick you mean i confess i cant see the propriety of going into weeds for a man who died thirteen years ago and good riddance then  and when old louisa baldwin remarked to me that she thought it very strange that leslie should never have suspected it wasnt her own husband i said you never suspected it wasnt dick moore and you were nextdoor neighbor to him all his life and by nature youre ten times as suspicious as leslie  but you cant stop some peoples tongues anne dearie and im real thankful leslie will be under your roof while owen is courting her  owen ford came to the little house one august evening when leslie and anne were absorbed in worshipping the baby  he paused at the open door of the living room unseen by the two within gazing with greedy eyes at the beautiful picture  leslie sat on the floor with the baby in her lap making ecstatic dabs at his fat little hands as he fluttered them in the air  oh you dear beautiful beloved baby she mumbled catching one wee hand and covering it with kisses  isnt him ze darlingest itty sing crooned anne hanging over the arm of her chair adoringly  dem itty wee pads are ze very tweetest handies in ze whole big world isnt dey you darling itty man  anne in the months before little jems coming had pored diligently over several wise volumes and pinned her faith to one in especial sir oracle on the care and training of children  sir oracle implored parents by all they held sacred never to talk baby talk to their children  infants should invariably be addressed in classical language from the moment of their birth  so should they learn to speak english undefiled from their earliest utterance  how demanded sir oracle can a mother reasonably expect her child to learn correct speech when she continually accustoms its impressionable gray matter to such absurd expressions and distortions of our noble tongue as thoughtless mothers inflict every day on the helpless creatures committed to their care can a child who is constantly called tweet itty wee singie ever attain to any proper conception of his own being and possibilities and destiny  anne was vastly impressed with this and informed gilbert that she meant to make it an inflexible rule never under any circumstances to talk baby talk to her children  gilbert agreed with her and they made a solemn compact on the subjecta compact which anne shamelessly violated the very first moment little jem was laid in her arms  oh the darling itty wee sing she had exclaimed  and she had continued to violate it ever since  when gilbert teased her she laughed sir oracle to scorn  he never had any children of his own gilberti am positive he hadnt or he would never have written such rubbish  you just cant help talking baby talk to a baby  it comes naturaland its right  it would be inhuman to talk to those tiny soft velvety little creatures as we do to great big boys and girls  babies want love and cuddling and all the sweet baby talk they can get and little jem is going to have it bless his dear itty heartums  but youre the worst i ever heard anne protested gilbert who not being a mother but only a father was not wholly convinced yet that sir oracle was wrong  i never heard anything like the way you talk to that child  very likely you never did  go awaygo away  didnt i bring up three pairs of hammond twins before i was eleven  you and sir oracle are nothing but coldblooded theorists  gilbert just look at him  hes smiling at mehe knows what were talking about  and oo dest agwees wif evy word muzzer says dont oo angellover  gilbert put his arm about them  oh you mothers he said  you mothers  god knew what he was about when he made you  so little jem was talked to and loved and cuddled and he throve as became a child of the house of dreams  leslie was quite as foolish over him as anne was  when their work was done and gilbert was out of the way they gave themselves over to shameless orgies of lovemaking and ecstasies of adoration such as that in which owen ford had surprised them  leslie was the first to become aware of him  even in the twilight anne could see the sudden whiteness that swept over her beautiful face blotting out the crimson of lip and cheeks  owen came forward eagerly blind for a moment to anne  leslie he said holding out his hand  it was the first time he had ever called her by her name but the hand leslie gave him was cold and she was very quiet all the evening while anne and gilbert and owen laughed and talked together  before his call ended she excused herself and went upstairs  owens gay spirits flagged and he went away soon after with a downcast air  gilbert looked at anne  anne what are you up to  theres something going on that i dont understand  the whole air here tonight has been charged with electricity  leslie sits like the muse of tragedy owen ford jokes and laughs on the surface and watches leslie with the eyes of his soul you seem all the time to be bursting with some suppressed excitement own up  what secret have you been keeping from your deceived husband  dont be a goose gilbert was annes conjugal reply  as for leslie she is absurd and im going up to tell her so  anne found leslie at the dormer window of her room  the little place was filled with the rhythmic thunder of the sea  leslie sat with locked hands in the misty moonshinea beautiful accusing presence  anne she said in a low reproachful voice did you know owen ford was coming to four winds  i did said anne brazenly  oh you should have told me anne leslie cried passionately if i had known i would have gone awayi wouldnt have stayed here to meet him  you should have told me  it wasnt fair of you anneoh it wasnt fair  leslies lips were trembling and her whole form was tense with emotion but anne laughed heartlessly  she bent over and kissed leslies upturned reproachful face  leslie you are an adorable goose  owen ford didnt rush from the pacific to the atlantic from a burning desire to see me  neither do i believe that he was inspired by any wild and frenzied passion for miss cornelia  take off your tragic airs my dear friend and fold them up and put them away in lavender  youll never need them again  there are some people who can see through a grindstone when there is a hole in it even if you cannot  i am not a prophetess but i shall venture on a prediction  the bitterness of life is over for you  after this you are going to have the joys and hopesand i daresay the sorrows tooof a happy woman  the omen of the shadow of venus did come true for you leslie  the year in which you saw it brought your lifes best gift for youyour love for owen ford  now go right to bed and have a good sleep  leslie obeyed orders in so far that she went to bed but it may be questioned if she slept much  i do not think she dared to dream wakingly life had been so hard for this poor leslie the path on which she had had to walk had been so strait that she could not whisper to her own heart the hopes that might wait on the future  but she watched the great revolving light bestarring the short hours of the summer night and her eyes grew soft and bright and young once more  nor when owen ford came next day to ask her to go with him to the shore did she say him nay     chapter 37  miss cornelia makes a startling announcement  miss cornelia sailed down to the little house one drowsy afternoon when the gulf was the faint bleached blue of the august seas and the orange lilies at the gate of annes garden held up their imperial cups to be filled with the molten gold of august sunshine  not that miss cornelia concerned herself with painted oceans or sunthirsty lilies she sat in her favorite rocker in unusual idleness  she sewed not neither did she spin  nor did she say a single derogatory word concerning any portion of mankind  in short miss cornelias conversation was singularly devoid of spice that day and gilbert who had stayed home to listen to her instead of going afishing as he had intended felt himself aggrieved  what had come over miss cornelia she did not look cast down or worried  on the contrary there was a certain air of nervous exultation about her  where is leslie she askednot as if it mattered much either  owen and she went raspberrying in the woods back of her farm answered anne  they wont be back before supper timeif then  they dont seem to have any idea that there is such a thing as a clock said gilbert  i cant get to the bottom of that affair  im certain you women pulled strings  but anne undutiful wife wont tell me  will you miss cornelia  no i shall not  but said miss cornelia with the air of one determined to take the plunge and have it over i will tell you something else  i came today on purpose to tell it  i am going to be married  anne and gilbert were silent  if miss cornelia had announced her intention of going out to the channel and drowning herself the thing might have been believable  this was not  so they waited  of course miss cornelia had made a mistake  well you both look sort of kerflummexed said miss cornelia with a twinkle in her eyes  now that the awkward moment of revelation was over miss cornelia was her own woman again  do you think im too young and inexperienced for matrimony  you knowit is rather staggering said gilbert trying to gather his wits together  ive heard you say a score of times that you wouldnt marry the best man in the world  im not going to marry the best man in the world retorted miss cornelia  marshall elliott is a long way from being the best  are you going to marry marshall elliott exclaimed anne recovering her power of speech under this second shock  yes  i could have had him any time these twenty years if id lifted my finger  but do you suppose i was going to walk into church beside a perambulating haystack like that  i am sure we are very gladand we wish you all possible happiness said anne very flatly and inadequately as she felt  she was not prepared for such an occasion  she had never imagined herself offering betrothal felicitations to miss cornelia  thanks i knew you would said miss cornelia  you are the first of my friends to know it  we shall be so sorry to lose you though dear miss cornelia said anne beginning to be a little sad and sentimental  oh you wont lose me said miss cornelia unsentimentally  you dont suppose i would live over harbor with all those macallisters and elliotts and crawfords do you from the conceit of the elliotts the pride of the macallisters and the vainglory of the crawfords good lord deliver us  marshall is coming to live at my place  im sick and tired of hired men  that jim hastings ive got this summer is positively the worst of the species  he would drive anyone to getting married  what do you think  he upset the churn yesterday and spilled a big churning of cream over the yard  and not one whit concerned about it was he  just gave a foolish laugh and said cream was good for the land  wasnt that like a man  i told him i wasnt in the habit of fertilising my back yard with cream  well i wish you all manner of happiness too miss cornelia said gilbert solemnly but he added unable to resist the temptation to tease miss cornelia despite annes imploring eyes i fear your day of independence is done  as you know marshall elliott is a very determined man  i like a man who can stick to a thing retorted miss cornelia  amos grant who used to be after me long ago couldnt  you never saw such a weathervane  he jumped into the pond to drown himself once and then changed his mind and swum out again  wasnt that like a man  marshall would have stuck to it and drowned  and he has a bit of a temper they tell me persisted gilbert  he wouldnt be an elliott if he hadnt  im thankful he has  it will be real fun to make him mad  and you can generally do something with a tempery man when it comes to repenting time  but you cant do anything with a man who just keeps placid and aggravating  you know hes a grit miss cornelia  yes he is admitted miss cornelia rather sadly  and of course there is no hope of making a conservative of him  but at least he is a presbyterian  so i suppose i shall have to be satisfied with that  would you marry him if he were a methodist miss cornelia  no i would not  politics is for this world but religion is for both  and you may be a relict after all miss cornelia  not i  marshall will live me out  the elliotts are longlived and the bryants are not  when are you to be married asked anne  in about a months time  my wedding dress is to be navy blue silk and i want to ask you anne dearie if you think it would be all right to wear a veil with a navy blue dress  ive always thought id like to wear a veil if i ever got married  marshall says to have it if i want to  isnt that like a man  why shouldnt you wear it if you want to asked anne  well one doesnt want to be different from other people said miss cornelia who was not noticeably like anyone else on the face of the earth  as i say i do fancy a veil  but maybe it shouldnt be worn with any dress but a white one  please tell me anne dearie what you really think  ill go by your advice  i dont think veils are usually worn with any but white dresses admitted anne but that is merely a convention and i am like mr elliott miss cornelia  i dont see any good reason why you shouldnt have a veil if you want one  but miss cornelia who made her calls in calico wrappers shook her head  if it isnt the proper thing i wont wear it she said with a sigh of regret for a lost dream  since you are determined to be married miss cornelia said gilbert solemnly i shall give you the excellent rules for the management of a husband which my grandmother gave my mother when she married my father  well i reckon i can manage marshall elliott said miss cornelia placidly  but let us hear your rules  the first one is catch him  hes caught  go on  the second one is feed him well  with enough pie  what next  the third and fourth arekeep your eye on him  i believe you said miss cornelia emphatically    chapter 38  red roses  the garden of the little house was a haunt beloved of bees and reddened by late roses that august  the little house folk lived much in it and were given to taking picnic suppers in the grassy corner beyond the brook and sitting about in it through the twilights when great night moths sailed athwart the velvet gloom  one evening owen ford found leslie alone in it  anne and gilbert were away and susan who was expected back that night had not yet returned  the northern sky was amber and pale green over the fir tops  the air was cool for august was nearing september and leslie wore a crimson scarf over her white dress  together they wandered through the little friendly flowercrowded paths in silence  owen must go soon  his holiday was nearly over  leslie found her heart beating wildly  she knew that this beloved garden was to be the scene of the binding words that must seal their as yet unworded understanding  some evenings a strange odor blows down the air of this garden like a phantom perfume said owen  i have never been able to discover from just what flower it comes  it is elusive and haunting and wonderfully sweet  i like to fancy it is the soul of grandmother selwyn passing on a little visit to the old spot she loved so well  there should be a lot of friendly ghosts about this little old house  i have lived under its roof only a month said leslie but i love it as i never loved the house over there where i have lived all my life  this house was builded and consecrated by love said owen  such houses must exert an influence over those who live in them  and this gardenit is over sixty years old and the history of a thousand hopes and joys is written in its blossoms  some of those flowers were actually set out by the schoolmasters bride and she has been dead for thirty years  yet they bloom on every summer  look at those red roses lesliehow they queen it over everything else  i love the red roses said leslie  anne likes the pink ones best and gilbert likes the white  but i want the crimson ones  they satisfy some craving in me as no other flower does  these roses are very latethey bloom after all the others have goneand they hold all the warmth and soul of the summer come to fruition said owen plucking some of the glowing halfopened buds  the rose is the flower of lovethe world has acclaimed it so for centuries  the pink roses are love hopeful and expectantthe white roses are love dead or forsakenbut the red rosesah leslie what are the red roses  love triumphant said leslie in a low voice  yeslove triumphant and perfect  leslie you knowyou understand i have loved you from the first  and i know you love mei dont need to ask you  but i want to hear you say itmy darlingmy darling  leslie said something in a very low and tremulous voice  their hands and lips met it was lifes supreme moment for them and as they stood there in the old garden with its many years of love and delight and sorrow and glory he crowned her shining hair with the red red rose of a love triumphant  anne and gilbert returned presently accompanied by captain jim  anne lighted a few sticks of driftwood in the fireplace for love of the pixy flames and they sat around it for an hour of good fellowship  when i sit looking at a driftwood fire its easy to believe im young again said captain jim  can you read futures in the fire captain jim asked owen  captain jim looked at them all affectionately and then back again at leslies vivid face and glowing eyes  i dont need the fire to read your futures he said  i see happiness for all of youall of youfor leslie and mr fordand the doctor here and mistress blytheand little jemand children that aint born yet but will be  happiness for you allthough mind you i reckon youll have your troubles and worries and sorrows too  theyre bound to comeand no house whether its a palace or a little house of dreams can bar em out  but they wont get the better of you if you face em together with love and trust  you can weather any storm with them two for compass and pilot  the old man rose suddenly and placed one hand on leslies head and one on annes  two good sweet women he said  true and faithful and to be depended on  your husbands will have honor in the gates because of youyour children will rise up and call you blessed in the years to come  there was a strange solemnity about the little scene  anne and leslie bowed as those receiving a benediction  gilbert suddenly brushed his hand over his eyes owen ford was rapt as one who can see visions  all were silent for a space  the little house of dreams added another poignant and unforgettable moment to its store of memories  i must be going now said captain jim slowly at last  he took up his hat and looked lingeringly about the room  good night all of you he said as he went out  anne pierced by the unusual wistfulness of his farewell ran to the door after him  come back soon captain jim she called as he passed through the little gate hung between the firs  ay ay he called cheerily back to her  but captain jim had sat by the old fireside of the house of dreams for the last time  anne went slowly back to the others  its soso pitiful to think of him going all alone down to that lonely point she said  and there is no one to welcome him there  captain jim is such good company for others that one cant imagine him being anything but good company for himself said owen  but he must often be lonely  there was a touch of the seer about him tonighthe spoke as one to whom it had been given to speak  well i must be going too  anne and gilbert discreetly melted away but when owen had gone anne returned to find leslie standing by the hearth  oh lesliei knowand im so glad dear she said putting her arms about her  anne my happiness frightens me whispered leslie  it seems too great to be realim afraid to speak of itto think of it  it seems to me that it must just be another dream of this house of dreams and it will vanish when i leave here  well you are not going to leave hereuntil owen takes you  you are going to stay with me until that times comes  do you think id let you go over to that lonely sad place again  thank you dear  i meant to ask you if i might stay with you  i didnt want to go back thereit would seem like going back into the chill and dreariness of the old life again  anne anne what a friend youve been to mea good sweet womantrue and faithful and to be depended oncaptain jim summed you up  he said women not woman smiled anne  perhaps captain jim sees us both through the rosecolored spectacles of his love for us  but we can try to live up to his belief in us at least  do you remember anne said leslie slowly that i once saidthat night we met on the shorethat i hated my good looks  i didthen it always seemed to me that if i had been homely dick would never have thought of me  i hated my beauty because it had attracted him but nowoh im glad that i have it  its all i have to offer owenhis artist soul delights in it  i feel as if i do not come to him quite emptyhanded  owen loves your beauty leslie  who would not  but its foolish of you to say or think that that is all you bring him  he will tell you thati neednt  and now i must lock up  i expected susan back tonight but she has not come  oh yes here i am mrs doctor dear said susan entering unexpectedly from the kitchen and puffing like a hen drawing rails at that  its quite a walk from the glen down here  im glad to see you back susan  how is your sister  she is able to sit up but of course she cannot walk yet  however she is very well able to get on without me now for her daughter has come home for her vacation  and i am thankful to be back mrs doctor dear  matildas leg was broken and no mistake but her tongue was not she would talk the legs off an iron pot that she would mrs doctor dear though i grieve to say it of my own sister  she was always a great talker and yet she was the first of our family to get married she really did not care much about marrying james clow but she could not bear to disoblige him  not but what james is a good manthe only fault i have to find with him is that he always starts in to say grace with such an unearthly groan mrs doctor dear  it always frightens my appetite clear away  and speaking of getting married mrs doctor dear is it true that cornelia bryant is going to be married to marshall elliott  yes quite true susan  well mrs doctor dear it does not seem to me fair  here is me who never said a word against the men and i cannot get married nohow  and there is cornelia bryant who is never done abusing them and all she has to do is to reach out her hand and pick one up as it were  it is a very strange world mrs doctor dear  theres another world you know susan  yes said susan with a heavy sigh but mrs doctor dear there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage there    chapter 39  captain jim crosses the bar  one day in late september owen fords book came at last  captain jim had gone faithfully to the glen post office every day for a month expecting it  this day he had not gone and leslie brought his copy home with hers and annes  well take it down to him this evening said anne excited as a schoolgirl  the long walk to the point on that clear beguiling evening along the red harbor road was very pleasant  then the sun dropped down behind the western hills into some valley that must have been full of lost sunsets and at the same instant the big light flashed out on the white tower of the point  captain jim is never late by the fraction of a second said leslie  neither anne nor leslie ever forgot captain jims face when they gave him the bookhis book transfigured and glorified  the cheeks that had been blanched of late suddenly flamed with the color of boyhood his eyes glowed with all the fire of youth but his hands trembled as he opened it  it was called simply the lifebook of captain jim and on the title page the names of owen ford and james boyd were printed as collaborators  the frontispiece was a photograph of captain jim himself standing at the door of the lighthouse looking across the gulf  owen ford had snapped him one day while the book was being written  captain jim had known this but he had not known that the picture was to be in the book  just think of it he said the old sailor right there in a real printed book  this is the proudest day of my life  im like to bust girls  therell be no sleep for me tonight  ill read my book clean through before sunup  well go right away and leave you free to begin it said anne  captain jim had been handling the book in a kind of reverent rapture now he decidedly closed it and laid it aside  no no youre not going away before you take a cup of tea with the old man he protested  i couldnt hear to thatcould you matey the lifebook will keep i reckon  ive waited for it this many a year  i can wait a little longer while im enjoying my friends  captain jim moved about getting his kettle on to boil and setting out his bread and butter  despite his excitement he did not move with his old briskness  his movements were slow and halting  but the girls did not offer to help him  they knew it would hurt his feelings  you just picked the right evening to visit me he said producing a cake from his cupboard  leetle joes mother sent me down a big basket full of cakes and pies today  a blessing on all good cooks says i look at this purty cake all frosting and nuts  taint often i can entertain in such style  set in girls set in  well tak a cup o kindness yet for auld lang syne  the girls set in right merrily  the tea was up to captain jims best brewing  little joes mothers cake was the last word in cakes captain jim was the prince of gracious hosts never even permitting his eyes to wander to the corner where the lifebook lay in all its bravery of green and gold  but when his door finally closed behind anne and leslie they knew that he went straight to it and as they walked home they pictured the delight of the old man poring over the printed pages wherein his own life was portrayed with all the charm and color of reality itself  i wonder how he will like the endingthe ending i suggested said leslie  she was never to know  early the next morning anne awakened to find gilbert bending over her fully dressed and with an expression of anxiety on his face  are you called out she asked drowsily  no  anne im afraid theres something wrong at the point  its an hour after sunrise now and the light is still burning  you know it has always been a matter of pride with captain jim to start the light the moment the sun sets and put it out the moment it rises  anne sat up in dismay  through her window she saw the light blinking palely against the blue skies of dawn  perhaps he has fallen asleep over his lifebook she said anxiously or become so absorbed in it that he has forgotten the light  gilbert shook his head  that wouldnt be like captain jim  anyway im going down to see  wait a minute and ill go with you exclaimed anne  oh yes i mustlittle jem will sleep for an hour yet and ill call susan  you may need a womans help if captain jim is ill  it was an exquisite morning full of tints and sounds at once ripe and delicate  the harbor was sparkling and dimpling like a girl white gulls were soaring over the dunes beyond the bar was a shining wonderful sea  the long fields by the shore were dewy and fresh in that first fine purelytinted light  the wind came dancing and whistling up the channel to replace the beautiful silence with a music more beautiful still  had it not been for the baleful star on the white tower that early walk would have been a delight to anne and gilbert  but they went softly with fear  their knock was not responded to  gilbert opened the door and they went in  the old room was very quiet  on the table were the remnants of the little evening feast  the lamp still burned on the corner stand  the first mate was asleep in a square of sunshine by the sofa  captain jim lay on the sofa with his hands clasped over the lifebook open at the last page lying on his breast  his eyes were closed and on his face was a look of the most perfect peace and happinessthe look of one who has long sought and found at last  he is asleep whispered anne tremulously  gilbert went to the sofa and bent over him for a few moments  then he straightened up  yes he sleepswell he added quietly  anne captain jim has crossed the bar  they could not know precisely at what hour he had died but anne always believed that he had had his wish and went out when the morning came across the gulf  out on that shining tide his spirit drifted over the sunrise sea of pearl and silver to the haven where lost margaret waited beyond the storms and calms    chapter 40  farewell to the house of dreams  captain jim was buried in the little overharbor graveyard very near to the spot where the wee white lady slept  his relatives put up a very expensive very ugly monumenta monument at which he would have poked sly fun had he seen it in life  but his real monument was in the hearts of those who knew him and in the book that was to live for generations  leslie mourned that captain jim had not lived to see the amazing success of it  how he would have delighted in the reviewsthey are almost all so kindly  and to have seen his lifebook heading the lists of the best sellersoh if he could just have lived to see it anne  but anne despite her grief was wiser  it was the book itself he cared for leslienot what might be said of itand he had it  he had read it all through  that last night must have been one of the greatest happiness for himwith the quick painless ending he had hoped for in the morning  i am glad for owens sake and yours that the book is such a successbut captain jim was satisfiedi know  the lighthouse star still kept a nightly vigil a substitute keeper had been sent to the point until such time as an allwise government could decide which of many applicants was best fitted for the placeor had the strongest pull  the first mate was at home in the little house beloved by anne and gilbert and leslie and tolerated by a susan who had small liking for cats  i can put up with him for the sake of captain jim mrs doctor dear for i liked the old man  and i will see that he gets bite and sup and every mouse the traps account for  but do not ask me to do more than that mrs doctor dear  cats is cats and take my word for it they will never be anything else  and at least mrs doctor dear do keep him away from the blessed wee man  picture to yourself how awful it would be if he was to suck the darlings breath  that might be fitly called a catastrophe said gilbert  oh you may laugh doctor dear but it would be no laughing matter  cats never suck babies breaths said gilbert  that is only an old superstition susan  oh well it may be a superstition or it may not doctor dear  all that i know is it has happened  my sisters husbands nephews wifes cat sucked their babys breath and the poor innocent was all but gone when they found it  and superstition or not if i find that yellow beast lurking near our baby i will whack him with the poker mrs doctor dear  mr and mrs marshall elliott were living comfortably and harmoniously in the green house  leslie was busy with sewing for she and owen were to be married at christmas  anne wondered what she would do when leslie was gone  changes come all the time  just as soon as things get really nice they change she said with a sigh  the old morgan place up at the glen is for sale said gilbert apropos of nothing in especial  is it asked anne indifferently  yes  now that mr morgan has gone mrs morgan wants to go to live with her children in vancouver  she will sell cheaply for a big place like that in a small village like the glen will not be very easy to dispose of  well its certainly a beautiful place so it is likely she will find a purchaser said anne absently wondering whether she should hemstitch or featherstitch little jems short dresses  he was to be shortened the next week and anne felt ready to cry at the thought of it  suppose we buy it anne remarked gilbert quietly  anne dropped her sewing and stared at him  youre not in earnest gilbert  indeed i am dear  and leave this darling spotour house of dreams said anne incredulously  oh gilbert itsits unthinkable  listen patiently to me dear  i know just how you feel about it  i feel the same  but weve always known we would have to move some day  oh but not so soon gilbertnot just yet  we may never get such a chance again  if we dont buy the morgan place someone else willand there is no other house in the glen we would care to have and no other really good site on which to build this little house iswell it is and has been what no other house can ever be to us i admit but you know it is outoftheway down here for a doctor  we have felt the inconvenience though weve made the best of it  and its a tight fit for us now  perhaps in a few years when jem wants a room of his own it will be entirely too small  oh i knowi know said anne tears filling her eyes  i know all that can be said against it but i love it soand its so beautiful here  you would find it very lonely here after leslie goesand captain jim has gone too  the morgan place is beautiful and in time we would love it  you know you have always admired it anne  oh yes butbutthis has all seemed to come up so suddenly gilbert  im dizzy  ten minutes ago i had no thought of leaving this dear spot  i was planning what i meant to do for it in the springwhat i meant to do in the garden  and if we leave this place who will get it  it is outoftheway so its likely some poor shiftless wandering family will rent itand overrun itand oh that would be desecration  it would hurt me horribly  i know  but we cannot sacrifice our own interests to such considerations annegirl  the morgan place will suit us in every essential particularwe really cant afford to miss such a chance think of that big lawn with those magnificent old trees and of that splendid hardwood grove behind ittwelve acres of it  what a play place for our children  theres a fine orchard too and youve always admired that high brick wall around the garden with the door in ityouve thought it was so like a storybook garden  and there is almost as fine a view of the harbor and the dunes from the morgan place as from here  you cant see the lighthouse star from it  yes you can see it from the attic window  theres another advantage annegirlyou love big garrets   theres no brook in the garden  well no but there is one running through the maple grove into the glen pond  and the pond itself isnt far away  youll be able to fancy you have your own lake of shining waters again  well dont say anything more about it just now gilbert  give me time to thinkto get used to the idea  all right  there is no great hurry of course  onlyif we decide to buy it would be well to be moved in and settled before winter  gilbert went out and anne put away little jems short dresses with trembling hands  she could not sew any more that day  with tearwet eyes she wandered over the little domain where she had reigned so happy a queen  the morgan place was all that gilbert claimed  the grounds were beautiful the house old enough to have dignity and repose and traditions and new enough to be comfortable and uptodate  anne had always admired it but admiring is not loving and she loved this house of dreams so much  she loved everything about itthe garden she had tended and which so many women had tended before herthe gleam and sparkle of the little brook that crept so roguishly across the cornerthe gate between the creaking fir treesthe old red sandstone stepthe stately lombardiesthe two tiny quaint glass cupboards over the chimneypiece in the livingroomthe crooked pantry door in the kitchenthe two funny dormer windows upstairsthe little jog in the staircasewhy these things were a part of her  how could she leave them  and how this little house consecrated aforetime by love and joy had been reconsecrated for her by her happiness and sorrow  here she had spent her bridal moon here wee joyce had lived her one brief day here the sweetness of motherhood had come again with little jem here she had heard the exquisite music of her babys cooing laughter here beloved friends had sat by her fireside  joy and grief birth and death had made sacred forever this little house of dreams  and now she must leave it  she knew that even while she had contended against the idea to gilbert  the little house was outgrown  gilberts interests made the change necessary his work successful though it had been was hampered by his location  anne realised that the end of their life in this dear place drew nigh and that she must face the fact bravely  but how her heart ached  it will be just like tearing something out of my life she sobbed and oh if i could hope that some nice folk would come here in our placeor even that it would be left vacant  that itself would be better than having it overrun with some horde who know nothing of the geography of dreamland and nothing of the history that has given this house its soul and its identity  and if such a tribe come here the place will go to rack and ruin in no timean old place goes down so quickly if it is not carefully attended to  theyll tear up my gardenand let the lombardies get raggedand the paling will come to look like a mouth with half the teeth missingand the roof will leakand the plaster falland theyll stuff pillows and rags in broken window panesand everything will be outatelbows  annes imagination pictured forth so vividly the coming degeneration of her dear little house that it hurt her as severely as if it had already been an accomplished fact  she sat down on the stairs and had a long bitter cry  susan found her there and enquired with much concern what the trouble was  you have not quarrelled with the doctor have you now mrs doctor dear  but if you have do not worry  it is a thing quite likely to happen to married couples i am told although i have had no experience that way myself  he will be sorry and you can soon make it up  no no susan we havent quarrelled  its onlygilbert is going to buy the morgan place and well have to go and live at the glen  and it will break my heart  susan did not enter into annes feelings at all  she was indeed quite rejoiced over the prospect of living at the glen  her one grievance against her place in the little house was its lonesome location  why mrs doctor dear it will be splendid  the morgan house is such a fine big one  i hate big houses sobbed anne  oh well you will not hate them by the time you have half a dozen children remarked susan calmly  and this house is too small already for us  we have no spare room since mrs moore is here and that pantry is the most aggravating place i ever tried to work in  there is a corner every way you turn  besides it is outoftheworld down here  there is really nothing at all but scenery  out of your world perhaps susanbut not out of mine said anne with a faint smile  i do not quite understand you mrs doctor dear but of course i am not well educated  but if dr blythe buys the morgan place he will make no mistake and that you may tie to  they have water in it and the pantries and closets are beautiful and there is not another such cellar in p e  island so i have been told  why the cellar here mrs doctor dear has been a heartbreak to me as well you know  oh go away susan go away said anne forlornly  cellars and pantries and closets dont make a home  why dont you weep with those who weep  well i never was much hand for weeping mrs doctor dear  i would rather fall to and cheer people up than weep with them  now do not you cry and spoil your pretty eyes  this house is very well and has served your turn but it is high time you had a better  susans point of view seemed to be that of most people  leslie was the only one who sympathised understandingly with anne  she had a good cry too when she heard the news  then they both dried their tears and went to work at the preparations for moving  since we must go let us go as soon as we can and have it over said poor anne with bitter resignation  you know you will like that lovely old place at the glen after you have lived in it long enough to have dear memories woven about it said leslie  friends will come there as they have come herehappiness will glorify it for you  now its just a house to youbut the years will make it a home  anne and leslie had another cry the next week when they shortened little jem  anne felt the tragedy of it until evening when in his long nightie she found her own dear baby again  but it will be rompers nextand then trousersand in no time he will be grownup she sighed  well you would not want him to stay a baby always mrs doctor dear would you said susan  bless his innocent heart he looks too sweet for anything in his little short dresses with his dear feet sticking out  and think of the save in the ironing mrs doctor dear  anne i have just had a letter from owen said leslie entering with a bright face  and oh i have such good news  he writes me that he is going to buy this place from the church trustees and keep it to spend our summer vacations in  anne are you not glad  oh leslie glad isnt the word for it  it seems almost too good to be true  i shant feel half so badly now that i know this dear spot will never be desecrated by a vandal tribe or left to tumble down in decay  why its lovely  its lovely  one october morning anne wakened to the realisation that she had slept for the last time under the roof of her little house  the day was too busy to indulge regret and when evening came the house was stripped and bare  anne and gilbert were alone in it to say farewell  leslie and susan and little jem had gone to the glen with the last load of furniture  the sunset light streamed in through the curtainless windows  it has all such a heartbroken reproachful look hasnt it said anne  oh i shall be so homesick at the glen tonight  we have been very happy here havent we annegirl said gilbert his voice full of feeling  anne choked unable to answer  gilbert waited for her at the firtree gate while she went over the house and said farewell to every room she was going away but the old house would still be there looking seaward through its quaint windows  the autumn winds would blow around it mournfully and the gray rain would beat upon it and the white mists would come in from the sea to enfold it and the moonlight would fall over it and light up the old paths where the schoolmaster and his bride had walked  there on that old harbor shore the charm of story would linger the wind would still whistle alluringly over the silver sanddunes the waves would still call from the red rockcoves  but we will be gone said anne through her tears  she went out closing and locking the door behind her  gilbert was waiting for her with a smile  the lighthouse star was gleaming northward  the little garden where only marigolds still bloomed was already hooding itself in shadows  anne knelt down and kissed the worn old step which she had crossed as a bride  goodbye dear little house of dreams she said
