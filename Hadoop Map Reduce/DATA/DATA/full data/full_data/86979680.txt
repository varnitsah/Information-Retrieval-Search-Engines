of these letters which were written at the suggestion of the editor of the st jamess gazette appeared in that journal from which they are now reprinted by the editors kind permission they have been somewhat emended and a few additions have been made the letters to horace byron isaak walton chapelain ronsard and theocritus have not been published before  the gem published for the first time on the titlepage is a red cornelian in the british museum probably graecoroman and treated in an archaistic style it represents hermes psychogogos with a soul and has some likeness to the baptism of our lord as usually shown in art perhaps it may be postchristian the gem was selected by mr a s murray  it is perhaps superfluous to add that some of the letters are written rather to suit the correspondent than to express the writers own taste or opinions the epistle to lord byron especially is writ in a manner which is my aversion     letters to dead authors     i to w m thackeray    sirthere are many things that stand in the way of the critic when he has a mind to praise the living he may dread the charge of writing rather to vex a rival than to exalt the subject of his applause he shuns the appearance of seeking the favour of the famous and would not willingly be regarded as one of the many parasites who now advertise each movement and action of contemporary genius such and such men of letters are passing their summer holidays in the val daosta or the mountains of the moon or the suliman range as it may happen so reports our literary court circular and all our précieuses read the tidings with enthusiasm lastly if the critic be quite new to the world of letters he may superfluously fear to vex a poet or a novelist by the abundance of his eulogy no such doubts perplex us when with all our hearts we would commend the departed for they have passed almost beyond the reach even of envy and to those pale cheeks of theirs no commendation can bring the red  you above all others were and remain without a rival in your manysided excellence and praise of you strikes at none of those who have survived your day the increase of time only mellows your renown and each year that passes and brings you no successor does but sharpen the keenness of our sense of loss in what other novelist since scott was worn down by the burden of a forlorn endeavour and died for honours sake has the world found so many of the fairest gifts combined if we may not call you a poet for the first of english writers of light verse did not seek that crown who that was less than a poet ever saw life with a glance so keen as yours so steady and so sane your pathos was never cheap your laughter never forced your sigh was never the pulpit trick of the preacher your funny peopleyour costigans and fokerswere not mere characters of trick and catchword were not empty comic masks behind each the human heart was beating and ever and again we were allowed to see the features of the man  thus fiction in your hands was not simply a profession like another but a constant reflection of the whole surface of life a repeated echo of its laughter and its complaint others have written and not written badly with the stolid professional regularity of the clerk at his desk you like the scholar gipsy might have said that it needs heavensent moments for this skill there are it will not surprise you some honourable women and a few men who call you a cynic who speak of the withered world of thackerayan satire who think your eyes were ever turned to the sordid aspects of lifeto the motherinlaw who threatens to take away her silver breadbasket to the intriguer the sneak the termagant to the beckys and barnes newcomes and mrs mackenzies of this world the quarrel of these sentimentalists is really with life not with you they might as wisely blame monsieur buffon because there are snakes in his natural history had you not impaled certain noxious human insects you would have better pleased mr ruskin had you confined yourself to such performances you would have been more dear to the neobalzacian school in fiction  you are accused of never having drawn a good woman who was not a doll but the ladies that bring this charge seldom remind us either of lady castlewood or of theo or hetty lambert the best women can pardon you becky sharp and blanche amory they find it harder to forgive you emmy sedley and helen pendennis yet what man does not know in his heart that the best womengod bless themlean in their characters either to the sweet passiveness of emmy or to the sensitive and jealous affections of helen tis heaven not you that made them so and they are easily pardoned both for being a very little lower than the angels and for their gentle ambition to be painted as by guido or guercino with wings and harps and haloes so ladies have occasionally seen their own faces in the glass of fancy and thus inspired have drawn romola and consuelo yet when these fair idealists mdme sand and george eliot designed rosamund vincy and horace was there not a spice of malice in the portraits which we miss in your least favourable studies  that the creator of colonel newcome and of henry esmond was a snarling cynic that he who designed rachel esmond could not draw a good woman these are the chief charges all indifferent now to you who were once so sensitive that your admirers have to contend against a french critic m taine also protests that you do preach too much did any author but yourself so frequently break the thread seldom a strong thread of his plot to converse with his reader and moralise his tale we also might be offended but who that loves montaigne and pascal who that likes the wise trifling of the one and can bear with the melancholy of the other but prefers your preaching to anothers playing  your thoughts come in like the intervention of the greek chorus as an ornament and source of fresh delight like the songs of the chorus they bid us pause a moment over the wider laws and actions of human fate and human life and we turn from your persons to yourself and again from yourself to your persons as from the odes of sophocles or aristophanes to the action of their characters on the stage nor to my taste does the mere music and melancholy dignity of your style in these passages of meditation fall far below the highest efforts of poetry i remember that scene where clive at barnes newcomes lecture on the poetry of the affections sees ethel who is lost to him and the past and its dear histories and youth and its hopes and passions and tones and looks for ever echoing in the heart and present in the memorythese no doubt poor clive saw and heard as he looked across the great gulf of time and parting and grief and beheld the wonmn he had loved for many years  for ever echoing in the heart and present in the memory who has not heard these tones who does not hear them as he turns over your books that for so many years have been his companions and comforters we have been young and old we have been sad and merry with you we have listened to the midnight chimes with pen and warrington have stood with you beside the deathbed have mourned at that yet more awful funeral of lost love and with you have prayed in the inmost chapel sacred to our old and immortal affections a léal souvenir and whenever you speak for yourself and speak in earnest how magical how rare how lonely in our literature is the beauty of your sentences i cant express the charm of them so you write of george sand so we may write of you they seem to me like the sound of country bells provoking i dont know what vein of music and meditation and falling sweetly and sadly on the ear surely that style so fresh so rich so full of surprisesthat style which stamps as classical your fragments of slang and perpetually astonishes and delightswould alone give immortality to an author even had he little to say but you with your whole wide world of fops and fools of good women and brave men of honest absurdities and cheery adventurers you who created the steynes and newcomes the beckys and blanches captain costigan and f b and the chevalier strongall that host of friends imperishableyou must survive with shakespeare and cervantes in the memory and affection of men     ii to charles dickens    sirit has been said that every man is born a platonist or an aristotelian though the enormous majority of us to be sure live and die without being conscious of any invidious philosophic partiality whatever with more truth though that does not imply very much every englishman who reads may be said to be a partisan of yourself or of mr thackeray why should there be any partisanship in the matter and why having two such good things as your novels and those of your contemporary should we not be silently happy in the possession well men are made so and must needs fight and argue over their tastes in enjoyment for myself i may say that in this matter i am what the americans do not call a mugwump what english politicians dub a superior personthat is i take no side and attempt to enjoy the best of both  it must be owned that this attitude is sometimes made a little difficult by the vigour of your special devotees they have ceased indeed thank heaven to imitate you and even in descriptive articles the touch of mr gigadibs of him whom we almost took for the true dickens has disappeared the young lions of the press no longer mimic your less admirable mannerismsdo not strain so much after fantastic comparisons do not in your manner and mr carlyles give people nicknames derived from their teeth or their complexion and generally we are spared secondhand copies of all that in your style was least to be commended but though improved by lapse of time in this respect your devotees still put on little conscious airs of virtue robust manliness and so forth which would have irritated you very much and there survive some press men who seem to have read you a little especially your later works and never to have read anything else now familiarity with the pages of our mutual friendand dombey and son does not precisely constitute a liberal education and the assumption that it does is apt quite unreasonably to prejudice people against the greatest comic genius of modern times  on the other hand time is at last beginning to sift the true admirers of dickens from the false yours sir in the best sense of the word is a popular success a popular reputation for example i know that in a remote and even pictish part of this kingdom a rural household humble and under the shadow of a sorrow inevitably approaching has found in david copperfield oblivion of winter of sorrow and of sickness on the other hand people are now picking up heart to say that they cannot read dickens and that they particularly detest pickwick i believe it was young ladies who first had the courage of their convictions in this respect tout sied aux belles and the fair in the confidence of youth often venture on remarkable confessions in your natural history of young ladies i do not remember that you describe the humorous young lady 1 she is a very rare bird indeed and humour generally is at a deplorably low level in england        1   i am informed that the natural history of young      ladies is attributed by some writers to another      philosopher the author of the art of pluck   hence come all sorts of mischief arisen since you left us and it may be said that inordinate philanthropy genteel sympathy with irish murder and arson societies for badgering the poor esoteric buddhism and a score of other plagues including what was once called aestheticism are all primarily due to want of humour people discuss with the gravest faces matters which properly should only be stated as the wildest paradoxes it naturally follows that in a period almost destitute of humour many respectable persons cannot read dickens and are not ashamed to glory in their shame we ought not to be angry with others for their misfortunes and yet when one meets the crétins who boast that they cannot read dickens one certainly does feel much as mr samuel weller felt when he encountered mr job trotter  how very singular has been the history of the decline of humour is there any profound psychological truth to be gathered from consideration of the fact that humour has gone out with cruelty a hundred years ago eighty years agonay fifty years agowe were a cruel but also a humorous people we had bullbaitings and badgerdrawings and hustings and prizefights and cockfights we went to see men hanged the pillory and the stocks were no empty terrors unto evildoers for there was commonly a malefactor occupying each of these institutions with all this we had a broad blown comic sense we had hogarth and bunbury and george cruikshank and gilray we had leech and surtees and the creator of tittlebat titmouse we had the shepherd of the noctes and above all we had you  from the old giants of english funburly persons delighting in broad caricature in decided colours in cockney jokes in swashing blows at the more prominent and obvious human folliesfrom these you derived the splendid high spirits and unhesitating mirth of your earlier works mr squeers and sam weller and mrs gamp and all the pickwickians and mr dowler and john browdiethese and their immortal companions were reared so to speak on the beef and beer of that naughty foxhunting badgerbaiting old england which we have improved out of existence and these characters assuredly are your best by them though stupid people cannot read about them you will live while there is a laugh left among us perhaps that does not assure you a very prolonged existence but only the future can show  the dismal seriousness of the time cannot let us hope last for ever and a day honest old laughter the true lutin of your inspiration must have life left in him yet and cannot die though it is true that the taste for your pathos and your melodrama and plots constructed after your favourite fashion great expectations and the tale of two cities are exceptions may go by and never be regretted were people simpler or only less clearsighted as far as your pathos is concerned a generation ago jeffrey the hardheaded shallow critic who declared that wordsworth would never do cried wept like anything over your little nell one still laughs as heartily as ever with dick swiveller but who can cry over little nell  ah sir how could youwho knew so intimately who remembered so strangely well the fancies the dreams the sufferings of childhoodhow could you wallow naked in the pathetic and massacre holocausts of the innocents to draw tears by gloating over a childs deathbed was it worthy of you was it the kind of work over which our hearts should melt i confess that little nell might die a dozen times and be welcomed by whole legions of angels and i like the bereaved fowl mentioned by pet marjory would remain unmoved    she was more than usual calm   she did not give a single dam  wrote the astonishing child who diverted the leisure of scott over your little nell and your little dombey i remain more than usual calm and probably so do thousands of your most sincere admirers but about matter of this kind and the unsealing of the fountains of tears who can argue where is taste where is truth what tears are manly sir manly as fred bayham has it and of what lamentations ought we rather to be ashamed sunt lacrymae rerum one has been moved in the cell where socrates tasted the hemlock or by the riverbanks where syracusan arrows slew the parched athenians among the mire and blood or in fiction when colonel newcome said adsum or over the diary of clare doria forey or where aramis laments with strange tears the death of porthos but over dombey the son or little nell one declines to snivel  when an author deliberately sits down and says now let us have a good cry he poisons the wells of sensibility and chokes at least in many breasts the fountain of tears out of dombey and son there is little we care to remember except the deathless mr toots just as we forget the melodramatics of martin chuzzlewit i have read in that book a score of times i never see it but i revel in itin pecksniff and mrs gamp and the americans but what the plot is all about what jonas did what montagu tigg had to make in the matter what all the pictures with plenty of shading illustrate i have never been able to comprehend in the same way one of your most thoroughgoing admirers has allowed in the licence of private conversation that ralph nickleby and monk are too steep and probably a cultivated taste will always find them a little precipitous  too steepthe slang expresses that defect of an ardent genius carried above itself and out of the air we breathe both in its grotesque and in its gloomy imaginations to force the note to press fantasy too hard to deepen the gloom with black over the indigo that was the failing which proved you mortal to take an instance in little when pip went to mr pumblechooks the boy thought the seedsman a very happy man to have so many little drawers in his shop the reflection is thoroughly boyish but then you add i wondered whether the flowerseeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom that is not boyish at all that is the harddriven jaded literary fancy at work  so we arraign her but she the genius of charles dickens how brilliant how kindly how beneficent she is dwelling by a fountain of laughter imperishable though there is something of an alien salt in the neighbouring fountain of tears how poor the world of fancy would be how dispeopled of her dreams if in some ruin of the social system the books of dickens were lost and if the dodger and charley bates and mr crinkle and miss squeers and sam weller and mrs gamp and dick swiveller were to perish or to vanish with menanders men and women we cannot think of our world without them and children of dreams as they are they seem more essential than great statesmen artists soldiers who have actually worn flesh and blood ribbons and orders gowns and uniforms may we not almost welcome free education for every englishman who can read unless he be an ass is a reader the more for you     iii to pierre de ronsard prince of poets    master and prince of poetsas we know what choice thou madest of a sepulchre a choice how ill fulfilled by the jealousy of fate so we know well the manner of thy chosen immortality in the plains elysian among the heroes and the ladies of old song there was thy love with thee to enjoy her paradise in an eternal spring    la du plaisant avril la saison imortelle    sans eschange le suit   la terre sans labeur de sa grasse mamelle    tout chose y produit   denbas la troupe sainte autrefois amoureuse    nous honorant sur tous   viendra nous saluer sestimant bienheureuse    de saccointer de nous  there thou dwellest with the learned lovers of old days with belleau and du bellay and baif and the flower of the maidens of anjou surely no rumour reaches thee in that happy place of reconciled affections no rumour of the rudeness of time the despite of men and the change which stole from thy locks so early grey the crown of laurels and of thine own roses how different from thy choice of a sepulchre have been the fortunes of thy tomb    i will that none should break   the marble for my sake   wishful to make more fair     my sepulchre   so didst thou sing or so thy sweet numbers run in my rude english wearied of courts and of priories thou didst desire a grave beside thine own loire not remote from    the caves the founts that fall   from the high mountain wall    that fall and flash and fleet     wilh silver fret    only a laurel tree   shall guard the grave of me    only apollos bough     shall shade me now   far other has been thy sepulchre not in the free air among the field flowers but in thy priory of saint cosme with marble for a monument and no green grass to cover thee restless wert thou in thy life thy dust was not to be restful in thy death the huguenots ces nouveaux chrétiens qui la france ont pillée destroyed thy tomb and the warning of the later monument   abi nefaste quam calcas humum sacra est  has not scared away malicious men the storm that passed over france a hundred years ago more terrible than the religious wars that thou didst weep for has swept the column from the tomb the marble was broken by violent hands and the shattered sepulchre of the prince of poets gained a dusty hospitality from the museum of a country town better had been the laurel of thy desire the creeping vine and the ivy tree  scarce more fortunate for long than thy monument was thy memory thou hast not encountered master in the paradise of poets messieurs malherbe de balzac and boileauboileau who spoke of thee as ce poéte orgueilleux trébuché de si haut  these gallant gentlemen i make no doubt are happy after their own fashion backbiting each other and thee in the paradise of critics in their time they wrought thee much evil grumbling that thou wrotest in greek and latin of which tongues certain of them had but little skill and blaming thy many lyric melodies and the free flow of thy lines what said m de balzac to m chapelain m de malherbe m de grasse and yourself must be very little poets if ronsard be a great one time has brought in his revenges and messieurs chapelain and de grasse are as well forgotten as thou art well remembered men could not always be deaf to thy sweet old songs nor blind to the beauty of thy roses and thy loves when they took the wax out of their ears that m boileau had given them lest they should hear the singing of thy sirens then they were deaf no longer then they heard the old deaf poet singing and made answer to his lays hast thou not heard these sounds have they not reached thee the voices and the lyres of théophile gautier and alfred de musset methinks thou hast marked them and been glad that the old notes were ringing again and the old french lyric measures tripping to thine ancient harmonies echoing and replying to the muses of horace and catullus returning to nature poets returned to thee thy monument has perished but not thy music and the prince of poets has returned to his own again in a glorious restoration  through the dust and smoke of ages and through the centuries of wars we strain our eyes and try to gain a glimpse of thee master in thy good days when the muses walked with thee we seem to mark thee wandering silent through some little village or dreaming in the woods or loitering among thy lonely places or in gardens where the roses blossom among wilder flowers or on river banks where the whispering poplars and sighing reeds make answer to the murmur of the waters such a picture hast thou drawn of thyself in the summer afternoons    je men vais pourmener tantost parmy la plaine   tantost en un village et tantost en un bois   et tantost par les lieux solitaires et cois   jaime fort les jardins qui sentent le sauvage   jaime le flot de leau qui gazouille au rivage  still methinks there was a book in the hand of the grave and learned poet still thou wouldst carry thy horace thy catullus thy theocritus through the gemlike weather of the renouveau when the woods were enamelled with flowers and the young spring was lodged like a wandering prince in his great palaces hung with green    orgueilleux de ses fleurs enflé de sa jeunesse   logé comme un grand prince en ses vertes maisons  thou sawest in these woods by loire side the fair shapes of old religion fauns nymphs and satyrs and heardst in the nightingales music the plaint of philomel the ancient poets came back in the train of thyself and of the spring and learning was scarce less dear to thee than love and thy ladies seemed fairer for the names they borrowed from the beauties of forgotten days helen and cassandra how sweetly didst thou sing to them thine old morality and how gravely didst thou teach the lesson of the roses well didst thou know it well didst thou love the rose since thy nurse carrying thee an infant to the holy font let fall on thee the sacred water brimmed with floating blossoms of the rose    mignonne allons voir si la rose   qui ce matin avoit desclose   sa robe de pourpre au soleil   a point perdu ceste vespree   les plis de sa robe pourpree   et son teint au votre pareil  and again    la belle rose du printemps   aubert admoneste les hommes   passer joyeusement le temps   et pendant que jeunes nous sommes   esbattre la fleur de nos ans  in the same mood looking far down the future thou sangest of thy ladys age the most sad the most beautiful of thy sad and beautiful lays for if thy bees gathered much honey t was somewhat bitter to taste as that of the sardinian yews how clearly we see the great hall the grey lady spinning and humming among her drowsy maids and how they waken at the word and she sees her spring in their eyes and they forecast their winter in her face when she murmurs twas ronsard sang of me  winter and summer and spring how swiftly they pass and how early time brought thee his sorrows and grief cast her dust upon thy head    adieu ma lyre adieu fillettes   jadis mes douces amourettes   adieu je sens venir ma fin   nul passetemps de ma jeunesse   ne maccompagne en la vieillesse   que le feu le lict et le vin  wine and a soft bed and a bright fire to this trinity of poor pleasures we come soon if indeed wine be left to us poetry herself deserts us is it not said that bacchus never forgives a renegade and most of us turn recreants to bacchus even the bright fire i fear was not always there to warm thine old blood master or if fire there were the wood was not bought with thy booksellers money when autumn was drawing in during thine early old age in 1584 didst thou not write that thou hadst never received a sou at the hands of all the publishers who vended thy books and as thou wert about putting forth the folio edition of 1584 thou didst pray buon the bookseller to give thee sixty crowns to buy wood withal and make thee a bright fire in winter weather and comfort thine old age with thy friend gallandius and if buon will not pay then to try the other booksellers that wish to take everything and give nothing  was it knowledge of this passage master or ignorance of everything else that made certain of the common steadfast dunces of our days speak of thee as if thou hadst been a starveling neglected poetaster jealous forsooth of maitre francoys rabelais see how ignorantly m fleury writes who teaches french literature withal to them of muscovy and hath indited a life of rabelais rabelais était revétu dun emploi honorable ronsard était traité en subalterne quoth this wondrous professor what pierre de ronsard a gentleman of a noble house holding the revenue of many abbeys the friend of mary stuart of the duc dorléans of charles ix he is traité en subalterne and is jealous of a frocked or unfrocked manant like maitre francoys and then this amazing fleury falls foul of thine epitaph on maitre francoys and cries ronsard a voulu faire des vers méchants il na fait que de méchants vers more truly saith m saintebeuve if the good rabelais had returned to meudon on the day when this epitaph was made over the wine he would methinks have laughed heartily but what shall be said of a professor like the egregious m fleury who holds that ronsard was despised at court was there a party at tennis when the king would not fain have had thee on his side declaring that he ever won when ronsard was his partner did he not give thee benefices and many priories and call thee his father in apollo and even so they say bid thee sit down beside him on his throne away ye scandalous folk who tell us that there was strife between the prince of poets and the king of mirth naught have ye by way of proof of your slander but the talk of jean bernier a scurrilous starveling apothecary who put forth his fables in 1697 a century and a half after maitre francoys died bayle quoted this fellow in a note and ye all steal the tattle one from another in your dull manner and know not whence it comes nor even that bayle would none of it and mocked its author with so little knowledge is history written and thus doth each chattering brook of a life swell with its tribute that great mississippi of falsehood biography     iv to herodotus    to herodotus of halicarnassus greetingconcerning the matters set forth in your histories and the tales you tell about both greeks and barbarians whether they be true or whether they be false men dispute not little but a great deal wherefore i being concerned to know the verity did set forth to make search in every manner and came in my quest even unto the ends of the earth for there is an island of the cimmerians beyond the straits of heracles some three days voyage to a ship that hath a fair following wind in her sails and there it is said that men know many things from of old thither then i came in my inquiry now the island is not small but large greater than the whole of hellas and they call it britain in that island the east wind blows for ten parts of the year and the people know not how to cover themselves from the cold but for the other two months of the year the sun shines fiercely so that some of them die thereof and others die of the frozen mixed drinks for they have ice even in the summer and this ice they put to their liquor through the whole of this island from the west even to the east there flows a river called thames a great river and a laborious but not to be likened to the river of egypt  the mouth of this river where i stepped out from my ship is exceedingly foul and of an evil savour by reason of the city on the banks now this city is several hundred parasangs in circumference yet a man that needed not to breathe the air might go round it in one hour in chariots that run under the earth and these chariots are drawn by creatures that breathe smoke and sulphur such as orpheus mentions in his argonautica if it be by orpheus the people of the town when i inquired of them concerning herodotus of halicarnassus looked on me with amazement and went straightway about their businessnamely to seek out whatsoever new thing is coming to pass all over the whole inhabited world and as for things old they take no keep of them  nevertheless by diligence i learned that he who in this land knew most concerning herodotus was a priest and dwelt in the priests city on the river which is called the city of the ford of the ox but whether io when she wore a cows shape had passed by that way in her wanderings and thence comes the name of that city i could not though i asked all men i met learn aught with certainty but to me considering this it seemed that io must have come thither and now farewell to io  to the city of the priests there are two roads one by land and one by water following the river to a wellgirdled man the land journey is but one days travel by the river it is longer but more pleasant now that river flows as i said from the west to the east and there is in it a fish called chub which they catch but they do not eat it for a certain sacred reason also there is a fish called trout and this is the manner of his catching they build far this purpose great dams of wood which they call weirs having built the weir they sit upon it with rods in their hands and a line on the rod and at the end of the line a little fish there then they sit and spin in the sun as one of their poets says not for a short time but for many days having rods in their hands and eating and drinking in this wise they angle for the fish called trout but whether they ever catch him or not not having seen it i cannot say for it is not pleasant to me to speak things concerning which i know not the truth  now after sailing and rowing against the stream for certain days i came to the city of the ford of the ox here the river changes his name and is called isis after the name of the goddess of the egyptians but whether the britons brought the name from egypt or whether the egyptians took it from the britons not knowing i prefer not to say but to me it seems that the britons are a colony of the egyptians or the egyptians a colony of the britons moreover when i was in egypt i saw certain soldiers in white helmets who were certainly british but what they did there as egypt neither belongs to britain nor britain to egypt i know not neither could they tell me but one of them replied to me in that line of homer if the odyssey be homers we have come to a sorry cyprus and a sad egypt others told me that they once marched against the ethiopians and having defeated them several times then came back again leaving their property to the ethiopians but as to the truth of this i leave it to every man to form his own opinion  having come into the city of the priests i went forth into the street and found a priest of the baser sort who for a piece of silver led me hither and thither among the temples discoursing of many things  now it seemed to me a strange thing that the city was empty and no man dwelling therein save a few priests only and their wives and their children who are drawn to and fro in little carriages dragged by women but the priest told me that during half the year the city was desolate for that there came somewhat called the long or the vac and drave out the young priests and he said that these did no other thing but row boats and throw balls from one to the other and this they were made to do he said that the young priests might learn to be humble for they are the proudest of men but whether he spoke truth or not i know not only i set down what he told me but to anyone considering it this appears rather to jump with his storynamely that the young priests have houses on the river painted of divers colours all of them empty  then the priest at my desire brought me to one of the temples that i might seek out all things concerning herodotus the halicarnassian from one who knew now this temple is not the fairest in the city but less fair and goodly than the old temples yet goodlier and more fair than the new temples and over the roof there is the image of an eagle made of stoneno small marvel but a great one how men came to fashion him and that temple is called the house of queens here they sacrifice a boar once every year and concerning this they tell a certain sacred story which i know but will not utter  then i was brought to the priest who had a name for knowing most about egypt and the egyptians and the assyrians and the cappadocians and all the kingdoms of the great king he came out to me being attired in a black robe and wearing on his head a square cap but why the priests have square caps i know and he who has been initiated into the mysteries which they call matric knows but i prefer not to tell concerning the square cap then let this be sufficient now the priest received me courteously and when i asked him concerning herodotus whether he were a true man or not he smiled and answered abu goosh which in the tongue of the arabians means the father of liars then he went on to speak concerning herodotus and he said in his discourse that herodotus not only told the thing which was not but that he did so wilfully as one knowing the truth but concealing it for example quoth he solon never went to see croesus as herodotus avers nor did those about xerxes ever dream dreams but herodotus out of his abundant wickedness invented these things  now behold he went on how the curse of the gods falls upon herodotus for he pretends that he saw cadmeian inscriptions at thebes now i do not believe there were any cadmeian inscriptions there therefore herodotus is most manifestly lying moreover this herodotus never speaks of sophocles the athenian and why not because he being a child at school did not learn sophocles by heart for the tragedies of sophocles could not have been learned at school before they were written nor can any man quote a poet whom he never learned at school moreover as all those about herodotus knew sophocles well he could not appear to them to be learned by showing that he knew what they knew also then i thought the priest was making game and sport saying first that herodotus could know no poet whom he had not learned at school and then saying that all the men of his time well knew this poet about whom everyone was talking but the priest seemed not to know that herodotus and sophocles were friends which is proved by this that sophocles wrote an ode in praise of herodotus  then he went on and though i were to write with a hundred hands like briareus of whom homer makes mention i could not tell you all the things that the priest said against herodotus speaking truly or not truly or sometimes correctly and sometimes not as often befalls mortal men for herodotus he said was chiefly concerned to steal the lore of those who came before him such as hecataeus and then to escape notice as having stolen it also he said that being himself cunning and deceitful herodotus was easily beguiled by the cunning of others and believed in things manifestly false such as the story of the phoenixbird  then i spoke and said that herodotus himself declared that he could not believe that story but the priest regarded me not and he said that herodotus had never caught a crocodile with cold pig nor did he ever visit assyria nor babylon nor elephantine but saying that he had been in these lands said that which was not true he also declared that herodotus when he travelled knew none of the fat ones of the egyptians but only those of the baser sort and he called herodotus a thief and a beguiler and the same with intent to deceive as one of their own poets writes and to be short herodotus i could not tell you in one day all the charges which are now brought against you but concerning the truth of these things you know not least but most as to yourself being guilty or innocent wherefore if you have anything to show or set forth whereby you may be relieved from the burden of these accusations now is the time be no more silent but whether through the oracle of the dead or the oracle of branchidae or that in delphi or dodona or of amphiaraus at oropus speak to your friends and lovers whereof i am one from of old and let men know the very truth  now concerning the priests in the city of the ford of the ox it is to be said that of all men whom we know they receive strangers most gladly feasting them all day moreover they have many drinks cunningly mixed and of these the best is that they call archdeacon naming it from one of the priests offices truly as homer says if the odyssey be homers when that draught is poured into the bowl then it is no pleasure to refrain  drinking of this wine or nectar herodotus i pledge you and pour forth some deal on the ground to herodotus of halicarnassus in the house of hades  and i wish you farewell and good be with you whether the priest spoke truly or not truly even so may such good things betide you as befall dead men     v epistle to mr alexander pope

where thine ashes lie     vi to lucian of samosata    in what bower oh lucian of your rediscovered islands fortunate are you now reclining the delight of the fair the learned the witty and the brave in that clear and tranquil climate whose air breathes of violet and lily myrtle and the flower of the vine   where the daisies are rosescented  and the rose herself has got  perfume which on earth is not  among the music of all birds and the windblown notes of flutes hanging on the trees methinks that your laughter sounds most silvery sweet and that helen and fair charmides are still of your company master of mirth and soul the best contented of all that have seen the worlds ways clearly most clearsighted of all that have made tranquillity their bride what other laughers dwell with you where the crystal and fragrant waters wander round the shining palaces and the temples of amethyst  heine surely is with you if indeed it was not one syrian soul that dwelt among alien men germans and romans in the bodily tabernacles of heine and of lucian but he was fallen on evil times and evil tongues while lucian as witty as he as bitter in mockery as happily dowered with the magic of words lived long and happily and honoured imprisoned in no mattressgrave without rabelais without voltaire without heine you would find methinks even the joys of your happy islands lacking in zest and unless plato came by your way none of the ancients could meet you in the lists of sportive dialogue  there among the vines that bear twelve times in the year more excellent than all the vineyards of touraine while the songbirds bring you flowers from vales enchanted and the shapes of the blessed come and go beautiful in windwoven raiment of sunset hues there in a land that knows not age nor winter midnight nor autumn nor noon where the silver twilight of summerdawn is perennial where youth does not wax spectrepale and die there my lucian you are crowned the prince of the paradise of mirth  who would bring you if he had the power from the banquet where homer sings homer who in mockery of commentators past and to come german and greek informed you that he was by birth a babylonian yet if you who first wrote dialogues of the dead could hear the prayer of an epistle wafted to lands indiscoverable in the unheardof west you might visit once more a world so worthy of such a mocker so like the world you knew so well of old  ah lucian we have need of you of your sense and of your mockery here where faith is sick and superstition is waking afresh where gods come rarely and spectres appear at five shillings an interview where science is popular and philosophy cries aloud in the marketplace and clamour does duty for government and thais and lais are names of powerhere lucian is room and scope for you can i not imagine a new auction of philosophers and what wealth might be made by him who bought these popular sages and lecturers at his estimate and vended them at their own  hermes whom shall we put first up to auction  zeus that german in spectacles he seems a highly respectable man  hermes ho pessimist come down and let the public view you  zeus go on put him up and have done with him  hermes who bids for the life miserable for extreme complete perfect unredeemable perdition what offers for the universal extinction of the species and the collapse of the conscious  a purchaser he does not look at all a bad lot may one put him through his paces  hermes certainly try your luck  purchaser what is your name  pessimist hartmann  purchaser what can you teach me  pessimist that life is not worth living  purchaser wonderful most edifying how much for this lot  hermes two hundred pounds  purchaser i will write you a cheque for the money come home pessimist and begin your lessons without more ado  hermes attention here is a magnificent articlethe positive life the scientific life the enthusiastic life who bids for a possible place in the calendar of the future  purchaser what does he call himself he has a very french air  hermes put your own questions  purchaser whats your pedigree my philosopher and previous performances  positivist i am by rousseau out of catholicism with a strain of the evolution blood  purchaser what do you believe in  positivist in man with a large m  purchaser not in individual man  positivist by no means not even always in mr gladstone all men all churches all parties all philosophies and even the other sect of our own church are perpetually in the wrong buy me and listen to me and you will ahvays be in the right  purchaser and after this life what have you to offer me  positivist a distinguished position in the choir invisible but not of course conscious immortality  purchaser take him away and put up another lot  then the hegelian with his notion and the darwinian with his notions and the lotzian with his broad church mixture of religion and evolution and the spencerian with that absolute which is a sort of a something might all be offered with their divers wares and cheaply enough lucian you would value them in this auction of sects there is but one way to corinth as of old but which that way may be oh master of hermotimus we know no more than he did of old and still we find of all philosophies that the stoic route is most to be recommended but we have our cyrenaics too though they are no longer clothed in purple and crowned with flowers and fond of drink and of female fluteplayers ah here too you might laugh and fail to see where the pleasure lies when the cyrenaics are no judges of cakes nor of ale for that matter and are strangers in the courts of princes to despise all things to make use of all things in all things to follow pleasure only that is not the manner of the new if it were the secret of the older hedonism  then turning from the philosophers to the seekers after a sign what change lucian would you find in them and their ways none they are quite unaltered still our perigrinus and our perigrina too come to us from the east or if from the west they take india on their wayindia that secular home of drivelling creeds and of religion in its sacerdotage still they prattle of brahmins and buddhism though unlike peregrinus they do not publicly burn themselves on pyres at epsom downs after the derby we are not so fortunate in the demise of our theosophists and our police less wise than the hellenodicae would probably not permit the immolation of the quack like your alexander they deal in marvels and miracles oracles and warnings all such bogy stories as those of your philopseudes and the ghost of the lady who took to tablerapping because one of her best slippers had not been burned with her body are gravely investigated by the psychical society  even your ignorant bibliophile is still with usthe man without a tinge of letters who buys up old manuscripts because they are stained and gnawed and who goes for proof of valued antiquity to the testimony of the bookworms and the rich bibliophile now as in your satire clothes his volumes in purple morocco and gay dorures while their contents are sealed to him  as to the topics of satire and gay curiosity which occupy the lady known as gyp and m halévy in his les petites cardinal if you had not exhausted the matter in your dialogues of hetairai you would be amused to find the same old traits surviving without a touch of change one reads in halévys french of madame cardinal and in your greek of the mother of philinna and marvels that eighteen hundred years have not in one single trifle altered the mould still the old shabby lightloves the old greed the old luxury and squalor still the unconquerable superstition that now seeks to tell fortunes by the cards and in your time resorted to the sorceress with her magical bullroarer or turndun 1       1the greek rombos transliterated mentioned by lucian      and theocritus was the magical weapon of the australians      the turndun  yes lucian we are the same vain creatures of doubt and dread of unbelief and credulity of avarice and pretence that you knew and at whom you smiled nay our very social question is not altered do you not write in the runaways the artisans will abandon their workshops and leave their trades when they see that with all the labour that bows their bodies from dawn to dark they make a petty and starveling pittance while men that toil not nor spin are floating in pactolus  they begin to see this again as of yore but whether the end of their vision will be a laughing matter you fortunate lucian do not need to care hail to you and farewell     vii to maitre francoys rabelais  of the coming of the coqcigrues   masterin the boreal and septentrional lands turned aside from the noonday and the sun there dwelt of old as thou knowest and as olaus voucheth a race of men brave strong nimble and adventurous who had no other care but to fight and drink there by reason of the cold as virgil witnesseth men break wine with axes to their minds when once they were dead and gotten to valhalla or the place of their gods there would be no other pleasure but to swig tipple drink and boose till the coming of that last darkness and twilight wherein they with their deities should do battle against the enemies of all mankind which day they rather desired than dreaded  so chanced it also with pantagruel and brother john and their company after they had once partaken of the secret of the dive bouteille thereafter they searched no longer but abiding at their ease were merry frolic jolly gay glad and wise only that they always and ever did expect the awful coming of the coqcigrues now concerning the day of that coming and the nature of them that should come they knew nothing and for his part panurge was all the more adread as aristotle testifieth that men and panurge above others most fear that which they know least now it chanced one day as they sat at meat with viands rare dainty and precious as ever apicius dreamed of that there fluttered on the air a faint sound as of sermons speeches orations addresses discourses lectures and the like whereat panurge pricking up his ears cried methinks this wind bloweth from midlothian and so fell a trembling  next to their aural orifices and the avenues audient of the brain was borne a very melancholy sound as of harmoniums hymns organpianos psalteries and the like all playing different airs in a kind most hateful to the muses then said panurge as well as he might for the chattering of his teeth may i never drink if here come not the coqcigrues and this saying and prophecy of his was true and inspired but thereon the others began to mock flout and gird at panurge for his cowardice here am i cried brother john wellarmed and ready to stand a siege being entrenched fortified hemmedin and surrounded with great pasties huge pieces of salted beef salads fricassees hams tongues pies and a wilderness of pleasant little tarts jellies pastries trifles and fruits of all kinds and i shall not thirst while i have good wells founts springs and sources of bordeaux wine burgundy wine of the champagne country sack and canary a fig for thy coqcigrues  but even as he spoke there ran up suddenly a whole legion or rather army of physicians each armed with laryngoscopes stethoscopes horoscopes microscopes weighing machines and such other tools engines and arms as they had who after thy time persecuted monsieur de pourceaugnac and they all rushing on brother john cried out to him abstain abstain and one said i have well diagnosed thee and thou art in a fair way to have the gout i never did better in my days said brother john away with thy meats and drinks they cried and one said he must to royat and another hence with him to aix and a third banish him to wiesbaden and a fourth hale him to gastein and yet another to barbouille with him in chains  and while others felt his pulse and looked at his tongue they all wrote prescriptions for him like men mad for thy eating cried he that seemed to be their leader no soup no soup quoth brother john and those cheeks of his whereat you might have warmed your two hands in the winter solstice grew white as lilies nay and no salmon nor any beef nor mutton a little chicken by times but periculo tuo nor any game such as grouse partridge pheasant capercailzie wild duck nor any cheese nor fruit nor pastry nor coffee nor eau de vie and avoid all sweets no veal pork nor made dishes of any kind then what may i eat quoth the good brother whose valour had oozed out of the soles of his sandals a little cold bacon at breakfastno eggs quoth the leader of the strange folk and a slice of toast without butter and for thy drinkwhat gasped brother johnone dessertspoonful of whisky with a pint of the water of apollinaris at luncheon and dinner no more at this brother john fainted falling like a great buttress of a hill such as taygetus or erymanthus  while they were busy with him others of the frantic folk had built great platforms of wood whereon they all stood and spoke at once both men and women and of these some wore red crosses on their garments which meaneth salvation and others wore white crosses with a little black button of crape to signify purity and others bits of blue to mean abstinence while some of these pursued panurge others did beset pantagruel asking him very long questions whereunto he gave but short answers thus they asked  have ye local option herepan what  may one man drink if his neighbour be not athirstpan yea  have ye free educationpan what  must they that have pay to school them that have notpan nay  have ye free landpan what  have ye taken the land from the farmer and given it to the tailor out of work and the candlemaker masterlesspan nay  have your women folk votespan bosh  have ye got religionpan how  do you go about the streets at night brawling blowing a trumpet before you and making long prayerspan nay  have you manhood suffragepan eh  is jack as good as his master pan nay  have you joined the arbitration societypan quoy  will you let another kick you and will you ask his neighbour if you deserve the samepan nay  do you cat what you listpan ay  do you drink when you are athirst pan ay  are you governed by the free expression of the popular willpan how  are you servants of priests pulpits and penny paperspan no  now when they heard these answers of pantagruel they all fell some a weeping some a praying some a swearing some an arbitrating some a lecturing some a caucussing some a preaching some a faithhealing some a miracleworking some a hypnotising some a writing to the daily press and while they were thus busy like folk distraught reforming the island pantagruel burst out a laughing whereat they were greatly dismayed for laughter killeth the whole race of coqcigrues and they may not endure it  then pantagruel and his company stole aboard a barque that panurge had ready in the harbour and having provisioned her well with store of meat and good drink they set sail for the kingdom of entelechy where having landed they were kindly entreated and there abide to this day drinking of the sweet and eating of the fat under the protection of that intellectual sphere which hath in all places its centre and nowhere its circumference  such was their destiny there was their end appointed and thither the coqcigrues can never come for all the air of that land is full of laughter which killeth coqcigrues and there aboundeth the herb pantagruelion but for thee master francoys thou art not well liked in this island of ours where the coqcigrues are abundant very fierce cruel and tyrannical yet thou hast thy friends that meet and drink to thee and wish thee well wheresoever thou hast found thy grand peutétre     viii to jane austen    madameif to the enjoyments of your present state be lacking a view of the minor infirmities or foibles of men i cannot but think were the thought permitted that your pleasures are yet incomplete moreover it is certain that a woman of parts who has once meddled with literature will never wholly lose her love for the discussion of that delicious topic nor cease to relish what in the cant of our new age is styled literary shop for these reasons i attempt to convey to you some inkling of the present state of that agreeable art which you madam raised to its highest pitch of perfection  as to your own works immortal as i believe i have but little that is wholly cheering to tell one who among women of letters was almost alone in her freedom from a lettered vanity you are not a very popular author your volumes are not found in gaudy covers on every bookstall or if found are not perused with avidity by the emmas and catherines of our generation tis not long since a blow was dealt in the estimation of the unreasoning at your character as an author by the publication of your familiar letters the editor of these epistles unfortunately did not always take your witticisms and he added others which were too unmistakably his own while the injudicious were disappointed by the absence of your exquisite style and humour the wiser sort were the more convinced of your wisdom in your letters knowing your correspondents you gave but the small personal talk of the hour for them sufficient for your books you reserved matter and expression which are imperishable your admirers if not very numerous include all persons of taste who in your favour are apt somewhat to abate the rule or shake off the habit which commonly confines them to but temperate laudation  t is the fault of all art to seem antiquated and faded in the eyes of the succeeding generation the manners of your age were not the manners of today and young gentlemen and ladies who think scott slow think miss austen prim and dreary yet even could you return among us i scarcely believe that speaking the language of the hour as you might and versed in its habits you would win the general admiration for how tame madam are your characters especially your favourite heroines how limited the life which you knew and described how narrow the range of your incidents how correct your grammar  as heroines for example you chose ladies like emma and elizabeth and catherine women remarkable neither for the brilliance nor for the degradation of their birth women wrapped up in their own and the parishs concerns ignorant of evil as it seems and unacquainted with vain yearnings and interesting doubts who can engage his fancy with their matchmakings and the conduct of their affections when so many daring and dazzling heroines approach and solicit his regard  here are princesses dressed in white velvet stamped with golden fleursdelysladies with hearts of ice and lips of fire who count their roubles by the million their lovers by the score and even their husbands very often in figures of some arithmetical importance with these are the immaculate daughters of itinerant italian musicians maids whose souls are unsoiled amidst the contaminations of our streets and whose acquaintance with the art of phidias and praxiteles of daedalus and scopas is the more admirable because entirely derived from loving study of the inexpensive collections vended by the plasterofparis man round the corner when such heroines are wooed by the nephews of dukes where are your emmas and elizabeths your volumes neither excite nor satisfy the curiosities provoked by that modern and scientific fiction which is greatly admired i learn in the united states as well as in france and at home  you erred it cannot be denied with your eyes open knowing lydia and kitty so intimately as you did why did you make of them almost insignificant characters with lydia for a heroine you might have gone far and had you devoted three volumes and the chief of your time to the passions of kitty you might have held your own even now in the circulating library how lyddy perched on a corner of the roof first beheld her wickham how on her challenge he climbed up by a ladder to her side how they kissed caressed swung on gates together met at odd seasons in strange places and finally eloped all this might have been put in the mouth of a jealous elder sister say elizabeth and you would not have been less popular than several favourites of our time had you cast the whole narrative into the present tense and lingered lovingly over the thickness of marys legs and the softness of kittys cheeks and the blonde fluffiness of wickhams whiskers you would have left a romance still dear to young ladies  or again you might entrance your students still had you concentrated your attention on mrs rushworth who eloped with henrv crawford these should have been the chief figures of mansfield park but you timidly decline to tackle passion let other pens you write dwell on guilt and misery i quit such odious subjects as soon as i can ah there is the secret of your failure need i add that the vulgarity and narrowness of the social circles you describe impair your popularity i scarce remember more than one lady of title and but very few lords and these unessential in all your tales now when we all wish to be in society we demand plenty of titles in our novels at any rate and we get lords and very queer lords even from republican authors born in a country which in your time was not renowned for its literature i have heard a critic remark with a decided air of fashion on the brevity of the notice which your characters give each other when they offer invitations to dinner an invitation to dinner next day was despatched and this demonstrates that your acquaintance went out very little and had but few engagements how vulgar too is one of your heroines who bids mr darcy keep his breath to cool his porridge i blush for elizabeth it were superfluous to add that your characters are debased by being invariably mere members of the church of england as by law established the dissenting enthusiast the open soul that glides from esoteric buddhism to the salvation army and from the higher pantheism to the higher paganism we look for in vain among your studies of character nay the very words i employ are of unknown sound to you so how can you help us in the stress of the souls travailings  you may say that the souls travailings are no affair of yours proving thereby that you have indeed but a lowly conception of the duty of the novelist i only remember one reference in all your works to that controversy which occupies the chief of our attentionthe great controversy on creation or evolution your jane bennet cries i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine nor do you touch on our mighty social question the land laws save when mrs bennet appears as a land reformer and rails bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about there madam in that cruelly unjust performance what a text you had for a tendenzroman nay you can allow kitty to report that a private had been flogged without introducing a chapter on flogging in the army but you formally declined to stretch your matter out here and there with solemn specious nonsense about something unconnected with the story no padding for miss austen in fact madam as you were born before analysis came in or passion or realism or naturalism or irreverence or religious openmindedness you really cannot hope to rival your literary sisters in the minds of a perplexed generation your heroines are not passionate we do not see their red wet cheeks and tresses dishevelled in the manner of our frank young maenads what says your best successor a lady who adds fresh lustre to a name that in fiction equals yours she says of miss austen her heroines have a stamp of their own they have a certain gentle selfrespect and humour and hardness of heart love with them does not mean a passion as much as an interest deep and silent i think one prefers them so and that englishwomen should be more like anne elliot than maggie tulliver all the privilege i claim for my own sex is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone said anne perhaps she insisted on a monopoly that neither sex has all to itself ah madam what a relief it is to come back to your witty volumes and forget the follies of today in those of mr collins and of mrs bennet how fine nay how noble is your art in its delicate reserve never insisting never forcing the note never pushing the sketch into the caricature you worked without thinking of it in the spirit of greece on a labour happily limited and exquisitely organised dear books we say with miss thackeraydear books bright sparkling with wit and animation in which the homely heroines charm the dull hours fly and the very bores are enchanting     ix to master isaak walton    father isaakwhen i would be quiet and go angling it is my custom to carry in my wallet thy pretty book the compleat angler here methinks if i find not trout i shall find content and good company and sweet songs fair milkmaids and country mirth for you are to know that trout be now scarce and whereas he was ever a fearful fish he hath of late become so wary that none but the cunningest anglers may be even with him  it is not as it was in your time father when a man might leave his shop in fleet street of a holiday and when he had stretched his legs up tottenham hill come lightly to meadows chequered with waterlilies and ladysmocks and so fall to his sport nay now have the houses so much increased like a spreading sore through the breaking of that excellent law of the conscientious king and blessed martyr whereby building beyond the walls was forbidden that the meadows are all swallowed up in streets and as to the river lea wherein you took many a good trout i read in the news sheets that its bed is many inches thick in horrible filth and the air for more than half a mile on each side of it is polluted with a horrible sickening stench so that we stand in dread of a new plague called the cholera and so it is all about london for many miles and if a man at heavy charges betake himself to the fields lo you folk are grown so greedy that none will suffer a stranger to fish in his water  so poor anglers are in sore straits unless a man be rich and can pay great rents he may not fish in england and hence spring the discontents of the times for the angler is full of content if he do but take trout but if he be driven from the waterside he falls perchance into evil company and cries out to divide the property of the gentle folk as many now do even among parliament men whom you loved not father isaak neither do i love them more than reason and scripture bid each of us be kindly to his neighbour but behold the causes of the ill content are not yet all expressed for even where a man hath licence to fish he will hardly take trout in our age unless he be all the more cunning for the fish harried this way and that by so many of your disciples is exceeding shy and artful nor will he bite at a fly unless it falleth lightly just above his mouth and floateth dry over him for all the world like the natural ephemeris and we may no longer angle with worm for him nor with penk or minnow nor with the natural fly as was your manner but only with the artificial for the more difficulty the more diversion for my part i may cry like viator in your book master i can neither catch with the first nor second angle i have no fortune  so we fare in england but somewhat better north of the tweed where trout are less wary but for the most part small except in the extreme rough north among horrid hills and lakes thither master as methinks you may remember went richard franck that called himself philanthropus and was as it were the columbus of anglers discovering for them a new hyperborean world but franck doubtless is now an angler in the lake of darkness with nero and other tyrants for he followed after cromwell the man of blood in the old riding days how wickedly doth franck boast of that leader of the giddy multitude when they raged and became restless to find out misery for themselves and others and the rabble would herd themselves together as you said and endeavour to govern and act in spite of authority so you wrote and what said franck that recreant angler doth he not praise ireton vane nevill and martin and the most renowned valorous and victorious conqueror oliver cromwell natheless with all his sins on his head this franck discovered scotland for anglers and my heart turns to him when he praises the glittering and resolute streams of tweed  in those wilds of assynt and loch rannoch father we thy followers may yet take trout and forget the evils of the times but to be done with franck how harshly he speaks of thee and thy book for you may dedicate your opinion to what scribbling putationer you please the compleat angler if you will who tells you of a tedious fly story extravagantly collected from antiquated authors such as gesner and dubravius again he speaks of isaac walton whose authority to me seems alike authentick as is the general opinion of the vulgar prophet c  certain i am that franck if a better angler than thou was a worse man who writing his dialogues piscatorial or northern memoirs five years after the world welcomed thy compleat angler was jealous of thy favour with the people and may be hated thee for thy loyalty and sound faith but master like a peaceful man avoiding contention thou didst never answer this blustering franck but wentest quietly about thy quiet lea and left him his roaring brora and windy assynt how could this noisy man know theeand know thee he did having argued with thee in staffordand not love isaak walton a pedant angler i call him a plaguy angler so let him huff away and turn we to thee and to thy sweet charm in fishing for men  how often studying in thy book have i hummed to myself that of horace     laudis amore tumes sunt certa piacula quae te    ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello  so healing a book for the frenzy of fame is thy discourse on meadows and pure streams and the country life how peaceful men say and blessed must have been the life of this old man how lapped in content and hedged about by his own humility from the world they forget who speak thus that thy years which were many were also evil or would have seemed evil to divers that had tasted of thy fortunes thou wert poor but that to thee was no sorrow for greed of money was thy detestation thou wert of lowly rank in an age when gentle blood was alone held in regard yet tiny virtues made thee hosts of friends and chiefly among religious men bishops and doctors of the church thy private life was not unacquainted with sorrow thy first wife and all her fair children were taken from thee like flowers in spring though in thine age new love and new offspring comforted thee like the primrose of the later year thy private griefs might have made thee bitter or melancholy so might the sorrows of the state and of the church which were deprived of their heads by cruel men despoiled of their wealth the pious driven like thee from their homes fear everywhere everywhere robbery and confusion all this ruin might have angered another temper but thou father didst bear all with so much sweetness as perhaps neither natural temperament nor a firm faith nor the love of angling could alone have displayed for we see many anglers as witness richard franck aforesaid who are angry men and myself when i get my hooks entangled at every cast in a tree have come nigh to swear prophane  also we see religious men that are sour and fanatical no rare thing in the party that professes godliness but neither private sorrow nor public grief could abate thy natural kindliness nor shake a religion which was not untried but had indeed passed through the furnace like fine gold for if we find not faith at all times easy because of the oppositions of science and the searching curiosity of mens minds neither was faith a matter of course in thy day for the learned and pious were greatly tossed about like worthy mr chillingworth by doubts wavering between the church of rome and the reformed church of england the humbler folk also were invited now here now there by the clamours of fanatical nonconformists who gave themselves out to be somebody while atheism itself was not without many to witness to it therefore such a religion as thine was not so to say a mere innocence of evil in the things of our belief but a reasonable and grounded faith strong in despite of oppositions happy was the man in whom temper and religion and the love of the sweet country and an anglers pastime so conveniently combined happy the long life which held in its hand that threefold clue through the labyrinth of human fortunes around thee church and state might fall in ruins and might be rebuilded and thy tears would not be bitter nor thy triumph cruel   thus by gods blessing it befell thee          nec turpem senectam    degere nec cithara carentem   i would father that i could get at the verity about thy poems those recommendatory verses with which thou didst grace the lives of dr donne and others of thy friends redound more to the praise of thy kind heart than thy fancy but what or whose was the pastoral poem of thealma and clearchus which thou didst set about printing in 1678 and gavest to the world in 1683 thou gavest john chalkhill for the authors name and a john chalkhill of thy kindred died at winchester being eighty years of his age in 1679 now thou speakest of john chalkhill as a friend of edmund spensers and how could this be  are they right who hold that john chalkhill was but a name of a friend borrowed by thee out of modesty and used as a cloak to cover poetry of thine own inditing when mr flatman writes of chalkhill t is in words well fitted to thine own merit     happy old man whose worth all mankind knows    except himself who charitably shows    the ready road to virtue and to praise    the road to many long and happy days  however it be in that road by quiet streams and through green pastures thou didst walk all thine almost century of years and we who stray into thy path out of the highway of life we seem to hold thy hand and listen to thy cheerful voice if our sport be worse may our content be equal and our praise therefore none the less father if master stoddard the great fisher of tweedside be with thee greet him for me and thank him for those songs of his and perchance he will troll thee a catch of our dear river    tweed winding and wild where the heart is unbound   they know not they dream not who linger around   how the saddened will smile and the wasted rewin   from theethe bliss withered within  or perhaps thou wilt better love    the lanesome tala and the lyne   and mahon wi its mountain rills   an etterick whose waters twine   wi yarrow frae the forest hills   an gala too and teviot bright   an mony a stream o playfu speed   their kindred valleys a unite   amang the braes o bonnie tweed  so master may you sing against each other you two good old anglers like peter and corydon that sang in your golden age    x to m chapelain    monsieuryou were a popular writer and an honourable overeducated upright gentleman of the latter character you can never be deprived and i doubt not it stands you in better stead where you are than the laurels which flourished so gaily and faded so soon    laurel is green for a season and love is fair for a day   but love grows bitter with treason and laurel outlives not may  i know not if mr swinburne is correct in his botany but your laurel certainly outlived not may nor can we hope that you dwell where orpheus and where homer are some other crown some other paradise we cannot doubt it awaited un si bon homme but the moral excellence that even boileau admitted ladfoi lhonneur la probiité do not in parnassus avail the popular poet and some luckless musset or théophile regnier or villars attains a kind of immortality denied to the man of many contemporary editions and of a great commercial success  if ever for the confusion of horace any poet was made you sir should have been that fortunately manufactured article you were in matters of the muses the child of many prayers never since adams day have any parents but yours prayed for a poetchild then destiny that mocks the desires of men in general and fathers in particular heard the appeal and presented m chapelain and jeanne corbiére his wife with the future author of la pucelle oh futile hopes of men o pectora caeca all was done that education could do for a genius which among other qualities especially lacked fire and imagination and an ear for versesad defects these in a child of the muses your training in all the mechanics and metaphysics of criticism might have made you exclaim like rasselas enough thou hast convinced me that no human being can ever be a poet unhappily you succeeded in convincing cardinal richelieu that to be a poet was well within your powers you received a pension of one thousand crowns and were made captain of the cardinals minstrels as m de tréville was captain of the kings musketeers  ah pleasant age to live in when good intentions in poetry were more richly endowed than ever is research even research in prehistoric english among us niggard moderns how i wish i knew a cardinal or even as you did a prime minister who would praise and pension me but envy be still your existence was more happy indeed you constructed odes corrected sonnets presided at the hotel rambouillet while the learned ladies were still young and fair and you enjoyed a prodigious celebrity on the score of your yet unpublished epic who indeed says a sympathetic author m théophile gautier who could expect less than a miracle from a man so deeply learned in the laws of arta perfect turk in the science of poetry a person so well pensioned and so favoured by the great bishops and politicians combined in perfect good faith to advertise your merits hard must have been the heart that could resist the testimonials of your skill as a poet offered by the duc de montausier and the learned huet bishop of avranches and monseigneur godeau bishop of vence or m colbert who had such a genius for finance  if bishops and politicians and prime ministers skilled in finance and some critics ménage and sarrazin and vaugetas if ladies of birth and taste if all the world in fact combined to tell you that you were a great poet how can we blame you for taking yourself seriously and appraising yourself at the public estimate  it was not in human nature to resist the evidence of the bishops especially and when every minor poet believes in himself on the testimony of his own conceit you may be acquitted of vanity if you listened to the plaudits of your friends nay you ventured to pronounce judgment on contemporaries whom posterity has preferred to your perfections moliére said you understands the nature of comedy and presents it in a natural style the plot of his best pieces is borrowed but not without judgment his morale is fair and he has only to avoid scurrility  excellent unconscious popular chapelain  of yourself you observed in a report on contemporary literature that your courage and sincerity never allowed you to tolerate work not absolutely good and yet you regarded la pucellé with some complacency  on the pucellé you were occupied during a generation of mortal men i marvel not at the length of your labours as you received a yearly pension till the epic was finished but your muse was no alcmena and no hercules was the result of that prolonged night of creations first you gravely wrote out it was the task of five years all the compositions in prose ah why did you not leave it in that commonplace but appropriate medium what says the précieuse about you in boileaus satire    in chapelain for all his foes have said   she finds but one defect he cant be read   yet thinks the world might taste his maidens woes   if only he would turn his verse to prose  the verse had been prose and prose perhaps it should have remained yet for this precious pucelle in the age when paradise lost was sold for five pounds you are believed to have received about four thousand horace was wrong mediocre poets may exist now and then and he was a wise man who first spoke of aurea mediocritas at length the great work was achieved a work thrice blessed in its theme that divine maiden to whom france owes all and whom you and voltaire have recompensed so strangely in folio in italics with a score of portraits and engravings and culs de lampe the great work was given to the world and had a success six editions in eighteen months are figures which fill the poetic heart with envy and admiration and then alas the bubble burst a great lady madame de longveille hearing the pucellé read aloud murmured that it was perfect indeed but perfectly wearisome then the satires began and the satirists never left you till your poetic reputation was a rag till the mildest abbé at ménagés had his cheap sneer for chapelain  i make no doubt sir that envy and jealousy had much to do with the onslaught on your pucelle these qualities alas are not strange to literary minds does not even hesiod tell us potter hates potter and poet hates poet but contemporary spites do not harm true genius who suffered more than moliére from cabals yet neither the court nor the town ever deserted him and he is still the joy of the world i admit that his adversaries were weaker than yours what were boursault and le boulanger and thomas corneille and de visé what were they all compared to your enemy boileau brossette tells a story which really makes a man pity you there was a m de puimorin who to be in the fashion laughed at your once popular epic it is all very well for a man to laugh who cannot even read whereon m de puimorin replied quil navoit que trop su lire depuis que chapelain sétoit avisé de faire imprimer a new horror had been added to the accomplishment of reading since chapelain had published this repartee was applauded and m de puimorin tried to turn it into an epigram he did complete the last couplet    hélas pour mes péchés je nai su que trop lire  depuis que tu fais imprimer  but by no labour would m de puimorin achieve the first two lines of his epigram then you remember what great allies came to his assistance i almost blush to think that m despréaux m racine and m de moliére the three most renowned wits of the time conspired to complete the poor jest and madden you well bubble as your poetry was you may be proud that it needed all these sharpest of pens to prick the bubble other poets as popular as you have been annihilated by an article macaulay puts forth his hand and satan montgomery was no more it did not need a macaulay the laughter of a mob of little critics was enough to blow into space but you probably have met montgomery and of contemporary failures or successes i do not speak  i wonder sometimes whether the consensus of criticism ever made you doubt for a moment whether after all you were not a false child of apollo was your complacency tortured as the complacency of true poets has occasionally been by doubts did you expect posterity to reverse the verdict of the satirists and to do you justice you answered your earliest assailant liniére and by a few changes of words turned his epigrams into flattery but i fancy on the whole you remained calm unmoved wrapped up in admiration of yourself according to m de marivaux who reviewed as i am doing the spirits of the mighty dead you conceived on the strength of your reputation a great and serious veneration for yourself and your genius probably you were protected by this invulnerable armour of an honest vanity probably you declared that mere jealousy dictates the lines of boileau and that chapelains real fault was his popularity and his pecuniary success quil soit le mieux renté de tous les beauxesprits  this you would avow was your offence and perhaps you were not altogether mistaken yet posterity declines to read a line of yours and as we think of you we are again set face to face with that eternal problem how far is popularity a test of poetry burns was a poet and popular byron was a popular poet and the world agrees in the verdict of their own generation but montgomery though he sold so well was no poet nor sir i fear was your verse made of the stuff of immortality criticism cannot hurt what is truly great the cardinal and the academy left chiméne as fair as ever and as adorable it is only pinchbeck that perishes under the acids of satire gold defies them yet i sometimes ask myself does the existence of popularity like yours justify the malignity of satire which blesses neither him who gives nor him who takes are poisoned arrows fair against a bad poet i doubt it sir holding that even unpricked a poetic bubble must soon burst by its own nature yet satire will assuredly be written so long as bad poets are successful and bad poets will assuredly reflect that their assailants are merely envious and while their vogue lasts that prime ministers and the purchasing public are the only judges                    monsieur           votre trés humble serviteur                       andrew lang     xi to sir john manndeville kt  of the ways into ynde   sir johnwit you well that men holden you but light and some clepen you a liar and they say that you never were born in englond in the town of seynt albones nor have seen and gone through manye diverse londes and there goeth an old knight at arms and one that connes latyn and hath been beyond the sea and hath seen prester johns country and he hath been in an yle that men clepen burmah and there bin women bearded now men call him colonel henry yule and he hath writ of thee in his great booke sir john and he holds thee but lightly for he saith that ye did pill your tales out of odoric his book and that ye never saw snails with shells as big as houses nor never met no devyls but part of that ye say ye took it out of william of boldensele his book yet ye took not his wisdom withal but put in thine own foolishness nevertheless sir john for the frailty of mankynde ye are held a good fellow and a merry so now come i shall tell you of the new ways into ynde  in that lond they have a queen that governeth all the lond and all they ben obeyssant to her and she is the queen of englond for englishmen have taken all the lond of ynde for they were right good werryoures of old and wyse noble and worthy but of late hath risen a new sort of englishman very puny and fearful and these men clepen radicals and they go ever in fear and they scream on high for dread in the streets and the houses and they fain would flee away from all that their fathers gat them with the sword and this sort men call scuttleres but the mean folk and certain of the womenkind hear them gladly and they say ever that englishmen should flee out of ynde fro england men gon to ynde by many dyverse contreyes for englishmen ben very stirring and nymble for they ben in the seventh climate that is of the moon and the moon ye have said it yourself sir john natheless is it true is of lightly moving for to go diverse ways and see strange things and other diversities of the worlde wherefore englishmen be lightly moving and far wandering and they gon to ynde by the great sea ocean first come they to gibraltar that was the point of spain and builded upon a rock and there ben apes and it is so strong that no man may take it natheless did englishmen take it fro the spanyard and all to hold the way to ynde for ye may sail all about africa and past the cape men clepen of good hope but that way unto ynde is long and the sea is weary wherefore men rather go by the midland sea and englishmen have taken many yles in that sea  for first they have taken an yle that is clept malta and therein built they great castles to hold it against them of fraunce and italy and of spain and from this ile of malta men gon to cipre and cipre is right a good yle and a fair and a great and it hath 4 principal cytees within him and at famagost is one of the principal havens of the sea that is in the world and englishmen have but a lytel while gone won that yle from the sarazynes yet say that sort of englishmen where of i told you that is puny and sore adread that the lond is poisonous and barren and of no avail for that lond is much more hotter than it is here yet the englishmen that ben werryoures dwell there in tents and the skill is that they may ben the more fresh  from cypre men gon to the lond of egypte and in a day and a night he that hath a good wind may come to the haven of alessandrie now the lond of egypt longeth to the soudan yet the soudan longeth not to the lond of egypt and when i say this i do jape with words and may hap ye understond me not now englishmen went in shippes to alessandrie and brent it and over ran the lond and their soudyours warred agen the bedoynes and all to hold the way to ynde for it is not long past since frenchmen let dig a dyke through the narrow spit of lond from the midland sea to the red sea wherein was pharaoh drowned so this is the shortest way to ynde there may be to sail through that dyke if men gon by sea  but all the lond of egypt is clepen the vale enchaunted for no man may do his business well that goes thither but always fares he evil and therefore clepen they egypt the vale perilous and the sepulchre of reputations and men say there that is one of the entrees of helle in that vale is plentiful lack of gold and silver for many misbelieving men and many christian men also have gone often time for to take of the thresoure that there was of old and have pilled the thresoure wherefore there is none left and englishmen have let carry thither great store of our thresoure 9000000 of pounds sterling and whether they will see it agen i misdoubt me for that vale is alle fulle of develes and fiendes that men clepen bondholderes for that egypt from of olde is the lond of bondage and whatsoever thresoure cometh into the lond these devyls of bondholders grabben the same natheless by that vale do englishmen go unto ynde and they gon by aden even to kurrachee at the mouth of the flood of ynde thereby they send their souldyours when they are adread of them of muscovy  for look you there is another way into ynde and thereby the men of muscovy are fain to come if the englishmen let them not that way cometh by desert and wildernesse from the sea that is clept caspian even to khiva and so to merv and then come ye to zulfikar and penjdeh and anon to herat that is called the key of the gates of ynde then ye win the lond of the emir of the afghauns a great prince and a rich and he hath in his thresoure more crosses and stars and coats that captains wearen than any other man on earth  for all they of muscovy and all englishmen maken him gifts and he keepeth the gifts and he keepeth his own counsel for his lond lieth between ynde and the folk of muscovy wherefore both englishmen and men of muscovy would fain have him friendly yea and independent wherefore they of both parties give him clocks and watches and stars and crosses and culverins and now and again they let cut the throats of his men some deal and pill his country thereby they both set up their rest that the emir will be independent yea and friendly but his men love him not neither love they the english nor the muscovy folk for they are worshippers of mahound and endure not christian men and they love not them that cut their throats and burn their country  now they of muscovy ben devyls und they ben subtle for to make a thing seme otherwise than it is for to deceive mankind wherefore englishmen putten no trust in them of muscovy save only the englishmen ciept radicals for they make as if they loved these develes out of the fear and dread of war wherein they go and would be slaves sooner than fight but the folk of ynde know not what shall befall nor whether they of muscovy will take the lond or englishmen shall keep it so that their hearts may not enduren for drede and methinks that soon shall englishmen and muscovy folk put their bodies in adventure and war one with another and all for the way to ynde  but st george for englond i say and so enough and may the seyntes hele thee sir john of thy gowtes artetykes that thee tormenten but to thy boke i list not to give no credence     xii to alexandre dumas   sirthere are moments when the wheels of life even of such a life as yours run slow and when mistrust and doubt overshadow even the most intrepid disposition in such a moment towards the ending of your days you said to your son m alexandre dumas i seem to see myself set on a pedestal which trembles as if it were founded on the sands these sands your uncounted volumes are all of gold and make a foundation more solid than the rock as well might the singer of odysseus or the authors of the arabian nights or the first inventors of the stories of boccaccio believe that their works were perishable their names indeed have perished as the creator of les trois mousquetaires alarm himself with the thought that the world could ever forget alexandre dumas  than yours there has been no greater nor more kindly and beneficent force in modern letters to scott indeed you owed the first impulse of your genius but once set in motion what miracles could it not accomplish our dear porthos was overcome at last by a superhuman burden but your imaginative strength never found a task too great for it what an extraordinary vigour what health what an overflow of force was yours it is good in a day of small and laborious ingenuities to breathe the free air of your books and dwell in the company of dumass menso gallant so frank so indomitable such swordsmen and such trenchermen like m de rochefort in vingt ans aprés like that prisoner of the bastille your genius nest que dun parti cest du parti du grand air  there seems to radiate from you a still persistent energy and enjoyment in that current of strength not only your characters live frolic kindly and sane but even your very collaborators were animated by the virtue which went out of you how else can we explain it the dreary charge which feeble and envious tongues have brought against you in england and at home they say you employed in your novels and dramas that vicarious aid which in the slang of the studio the sculptors ghost is fabled to afford  well let it be so these ghosts when uninspired by you were faint and impotent as the strengthless tribes of the dead in homers hades before odysseus had poured forth the blood that gave them a momentary valour it was from you and your inexhaustible vitality that these collaborating spectres drew what life they possessed and when they parted from you they shuddered back into their nothingness where are the plays where the romances which maquet and the rest wrote in their own strength they are forgotten with last years snows they have passed into the wide wastepaper basket of the world you say of dartagnan when severed from his three friendsfrom porthos athos and aramishe felt that he could do nothing save on the condition that each of these companions yielded to him if one may so speak a share of that electric fluid which was his gift from heaven  no man of letters ever had so great a measure of that gift as you none gave of it more freely to all who cameto the chance associate of the hour as to the characters all so burly and fullblooded who flocked from your brain thus it was that you failed when you approached the supernatural your ghosts had too much flesh and blood more than the living persons of feebler fancies a writer so fertile so rapid so masterly in the ease with which he worked could not escape the reproaches of barren envy because you overflowed with wit you could not be serious because you created with a word you were said to scamp your work because you were never dull never pedantic incapable of greed you were to be censured as desultory inaccurate and prodigal  a generation suffering from mental and physical anaemiaa generation devoted to the chiselled phrase to accumulated documents to microscopic porings over human baseness to minute and disgustful records of what in humanity is least humanmay readily bring these unregarded and railing accusations like one of the great and goodhumoured giants of rabelais you may hear the murmurs from afar and smile with disdain to you who can amuse the worldto you who offer it the fresh air of the highway the battlefield and the seathe world must always return escaping gladly from the boudoirs and the bouges from the surgeries and hospitals and dead rooms of m daudet and m zola and of the wearisome de goncourt  with all your frankness and with that queer morality of the camp which if it swallows a camel now and again never strains at a gnat how healthy and wholesome and even pure are your romances you never gloat over sin nor dabble with an ugly curiosity in the corruptions of sense the passions in your tales are honourable and brave the motives are clearly human honour love friendship make the threefold cord the clue your knights and dames follow through how delightful a labyrinth of adventures your greatest books i take the liberty to maintain are the cycle of the valois la reine margot la dame de montsoreau les quarantecinq and the cycle of louis treize and louis quatorze les trois mousquetaires vingt ans aprés le vicomte de bragelonné and beside these two trilogiesa lonely monument like the sphinx hard by the three pyramidsmonte cristo  in these romances how easy it would have been for you to burn incense to that great goddess lubricity whom our critic says your people worship you had brantome you had tallemant you had rétif and a dozen others to furnish materials for scenes of voluptuousness and of blood that would have outdone even the present naturalistes from these alcoves of les dames galantes and from the torture chambers m zola would not have spared us one starting sinew of brave la mole on the rack you turned as scott would have turned without a thought of their profitable literary uses you had other metal to work on you gave us that superstitious and tragical true love of la molés that devotionhow tender and how pureof bussy for the dame de montsoreau you gave us the valour of dartagnan the strength of porthos the melancholy nobility of athos honour chivalry and friendship i declare your characters are real people to me and old friends i cannot bear to read the end of bragelonne and to part with them for ever suppose perthos athos and aramis should enter with a noiseless swagger curling their moustaches how we would welcome them forgiving dartagnan even his hateful fourberie in the case of milady the brilliance of your dialogue has never been approached there is wit everywhere repartees glitter and ring like the flash and clink of smallswords then what duels are yours and what inimitable battlepieces i know four good fights of one against a multitude in literature these are the death of gretir the strong the death of gunnar of lithend the death of hereward the wake the death of bussy damboise we can compare the strokes of the heroic fightingtimes with those described in later days and upon my word i do not know that the short sword of gretir or the bill of skarphedin or the bow of gunnar was better wielded than the rapier of your bussy or the sword and shield of kingsleys hereward  they say your fencing is unhistorical no doubt it is so and you knew it la mole could not have lunged on coconnas after deceiving circle for the parry was not invented except by your immortal chicot a genius in advance of his time even so hamlet and laertes would have fought with shields and axes not with small swords but what matters this pedantry in your works we hear the homeric muse again rejoicing in the clash of steel and even at times your very phrases are unconsciously homeric  look at these men of murder on the eve of st bartholomew who flee in terror from the queens chamber and find the door too narrow for their flight the very words were anticipated in a line of the odyssey concerning the massacre of the wooers and the picture of catherine de medicis prowling like a wolf among the bodies and the blood in a passage of the louvrethe picture is taken unwittingly from the iliad there was in you that reserve of primitive force that epic grandeur and simplicity of diction this is the force that animates monte cristo the earlier chapters the prison and the escape in later volumes of that romance methinks you stoop your wing of your dramas i have little room and less skill to speak antony they tell me was the greatest literary event of its time was a restoration of the stage while victor hugo needs the castoff clothes of history the wardrobe and costume the sepulchre of charlemagne the ghost of barbarossa the coffins of lucretia borgia alexandre dumas requires no more than a room in an inn where people meet in riding cloaks to move the soul with the last degree of terror and of pity  the reproach of being amusing has somewhat dimmed your famefor a moment the shadow of this tyranny will soon be overpast and when la curée and potbouillé are more forgotten than le grand cyrus men and womenand above all boyswill laugh and weep over the page of alexandre dumas like scott himself you take us captive in our childhood i remember a very idle little boy who was busy with the three musketeers when he should have been occupied with wilkinss latin prose twenty years after alas and more he is still constant to that gallant company and at this very moment is breathlessly wondering whether grimand will steal m de beaufort out of the cardinals prison     xiii to theocritus    sweet methinks is the whispering sound of yonder pinetree so theocritus with that sweet word ade didst thou begin and strike the keynote of thy songs sweet and didst thou find aught of sweet when thou like thy daphnis didst go down the stream when the whirling wave closed over the man the muses loved the man not hated of the nymphs perchance below those waters of death thou didst find like thine own hylas the lovely nereids waiting thee eunice and malis and nycheia with her april eyes in the house of hades theocritus doth there dwell aught that is fair and can the low light on the fields of asphodel make thee forget thy sicily nay methinks thou hast not forgotten and perchance for poets dead there is prepared a place more beautiful than their dreams it was well for the later minstrels of another day it was well for ronsard and du bellay to desire a dim elysium of their own where the sunlight comes faintly through the shadow of the earth where the poplars are duskier and the waters more pale than in the meadows of anjou        transliterated  there in that restful twilight far remote from war and plot from sword and fire and from religions that sharpened the steel and lit the torch there these learned singers would fain have wandered with their learned ladies satiated with life and in love with an unearthly quiet but to thee theocritus no twilight of the hollow land was dear but the high suns of sicily and the brown cheeks of the country maidens were happiness enough for thee therefore methinks surely is reserved an elysium beneath the summer of a faroff system with stars not ours and alien seasons there as bion prayed shall spring the thrice desirable be with thee the whole year through where there is neither frost nor is the heat so heavy on men but all is fruitful and all sweet things blossom and evenly meted are darkness and dawn space is wide and there be many worlds and suns enow and the sungod surely has had a care of his own little didst thou need in thy native land the isle of the three capes little didst thou need but sunlight on land and sea death can have shown thee naught dearer than the fragrant shadow of the pines where the dry needles of the fir are strewn or glades where feathered ferns make a couch more soft than sleep the short grass of the cliffs too thou didst love where thou wouldst lie and watch with the tunny watcher till the deep blue sea was broken by the burnished sides of the tunny shoal and afoam with their gambols in the brine there the muses met thee and the nymphs and there apollo remembering his old thraldom with admetus would lead once more a mortals flocks and listen and learn theocritus while thou like thine own comatas didst sweetly sing  there methinks i see thee as in thy happy days reclined on deep beds of fragrant lentisk lowly strewn and rejoicing in new stript leaves of the vine while far above thy head waved many a poplar many an elmtree and close at hand the sacred waters sang from the mouth of the cavern of the nymphs and when night came methinks thou wouldst flee from the merry company and the dancing girls from the fading crowds of roses or white violets from the cottabos and the minstrelsy and the bibline wine from these thou wouldst slip away into the summer night then the beauty of life and of the summer would keep thee from thy couch and wandering away from syracuse by the sandhills and the sea thou wouldst watch the low cabin roofed with grass where the fishingrods of reed were leaning against the door while the mediterranean floated up her waves and filled the waste with sound there didst thou see thine ancient fishermen rising ere the dawn from their bed of dry seaweed and heardst them stirring drowsy among their fishing gear and heardst them tell their dreams  or again thou wouldst wander with dusty feet through the ways that the dust makes silent while the breath of the kine as they were driven forth with the morning came fresh to thee and the trailing dewy branch of honeysuckle struck sudden on thy cheek thou wouldst see the dawn awake in rose and saffron across the waters and etna grey and pale against the sky and the setting crescent would dip strangely in the glow on her way to the sea then methinks thou wouldst murmur like thine own simaetha the lovelorn witch farewell selene bright and fair farewell ye other stars that follow the wheels of the quiet night nay surely it was in such an hour that thou didst behold the girl as she burned the laurel leaves and the barley grain and melted the waxen image and called on selene to bring her lover home even so even now in the islands of greece the setting moon may listen to the prayers of maidens bright golden moon that now art near the waters go thou and salute my lover he that stole my love and that kissed me saying never will i leave thee and lo he hath left me as men leave a field reaped and gleaned like a church where none cometh to pray like a city desolate  so the girls still sing in greece for though the temples have fallen and the wandering shepherds sleep beneath the broken columns of the gods house in selinus yet these ancient fires burn still to the old divinities in the shrines of the hearths of the peasants it is none of the new creeds that cry in the dirge of the sicilian shepherds of our time ah light of mine eyes what gift shall i send thee what offering to the other world the apple fadeth the quince decayeth and one by one they perish the petals of the rose i will send thee my tears shed on a napkin and what though it burneth in the flame if my tears reach thee at the last  yes little is altered theocritus on these shores beneath the sun where thou didst wear a tawny skin stripped from the roughest of hegoats and about thy breast an old cloak buckled with a plaited belt thou wert happier there in sicily methinks and among vines and shadowy limetrees of cos than in the dust and heat and noise of alexandria what love of fame what lust of gold tempted thee away from the red cliffs and grey olives and wells of black water wreathed with maidenhair    the music of the rustic flute   kept not for long its happy country tone   lost it too soon and learned a stormy note   of men contention tost of men who groan   which tasked thy pipe too sore and tired thy throat   it failed and thou wast mute   what hadst thou to make in cities and what could ptolemies and princes give thee better than the goatmilk cheese and the ptelean wine thy muses were meant to be the delight of peaceful men not of tyrants and wealthy merchants to whom they vainly went on a begging errand who will open his door and gladly receive our muses within his house who is there that will not send them back again without a gift and they with naked feet and looks askance come homewards and sorely they upbraid me when they have gone on a vain journey and listless again in the bottom of their empty coffer they dwell with heads bowed over their chilly knees where is their drear abode when portionless they return how far happier was the prisoned goatherd comatas in the fragrant cedar chest where the bluntfaced bees from the meadow fed him with food of tender flowers because still the muse dropped sweet nectar on his lips  thou didst leave the neatherds and the kine and the oaks of himera the galingale hummed over by the bees and the pine that dropped her cones and amaryllis in her cave and bombyca with her feet of carven ivory thou soughtest the city and strife with other singers and the learned write still on thy quarrels with apollonius and callimachus and antagoras of rhodes so ancient are the hatreds of poets envy jealousy and all unkindness  not to the wits of courts couldst thou teach thy rural song though all these centuries more than two thousand years they have laboured to vie with thee there has come no new pastoral poet though virgil copied thee and pope and phillips and all the buckram band of the teacup time and all the modish swains of france have sung against thee as the son challenged athene they never knew the shepherds life the long winter nights on dried heather by the fire the long summer days when over the dry grass all is quiet and only the insects hum and the shrunken burn whispers a silver tune swains in highheeled shoon and lace shepherdesses in rouge and diamonds the world is weary of all concerning them save their images in porcelain effigies how unlike the golden figures dedicate to aphrodite of bombyca and battus somewhat theocritus thou hast to answer for thou that first of men brought the shepherd to court and made courtiers wild to go a maying with the shepherds     xiv to edgar allan poe    siryour english readers better acquainted with your poems and romances than with your criticisms have long wondered at the indefatigable hatred which pursues your memory you who knew the men will not marvel that certain microbes of letters the survivors of your own generation still harass your name with their malevolence while old women twitter out their incredible and heeded slanders in the literary papers of new york but their persistent animosity does not quite suffice to explain the dislike with which many american critics regard the greatest poet perhaps the greatest literary genius of their country with a commendable patriotism they are not apt to rate native merit too low and you i think are the only example of an american prophet almost without honour in his own country  the recent publication of a cold careful and in many respects admirable study of your career edgar allan poe by george woodberry houghton mifflin and co boston reminds english readers who have forgotten it and teaches those who never knew it that you were unfortunately a reviewer how unhappy were the necessities how deplorable the vein that compelled or seduced a man of your eminence into the dusty and stony ways of contemporary criticism about the writers of his own generation a leader of that generation should hold his peace he should neither praise nor blame nor defend his equals he should not strike one blow at the buzzing ephemerae of letters the breath of their life is in the columns of literary gossip and they should be allowed to perish with the weekly advertisements on which they pasture reviewing of course there must needs be but great minds should only criticise the great who have passed beyond the reach of eulogy or faultfinding  unhappily taste and circumstances combined to make you a censor you vexed a continent and you are still unforgiven what irritation of a sensitive nature chafed by some indefinite sense of wrong drove you in mr longfellows own words to attack his pure and beneficent muse we may never ascertain but mr longfellow forgave you easily for pardon comes easily to the great it was the smaller men the daweses griswolds and the like that knew not how to forget the new yorkers never forgave him says your latest biographer and one scarcely marvels at the inveteracy of their malice it was not individual vanity alone but the whole literary class that you assailed as a literary people you wrote we are one vast perambulating humbug after that declaration of war you died and left your reputation to the vanities yet writhing beneath your scorn they are writhing and writing still he who knows them need not linger over the attacks and defences of your personal character he will not waste time on calumnies talebearing private letters and all the noisome dust which takes so long in settling above your tomb  for us it is enough to know that you were compelled to live by your pen and that in an age when the author of to helen and the cask of amontillado was paid at the rate of a dollar a column when such poverty was the mate of such pride as yours a misery more deep than that of burns an agony longer than chattertons were inevitable and assured no man was less fortunate than you in the moment of his birthinfelix opportunitate vitae had you lived a generation later honour wealth applause success in europe and at home would all have been yours within thirty years so great a change has passed over the profession of letters in america and it is impossible to estimate the rewards which would have fallen to edgar poe had chance made him the contemporary of mark twain and of called back it may be that your criticisms helped to bring in the new era and to lift letters out of the reach of quite unlettered scribblers though not a scholar at least you had a respect for scholarship you might still marvel over such words as objectional in the new biography of yourself and might ask what is meant by such a sentence as his connection with it had inured to his own benefit by the frequent puffs of himself and so forth  best known in your own day as a critic it is as a poet and a writer of short tales that you must live but to discuss your few and elaborate poems is a waste of time so completely does your own brief definition of poetry the rhythmic creation of the beautiful exhaust your theory and so perfectly is the theory illustrated by the poems natural bent and reaction against the example of mr longfellow combined to make you too intolerant of what you call the didactic element in verse even if morality be not seveneighths of our life the exact proportion as at present estimated there was a place even on the hellenic parnassus for gnomic bards and theirs in the nature of the case must always be the largest public  music is the perfection of the soul or the idea of poetry so you wrote the vagueness of exaltation aroused by a sweet air which should be indefinite and never too strongly suggestive is precisely what we should aim at in poetry you aimed at that mark and struck it again and again notably in helen thy beauty is to me in the haunted palace the valley of unrest and the city in the sea but by some nemesis which might perhaps have been foreseen you are to the world the poet of one poemthe raven a piece in which the music is highly artificial and the exaltation what there is of it by no means particularly vague so a portion of the public know little of shelley but the skylark and those two incongruous birds the lark and the raven bear each of them a poets name vivu per ora virum your theory of poetry if accepted would make you after the author of kubla khan the foremost of the poets of the world at no long distance would come mr william morris as he was when he wrote golden wings the blue closet and the sailing of the sword and close up mr lear the author of the yongi bongi bo and the lay of the jumblies  on the other hand homer would sink into the limbo to which you consigned moliére if we may judge a theory by its results when compared with the deliberate verdict of the world your aesthetic does not seem to hold water the odyssey is not really inferior to ulalume as it ought to be if your doctrine of poetry were correct nor le festin de pierré to undine yet you deserve the praise of having been constant in your poetic practice to your poetic principlesprinciples commonly deserted by poets who like wordsworth have published their aesthetic system your pieces are few and dr johnson would have called you like fielding a barren rascal but how can a writers verses be numerous if with him as with you poetry is not a pursuit but a passion which cannot at will be excited with an eye to the paltry compensations or the more paltry commendations of mankind of you it may be said more truly than shelley said it of himself that to ask you for anything human is like asking at a ginshop for a leg of mutton  humanity must always be to the majority of men the true stuff of poetry and only a minority will thank you for that rare music which like the strains of the fiddler in the story is touched on a single string and on an instrument fashioned from the spoils of the grave you chose or you were destined     to vary from the kindly race of men  and the consequences which wasted your life pursue your reputation for your stories has been reserved a boundless popularity and that highest successthe success of a perfectly sympathetic translation by this time of course you have made the acquaintance of your translator m charles baudelaire who so strenuously shared your views about mr emerson and the transcendentalists and who so energetically resisted all those ideas of progress which came from hell or boston on this point however the world continues to differ from you and m baudelaire and perhaps there is only the choice between our optimism and universal suicide or universal opiumeating but to discuss your ultimate ideas is perhaps a profitless digression from the topic of your prose romances  an english critic probably a northerner at heart has described them as hawthorne and delirium tremens i am not aware that extreme orderliness masterly elaboration and unchecked progress towards a predetermined effect are characteristics of the visions of delirium if they be then there is a deal of truth in the criticism and a good deal of delirium tremens in your style but your ingenuity your completeness your occasional luxuriance of fancy and wealth of jewellike words are not perhaps gifts which mr hawthorne had at his command he was a great writerthe greatest writer in prose fiction whom america has produced but you and he have not much in common except a certain mortuary turn of mind and a taste for gloomy allegories about the workings of conscience  i forbear to anticipate your verdict about the latest essays of american fiction these by no means follow in the lines which you laid down about brevity and the steady working to one single effect probably you would not be very tolerant tolerance was not your leading virtue of mr roe now your countrymens favourite novelist he is long he is didactic he is eminently uninspired in the works of one who is what you were called yourself a bostonian you would admire at least the acute observation the subtlety and the unfailing distinction but destitute of humour as you unhappily but undeniably were you would miss i fear the charm of daisy miller you would admit the unity of effect secured in washington square though that effect is as remote as possible from the terror of the house of usher or the vindictive triumph of the cask of amontillado  farewell farewell thou sombre and solitary spirit a genius tethered to the hackwork of the press a gentleman among canaille a poet among poetasters dowered with a scholars taste without a scholars training embittered by his sensitive scorn and all unsupported by his consolations     xv to sir walter scott bart                    rodono st marys loch                   sept 5 1885  sirin your biography it is recorded that you not only won the favour of all men and women but that a domestic fowl conceived an affection for you and that a pig by his will had never been severed from your company if some circe had repeated in my case her favourite miracle of turning mortals into swine and had given me a choice into that fortunate pig blessed among his race would i have been converted you almost alone among men of letters still like a living friend win and charm us out of the past and if one might call up a poet as the scholiast tried to call homer from the shades who would not out of all the rest demand some hours of your society who that ever meddled with letters what child of the irritable race possessed even a tithe of your simple manliness of the heart that never knew a touch of jealousy that envied no man his laurels that took honour and wealth as they came but never would have deplored them had you missed both and remained but the border sportsman and the border antiquary  were the word genial not so much profaned were it not misused in easy goodnature to extenuate lettered and sensual indolence that worn old term might be applied above all men to the shirra but perhaps we scarcely need a word it would be seldom in use for a character so rare or rather so lonely in its nobility and charm as that of walter scott here in the heart of your own country among your own grey roundshouldered hills each so like the other that the shadow of one falling on its neighbour exactly outlines that neighbours shape it is of you and of your works that a native of the forest is most frequently brought in mind all the spirits of the river and the hill all the dying refrains of ballad and the fading echoes of story all the memory of the wild past each legend of burn and loch seem to have combined to inform your spirit and to secure themselves an immortal life in your song it is through you that we remember them and in recalling them as in treading each hillside in this land we again remember you and bless you  it is not sixty years since the echo of tweed among his pebbles fell for the last time on your ear not sixty years since and how much is altered but two generations have passed the lad who used to ride from edinburgh to abbotsford carrying new books for you and old is still vending

walter we are still very radical in the forest and you were taken away from many evils to come how would the cheek of walter scott or of leyden have blushed at the names of majuba the soudan maiwand

vicissitudes of things and the overthrow of customs let us be thankful that beyond the reach of the manufacturers the border country remains as kind and homely as ever i looked at ashiestiel some days ago the house seemed just as it may have been when you left it for abbotsford only there was a lawntennis net on the lawn the hill on the opposite bank of the tweed was covered to the crest with turnips and the burn did not sing below the little bridge for in this arid summer the burn was dry but there was still a grilse that rose to a big march brown in the shrunken stream below elibank this

praise be unequal to our gratitude fungor inani munere     xvi to eusebius of caesarea  concerning the gods of the heathen   touching the gods of the heathen most reverend father thou art not ignorant that even now as in the time of thy probation on earth there is great dissension that these feigned deities and idols the work of mens hands are no longer worshipped thou knowest neither do men eat meat offered to idols even as spoke that last oracle which murmured forth the latest and the only true voice from delphi even so the fairwrought court divine hath fallen no more hath phoebus his home no more his laurelbough nor the singing well of water nay the sweetvoiced water is silent the fane is ruinous and the images of mens idolatry are dust  nevertheless most worshipful men do still dispute about the beginnings of those sinful gods such as zeus athene and dionysus and marvel how first they won their dominion over the souls of the foolish peoples now concerning these things there is not one belief but many howbeit there are two main kinds of opinion one sect of philosophers believesas thyself with heavenly learning didst not vainly persuadethat the gods were the inventions of wild and bestial folk who long before cities were builded or life was honourably ordained fashioned forth evil spirits in their own savage likeness ay or in the likeness of the very beasts that perish to this judgment as it is set forth in thy book of the preparation for the gospel i humble as i am do give my consent but on the other side are many and learned men chiefly of the tribes of the alemanni who have almost conquered the whole inhabited world these being unwilling to suppose that the hellenes were in bondage to superstitions handed down from times of utter darkness and a bestial life do chiefly hold with the heathen philosophers even with the writers whom thou most venerable didst confound with thy wisdom and chasten with the scourge of small cords of thy wit  thus like the heathen our doctors and teachers maintain that the gods of the nations were in the beginning such pure natural creatures as the blue sky the sun the air the bright dawn and the fire but as time went on men forgetting the meaning of their own speech and no longer understanding the tongue of their own fathers were misled and beguiled into fashioning all those lamentable tales as that zeus for love of mortal women took the shape of a bull a ram a serpent an ant an eagle and sinned in such wise as it is a shame even to speak of  behold then most worshipful how these doctors and learned men argue even like the philosophers of the heathen whom thou didst confound for they declare the gods to have been natural elements sun and sky and storm even as did thy opponents and like them as thou saidst they are nowise at one with each other in their explanations for of old some boasted that hera was the air and some that she signified the love of woman and man and some that she was the waters above the earth and others that she was the earth beneath the waters and yet others that she was the night for that night is the shadow of earth as if forsooth the men who first worshipped hera had understanding of these things and when hera and zeus quarrel unseemly as homer declareth this meant said the learned in thy days no more than the strife and confusion of the elements and was not in the beginning an idle slanderous tale  to all which most worshipful thou didst answer wisely saying that hera could not be both night and earth and water and air and the love of sexes and the confusion of the elements but that all these opinions were vain dreams and the guesses of the learned and whythou saidsteven if the gods were pure natural creatures are such foul things told of them in the mysteries as it is not fitting for me to declare these wanderings and drinkings and loves and corruptions that would be shameful in men why thou saidst were they attributed to the natural elements and wherefore did the gods constantly show themselves like the sorcerers called werewolves in the shape of the perishable beasts but mainly thou didst argue that till the philosophers of the heathen were agreed among themselves not all contradicting each the other they had no semblance of a sure foundation for their doctrine  to all this and more most worshipful father i know not what the heathen answered thee but in our time the learned men who stand to it that the heathen gods were in the beginning the pure elements and that the nations forgetting their first love and the significance of their own speech became confused and were betrayed into foul stories about the pure godsthese learned men i say agree no whit among themselves nay they differ one from another not less than did plutarch and porphyry and theagenes and the rest whom thou didst laugh to scorn bear with me father while i tell thee how the new plutarchs and porphyrys do contend among themselves and yet these differences of theirs they call science  consider the goddess athene who sprang armed from the head of zeus even asamong the fables of the poor heathen folk of seas thou never knewestgoddesses are fabled to leap out from the armpits or feet of their fathers thou must know that what plato in the cratylus made socrates say in jest the learned among us practise in sad earnest for when they wish to explain the nature of any god they first examine his name and torment the letters thereof arranging and altering them according to their will and flying off to the speech of the indians and medes and chaldeans and other barbarians if greek will not serve their turn how saith socrates i bethink me of a very new and ingenious idea that occurs to me and if i do not mind i shall be wiser than i should be by tomorrows dawn my notion is that we may put in and pull out letters at pleasure and alter the accents even so do our learnednot at pleasure maybe but according to certain fixed laws so they declare yet none the more do they agree among themselves and i deny not that they discover many things true and good to be known but as touching the names of the gods their learning as it standeth is confusion look then at the goddess athene taking one example out of hundreds we have dwelling in our coasts muellerus the most erudite of the doctors of the alemanni and the most goldenmouthed concerning athene he saith that her name is none other than in the ancient tongue of the brachmanae ahana which being interpreted means the dawn and that the morning light saith he offers the best startingpoint for the later growth of athene has been proved i believe beyond the reach of doubt or even cavil 1       1 the lesson of jupiternineteenth century october 1885  yet this same doctor candidly lets us know that another of his nation the witty benfeius hath devised another sense and origin of athene taken from the speech of the old medes but muellerus declares to us that whosoever shall examine the contention of benfeius will be bound in common honesty to confess that it is untenable this father is one for benfeius as the saying goes and as muellerus holds that these matters admit of almost mathematical precision it would seem that benfeius is but a dummkopf as the alemanni say in their own language when they would be pleasant among themselves  now wouldst thou credit it despite the mathematical plainness of the facts other alemanni agree neither with muellerus nor yet with benfeius and will neither hear that athene was the dawn nor yet that she is the feminine of the zend thraetana athwyana lo you how prellerus goes about to show that her name is drawn not from ahana and the old brachmanae nor athwyana and the old medes but from the root aith whence aither the air or ath whence anthos a flower yea and prellerus will have it that no man knows the verity of this matter none the less he is very bold and will none of the dawn but holds to it that athene was from the first the clear pure height of the air which is exceeding pure in attica  now father as if all this were not enough comes one roscherus in with a mighty great volume on the gods and furtwaenglerus among others for his ally and these doctors will neither with rueckertus and hermannus take athene for wisdom in person nor with welckerus and prellerus for the goddess of air nor even with muellerus and mathematical certainty for the morningred but they say that athene is the black thundercloud and the lightning that leapeth therefrom i make no doubt that other alemanni are of other minds quot alemanni tot sententiae  yea as thou saidst of the learned heathen oude gar allelois symphona physiologousis yet these disputes of theirs they call science but if any man says to the learned best of men you are erudite and laborious and witty but till you are more of the same mind your opinions cannot be styled knowledge nay they are at present of no avail whereon to found any doctrine concerning the godsthat man is railed at for his mean and weak arguments        transliterated from greek  was it thus father that the heathen railed against thee but i must still believe with thee that these evil tales of the gods were invented when mans life was yet brutish and wandering as is the life of many tribes that even now tell like tales and were maintained in honour of the later greeks because none dared alter the ancient beliefs of his ancestors farewell father and all good be with thee wishes thy wellwisher and thy disciple     xvii to percy bysshe shelley   sirin your lifetime on earth you were not more than commonly curious as to what was said by the herd of mankind if i may quote your own phrase it was that of one who loved his fellowmen but did not in his less enthusiastic moments overestimate their virtues and their discretion removed so far away from our hubbub and that world where as you say we pursue our serious folly as of old you are one may guess but moderately concerned about the fate of your writings and your reputation as to the first you have somewhere said in one of your letters that the final judgment on your merits as a poet is in the hands of posterity and that you fear the verdict will be guilty and the sentence death such apprehensions cannot have been fixed or frequent in the mind of one whose genius burned always with a clearer and steadier flame to the last the jury of which you spoke has met a mixed jury and a merciful the verdict is well done and the sentence immortality of fame there have been there are dissenters yet probably they will be less and less heard as the years go on  one judge or juryman has made up his mind that prose was your true province and that your letters will outlive your lays i know not whether it was the same or an equally wellinspired critic who spoke of your most perfect lyrics so beau brummell spoke of his illtied cravats as a gallery of your failures but the general voice does not echo these utterances of a too subtle intellect at a famous university not your own once existed a band of men known as the trinity sniffers perhaps the spirit of the sniffer may still inspire some of the jurors who from time to time make themselves heard in your case the quarterly review i fear is still unreconciled it regards your attempts as tainted by the spirit of the liberal movement in english literature and it is impossible alas to maintain with any success that you were a throne and altar tory at oxford you are forgiven and the old rooms where you let the oysters burn was not your founder king alfred once guilty of similar negligence are now shown to pious pilgrims  but conservatives t is rumoured are still averse to your opinions and are believed to prefer to yours the works of the reverend mr keble and indeed of the clergy in general but in spite of all this your poems like the affections of the true lovers in theocritus are still in the mouths of all and chiefly on the lips of the young it is in your lyrics that you live and i do not mean that every one could pass an examination in the plot of prometheus unbound talking of this piece by the way a cambridge critic finds that it reveals in you a hankering after life in a cavedoubtless an unconsciously inherited memory from caveman speaking of caveman reminds me that you once spoke of deserting song for prose and of producing a history of the moral intellectual and political elements in human society which we now agree began as asia would fain have ended in a cave  fortunately you gave us adonai and hellas instead of this treatise and we have now successfully written the natural history of man for ourselves science tells us that before becoming cavedweller he was a brute experience daily proclaims that he constantly reverts to his original condition lhomme est un méchant animal in spite of your boyish efforts to add pretty girls to the list of the good the disinterested and the free  ah not in the wastes of speculation nor the sterile din of politics were the haunts meet for thee watching the yellow bees in the ivy bloom and the reflected pine forest in the waterpools watching the sunset as it faded and the dawn as it fired and weaving all fair and fleeting things into a tissue where light and music were at one that was the task of shelley to ask you for anything human you said was like asking for a leg of mutton at a ginshop nay rather like asking apollo and hebe in the olympian abodes to give us beef for ambrosia and port for nectar each poet gives what he has and what he can offer you spread before us fairy bread and enchanted wine and shall we turn away with a sneer because out of all the multitudes of singers one is spiritual and strange one has seen artemis unveiled one like anchises has been beloved of the goddess and his eyes when he looks on the common works of common men are like the eyes of anchises blind with excess of light let shelley sing of what he saw what none saw but shelley  notwithstanding the popularity of your poems the most romantic of things didactic our world is no better than the world you knew this will disappoint you who had a passion for reforming it kings and priests are very much where you left them true we have a poet who assails them at large frequently and fearlessly yet mr swinburne has never like kind hunt been in prison nor do we fear for him a charge of treason moreover chemical science has discovered new and ingenious ways of destroying principalities and powers you would be interested in the methods but your peaceful revolutionism which disdained physical force would regret their application  our foreign affairs are not in a state which even you would consider satisfactory for we have just had to contend with a revolt of islam and we still find in russia exactly the qualities which you recognised and described we have a great statesman whose methods and eloquence somewhat resemble those you attribute to laon and prince athanase alas he is a youth of more than seventy summers and not in his time will prometheus retire to a cavern and pass a peaceful millennium in twining buds and beams  in domestic affairs most of the reforms you desired to see have been carried ireland has received emancipation and almost everything else she can ask for i regret to say that she is still unhappy her wounds unstanched her wrongs unforgiven at home we have enfranchised the paupers and expect the most happy results paupers as mr gladstone says are our own flesh and blood and as we compel them to be vaccinated so we should permit them to vote is it a dream that mr jesse collings how you would have loved that man has a bill for extending the priceless boon of the vote to inmates of pauper lunatic asylums this may prove that last element in the elixir of political happiness which we have sought in vain atheists you will regret to hear are still unpopular but the new parliament has done something for mr bradlaugh you should have known our charles while you were in the queen mab stage i fear you wandered later from his robust condition of intellectual development  as to your private life many biographers contrive to make public as much of it as possible your name even in life was alas a kind of ducdame to bring people of no very great sense into your circle this curious fascination has attracted round your memory a feeble folk of commentators biographers anecdotists and others of the tribe they swarm round you like carrionflies round a sensitive plant like nightbirds bewildered by the sun men of sense and taste have written on you indeed but your weaker admirers are now disputing as to whether it was your heart or a less dignified and most troublesome organ which escaped the flames of the funeral pyre these biographers fight terribly among themselves and vainly prolong the memory of old unhappy faroff things and sorrows long ago let us leave them and their squabbles over what is unessential their raking up of old letters and old stories  the town has lately yawned a weary laugh over an enemy of yours who has produced two heavy volumes styled by him the real shelley the real shelley it appears was shelley as conceived of by a worthy gentleman so prejudiced and so skilled in taking up things by the wrong handle that i wonder he has not made a name in the exact science of comparative mythology he criticises you in the spirit of that christian apologist the englishman who called you a damned atheist in the postoffice at pisa he finds that you had a little turnedup nose a feature no less important in his system than was the nose of cleopatra according to pascal in the history of the world to be in harmony with your nose you were a phenomenal liar an illbred illborn profligate partly insane an eviltempered monster a selfrighteous person full of selfapprobationin fact you were the beast of this pious apocalypse your friend dr lind was an embittered and scurrilous apothecary a bad old man but enough of this inopportune brawler for humanity of which you hoped such great things science predicts extinction in a night of frost the sun will grow cold slowlyas slowly as doom came on jupiter in your prometheus but as surely if this nightmare be fulfilled perhaps the last man in some fetid hut on the icebound equator will read by a fading lamp charged with the dregs of the oil in his cruse the poetry of shelley so reading he the latest of his race will not wholly be deprived of those sights which alone says the nameless greek make life worth enduring in your verse he will have sight of sky and sea and cloud the gold of dawn and the gloom of earthquake and eclipse he will be face to face in fancy with the great powers that are dead sun and ocean and the illimitable azure of the heavens in shelleys poetry while man endures all those will survive for your voice is as the voice of winds and tides and perhaps more deathless than all of these and only perishable with the perishing of the human spirit     xviii to monsieur de moliére valet de chambre du roi   monsieurwith what awe does a writer venture into the presence of the great moliére as a courtier in your time would scratch humbly with his comb at the door of the grand monarch so i presume to draw near your dwelling among the immortals you like the king who among all his titles has now none so proud as that of the friend of moliéreyou found your dominions small humble and distracted you raised them to the dignity of an empire what louis xiv did for france you achieved for french comedy and the baton of scapin still wields its sway though the sword of louis was broken at blenheim for the king the pyrenees or so he fancied ceased to exist by a more magnificent conquest you overcame the channel if england vanquished your countrys arms it was through you that france ferum victorem cepit and restored the dynasty of comedy to the land whence she had been driven ever since dryden borrowed letourdi our tardy apish nation has lived in matters theatrical on the spoils of the wits of france  in one respect to be sure times and manners have altered while you lived taste kept the french drama pure and it was the congenial business of english playwrights to foist their rustic grossness and their large fescennine jests into the urban page of moliére now they are diversely occupied and it is their affair to lend modesty where they borrow wit and to spare a blush to the cheek of the lord chamberlain but still as has ever been our wont since etherege saw and envied and imitated your successesstill we pilfer the plays of france and take our bien as you said in your lordly manner wherever we can find it we are the privateers of the stage and it is rarely to be sure that a comedy pleases the town which has not first been cut out from the countrymen of moliére why this should be and what tenebriferous star as paracelsus your companion in the dialogues des morts would have believed thus darkens the sun of english humour we know not but certainly our dependence on france is the sincerest tribute to you without you neither rotrou nor corneille nor a wilderness of monkeys like scarron could ever have given comedy to france and restored her to europe  while we owe to you monsieur the beautiful advent of comedy fair and beneficent as peace in the play of aristophanes it is still to you that we must turn when of comedies we desire the best if you studied with daily and nightly care the works of plautus and terence if you let no musty bouquin escape you so your enemies declared it was to some purpose that you laboured shakespeare excepted you eclipsed all who came before you and from those that follow however fresh we turn we turn from regnard and beaumarchais from sheridan and goldsmith from musset and pailleron and labiche to that crowded world of your creations creations one may well say for you anticipated nature herself you gave us before she did in alceste a rousseau who was a gentleman not a lacquey in a mot of don juans the secret of the new religion and the watchword of comte lamour de lhumanité  before you where can we find save in rabelais a frenchman with humour and where unless it be in montaigne the wise philosophy of a secular civilisalion with a heart the most tender delicate loving and generous a heart often in agony and torment you had to make life endurable we cannot doubt it without any whisper of promise or hope or warning from religion yes in an age when the greatest mind of all the mind of pascal proclaimed that the only help was in voluntary blindness that the only chance was to hazard all on a bet at evens you monsieur refused to be blinded or to pretend to see what you found invisible  in religion you beheld no promise of help when the jesuits and jansenists of your time saw each of them in tartufe the portrait of their rivals as each of the laughable marquises in your play conceived that you were girding at his neighbour you all the while were mocking every credulous excess of faith in the sermons preached to agnés we surely hear your private laughter in the arguments for credulity which are presented to don juan by his valet we listen to the eternal selfdefence of superstition thus desolate of belief you sought for the permanent element of lifeprecisely where pascal recognised all that was most fleeting and unsubstantialin divertissement in the pleasure of looking on a spectator of the accidents of existence an observer of the follies of mankind like the gods of the epicurean you seem to regard our life as a play that is played as a comedy yet how often the tragic note comes in what pity and in the laughter what an accent of tears as of rain in the wind no comedian has been so kindly and human as you none has had a heart like you to feel for his butts and to leave them sometimes in a sense superior to their tormentors sganarelle m de pourceaugnac george dandin and the restour sympathy somehow is with them after all and m de pourceaugnac is a gentleman despite his misadventures  though triumphant youth and malicious love in your plays may batter and defeat jealousy and old age yet they have not all the victory or you did not mean that they should win it they go off with laughter and their victim with a grimace but in him we that are past our youth behold an actor in an unending tragedy the defeat of a generation your sympathy is not wholly with the dogs that are having their day you can throw a bone or a crust to the dog that has had his and has been taught that it is over and ended yourself not unlearned in shame in jealousy in endurance of the wanton pride of men how could the poor player and the husband of céliméne be untaught in that experience you never sided quite heartily as other comedians have done with young prosperity and rank and power  i am not the first who has dared to approach you in the shades for just after your own death the author of les dialogues des morts gave you paracelsus as a companion and the author of le jugement de pluton made the mighty warder decide that moliére should not talk philosophy these writers like most of us feel that after all the comedies of the contemplateur of the translator of lucretius are a philosophy of life in themselves and that in them we read the lessons of human experience writ small and clear  what comedian but moliére has combined with such depthswith the indignation of alceste the selfdeception of tartufe the blasphemy of don juansuch wildness of irresponsible mirth such humour such wit even now when more than two hundred years have sped by when so much water has flowed under the bridges and has borne away so many trifles of contemporary mirth cetera fluminis ritu feruntur even now we never laugh so well as when mascarille and vadius and m jourdain tread the boards in the maison de moliére since those mobile dark brows of yours ceased to make men laugh since your voice denounced the demoniac manner of contemporary tragedians i take leave to think that no player has been more worthy to wear the canons of mascarille or the gown of vadius than m coquelin of the comédie francaise in him you have a successor to your mascarille so perfect that the ghosts of playgoers of your date might cry could they see him that moliére had come again but with all respect to the efforts of the fair i doubt if mdlle barthet or mdme croizette herself would reconcile the town to the loss of the fair de brie and madeleine and the first the true céliméne armande yet had you ever so merry a soubrette as mdme samary so exquisite a nicole  denounced persecuted and buried huggermugger two hundred years ago you are now not overpraised but more worshipped with more servility and ostentation studied with more prying curiosity than you may approve are not the moliéristes a body who carry adoration to fanaticism any scrap of your handwriting so few are these any anecdote even remotely touching on your life any fact that may prove your house was numbered 15 not 22 is eagerly seized and discussed by your too minute historians concerning your private life these men often write more like malicious enemies than friends repeating the fabulous scandals of le boulanger and trying vainly to support them by grubbing in dusty parish registers it is most necessary to defend you from your friendsfrom such friends as the veteran and inveterate m arséne houssaye or the industrious but puzzleheaded m loiseleur truly they seek the living among the dead and the immortal moliére among the sweepings of attorneys offices as i regard them for i have tarried in their tents and as i behold their trivialitiesthe exercises of men who neglect moliérés works to write about moliéres greatgrandmothers secondbest bedi sometimes wish that moliére were here to write on his devotees a new comedy les moliéristes how fortunate were they monsieur who lived and worked with you who saw you day by day who were attached as lagrange tells us by the kindest loyalty to the best and most honourable of men the most openhanded in friendship in charity the most delicate of the heartiest sympathy ah that for one day i could behold you writing in the study rehearsing on the stage musing in the lacesellers shop strolling through the palais turning over the new books at billaines dusting your ruffles among the old volumes on the sunny stalls would that through the ages we could hear you after supper merry with boileau and with racinenot yet a traitorlaughing over chapelain combining to gird at him in an epigram or mocking at cotin or talking your favourite philosophy mindful of descartes surely of all the wits none was ever so good a man none ever made life so rich with humour and friendship     xix to robert burns   siramong men of genius and especially among poets there are some to whom we turn with a peculiar and unfeigned affection there are others whom we admire rather than love by some we are won with our will by others conquered against our desire it has been your peculiar fortune to capture the hearts of a whole peoplea people not usually prone to praise but devoted with a personal and patriotic loyalty to you and to your reputation in you every scot who is a scot sees admires and compliments himself his ideal selfindependent fond of whisky fonder of the lassies you are the true representative of him and of his nation next year will be the hundredth since the press of kilmarnock brought to light its solitary masterpiece your poems and next year therefore methinks the revenue will receive a welcome accession from the abundance of whisky drunk in your honour it is a cruel thing for any of your countrymen to feel that where all the rest love he can only admire where all the rest are idolators he may not bend the knee but stands apart and beats upon his breast observing not adoringa critic yet to some of uspetty souls perhaps and enviousthat loud indiscriminating praise of robbie burns for so they style you in their changehouse familiarity has long been ungrateful and among the treasures of your songs we venture to select and even to reject so it must be we cannot all love haggis nor painch tripe and thairm and all those rural dainties which you celebrate as warmreekin rich rather too rich as the young lady said on an occasion recorded by sam weller    auld scotland wants nae skinking ware      that jaups in luggies   but if ye wish her gratefu prayer      gie her a haggis   you have given her a haggis with a vengeance and her gratefu prayer is yours for ever but if even an eternity of partridge may pall on the epicure so of haggis too as of all earthly delights cometh satiety at last and yet what a glorious haggis it isthe more emphatically rustic and even fescennine part of your verse we have had many a rural bard since theocritus watched the visionary flocks but you are the only one of them all who has spoken the sincere doric yours is the talk of the byre and the ploughtail yours is that large utterance of the early hinds even theocritus minces matters save where lacon and comatas quite outdo the swains of ayrshire but thee theocritus wha matches you ask and yourself outmatch him in this wide rude region trodden only by the rural muse  thy rural loves are natures sel and the wooer of jean armour speaks more like a true shepherd than the elegant daphnis of the oaristys  indeed it is with this that moral critics of your life reproach you forgetting perhaps that in your amours you were but as other scotch ploughmen and shepherds of the past and present ettrick may still with afghanistan offer matter for idylls as mr carlyle your antithesis and the complement of the scotch character supposed but the morals of ettrick are those of rural sicily in old days or of mossgiel in your days over these matters the kirk with all her power and the free kirk too have had absolutely no influence whatever to leave so delicate a topic you were but as other swains or as that birkie cad a lord lord byron only you combined in certain of your letters a libertine theory with your practice you poured out in song your audacious raptures your halfhearted repentance your shame and your scorn you spoke the truth about rural lives and loves we may like it or dislike it but we cannot deny the verity  was it not as unhappy a thing sir for you as it was fortunate for letters and for scotland that you were born at the meeting of two ages and of two worldsprecisely in the moment when bookish literature was beginning to reach the people and when society was first learning to admit the lowborn to her minor mysteries before you how many singers not less truly poets than yourselfthough less versatile not less passionate though less sensuous not less simplehad been born and had died in poor mens cottages there abides not even the shadow of a name of the old scotch songsmiths of the old balladmakers the authors of clerk saunders of the wife of ushers well of fair annie and sir patrick spens and the bonny hind are as unknown to us as homer whom in their directness and force they resemble they never perhaps gave their poems to writing certainly they never gave them to the press on the lips and in the hearts of the people they have their lives and the singers after a life obscure and untroubled by society or by fame are forgotten the iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth his poppy  had you been born some years earlier you would have been even as these unnamed immortals leaving great verses to a little clanverses retained only by memory you would have been but the minstrel of your native valley the wider world would not have known you nor you the world great thoughts of independence and revolt would never have burned in you indignation would not have vexed you society would not have given and denied her caresses you would have been happy your songs would have lingered in all the circle of the summer hills and your scorn your satire your narrative verse would have been unwritten or unknown to the world what a loss and what a gain to you we should have possessed but a few of your lyrics as    when oer the hill the eastern star   tells bughtintime is near my jo   and owsen frae the furrowed field   return sae dowf and wearie o  how noble that is how natural how unconsciously greek you found oddly in good mrs barbauld the merits of the tenth muse    in thy sweet sang barbauld survives   even sapphos flame  but how unconsciously you remind us both of sappho and of homer in these strains about the evening star and the hour when the day metenisseto boulytoide had you lived and died the pastoral poet of some silent glen such lyrics could not but have survived free too of all that in your songs reminds us of the poets corner in the kirkcudbright advertiser we should not have read how    phoebus gilding the brow o morning     banishes ilk darksome shade  still we might keep a lovepoem unexcelled by catullus    had we never loved sae kindly   had we never loved sae blindly   never metor never parted   we had neer been brokenhearted  but the letters to clarinda would have been unwritten and the thrush would have been untaught in the style of the bird of paradise       transliterated from greek  a quiet life of song fallentis semita vitae was not to be yours fate otherwise decreed it the touch of a lettered society the strife with the kirk discontent with the state poverty and pride neglect and success were needed to make your genius what it was and to endow the world with tam o shanter the jolly beggars and holy willies prayer who can praise them too highlywho admire in them too much the humour the scorn the wisdom the unsurpassed energy and courage so powerful so commanding is the movement of that beggars chorus that methinks it unconsciously echoed in the brain of our greatest living poet when he conceived the vision of sin you shall judge for yourself recall     heres to budgets bags and wallets    heres to all the wandering train    heres our ragged bairns and callers    one and all cry out amen     a fig for those by law protected    libertys a glorious feast    courts for cowards were erected    churches built to please the priest  then read this   drink to lofty hopes that cool     visions of a perfect state    drink we last the public fool     frantic love and frantic hate    drink to fortune drink to chance     while we keep a little breath    drink to heavy ignorance     hob and nob with brother death is not the movement the same though the modern speaks a wilder recklessness  so in the best company we leave you who were the life and soul of so much company good and bad no poet since the psalmist of israel ever gave the world more assurance of a man none lived a life more strenuous engaged in an eternal conflict of the passions and by them overcomemighty and mightily fallen when we think of you byron seems as plato would have said remote by one degree from actual truth and musset by a degree more remote than byron     xx to lord byron   my lord  do you remember how leigh hunt  enraged you once by writing my dear byron   books have their fatesas mortals have who punt  and yours have entered on an age of iron   critics there be who think your satin blunt  your pathos fudge such perils must environ  poets who in their time were quite the rage  though now theres not a soul to turn their page   yes there is much dispute about your worth   and much is said which you might like to know  by modern poets here upon the earth   where poets live and love each other so  and in elysium it may move your mirth   to hear of bards that pitch your praises low  though there be some that for your credit stickle  asglorious matand not inglorious nichol   this kind of writing is my pet aversion   i hate the slang i hate the personalities  i loathe the aimless reckless loose dispersion   of every rhyme that in the singers wallet is  i hate it as you hated the excursion  but while no man a hero to his valet is  the heros still the model i indite  the kind of rhymes that byron oft would write   theres a swiss critic whom i cannot rhyme to   one scherer dry as sawdust grim and prim  of him theres much to say if i had time to   concern myself in any wise with him  he seems to hate the heights he cannot climb to  he thinks your poetry a coxcombs whim  a good deal of his sawdust he has spilt on  shakspeare and moliére and you and milton   ay much his temper is like viviens mood   which found not galahad pure nor lancelot brave  cold as a hailstorm on an april wood   he buries poets in an icy grave  his essayshe of the genevan hood   nothing so good but better doth he crave  so stupid and so solemn in his spite  he dares to print that moliére could not write   enough of these excursions i was saying   that half our english bards are turned reviewers  and arnold was discussing and assaying   the weight and value of that work of yours  examining and testing it and weighing   and proved the gems are pure the gold endures  while swinburne cries with an exceeding joy  the stones are paste and half the gold alloy   in byron arnold finds the greatest force   poetic in this later age of ours  his song a torrent from a mountain source   clear as the crystal singing with the showers  sweeps to the sea in unrestricted course   through banks oerhung with rocks and sweet with flowers  none of your brooks that modestly meander  but swift as awe along the pass of brander   and when our century has clomb its crest   and backward gazes oer the plains of time  and counts its harvest yours is still the best   the richest garner in the field of rhyme  the metaphoric mixture t is confest   is all my own and is not quite sublime  but fames not yours alone you must divide all  the plums and pudding with the bard of rydal   wordsworth and byron these the lordly names   and these the gods to whom most incense burns  absurd cries swinburne and in anger flames   and in an aeschylean fury spurns  with impious foot your altar and exclaims   and wreathes his laurels on the golden urns  where coleridges and shelleys ashes lie  deaf to the din and heedless of the cry   for byron swinburne shouts has never woven   one honest thread of life within his song  as offenbach is to divine beethoven   so byron is to shelley this is strong  and on parnassus peak divinely cloven   he may not stand or stands by cruel wrong  for byrons rank the examiner has reckoned  is in the third class or a feeble second   a bernesque poet at the very most   and never earnest save in politics  the pegasus that he was wont to boast   a blundering floundering hackney full of tricks  a beast that must be driven to the post   by whips and spurs and oaths and kicks and sticks  a gasping ranting brokenwinded brute  that any judge of pegasi would shoot   in sooth a halfbred pegasus and far gone   in spavin curb and half a hundred woes  and byrons style is jolterheaded jargon   his verse is only bearable in prose  so living poets write of those that are gone   and oer the eagle thus the bantam crows  and swinburne ends where verisopht began  by owning you a very clever man   or rather does not end he still must utter   a quantity of the unkindest things  ah were you here i marvel would you flutter   oer such a foe the tempest of your wings  t is rant and cant and glare and splash and splutter   that rend the modest air when byron sings  there swinburne stops a critic rather fiery  animis caelestibus tantaene irae   but whether he or arnold in the right is   long is the argument the quarrel long  non nobis est  to settle  tantas lites   no poet i to judge of right or wrong  but of all things i always think a fight is   the most unpleasant in the lists of song  when marsyas of old was flayed apollo  set an example which we need not follow   the fashion changes maidens do not wear   as once they wore in necklaces and lockets  a curl ambrosial of lord byrons hair   don juan is not always in our pockets  nay a new writers readers do not care   much for your verse but are inclined to mock its  manners and morals ay and most young ladies  to yours prefer the epic called of hades   i do not blame them im inclined to think   that with the reigning taste t is vain to quarrel  and burns might teach his votaries to drink   and byron never meant to make them moral  you yet have lovers true who will not shrink   from lauding you and giving you the laurel  the germans too those men of blood and iron  of all our poets chiefly swear by byron   farewell thou titan fairer than the gods   farewell farewell thou swift and lovely spirit  thou splendid warrior with the world at odds   unpraised unpraisable beyond thy merit  chased like oresres by the furies rods   like him at length thy peace dost thou inherit  beholding whom men think how fairer far  than all the steadfast stars the wandering star  note mr swlnburnes and mr arnolds diverse views of byron will be found in the selections by mr arnold and in the nineteenth century     xxi to omar khayyam     wise omar do the southern breezes fling   above your grave at ending of the spring     the snowdrift of the petals of the rose   the wild white roses you were wont to sing    far in the south i know a land divine 1   and there is many a saint and many a shrine    and over all the shrines the blossom blows   of roses that were dear to you as wine        1 the hills above san remo where rosebushes are planted      by the shrines omar desired that his grave might be where      the wind would scatter roseleaves over it     you were a saint of unbelieving days   liking your life and happy in mens praise    enough for you the shade beneath the bough   enough to watch the wild world go its ways    dreadless and hopeless thou of heaven or hell   careless of words thou hadst not skill to spell    content to know not all thou knowest now   whats death doth any pitcher dread the well    the pitchers we whose maker makes them ill   shall he torment them if they chance to spill    nay like the broken potsherds are we cast   forth and forgottenand what will be will    so still were we before the months began   that rounded us and shaped us into man    so still we shall be surely at the last   dreamless untouched of blessing or of ban    ah strange it seems that this thy common thought   how all things have been ay and shall be nought    was ancient wisdom in thine ancient east   in those old days when senlac fight was fought    which gave our england for a captive land   to pious chiefs of a believing band    a gift to the believer from the priest   tossed from the holy to the bloodred hand 1    1 omar was contemporary with the battle of hastings    yea thou wert singing when that arrow clave   through helm and brain of him who could not save    his england even of harold godwins son   the high tide murmurs by the heros grave 1    1 per mandata ducis rex hic heralde quiescis        ut custos maneas littoris et pelagi    and thou wert wreathing roseswho can tell   or chanting for some girl that pleased thee well    or satst at wine in nashapur when dun   the twilight veiled the field where harold fell    the salt seawaves above him rage and roam   along the white walls of his guarded home    no zephyr stirs the rose but oer the wave   the wild wind beats the breakers into foam    and dear to him as roses were to thee   rings long the roar of onset of the sea    the swans path of his fathers is his grave   his sleep methinks is sound as thine can be    his was the age of faith when all the west   looked to the priest for torment or for rest    and thou wert living then and didst not heed   the saint who banned thee or the saint who blessed    ages of progress these eight hundred years

saidst ah waste it well    an hour we have and yet eternity   looms oer us and the thought of heaven or hell    nay we can never be as wise as thou   o idle singer neath the blossomed bough    nay and we cannot be content to die   we cannot shirk the questions where and how    ah not from learned peace and gay content    shall we of england go the way he went    the singer of the red wine and the

omar once was sure     xxii to q horatius flaccus   in what manner of paradise are we to conceive that you horace are dwelling or what region of immortality can give you such pleasures as this life afforded the country and the town nature and men who knew them so well as you or who ever so wisely made the best of those two worlds truly here you had good things nor do you ever in all your poems look for more delight in the life beyond you never expect consolation for present sorrow and when you once have shaken hands with a friend the parting seems to you eternal    quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus   tam cari capitis  so you sing for the dear head you mourn has sunk for ever beneath the wave virgil might wander forth bearing the golden branch the sibyl doth to singing men allow and might visit as one not wholly without hope the dim dwellings of the dead and the unborn to him was it permitted to see and sing mothers and men and the bodies outworn of mighty heroes boys and unwedded maids and young men borne to the funeral fire before their parents eyes the endless caravan swept past himmany as fluttering leaves that drop and fall in autumn woods when the first frost begins many as birds that flock landward from the great sea when now the chill year drives them oer the deep and leads them to sunnier lands such things was it given to the sacred poet to behold and the happy seats and sweet pleasances of fortunate souls where the larger light clothes all the plains and dips them in a rosier gleam plains with their own new sun and stars before unknown ah not frustra pius was virgil as you say horace in your melancholy song in him we fancy there was a happier mood than your melancholy patience not though thou wert sweeter of song than thracian orpheus with that lyre whose lay led the dancing trees not so would the blood return to the empty shade of him whom once with dread wand the inexorable god hath folded with his shadowy flocks but patience lighteneth what heaven forbids us to undo      durum sed levius fit patientia  it was all your philosophy in that last sad resort to which we are pushed so often    with closelipped patience for our only friend   sad patience too near neighbour of despair  the epicurean is at one with the stoic at last and horace with marcus aurelius to go away from among men if there are gods is not a thing to be afraid of but if indeed they do not exist or if they have no concern about human affairs what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of providence  an excellent philosophy but easier to those for whom no hope had dawn or seemed to set yet it is harder than common horace for us to think of you still glad somewhere among rivers like liris and plains and vineclad hills that    solemque suum sua sidera borunt  it is hard for you looked for no such thing         omnes una manet nox    et calcanda semel via leti  you could not tell maecenas that you would meet him again you could only promise to tread the dark path with him            ibimus ibimus   utcunque praecedes supremum       carpere iter comites parati  enough horace of these mortuary musings you loved the lesson of the roses and now and again would speak somewhat like a deaths head over thy temperate cups of sabine ordinaire your melancholy moral was but meant to heighten the joy of thy pleasant life when wearied italy after all her wars and civic bloodshed had won a peaceful haven the harbour might be treacherous the prince might turn to the tyrant far away on the wide roman marches might be heard as it were the endless ceaseless monotone of beating horses hoofs and marching feet of men they were coming they were nearing like footsteps heard on wool there was a sound of multitudes and millions of barbarians all the north officina gentium mustering and marshalling her peoples but their coming was not to be today nor tomorrow nor today was the budding princely sway to blossom into the bloodred flower of nero in the hall between the two tempests of republic and empire your odes sound like linnets in the pauses of the wind  what joy there is in these songs what delight of life what an exquisite hellenic grace of art what a manly nature to endure what tenderness and constancy of friendship what a sense of all that is fair in the glittering stream the music of the waterfall the hum of bees the silvery grey of the olive woods on the hillside how human are all your verses horace what a pleasure is yours in the straining poplars swaying in the wind what gladness you gain from the white crest of soracte beheld through the fluttering snowflakes while the logs are being piled higher on the hearth you sing of women and winenot all wholehearted in your praise of them perhaps for passion frightens you and t is pleasure more than love that you commend to the young lydia and glycera and the others are but passing guests of a heart at ease in itself and happy enough when their facile reign is ended you seem to me like a man who welcomes middle age and is more glad than sophocles was to flee from these hard masters the passions in the fallow leisure of life you glance round contented and find all very good save the need to leave all behind even that you take with an italian goodhumour as the folk of your sunny country bear poverty and hunger      durum sed levius fit patientia  to them to you the loveliness of your land is and was a thing to live for none of the latin poets your fellows or none but virgil seem to me to have known so well as you horace how happy and fortunate a thing it was to be born in italy you do not say so like your virgil in one splendid passage numbering the glories of the land as a lover might count the perfections of his mistress but the sentiment is ever in your heart and often on your lips     me nec tam patiens lacedaemon   nec tam larissae percussit campus opimae    quam domus albuneae resonantis   et praeceps anio ac tiburni lucus et uda    mobilibus pomaria rivis 1       1 me neither resolute sparta nor the rich larissaean      plain so enraptures as the fane of echoing albunea the      headlong anio the grove of tibur the orchards watered by      the wandering rills  so a poet should speak and to every singer his own land should be dearest beautiful is italy with the grave and delicate outlines of her sacred hills her dark groves her little cities perched like eyries on the crags her rivers gliding under ancient walls beautiful is italy her seas and her suns but dearer to me the long grey wave that bites the rock below the minster in the north dearer is the barren moor and black peatwater swirling in tanny foam and the scent of bog myrtle and the bloom of heather and watching over the lochs the green roundshouldered hills  in affection for your native land horace certainly the pride in great romans dead and gone made part and you were in all senses a lover of your country your countrys heroes your countrys gods none but a patriot could have sung that ode on regulus who died as our own hero died on an evil day for the honour of rome as gordon for the honour of england   fertur pudicae conjujis osculum  parvosque natos ut capitis minor   ab se removisse et virilem    torvus humi pusuisse voltum   donec labantes consilio patres  firmaret auctor nunquam alias dato   interque maerentes amicos    egregius properaret exul   atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus  tortor pararet non aliter tamen   dimovit obstantes propinquos    et populum reditus morantem   quam si clientum longa negotia  dijudicata lite relinqueret   tendens venafranos in agros    aut lacedaemonium tarentum 1  1 they say he put aside from him the pure lips of his wife and his little children like a man unfree and with his brave face bowed earthward sternly he waited till with such counsel as never mortal gave he might strengthen the hearts of the fathers and through his mourning friends go forth a hero into exile yet well he knew what things were being prepared for him at the hands of the tormenters who none the less put aside the kinsmen that barred his path and the people that would fain have held him back passing through their midst as he might have done if his retainers weary business ended and the suits adjudged he were faring to his venafran lands or to dorian tarentum  we talk of the greeks as your teachers your teachers they were but that poem could only have been written by a roman the strength the tenderness the noble and monumental resolution and resignationthese are the gift of the lords of human things the masters of the world your countrys heroes are dear to you horace but you did not sing them better than your countrys gods the pious protecting spirits of the hearth the farm the field kindly ghosts it may be of latin fathers dead or gods framed in the image of these what you actually believed we know not you knew not who knows what he believes parcus deorum cultor you bowed not often it may be in the temples of the state religion and before the statues of the great olympians but the pure and pious worship of rustic tradition the faith handed down by the homely elders with that you never broke clean hands and a pure heart these with a sacred cake and shining grains of salt you could offer to the lares it was a benignant religion uniting old times and new men living and men long dead and gone in a kind of service and sacrifice solemn yet familiar       te nihil attinet  tentare multa caede bidentium   parvos coronantem marino    rore deos fragilique myrto   immunis aram si tetigit manus  non sumptuosa blandior hostia    mollivit aversos penates     farre pio et salienta mica 1        1 thou phidyle hast no need to besiege the gods with      slaughter so great of sheep thou who crownest thy tiny      deities with myrtle rare and rosemary if but the hand be      clean that touches the altar then richest sacrifice will      not more appease the angered penates than the duteous cake      and salt that crackles in the blaze   farewell dear horace farewell thou wise and kindly heathen of mortals the most human the friend of my friends and of so many generations of men
