 the imp of mischief woe is me   is always busy as a bee  that is why so many people are forever getting into trouble he wont keep still no sir he wont keep still unless he is made to once let him get started there is no knowing where he will stop peter rabbit had just seen jimmy skunk disappear inside an old barrel lying on its side at the top of the hill and at once the imp of mischief began to whisper to peter of course peter shouldnt have listened certainly not but he did you know peter dearly loves a joke when it is on some one else he sat right where he was and watched to see if jimmy would come out of the barrel jimmy didnt come out and after a little peter stole over to the barrel and peeped inside there was jimmy skunk curled up for a nap  peter tiptoed away very softly all the time the imp of mischief was whispering to him that this was a splendid chance to play a joke on jimmy you know it is very easy to play a joke on any one who is asleep peter doesnt often have a chance to play a joke on jimmy skunk it isnt a very safe thing to do not if jimmy is awake no one knows that better than peter he sat down some distance from the barrel but where he could keep an eye on it then he went into a brown study which is one way of saying that he thought very hard he wanted to play a joke on jimmy but like most jokers he didnt want the joke to come back on himself in fact he felt that it would be a great deal better for him if jimmy shouldnt know that he had anything to do with the joke  as he sat there in a brown study he happened to glance over on the green meadows and there he saw something red he looked very hard and in a minute he saw that it was reddy fox right away peters nimble wits began to plan how he could use reddy fox to play a joke on jimmy all in a flash an idea came to him an idea that made him laugh right out you see the imp of mischief was very very busy whispering to peter  if reddy were only up here i believe i could do it and it would be a joke on reddy as well as on jimmy thought peter and laughed right out again  what are you laughing at asked a voice it was the voice of sammy jay  right away a plan for getting reddy up there flashed into peters head he would get sammy angry and that would make sammy scream reddy would be sure to come up there to see what sammy jay was making such a fuss about sammy you know is very quicktempered no one knows this better than peter so instead of replying politely to sammy as he should have done peter spoke crossly  fly away sammy fly away it is no business of yours what i am laughing at said he  right away sammys quick temper flared up he began to call peter names and peter answered back this angered sammy still more and as he always screams when he is angry he was soon making such a racket that reddy fox down on the green meadows couldnt help but hear it peter saw him lift his head to listen in a few minutes he began to trot that way he was coming to find out what that fuss was about peter knew that reddy wouldnt come straight up there that isnt reddys way he would steal around back of the old stone wall on the edge of the old orchard which was back of peter and would try to see what was going on without being seen himself  as soon as he sees me he will think that at last he has a chance to catch me thought peter i shall have to run my very fastest but if everything goes right he will soon forget all about me i do hope that the noise sammy jay is making will not waken jimmy skunk and bring him out to see what is going on  so with one eye on the barrel where jimmy skunk was taking a nap and the other eye on the old stone wall behind which he expected reddy fox to come stealing up peter waited and didnt mind in the least the names that sammy jay was calling him     ii  peter makes a flying jump     to risk your life unless theres need   is downright foolishness indeed  never forget that never do such a crazy thing as peter rabbit was doing what was he doing why he was running the risk of being caught by reddy fox all for the sake of a joke did you ever hear of anything more foolish yet peter was no different from a lot of people who every day risk their lives in the most careless and heedless ways just to save a few minutes of time or for some other equally foolish reason the fact is peter didnt stop to think what dreadful thing might happen if his plans didnt work out as he intended he didnt once think of little mrs peter over in the dear old briarpatch and how she would feel if he never came home again thats the trouble with thoughtlessness it never remembers other people  all the time that reddy fox was creeping along behind the old stone wall on the edge of the old orchard peter knew just where he was though reddy didnt know that if he had known it he would have suspected one of peters tricks  hell peep over that wall and just as soon as he sees me he will feel sure that this time he will catch me thought peter he will steal along to that place where the wall is lowest and will jump over it right there i must be ready to jump the very second he does  it all happened just as peter had expected while seeming to be paying no attention to anything but to sammy jay he kept his eyes on that low place in the old wall and presently he saw reddys sharp nose as reddy peeped over to make sure that he was still there the instant that sharp nose dropped out of sight peter made ready to run for his life a second later reddy leaped over the wall and peter was off as hard as he could go with reddy almost at his heels sammy jay who had been so busy calling peter names that he hadnt seen reddy at all forgot all about his quarrel with peter  go it peter go it he screamed excitedly that was just like sammy  peter did go it he had to he ran with all his might reddy grinned as he saw peter start towards the green meadows it was a long way to the dear old briarpatch and reddy didnt have any doubt at all that he would catch peter before he got there he watched sharply for peter to dodge and try to get back to the old stone wall he didnt mean to let peter do that but peter didnt even try he ran straight for the edge of the hill above the green meadows then for the first time reddy noticed an old barrel there lying on its side  i wonder if he thinks he can hide in that thought reddy and grinned again for he remembered that he had passed that old barrel a few days before and that one end was open while the other end was closed if he tries that i will get him without the trouble of much of a chase thought reddy and chuckled  lippertylippertylip ran peter lippertylippertylip reddy right at his heels to sammy jay it looked as if in a few more jumps reddy certainly would catch peter go it peter oh go it go it screamed sammy for in spite of his quarrels with peter he didnt want to see him come to any real harm  just as he reached the old barrel reddy was so close to him that peter was almost sure that he could feel reddys breath then peter made a splendid flying jump right over the old barrel and kept on down the hill lippertylippertylip as fast as ever he could straight for an old house of johnny chucks of which he knew when he reached it he turned to see what was happening behind him for he knew by the screaming of sammy jay and by other sounds that a great deal was happening in fact he suspected that the joke which he had planned was working out just as he had hoped it would     iii  what happened at the old barrel   peter rabbits jump over the old barrel on the edge of the hill was unexpected to reddy fox in fact reddy was so close on peters heels that he had no thought of anything but catching peter he was running so fast that when peter made his flying jump over the barrel reddy did not have time to jump too and he ran right smack bang against that old barrel now you remember that that barrel was right on the edge of the hill when reddy ran against it he hit it so hard that he rolled it over and of course that started it down the hill you know a barrel is a very rolly sort of thing and once it has started down a hill nothing can stop it  it was just so this time reddy fox had no more than picked himself up when the barrel was half way down the hill and going faster and faster it bounced along over the ground and every time it hit a little hummock it seemed to jump right up in the air and all the time it was making the strangest noises reddy quite forgot the smarting sore places where he had bumped into the barrel he simply stood and stared at the runaway  as i live he exclaimed i believe there was some one in that old barrel there was you remember that jimmy skunk had curled up in there for a nap now jimmy was awake very much awake you see for once in his life he was moving fast very much faster than ever he had moved before since he was born and it wasnt at all comfortable no sir it wasnt at all a comfortable way in which to travel he went over and over so fast that it made him dizzy first he was right side up and then wrong side up so fast that he couldnt tell which side up he was and every time that old barrel jumped when it went over a hummock jimmy was tossed up so that he hit whatever part of the barrel happened to be above him of course he couldnt get out because he was rolled over and over so fast that he didnt have a chance to try  now reddy didnt know who was in the barrel he just knew by the sounds that some one was so he started down the hill after the barrel to see what would happen when it stopped all the time peter rabbit was dancing about in the greatest excitement but taking the greatest care to keep close to that old house of johnny chucks so as to pop into it in case of danger he saw that reddy fox had quite forgotten all about him in his curiosity as to who was in the barrel and he chuckled as he thought of what might happen when the barrel stopped rolling and reddy found out sammy jay was flying overhead screaming enough to split his throat altogether it was quite the most exciting thing peter had ever seen  now it just happened that old man coyote had started to cross the green meadows right at the foot of the hill just as the barrel started down of course he heard the noise and looked up to see what it meant when he saw that barrel rushing right down at him it frightened him so that he just gave one yelp and started for the old pasture like a gray streak he gave peter a chance to see just how fast he can run and peter made up his mind right then that he never would run a race with old man coyote  down at the bottom of the hill was a big stone and when the barrel hit this the hoops broke and the barrel fell all apart peter decided that it was high time for him to get out of sight so he dodged into the old house of johnny chuck and lay low in the doorway where he could watch he saw jimmy skunk lay perfectly still and a great fear crept into his heart had jimmy been killed he hadnt once thought of what might happen to jimmy when he planned that joke but presently jimmy began to wave first one leg and then another as if to make sure that he had some legs left then slowly he rolled over and got on to his feet peter breathed a sigh of relief     iv  jimmy skunk is very mad indeed     when jimmy skunk is angry   then every one watch out   its better far at such a time   to be nowhere about  jimmy skunk was angry this time and no mistake he was just plain mad and when jimmy skunk feels that way no one wants to be very near him you know he is one of the very bestnatured little fellows in the world ordinarily he minds his own business and if no one interferes with him he interferes with no one but once he is aroused and feels that he hasnt been treated fairly look out for him  and this time jimmy was mad clear through as he got to his feet and shook himself to see that he was all there i dont know that any one could blame him to be wakened from a comfortable nap by being rolled over and over and shaken nearly to death as jimmy had been by that wild ride down the hill in the old barrel was enough to make any one mad so he really is not to be blamed for feeling as he did  now jimmy can never be accused of being stupid he knew that an old barrel which has been lying in one place for a long time doesnt move of its own accord he knew that that barrel couldnt possibly have started off down the hill unless some one had made it start and he didnt have a doubt in the world that whoever had done it had known that he was inside and had done it to make him uncomfortable so just as soon as he had made sure that he was really alive and quite whole he looked about to see who could have played such a trick on him  the first person he saw was reddy fox in fact reddy was right close at hand you see he had raced down the hill after the barrel to see who was in it when he heard the strange noises coming from it as it rolled and bounded down if reddy had known that it was jimmy skunk he would have been quite content to remain at the top of the hill but he didnt know and if the truth be known he had hopes that it might prove to be some one who would furnish him with a good breakfast so quite out of breath with running reddy arrived at the place where the old barrel had broken to pieces just as jimmy got to his feet  now when jimmy skunk is angry he doesnt bite and he doesnt scratch you know old mother nature has provided him with a little bag of perfume which jimmy doesnt object to in the least but which makes most people want to hold their noses and run he never uses it excepting when he is angry or in danger but when he does use it his enemies always turn tail and run that is why he is afraid of no one and why every one respects jimmy and his rights  he used it now and he didnt waste any time about it he threw some of that perfume right in the face of reddy fox before reddy had a chance to turn or to say a word  take that snapped jimmy skunk perhaps it will teach you not to play tricks on your honest neighbors  poor reddy some of that perfume got in his eyes and made them smart dreadfully in fact for a little while he couldnt see at all and then the smell of it was so strong that it made him quite sick he rolled over and over on the ground choking and gasping and rubbing his eyes jimmy skunk just stood and looked on and there wasnt a bit of pity in his eyes  how do you like that said he you thought yourself very smart rolling me down hill in a barrel didnt you you might have broken my neck  i didnt know you were in that barrel and i didnt mean to roll it down the hill anyway whined reddy when he could get his voice  huh snorted jimmy skunk who didnt believe a word of it  i didnt honestly i didnt protested reddy i ran against the barrel by accident chasing peter rabbit i didnt have any idea that any one was in it  huh said jimmy skunk again if you were chasing peter rabbit where is he now  reddy had to confess he didnt know he was nowhere in sight and he certainly hadnt had time to reach the dear old briarpatch jimmy looked this way and that way but there was no sign of peter rabbit  huh said he again turning his back on reddy fox and walking away with a great deal of dignity     v  reddy fox sneaks away   to sneak away is to steal away trying to keep out of sight of everybody and is usually done only by those who for some reason or other are ashamed to be seen just as soon as reddy fox could see after jimmy skunk had thrown that terrible perfume in reddys face he started for the green forest he wanted to get away by himself but he didnt trot with his head up and his big plumey tail carried proudly as is usual with him no indeed instead he hung his head and his handsome tail was dropped between his legs he was the very picture of shame you see that terrible perfume which jimmy skunk had thrown at him clung to his red coat and he knew that he couldnt get rid of it not for a long time anyway and he knew too that wherever he went his neighbors would hold their noses and make fun of him and that no one would have anything to do with him so he sneaked away across the green meadows towards the green forest and he felt too sick and mean and unhappy to even be angry with sammy jay who was making fun of him and saying that he had got no more than he deserved  poor reddy he didnt know what to do or where to go he couldnt go home for old granny fox would drive him out of the house she had warned him time and again never to provoke jimmy skunk and he knew that she never would forgive him if he should bring that terrible perfume near their home he knew too that it would not be long before all the little people of the green forest and the green meadows would know what had happened to him sammy jay would see to that he knew just how they would point at him and make fun of him he would never hear the last of it he felt as if he never never would be able to hold his head and his tail up again every few minutes he stopped to roll over and over on the ground trying to get rid of that dreadful perfume  when he reached the green forest he hurried over to the laughing brook to wash out his eyes it was just his luck to have billy mink come along while he was doing this billy didnt need to be told what had happened phew he exclaimed holding on to his nose then he turned and hurried beyond the reach of that perfume there he stopped and made fun of reddy fox and said all the provoking things he could think of reddy took no notice at all he felt too miserable to quarrel  after he had washed his face he felt better water wouldnt take away the awful smell but it did take away the smart from his eyes then he tried to plan what to do next  the only thing i can do is to get as far away from everybody as i can thought he i guess ill have to go up to the old pasture to live for a while  so he started for the old pasture keeping as much out of sight as possible on the way he remembered that old man coyote lived there of course it would never do to go near old man coyotes home for if he smelled that awful perfume and discovered that he reddy was the cause of it he would certainly drive him out of the old pasture and then where could he go so reddy went to the loneliest part of the old pasture and crept into an old house that he and granny had dug there long ago when they had been forced to live in the old pasture in the days when farmer browns boy and bowser the hound had hunted them for stealing chickens there he stretched himself out and was perfectly miserable  it wouldnt be so bad if i had really been to blame but i wasnt i didnt know jimmy skunk was in that barrel and i didnt mean to start it rolling down the hill anyway he muttered it was all an accident and he stopped and into his yellow eyes crept a look of suspicion i wonder said he slowly if peter rabbit knew that jimmy skunk was there and planned to get me into all this trouble i wonder     vi  peter rabbit doesnt enjoy his joke   all the time that jimmy skunk was punishing reddy fox for rolling him down hill in a barrel and while reddy was sneaking away to the green forest to get out of sight peter rabbit was lying low in the old house of johnny chuck right near the place where jimmy skunks wild ride had come to an end it had been a great relief to peter when he had seen jimmy skunk get to his feet and he knew that jimmy hadnt been hurt in that wild ride lying flat in the doorway of johnny chucks old house peter could see all that went on without being seen himself and he could hear all that was said  he chuckled as he saw reddy fox come up and his eyes were popping right out with excitement as he waited for what would happen next he felt sure that reddy fox was in for something unpleasant and he was glad of course that wasnt a bit nice of peter right down in his heart peter knew it but he had been chased so often by reddy and given so many dreadful frights that he felt now that he was getting even so he chuckled as he waited for what was to happen suddenly that chuckle broke right off in the middle and peter cried ouch he had felt a pain as if a hot needle had been thrust into him it made him almost jump out of the doorway but he remembered in time that it would never never do for him to show himself outside for right away reddy fox and jimmy skunk would suspect that he had had something to do with that wild ride of jimmys in the barrel so it would not do to show himself now no indeed  all he could do was to kick and squirm and twist his head around to see what was happening it didnt take long to find out even as he looked he felt another sharp pain which brought another ouch from him and made him kick harder than ever two very angry little insects were just getting ready to sting him again and more were coming they were yellow jackets which you know belong to the wasp family and carry very sharp little lances in their tails the fact is this old house of johnny chucks had been deserted so long the yellow jackets had decided that as no one else was using it they would and they had begun to build their home just inside the hall  poor peter what could he do he didnt dare go out and he simply couldnt stay where he was whatever he did must be done quickly for it looked to him as if a regular army of yellow jackets was coming and those little lances they carried were about the most painful things he knew of by this time he had lost all interest in what was going on outside there was quite enough going on inside too much in fact he remembered that johnny chuck digs his house deep down in the ground he looked down the long hall it was dark down there perhaps if he went down there these angry little warriors wouldnt follow him it was worth trying anyway  so peter scrambled to his feet and scurried down the long hall and as he ran he cried ouch ouch oh ohoo those sharp little lances were very busy and there was no way of fighting back at the end of the long hall was a snug little room very dark but cool and comfortable it was just as he had hoped the yellow jackets did not follow him down there they had driven him away from their home which was right near the entrance and they were satisfied  but what a fix he was in what a dreadful fix he ached and smarted all over my goodness how he did smart and to get out he would have to go right past the yellow jacket home again  oh dear i wish i had never thought of such a joke moaned peter trying in vain to find a comfortable position i guess i am served just right  i rather think he was dont you     vii  sammy jay does some guessing   sammy jay is a queer fellow although he is a scamp and dearly loves to make trouble for his neighbors he is always ready to take their part when others make trouble for them many are the times he has given them warning of danger this is one reason they are quite willing to overlook his own shortcomings so though in many ways he is no better than reddy fox he dearly loves to upset reddys plans and is very apt to rejoice when reddy gets into trouble of course being right there he saw all that happened when reddy ran against the old barrel at the top of the hill and sent it rolling he had been quite as much surprised as reddy to find that there was some one inside and he had followed reddy to see who it was so of course he had seen what happened to reddy  now instead of being sorry for reddy he had openly rejoiced it seems to be just that way with a great many people they like to see others who are considered very smart get into trouble so sammy had laughed and made fun of poor reddy in the first place it was very exciting and sammy dearly loves excitement and then it would make such a splendid story to tell and no one likes to carry tales more than does sammy jay he watched reddy sneak away to the green forest and jimmy skunk slowly walk away in a very dignified manner then sammy flew back to the old orchard to spread the news among the little people there it wasnt until he reached the old orchard that he remembered peter rabbit instead of flying about telling every one what had happened to jimmy skunk and reddy fox he found a comfortable perch in an old appletree and was strangely silent the fact is sammy jay was doing some hard thinking he had suddenly begun to wonder it had popped into that shrewd little head of his that it was very strange how suddenly peter rabbit had disappeared  of course thought sammy jimmy skunk is sure that reddy rolled that barrel down hill purposely and i dont wonder that he does think so but i saw it all and i know that it was all an accident so far as reddy was concerned i didnt know that jimmy was in that barrel and reddy couldnt have known it because he didnt come up here until after i did but peter rabbit may have known why did peter run so that he would have to jump over that barrel when he could have run right past it  of course he may have thought that if he could make reddy run right slam bang against that barrel it would stop reddy long enough to give him a chance to get away that would have been pretty smart of peter and quite like him but somehow i have a feeling that he knew all the time that jimmy skunk was taking a nap inside and that something was bound to happen if he was disturbed the more i think of it the more i believe that peter did know and that he planned the whole thing if he did it was one of the smartest tricks i ever heard of i didnt think peter had it in him it was rather hard on jimmy skunk but it got rid of reddy fox for a while he wont dare show his face around here for a long time that means that peter will have one less worry on his mind hello here comes jimmy skunk ill ask him a few questions  jimmy came ambling along in his usual lazy manner he had quite recovered his good nature he felt that he was more than even with reddy fox and as he was none the worse for his wild ride in the barrel he had quite forgotten that he had lost his temper  hello jimmy have you seen peter rabbit this morning cried sammy jay  jimmy looked up and grinned yes said he i saw him up here early this morning why  did he see you go into that old barrel persisted sammy  i dont know confessed jimmy he may have what have you got on your mind sammy jay  nothing much only reddy fox was chasing him when he ran against that barrel and sent you rolling down the hill replied sammy  jimmy pricked up his ears then reddy didnt do it purposely he exclaimed  no replied sammy he didnt do it purposely i am quite sure that he didnt know you were in it but how about peter rabbit i am wondering and im doing a little guessing too     viii  jimmy skunk looks for peter   jimmy skunk looked very hard at sammy jay sammy jay looked very hard at jimmy skunk then sammy slowly shut one eye and as slowly opened it again it was a wink  you mean said jimmy skunk that you guess that peter rabbit knew that i was in that barrel and that he jumped over it so as to make reddy fox run against it is that it  sammy jay said nothing but winked again jimmy grinned then he looked thoughtful i wonder said he slowly if peter did it so as to gain time to get away from reddy fox  i wonder said sammy jay  and i wonder if he did it just to get reddy into trouble continued jimmy  i wonder repeated sammy jay  and i wonder if he did it for a joke a double joke on reddy and myself jimmy went on scratching his head thoughtfully  i wonder said sammy jay once more and burst out laughing  now jimmy skunk has a very shrewd little head on his shoulders so that is your guess is it well i wouldnt be a bit surprised if you are right said he nodding his head i think i will go look for peter i think he needs a lesson jokes that put other people in danger or make them uncomfortable can have no excuse my neck might have been broken in that wild ride down the hill and certainly i was made most uncomfortable i felt as if everything inside me was shaken out of place and all mixed up even now my stomach feels a bit queer as if it might not be just where it ought to be by the way what became of peter after he jumped over the barrel  sammy shook his head i dont know he confessed you see it was very exciting when that barrel started rolling and we knew by the sounds that there was some one inside it i guess reddy fox forgot all about peter i know i did and when the barrel broke to pieces against that stone down there and you and reddy faced each other it was still more exciting after it was over i looked for peter but he was nowhere in sight he hadnt had time to reach the old briarpatch i really would like to know myself what became of him  jimmy skunk turned and looked down the hill then in his usual slow way he started back towards the broken barrel  where are you going asked sammy  to look for peter rabbit replied jimmy i want to ask him a few questions  jimmy skunk ambled along down the hill at first he was very angry as he thought of what peter had done and he made up his mind that peter should be taught a lesson he would never forget but as he ambled along the funny side of the whole affair struck him for jimmy skunk has a great sense of humor and before he reached the bottom of the hill his anger had all gone and he was chuckling  im sorry if i did reddy fox an injustice thought he but he makes so much trouble for other people that i guess no one else will be sorry he isnt likely to bother any one for some time peter really ought to be punished but somehow i dont feel so much like punishing him as i did ill just give him a little scare and let the scamp off with that now i wonder where he can be i have an idea he isnt very far away let me see seems to me i remember an old house of johnny chucks not very far from here ill have a look in that  illustration     ix  jimmy visits johnny chucks old house   jimmy skunk was smiling as he ambled towards the old house of johnny chuck near the foot of the hill there was no one near to see him and this made him smile still more you see the odor of that perfume which he had thrown at reddy fox just a little while before was very very strong there and jimmy knew that until that had disappeared no one would come near the place because it was so unpleasant for every one to jimmy himself it wasnt unpleasant at all and he couldnt understand why other people disliked it so he had puzzled over that a great deal he was glad that it was so because on account of it every one treated him with respect and took special pains not to quarrel with him  i guess its a good thing that old mother nature didnt make us all alike said he to himself i think there must be something the matter with their noses and i suppose they think there is something the matter with mine but there isnt not a thing hello there is johnny chucks old house just ahead of me now we will see what we shall see  he walked softly as he drew near to the old house if peter was way down inside it wouldnt matter how he approached but if peter should happen to be only just inside the doorway he might take it into his head to run if he should hear footsteps particularly if those footsteps were not heavy enough to be those of reddy or granny fox or old man coyote jimmy didnt intend to give peter a chance to do any such thing if peter once got outside that old house his long legs would soon put him beyond jimmys reach and jimmy knew it if he was to give peter the fright that he had made up his mind to give him he would first have to get him where he couldnt run away so jimmy walked as softly as he knew how and approached the old house in such a way as to keep out of sight of peter should he happen to be lying so as to look out of the doorway  at last he reached a position where with one jump he could land right on the doorstep he waited a few minutes and cocked his head on one side to listen there wasnt a sound to tell him whether peter was there or not then lightly he jumped over to the doorstep and looked in at the doorway there was no peter to be seen  if he is here he is way down inside thought jimmy i wonder if he really is here i think ill look about a bit before i go in  now the doorstep was of sand as johnny chucks doorsteps always are almost at once jimmy chuckled there were peters tracks and they pointed straight towards the inside of johnny chucks old house jimmy looked carefully but not a single track pointing the other way could he find then he chuckled again the scamp is here all right he muttered he hid here and watched all that happened and then decided to lie low and wait until he was sure that the way was clear and no one would see him in this jimmy was partly right and partly wrong as you and i know  he stared down the long dark doorway a minute then he made up his mind ill go down and make peter a call and i wont bother to knock he chuckled and poked his head inside the doorway but that was as far as jimmy skunk went yes sir that was just as far as jimmy skunk went you see no sooner did he start to enter that old house of johnny chucks than he was met by a lot of those yellow jackets and they were in a very bad temper  jimmy skunk knows all about yellow jackets and the sharp little lances they carry in their tails he has the greatest respect for them he backed out in a hurry and actually hurried away to a safe distance then he sat down to think after a little he began to chuckle again i know what happened said he talking to himself peter rabbit popped into that doorway those yellow jackets just naturally got after him he didnt dare come out for fear of reddy fox and me and so he went on down to jimmy chucks old bedroom and hes down there now wondering how ever he is to get out without getting stung i reckon i dont need to scare peter to pay him for that joke i reckon hes been punished already  illustration     x  peter rabbit is most uncomfortable   if ever any one was sorry for having played pranks on other folks that one was peter rabbit i am afraid it wasnt quite the right kind of sorrow you see he wasnt sorry because of what had happened to jimmy skunk and reddy fox but because of what had happened to himself there he was down in the bedroom of johnny chucks old house smarting and aching all over from the sharp little lances of the yellow jackets who had driven him down there before he had had a chance to see what happened to reddy fox that was bad enough but what troubled peter more was the thought that he couldnt get out without once again facing those hottempered yellow jackets peter wished with all his might that he had known about their home in johnny chucks old house before ever he thought of hiding there  but wishes of that kind are about the most useless things in the world they wouldnt help him now he had so many aches and smarts that he didnt see how he could stand a single one more and yet he couldnt see how he was going to get out without receiving several more all at once he had a comforting thought he remembered that johnny chuck usually has a back door if that were the case here he would be all right he would find out cautiously he poked his head out of the snug bedroom there was the long hall down which he had come and thereyes sir there was another hall it must be the way to the back door carefully peter crept up it  funny thought he that i dont see any light ahead of me  and then he bumped his nose yes sir peter bumped his nose against the end of that hall you see it was an old house and like most old houses it was rather a tumbledown affair anyway the back door had been blocked with a great stone and the walls of the back hall had fallen in there was no way out there sadly peter backed out to the little bedroom he would wait until night and perhaps then the yellow jackets would be asleep and he could steal out the front way without getting any more stings meanwhile he would try to get a nap and forget his aches and pains  hardly had peter curled up for that nap when he heard a voice it sounded as if it came from a long way off but he knew just where it came from it came from the doorway of that old house he knew too whose voice it was it was jimmy skunks voice  i know where you are peter rabbit said the voice and i know why you are hiding down there i know too how it happened that i was rolled down hill in that barrel im just giving you a little warning peter there are a lot of very angry yellow jackets up here as you will find out if you try to come out before dark im going away now but im going to come back about dark to wait for you i may want to play a little joke on you to pay you back for the one you played on me  that put an end to peters hope of a nap he shivered as he thought of what might happen to him if jimmy skunk should catch him what with his aches and pains from the stings of the yellow jackets and fear of being caught by jimmy skunk it was quite impossible to sleep he was almost ready to face those yellow jackets rather than wait and meet jimmy skunk twice he started up the long hall but turned back he just couldnt stand any more stings he was miserable yes sir he was miserable and most uncomfortable in both body and mind  i wish id never thought of that joke he half sobbed i thought it was a great joke but it wasnt it was a horrid mean joke why oh why did i ever think of it  meanwhile jimmy skunk had gone off chuckling     xi  jimmy skunk keeps his word     keep your word whateer you do   and to your inmost self be true  when jimmy skunk shouted down the hall of johnny chucks old house to peter rabbit that he would come back at dark he was half joking he did it to make peter uneasy and to worry him the truth is jimmy was no longer angry at all he had quite recovered his good nature and was very much inclined to laugh himself over peters trick but he felt that it wouldnt do to let peter off without some kind of punishment and so he decided to frighten peter a little he knew that peter wouldnt dare come out during the daytime because of the yellow jackets whose home was just inside the doorway of that old house and he knew that peter wouldnt dare face him for he would be afraid of being treated as reddy fox had been so that is why he told peter that he was coming back at dark he felt that if peter was kept a prisoner in there for a while all the time worrying about how he was to get out he would be very slow to try such a trick again  as jimmy ambled away to look for some beetles he chuckled and chuckled and chuckled i guess that by this time peter wishes he hadnt thought of that joke on reddy fox and myself said he perhaps ill go back there tonight and perhaps i wont he wont know whether i do or not and he wont dare come out  then he stopped and scratched his head thoughtfully then he sighed then he scratched his head again and once more sighed i really dont want to go back there tonight he muttered but i guess ill have to i said i would and so ill have to do it i believe in keeping my word if i shouldnt and some day he should find it out he wouldnt believe me the next time i happened to say i would do a thing yes sir ill have to go back there is nothing like making people believe that when you say a thing you mean it there is nothing like keeping your word to make people respect you  being naturally rather lazy jimmy decided not to go any farther than the edge of the old orchard which was only a little way above johnny chucks old house where peter was a prisoner there jimmy found a warm sunny spot and curled up for a nap in fact he spent all the day there when jolly round red mr sun went to bed behind the purple hills and the black shadows came trooping across the green meadows jimmy got up yawned chuckled and then slowly ambled down to johnny chucks old house a look at the footprints in the sand on the doorstep told him that peter had not come out jimmy sat down and waited until it was quite dark then he poked his head in at the doorway the yellow jackets had gone to bed for the night  come out peter im waiting for you he called down the hall and made his voice sound as angry as he could but inside he was chuckling then jimmy skunk calmly turned and went about his business he had kept his word  as for peter rabbit that had been one of the very worst days he could recall he had ached and smarted from the stings of the yellow jackets he had worried all day about what would happen to him if he did meet jimmy skunk and he was hungry he had had just a little bit of hope and this was that jimmy skunk wouldnt come back when it grew dark he had crept part way up the hall at the first hint of night and stretched himself out to wait until he could be sure that those dreadful yellow jackets had gone to sleep he had just about made up his mind that it was safe for him to scamper out when jimmy skunks voice came down the hall to him poor peter the sound of that voice almost broke his heart  he has come back hes kept his word he half sobbed as he once more went back to johnny chucks old bedroom  there he stayed nearly all the rest of the night though his stomach was so empty it ached just before it was time for mr sun to rise peter ventured to dash out of johnny chucks old house he got past the home of the yellow jackets safely for they were not yet awake with his heart in his mouth he sprang out of the doorway jimmy skunk wasnt there with a sigh of relief peter started for the dear safe old briarpatch lippertylippertylip as fast as he could go  ill never never play another joke he said over and over again as he ran     xii  jimmy skunk and unc billy possum meet   jimmy skunk ambled along down the lone little path through the green forest he didnt hurry jimmy never does hurry hurrying and worrying are two things he leaves for his neighbors now and then jimmy stopped to turn over a bit of bark or a stick hoping to find some fat beetles but it was plain to see that he had something besides fat beetles on his mind  up the lone little path through the green forest shuffled unc billy possum he didnt hurry it was too warm to hurry unlike jimmy skunk he does hurry sometimes does unc billy especially when he suspects that bowser the hound is about and sometimes unc billy does worry you see there are people who think that unc billy would make a very good dinner unc billy doesnt think he would anyway he has no desire to have the experiment tried so occasionally when he discovers one of these people who think he would make a good dinner he worries a little  but just now unc billy was neither hurrying nor worrying there was no need of doing either and unc billy never does anything that there is no need of doing so unc billy shuffled up the lone little path and jimmy skunk ambled down the lone little path and right at a bend in the lone little path they met  illustration  jimmy skunk grinned hello unc billy said he have you seen any fat beetles this morning  unc billy grinned good monin brer skunk he replied ah cant rightly say ah have ah had it on mah mind to ask yo the same thing  jimmy sat down and looked at unc billy with twinkling eyes his grin grew broader and became a chuckle unc billy said he have you ever in your life combed your hair or brushed your coat you know unc billy usually looks as if every hair was trying to point in a different direction from every other hair while jimmy skunk always appears as neat as if he spent half his time brushing and smoothing his handsome black and white coat  unc billys eyes twinkled ah reckons ah did such a thing once or twice when ah was very small brer skunk said he without a trace of a smile but it seems to me a powerful waste of time ah have mo important things to worry about by the way brer skunk did yo ever run away from anybody in all your life  jimmy looked surprised at the question he scratched his head thoughtfully not that i remember of said he after a little most folks run away from me he added with a little throaty chuckle those who dont run away always are polite and step aside it may be that when i was a very little fellow and didnt know much about the great world and the people who live in it i might have run away from some one but if i did i cant remember it why do you ask unc billy  oh no reason in particular brer skunk no reason in particular only ah wonder sometimes if yo ever realize how lucky yo are if ah never had to worry about mah hungry neighbors ah reckons perhaps ah might brush mah coat oftener unc billys eyes twinkled more than ever  worry replied jimmy skunk sagely is the result of being unprepared anybody who is prepared has no occasion to worry just think it over unc billy  it was unc billys turn to scratch his head thoughtfully ah fear ah dont quite get your meaning brer skunk said he  sit down unc billy and ill explain replied jimmy     xiii  jimmy skunk explains     youll find this true whereer you go   that those prepared few troubles know  to begin with i am not such a very big fellow am i said jimmy  ah reckons ah knows a right smart lot of folks bigger than yo brer skunk replied unc billy with a grin you know jimmy skunk really is a little fellow compared with some of his neighbors  and i havent very long claws or very big teeth have i continued jimmy  ah reckons mine are about as long and about as big returned unc billy looking more puzzled than ever  but you never see anybody bothering me do you went on jimmy  no replied unc billy  and its the same way with prickly porky the porcupine you never see anybody bothering him or offering to do him any harm do you persisted jimmy  no replied unc billy once more  why demanded jimmy  unc billy grinned broadly ah reckons brer skunk said he that there isnt anybody wants to go fo to meddle with yo and brer porky ah reckons most folks knows what would happen if they did and that yo and brer porky are folks its a sight mo comfortable to leave alone leastways ah does ah aint aiming fo trouble with either of yo that lil bag of scent yo carry is certnly most powerful brer skunk and ah isnt hankering to brush against those little spears brer porky is so free with ah knows when ahs well off and ah reckons most folks feel the same way  jimmy skunk chuckled one more question unc billy said he did you ever know me to pick a quarrel and use that bag of scent without being attacked  unc billy considered for a few minutes ah cant say ah ever did he replied  and you never knew prickly porky to go hunting trouble either declared jimmy we dont either of us go hunting trouble and trouble never comes hunting us and the reason is that we both are always prepared for trouble and everybody knows it buster bear could squash me by just stepping on me but he doesnt try it you notice he always is very polite when we meet prickly porky and i are armed for defence but we never use our weapons for offence nobody bothers us and we bother nobody thats the beauty of being prepared  unc billy thought it over for a few minutes then he sighed and sighed again  ah reckons yo and brer porky are about the luckiest people ah knows said he yes sah ah reckons yo is just that ah dont fear anybody mah own size but ah certnly does have some mighty scary times when ah meets some people ah might mention ah wish ol mother nature had done gone and given me something fo to make people as scary of me as they are of yo ah certnly believes in preparedness after seein yo brer skunk ah certnly does just that very thing have yo found any nice fresh aiggs lately     xiv  a little something about eggs     an egg says jimmy skunk is good     its very good indeed to eat   an egg says mrs grouse is dear     twill hatch into a baby sweet  so in the matter of eggs as in a great many other matters it all depends on the point of view to jimmy skunk and unc billy possum eggs are looked on from the viewpoint of something to eat their stomachs prompt them to think of eggs eggs are good to fill empty stomachs the mere thought of eggs will make jimmy and unc billy smack their lips they say they love eggs but they dont they like them which is quite different  but mrs grouse and most of the other feathered people of the green forest and the green meadows and the old orchard really do love eggs it is the heart instead of the stomach that responds to the thought of eggs to them eggs are almost as precious as babies because they know that some day some day very soon those eggs will become babies there are a few feathered folks i am sorry to say who love their own eggs but like the eggs of other peoplelike them just as jimmy skunk and unc billy possum do to eat blacky the crow is one and his cousin sammy jay is another  so in the springtime there is always a great deal of matching of wits between the little people of the green forest and the green meadows and the old orchard those who have eggs try to keep them a secret or to build the nests that hold them where none who like to eat them can get them and those who have an appetite for eggs try to find them  when unc billy possum suddenly changed the subject by asking jimmy skunk if he had found any nice fresh eggs lately he touched a subject very close to jimmys heart i should have said rather his stomach to tell the truth it was a longing for some eggs that had brought jimmy to the green forest he knew that somewhere there mrs grouse must be hiding a nestful of the very nicest of eggs and it was to hunt for these that he had come  no replied jimmy i havent had any luck at all this spring ive almost forgotten what an egg tastes like either im growing dull and stupid or some folks are smarter than they used to be by the way have you seen mrs grouse lately jimmy looked very innocent as he asked this  unc billy chuckled until his sides shook do yo suppose ahd tell yo if ah had he demanded ah reckons mrs grouse hasnt got any mo aiggs than ah could comfortably take care of mahself not to mention mrs possum here unc billy looked back over his shoulder to make sure that old mrs possum wasnt within hearing and jimmy skunk chuckled seems to me brer skunk yo might better do your aigg hunting on the green meadows and leave the green forest to me continued unc billy that would be no mo than fair yo know ah never did hanker fo to get far away from trees but yo dont mind besides there are mo aiggs for yo to find on the green meadows than there are fo me to find in the green forest a right smart lot of birds make their nests on the ground there there is brer bob white and brer meadowlark and brer bobolink and brer field sparrow and brer  never mind any more unc billy interrupted jimmy skunk i know all about them that is i know all about them i want to know except where their eggs are didnt i just tell you i havent had any luck at all thats why im over here  well yo wont have any mo luck here unless yo are a right smart lot sharper than your unc billy and when it comes to hunting aiggs ah dont take mah hat off to anybody not even to yo brer skunk replied unc billy     xv  a second meeting   jimmy skunk couldnt think of anything but eggs the more he thought of them the more he wanted some after parting from unc billy possum in the green forest he went back to the green meadows and prowled about hunting for the nests of his feathered neighbors who build on the ground and having no more luck than he had had before  unc billy possum was faring about the same way he couldnt for the life of him stop thinking about those eggs that belonged to mrs grouse the more he tried to forget about them the more he thought about them  ah feels it in mah bones that there isnt the least bit of use in huntin fo them said he to himself as he watched jimmy skunk amble out of sight up the lone little path no sah there isnt the least bit of use ah done look every place ah can think of already still ah havent got anything else special on mah mind and those aiggs certnly would taste good ah reckons it must be ah needs those aiggs or ah wouldnt have them on mah mind so much ah finds it rather painful to carry aiggs on mah mind all the time but ah would enjoy carrying them in mah stomach ah certnly would unc billy grinned and started to ramble about aimlessly hoping that chance would lead him to the nest of mrs grouse  do what he would unc billy couldnt get the thought of eggs off his mind and the more he thought about them the more he wanted some and that led him to think of farmer browns henhouse he had long ago resolved never again to go there but the longing for a taste of eggs was too much for his good resolutions and as soon as jolly round red mr sun sank to rest behind the purple hills and the black shadows came creeping across the green meadows and through the green forest unc billy slipped away taking pains that old mrs possum shouldnt suspect where he was going  out from the green forest keeping among the black shadows along by the old stone wall on the edge of the old orchard he stole and so at last he reached farmer browns henhouse he stopped to listen there was no sign of bowser the hound and unc billy sighed gently it was a sigh of relief then he crept around a corner of the henhouse towards a certain hole under it he remembered well just as he reached it he saw something white it moved it was coming towards him from the other end of the henhouse unc billy stopped right where he was he was undecided whether to run or stay then he heard a little grunt and decided to stay he even grinned a few seconds later up came jimmy skunk it was a white stripe on jimmys coat that unc billy had seen  jimmy gave a little snort of surprise when he almost bumped into unc billy  what are you doing here he demanded  just taking a lil walk fo the good of mah appetite replied unc billy grinning more broadly than ever what are yo doing here brer skunk  the same thing replied jimmy then he chuckled this is an unexpected meeting i guess you must have had the same thing on your mind all day that i have he added  ah reckon so replied unc billy and both grinned  illustration     xvi  a matter of politeness    it costs not much to be polite   and furthermore its always right   unc billy possum and jimmy skunk facing each other among the black shadows close by a hole that led under farmer browns henhouse chuckled as each thought of what had brought the other there it is queer how a like thought often brings people together unc billy had the same longing in his stomach that jimmy skunk had and jimmy skunk had the same thing on his mind that unc billy had more than this it was the second time that day that they had met they had met in the morning in the green forest and now they had met again among the black shadows of the evening at farmer browns henhouse and it was all on account of eggs yes sir it was all on account of eggs  are you just coming out or are you just going in jimmy inquired politely  ah was just going in but ahll follow yo brer skunk replied unc billy just as politely  nothing of the kind returned jimmy i wouldnt for a minute think of going before you i hope i know my manners better than that  yo certnly are most polite brer skunk yo certnly are most polite yo are a credit to your bringing up but politeness always did run in your family there is a saying that hansome is as hansome does and your politeness is as fine as yo are hansome brer skunk ahll just step one side and let yo go first just to show that ah sholy does appreciate your friendship said unc billy  jimmy skunk chuckled i guess youve forgotten that other old saying age before beauty unc billy said he so you go first you know you are older than i i couldnt think of being so impolite as to go first i really couldnt think of such a thing  and so they argued and argued each insisting in the most polite way that the other should go first if the truth were known neither of them was insisting out of politeness at all no sir politeness had nothing to do with it jimmy skunk wanted unc billy to go first because jimmy believes in safety first and it had popped into jimmys head that there might there just might happen to be a trap inside that hole if there was he much preferred that unc billy should be the one to find it out yes sir that is why jimmy skunk was so very polite  unc billy wanted jimmy to go first because he always feels safer behind jimmy than in front of him he has great respect for that little bag of scent that jimmy carries and he knows that when jimmy makes use of it he always throws it in front and never behind him jimmy seldom uses it but sometimes he does if he happens to be startled and thinks danger near so unc billy preferred that jimmy should go first it wasnt politeness at all on the part of unc billy in both cases it was a kind of selfishness each was thinking of self  how long they would have continued to argue and try to appear polite if something hadnt happened nobody knows but something did happen there was a sudden loud sniff just around the corner of the henhouse it was from bowser the hound right then and there unc billy possum and jimmy skunk forgot all about politeness and both tried to get through that hole at the same time they couldnt because it wasnt big enough but they tried hard bowser sniffed again and this time unc billy managed to squeeze jimmy aside and slip through jimmy was right at his heels     xvii  jimmy skunk gets a bump   hardly had jimmy skunk entered the hole under farmer browns henhouse following close on the heels of unc billy possum than along came bowser the hound sniffing and sniffing in a way that made unc billy nervous when bowser reached that hole of course he smelled the tracks of unc billy and jimmy and right away he became excited he began to dig goodness how he did make the dirt fly all the time he whined with eagerness  unc billy wasted no time in squeezing through a hole in the floor way over in one corner a hole that farmer browns boy had intended to nail a board over long before unc billy knew that bowser couldnt get through that even if he did manage to dig his way under the henhouse once through that and fairly in the henhouse unc billy drew a long breath he felt safe for the time being anyway and he didnt propose to worry over the future  jimmy skunk hurried after unc billy it wasnt fear that caused jimmy to hurry no indeed it wasnt fear he had been startled by the unexpectedness of bowsers appearance it was this that had caused him to struggle to be first through that hole under the henhouse but once through he had felt a bit ashamed that he had been so undignified he wasnt afraid of bowser he was sorely tempted to turn around and send bowser about his business as he knew he very well could but he thought better of it besides unc billy was already through that hole in the floor and jimmy didnt for a minute forget what had brought him there he had come for eggs and so had unc billy it would never do to let unc billy be alone up there for long so jimmy skunk did what he very seldom doeshurried yes sir he hurried after unc billy possum he meant to make sure of his share of the eggs he was certain were up there  there was a row of nesting boxes along one side close to the floor above these was another row and above these a third row jimmy doesnt climb but unc billy is a famous climber  ill take these lower nests said jimmy and lifted his tail in a way that made unc billy nervous  all right replied unc billy promptly all right brer skunk its just as yo say  with this unc billy scrambled up to the next row of nests jimmy grinned and started to look in the lower nests he took his time about it for that is jimmys way there was nothing in the first one and nothing in the second one and nothing in the third one this was disappointing to say the least and jimmy began to move a little faster meanwhile unc billy had hurried from one nest to another in the second row with no better success by the time jimmy was halfway along his row unc billy bad begun on the upper row and the only eggs he had found were hard china nesteggs put there by farmer browns boy to tempt the hens to lay in those particular nests disappointment was making unc billy lose his temper each time he peeped in a nest and saw one of those china eggs he hoped it was a real egg and each time when he found it wasnt he grew angrier  at last he so lost his temper that when he found another of those eggs he angrily kicked it out of the nest now it happened that jimmy skunk was just underneath down fell that hard china egg squarely on jimmy skunks head for just a minute jimmy saw stars at least he thought he did then he saw the egg and knew that unc billy had knocked it down and that it was this that had hit him jimmy was sore at heart because he had found no eggs and now he had a bump on the head that also was sore jimmy skunk lost his temper a thing he rarely does     xviii  a sad sad quarrel   jimmy skunk sat on the floor of farmer browns henhouse rubbing his head and glaring up at the upper row of nests with eyes red with anger of course it was dark in the henhouse for it was night but jimmy can see in the dark just as so many other little people who wear fur can what he saw was the anxious looking face of unc billy possum staring down at him  you did that purposely snapped jimmy you did that purposely and you neednt tell me you didnt  on mah honor ah didnt protested unc billy it was an accident just a sho nuff accident and ahm right sorry fo it  that sounds very nice but i dont believe a word of it you did it purposely and you cant make me believe anything else come down here and fight i dare you to jimmy was getting more and more angry every minute  unc billy began to grow angry of course it was wholly his fault that that egg had fallen but it wasnt his fault that jimmy had happened to be just beneath he hadnt known that jimmy was there he had apologized and he felt that no one could do more than that jimmy skunk had doubted his word had refused to believe him and that made him angry his little eyes glowed with rage  if yo want to fight come up here ill wait fo yo right where ah am he sputtered  this made jimmy angrier than ever he couldnt climb up there and he knew that unc billy knew it unc billy was perfectly safe in promising to wait for him  youre a coward just a plain noaccount coward snapped jimmy im not going to climb up there but ill tell you what i am going to do im going to wait right down here until you come down if it isnt until next year nobody can drop things on my head and not get paid back i thought you were a friend but now i know better  wait as long as yo please ah reckons ah can stay as long as yo can retorted unc billy grinding and snapping his teeth  suit yourself retorted jimmy im going to pay you up for that bump on my head or know the reason why  and so they kept on quarreling and calling each other names for the time being quite forgetting that they were where they had no business to be either of them it really was dreadful and it was all because both had been sadly disappointed they had found no eggs where they had been sure they would find plenty you see farmer browns boy had gathered every egg when he shut the biddies up for the night did you ever notice what a bad thing for the temper disappointment often is  illustration     xix  jimmy skunk is true to his word   unc billy possum was having a bad night of it when he had grown tired of quarreling with jimmy skunk he had tried to take a nap he had tried first one nest and then another but none just suited him this was partly because he wasnt sleepy he was hungry and not at all sleepy he wished with all his heart that he hadnt foolishly yielded to that fit of temper which had resulted in kicking that china nestegg out of a nest and down on the head of jimmy skunk making jimmy so thoroughly angry  unc billy had no intention of going down while jimmy was there he thought that jimmy would soon grow tired of waiting and go away so for quite awhile unc billy didnt worry but as it began to get towards morning he began to grow anxious unc billy had no desire to be found in that henhouse when farmer browns boy came to feed the biddies  then too he was hungry he had counted on a good meal of eggs and not one had he found now he wanted to get out to look for something else to eat but he couldnt without facing jimmy skunk and it was better to go hungry than to do that yes sir it was a great deal better to go hungry several times when he thought jimmy was asleep he tried to steal down he was just as careful not to make a sound as he could be but every time jimmy knew and was waiting for him unc billy wished that there was no such place as farmer browns henhouse he wished he had never thought of eggs he wished many other foolish wishes but most of all he wished that he hadnt lost his temper and kicked that egg down on jimmy skunks head when the first light stole in under the door and the biddies began to stir uneasily on their roosts unc billys anxiety would allow him to keep still no longer  don yo think weuns better make up and get out of here brer skunk he ventured  i dont mind staying here its very comfortable replied jimmy looking up at unc billy in a way that made him most uncomfortable it was plain to see that jimmy hadnt forgiven him  for some time unc billy said no more but he grew more and more restless you see he knew it would soon be time for farmer browns boy to come to let the hens out and feed them at last he ventured to speak again  ah reckons yo done forget something said he  what is that asked jimmy  ah reckons yo done foget that its most time fo farmer browns boy to come and it wont do fo weuns to be found in here replied unc billy  im not worrying about farmer browns boy he can come as soon as he pleases retorted jimmy skunk and grinned  that sounded like boasting but it wasnt no sir it wasnt and unc billy knew it he knew that jimmy meant it unc billy was in despair he didnt dare stay and he didnt dare go down and face jimmy skunk and there he was it certainly had been a bad night for unc billy possum     xx  farmer browns boy arrives   the light crept farther under the door of farmer browns henhouse and by this time the hens were all awake furthermore they had discovered jimmy skunk down below and were making a great fuss they were cackling so that unc billy was sure farmer browns boy would soon hear them and hurry out to find out what the noise was all about  if yo would just get out of sight brer skunk ah reckons those fool hens would keep quiet unc billy ventured  i dont mind their noise it doesnt trouble me a bit replied jimmy skunk and grinned it was plain enough to unc billy that jimmy was enjoying the situation  but unc billy wasnt he was so anxious that he couldnt keep still he paced back and forth along the shelf in front of the upper row of nests and tried to make up his mind whether it would be better to go down and face jimmy skunk or to try to hide under the hay in one of the nests and all the time he kept listening and listening and listening for the footsteps of farmer browns boy  at last he heard them and he knew by the sound that farmer browns boy was coming in a hurry he had heard the noise of the hens and was coming to find out what it was all about unc billy hoped that now jimmy skunk would retreat through the hole in the floor and give him a chance to escape  hes coming farmer browns boy is coming brer skunk yo better get away while yo can whispered unc billy  i hear him replied jimmy calmly im waiting for him to open the door for me to go out it will be much easier than squeezing through that hole  unc billy gasped he knew of course that it was jimmy skunks boast that he feared no one but it was hard to believe that jimmy really intended to face farmer browns boy right in his own henhouse where jimmy had no business to be he hoped that at last jimmys boldness would get him into trouble yes he did you see that might give him a chance to slip away himself otherwise he would be in a bad fix  the latch on the door rattled unc billy crept into one of the nests but frightened as he was he couldnt keep from peeping over the edge to see what would happen the door swung open letting in a flood of light the hens stopped their noise farmer browns boy stood in the doorway and looked in jimmy skunk lifted his big plume of a tail just a bit higher than usual and calmly and without the least sign of being in a hurry walked straight towards the open door of course farmer browns boy saw him at once  so its you you black and white rascal he exclaimed i suppose you expect me to step out of your way and i suppose i will do just that very thing you are the most impudent and independent fellow of my acquaintance thats what you are you didnt get any eggs because i gathered all of them last night and you didnt get a chicken because they were wise enough to stay on their roosts so i dont know as i have any quarrel with you and im sure i dont want any come along out of there you rascal  farmer browns boy stepped aside and jimmy skunk calmly and without the least sign of hurry or worry walked out stopped for a drink at the pan of water in the henyard walked through the henyard gate and turned towards the stone wall along the edge of the old orchard     xxi  the nestegg gives unc billy away     tis little things that often seem     scarce worth a passing thought   which in the end may prove that they     with big results are fraught  farmer browns boy watched jimmy skunk calmly and peacefully go his way and grinned as he watched him he scratched his head thoughtfully i suppose said he that that is as perfect an example of the value of preparedness as there is jimmy knew he was all ready for trouble if i chose to make it and that because of that i wouldnt make it so he has calmly gone his way as if he were as much bigger than i as i am bigger than he there certainly is nothing like being prepared if you want to avoid trouble  then farmer browns boy once more turned to the henhouse and entered it he looked to make sure that no hen had been foolish enough to go to sleep where jimmy could have caught her and satisfied of this he would have gone about his usual morning work of feeding the hens but for one thing that one thing was the china nestegg on the floor  hello exclaimed farmer browns boy when he saw it now how did that come there it must be that jimmy skunk pulled it out of one of those lower nests  now he knew just which nests had contained nesteggs and it didnt take but a minute to find that none was missing in any of the lower nests thats queer he muttered that egg must have come from one of the upper nests jimmy couldnt have got up to those none of the hens could have kicked it out last night because they were all on the roosts when i shut them up they certainly didnt do it this morning because they wouldnt have dared leave the roosts with jimmy skunk here ill have to look into this  so he began with the second row of nests and looked in each then he started on the upper row and so he came to the nest in which unc billy possum was hiding under the hay and holding his breath now unc billy had covered himself up pretty well with the hay but he had forgotten one thing he had forgotten his tail yes sir unc billy had forgotten his tail and it hung just over the edge of the nest of course farmer browns boy saw it he couldnt help but see it  ho ho he exclaimed right away ho ho so there was more than one visitor here last night this henhouse seems to be a very popular place i see that the first thing for me to do after breakfast is to nail a board over that hole in the floor so it was you unc billy possum who kicked that nestegg out found it a little hard for your teeth didnt you lost your temper and kicked it out didnt you that was foolish unc billy very foolish indeed never lose your temper over trifles it doesnt pay now i wonder what id better do with you  all this time unc billy hadnt moved of course he couldnt understand what farmer browns boy was saying nor could he see what farmer browns boy was doing so he held his breath and hoped and hoped that he hadnt been discovered and perhaps he wouldnt have been but for that telltale nestegg on the floor that was the cause of all his troubles first it had angered jimmy skunk because as you remember it had fallen on jimmys head then it had led farmer browns boy to look in all the nests it had seemed a trifle kicking that egg out of that nest but see what the results were truly little things often are not so little as they seem  illustration     xxii  unc billy possum tries his old trick   the first knowledge unc billy possum had that he was discovered came to him through his tail yes sir it came to him through his tail farmer browns boy pinched it it was rather a mean thing to do but farmer browns boy was curious he wanted to see what unc billy would do and he didnt pinch very hard not hard enough to really hurt farmer browns boy is too goodhearted to hurt any one if he can help it  now any other of the green forest and green meadows people would promptly have pulled their tail away had they been in unc billys place but unc billy didnt no sir unc billy didnt that tail might have belonged to any one but him so far as he made any sign of course he felt like pulling it away any one would have in his place but he didnt move it the tiniest bit which goes to show that unc billy has great selfcontrol when he wishes  farmer browns boy pinched again just a little harder but still unc billy made no sign farmer browns boy chuckled and began to pull on that tail he pulled and pulled until finally he had pulled unc billy out of his hidingplace and he swung by his tail from the hand of farmer browns boy there wasnt the least sign of life about unc billy he looked as if he were dead and he acted as if he were dead any one not knowing unc billy would have supposed that he was dead  farmer browns boy dropped unc billy on the floor he lay just as he fell farmer browns boy rolled him over with his foot but there wasnt a sign of life in unc billy he hoped that farmer browns boy really did think him dead that was what he wanted farmer browns boy picked him up again and laid him on a box first putting a board over the hole in the floor and closing the henhouse door then he went about his work of cleaning out the henhouse and measuring out the grain for the biddies  unc billy lay there on the box and he certainly was pathetic looking a dead animal or bird is always pathetic looking and none was ever more so than unc billy possum as he lay on that box his hair was all rumpled up as it usually is it was filled with dust from the floor and bits of straw his lips were drawn back and his mouth partly open his eyes seemed to be closed as a matter of fact they were open just a teeny weeny bit just enough for unc billy to watch farmer browns boy but to have looked at him you would have thought him as dead as the deadest thing that ever was  as he went about his work farmer browns boy kept an eye on unc billy and chuckled you old fraud said he you think you are fooling me but i know you possums dont die of nothing in hens nests you certainly are a clever old rascal and the best actor ive ever seen i wonder how long you will keep it up i wish i had half as much selfcontrol  when he had finished his work he picked unc billy up by the tail once more opened the door and started for the house with unc billy swinging from his hand and bumping against his legs still unc billy gave no sign of life he wondered where he was being taken to he was terribly frightened but he stuck to his old trick of playing dead which had served him so well more than once before  illustration     xxiii  unc billy gives himself away   never had unc billy possum played that old trick of his better than he was playing it now farmer browns boy knew that unc billy was only pretending to be dead yet so well did unc billy pretend that it was hard work for farmer browns boy to believe what he knew was the truththat unc billy was very much alive and only waiting for a chance to slip away  they were halfway from the henyard to the house when bowser the hound came to meet his master now we shall see what we shall see said farmer browns boy as bowser came trotting up if unc billy can stand this test ill take off my hat to him every time we meet hereafter he held unc billy out to bowser and bowser sniffed him all over  just imagine that just think of being nosed and sniffed at by one of whom you were terribly afraid and not so much as twitching an ear farmer browns boy dropped unc billy on the ground and bowser rolled him over and sniffed at him and then looked up at his master as much as to say this fellow doesnt interest me hes dead he must be the fellow i saw go under the henhouse last night how did you kill him  farmer browns boy laughed and picked unc billy up by the tail again hes fooled you all right old fellow and you dont know it said he to bowser as the latter pranced on ahead to the house the mother of farmer browns boy was in the doorway watching them approach  what have you got there she demanded i declare if it isnt a possum where did you kill him was he the cause of all that racket among the chickens  farmer browns boy took unc billy into the kitchen and dropped him on a chair mrs brown came over to look at him closer poor little fellow said she poor little fellow it was too bad he got into mischief and had to be killed i dont suppose he knew any better somehow it always seems wrong to me to kill these little creatures just because they get into mischief when all the time they dont know that they are in mischief she stroked unc billy gently  the eyes of farmer browns boy twinkled he went over to a corner and pulled a straw from his mothers broom then he returned to unc billy and began to tickle unc billys nose mrs brown looked puzzled she was puzzled  what are you doing that for she asked  just for fun replied farmer browns boy and kept on tickling unc billys nose now unc billy could stand having his tail pinched and being carried head down and being dropped on the ground but this was too much for him he wanted to sneeze he had got to sneeze he did sneeze he couldnt help it though it were to cost him his life  land of love exclaimed mrs brown jumping back and clutching her skirts in both hands as if she expected unc billy would try to take refuge behind them do you mean to say that that possum is alive  seems that way replied farmer browns boy as unc billy sneezed again for that straw was still tickling his nose i should certainly say it seems that way the old sinner is no more dead than i am hes just pretending he fooled you all right mother but he didnt fool me i havent hurt a hair of him you ought to know me well enough by this time to know that i wouldnt hurt him  he looked at his mother reproachfully and she hastened to apologize but what could i think she demanded if he isnt a deadlooking creature i never have seen one what are you going to do with him son  take him over to the green forest after breakfast and let him go replied farmer browns boy  this is just what he did do and unc billy wasted no time in getting home it was a long time before he met jimmy skunk again when he did jimmy was his usual goodnatured self and unc billy was wise enough not to refer to eggs
