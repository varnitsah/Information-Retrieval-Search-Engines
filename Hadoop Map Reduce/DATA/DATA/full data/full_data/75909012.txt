75909012	captain brassbounds conversion  by bernard shaw     act i  on the heights overlooking the harbor of mogador a seaport on the west coast of morocco the missionary in the coolness of the late afternoon is following the precept of voltaire by cultivating his garden he is an elderly scotchman spiritually a little weatherbeaten as having to navigate his creed in strange waters crowded with other craft but still a convinced son of the free church and the north african mission with a faithful brown eye and a peaceful soul physically a wiry smallknit man well tanned clean shaven with delicate resolute features and a twinkle of mild humor he wears the sun helmet and pagri the neutraltinted spectacles and the white canvas spanish sand shoes of the modern scotch missionary but instead of a cheap tourists suit from glasgow a grey flannel shirt with white collar a green sailor knot tie with a cheap pin in it he wears a suit of clean white linen acceptable in color if not in cut to the moorish mind  the view from the garden includes much atlantic ocean and a long stretch of sandy coast to the south swept by the north east trade wind and scantily nourishing a few stunted pepper trees mangy palms and tamarisks the prospect ends as far as the land is concerned in little hills that come nearly to the sea rudiments these of the atlas mountains the missionary having had daily opportunities of looking at this seascape for thirty years or so pays no heed to it being absorbed in trimming a huge red geranium bush to english eyes unnaturally big which with a dusty smilax or two is the sole product of his pet flowerbed he is sitting to his work on a moorish stool in the middle of the garden there is a pleasant seat in the shade of a tamarisk tree the house is in the south west corner of the garden and the geranium bush in the north east corner  at the gardendoor of the house there appears presently a man who is clearly no barbarian being in fact a less agreeable product peculiar to modern commercial civilization his frame and flesh are those of an illnourished lad of seventeen but his age is inscrutable only the absence of any sign of grey in his mud colored hair suggests that he is at all events probably under forty without prejudice to the possibility of his being under twenty a londoner would recognize him at once as an extreme but hardy specimen of the abortion produced by nature in a city slum his utterance affectedly pumped and hearty and naturally vulgar and nasal is ready and fluent nature a board school education and some kerbstone practice having made him a bit of an orator his dialect apart from its base nasal delivery is not unlike that of smart london society in its tendency to replace diphthongs by vowels sometimes rather prettily and to shuffle all the traditional vowel pronunciations he pronounces ow as ah and i as aw using the ordinary ow for o i for a a for u and e for a with this reservation that when any vowel is followed by an r he signifies its presence not by pronouncing the r which he never does under these circumstances but by prolonging and modifyinq the vowel sometimes even to the extreme degree of pronouncing it properly as to his yol for l a compendious delivery of the provincial ehal and other metropolitan refinements amazing to all but cockneys they cannot be indicated save in the above imperfect manner without the aid of a phonetic alphabet he is dressed in somebody elses very second best as a coastguardsman and gives himself the airs of a stage tar with sufficient success to pass as a possible fish porter of bad character in casual employment during busy times at billingsgate his manner shows an earnest disposition to ingratiate himself with the missionary probably for some dishonest purpose

at the door addressing rankin bikouros moroccan for epicurus a general moorish name for the missionaries who are supposed by the moors to have chosen their calling through a love of luxurious idleness

always permitted by the prophet to ask bikouros he goes cheerfully into the house with the krooboys  drinkwater jist thort eed trah it orn a did hooman nitre is the sime everywheres them eathens is jast lawk you an me gavner  a lady and gentleman both english come into the garden the gentleman more than elderly is facing old age on compulsion not resignedly he is clean shaven and has a brainy rectangular forehead a resolute nose with strongly governed nostrils and a tightly fastened down mouth which has evidently shut in much temper and anger in its time he has a habit of deliberately assumed authority and dignity but is trying to take life more genially and easily in his character of tourist which is further borne out by his white hat and summery racecourse attire  the lady is between thirty and forty tall very goodlooking sympathetic intelligent tender and humorous dressed with cunning simplicity not as a businesslike tailor made gaitered tourist but as if she lived at the next cottage and had dropped in for tea in blouse and flowered straw hat a woman of great vitality and humanity who begins a casual acquaintance at the point usually attained by english people after thirty years acquaintance when they are capable of reaching it at all she pounces genially on drinkwater who is smirking at her hat in hand with an air of hearty welcome the gentleman on the other hand comes down the side of the garden next the house instinctively maintaining a distance between himself and the others  the lady to drinkwater how dye do are you the missionary  drinkwater modestly naow lidy aw will not deceive you thow the mistike his but netral awm wanne of the missionarys good works lidyis first cornvert a umble british seamancountrymen o yours lidy and of is lawdships this eah is mr renkin the bust worker in the wust cowst vawnyawd introducing the judge mr renkin is lawdship sr ahrd ellam he withdraws discreetly into the house  sir howard to rankin i am sorry to intrude on you mr rankin but in the absence of a hotel there seems to be no alternative  lady cicely beaming on him besides we would so much rather stay with you if you will have us mr rankin  sir howard introducing her my sisterinlaw lady cicely waynflete mr rankin  rankin i am glad to be of service to your leddyship you will be wishing to have some tea after your journey im thinking  lady cicely thoughtful man that you are mr rankin but weve had some already on board the yacht and ive arranged everything with your servants so you must go on gardening just as if we were not here  sir howard i am sorry to have to warn you mr rankin that lady cicely from travelling in africa has acquired a habit of walking into peoples houses and behaving as if she were in her own  lady cicely but my dear howard i assure you the natives like it  rankin gallantly so do i  lady cicely delighted oh that is so nice of you mr rankin this is a delicious country and the people seem so good they have such nice faces we had such a handsome moor to carry our luggage up and two perfect pets of krooboys did you notice their faces howard  sir howard i did and i can confidently say after a long experience of faces of the worst type looking at me from the dock that i have never seen so entirely villainous a trio as that moor and the two krooboys to whom you gave five dollars when they would have been perfectly satisfied with one  rankin throwing up his hands five dollars tis easy to see you are not scotch my leddy  lady cicely oh poor things they must want it more than we do and you know howard that mahometans never spend money in drink  rankin excuse me a moment my leddy i have a word in season to say to that same moor he goes into the house  lady cicely walking about the garden looking at the view and at the flowers i think this is a perfectly heavenly place  drinkwater returns from the house with a chair  drinkwater placing the chair for sir howard awskink yr pawdn for the libbety sr ahrd  sir howard looking a him i have seen you before somewhere  drinkwater you ev sr ahrd but aw do assure yer it were hall a mistike  sir howard as usual he sits down wrongfully convicted of course  drinkwater with sly delight naow gavner half whispering with an ineffable grin wrorngfully hacquittid  sir howard indeed thats the first case of the kind i have ever met  drinkwater lawd sr ahrd wot jagginses them jurymen was you an me knaowed it too didnt we  sir howard i daresay we did i am sorry to say i forget the exact nature of the difficulty you were in can you refresh my memory  drinkwater owny the aw sperrits o youth y lawdship worterleoo rowd kice wot they calls ooliganism  sir howard oh you were a hooligan were you  lady cicely puzzled a hooligan  drinkwater deprecatingly nime giv huz pore thortless leds baw a gent on the dily chrornicle lidy rankin returns drinkwater immediately withdraws stopping the missionary for a moment near the threshold to say touching his forelock awll eng abaht within ile gavner hin kice aw should be wornted he goes into the house with soft steps  lady cicely sits down on the bench under the tamarisk rankin takes his stool from the flowerbed and sits down on her left sir howard being on her right  lady cicely what a pleasant face your sailor friend has mr rankin he has been so frank and truthful with us you know i dont think anybody can pay me a greater compliment than to be quite sincere with me at first sight its the perfection of natural good manners  sir howard you must not suppose mr rankin that my sisterinlaw talks nonsense on purpose she will continue to believe in your friend until he steals her watch and even then she will find excuses for him  rankin drily changing the subject and how have ye been sir howrrd since our last meeting that morning nigh forty year ago down at the docks in london  sir howard greatly surprised pulling himself together our last meeting mr rankin have i been unfortunate enough to forget an old acquaintance  rankin well perhaps hardly an acquaintance sir howrrd but i was a close friend of your brother miles and when he sailed for brazil i was one of the little party that saw him off you were one of the party also if im not mistaken i took particular notice of you because you were miless brother and i had never seen ye before but ye had no call to take notice of me  sir howard reflecting yes there was a young friend of my brothers who might well be you but the name as i recollect it was leslie  rankin that was me sir my name is leslie rankin and your brother and i were always miles and leslie to one another  sir howard pluming himself a little ah that explains it i can trust my memory still mr rankin though some people do complain that i am growing old  rankin and where may miles be now sir howard  sir howard abruptly dont you know that he is dead  rankin much shocked never haird of it dear dear i shall never see him again and i can scarcely bring his face to mind after all these years with moistening eyes which at once touch lady cicelys sympathy im right sorryright sorry  sir howard decorously subduing his voice yes he did not live long indeed he never came back to england it must be nearly thirty years ago now that he died in the west indies on his property there  rankin surprised his proaperty miles with a proaperty  sir howard yes he became a planter and did well out there mr rankin the history of that property is a very curious and interesting oneat least it is so to a lawyer like myself  rankin i should be glad to hear it for miless sake though i am no lawyer sir howrrd  lady cicely i never knew you had a brother howard  sir howard not pleased by this remark perhaps because you never asked me turning more blandly to rankin i will tell you the story mr rankin when miles died he left an estate in one of the west indian islands it was in charge of an agent who was a sharpish fellow with all his wits about him now sir that man did a thing which probably could hardly be done with impunity even here in morocco under the most barbarous of surviving civilizations he quite simply took the estate for himself and kept it  rankin but how about the law  sir howard the law sir in that island consisted practically of the attorney general and the solicitor general and these gentlemen were both retained by the agent consequently there was no solicitor in the island to take up the case against him  rankin is such a thing possible today in the british empire  sir howard calmly oh quite quite  lady cicely but could not a firstrate solicitor have been sent out from london  sir howard no doubt by paying him enough to compensate him for giving up his london practice that is rather more than there was any reasonable likelihood of the estate proving worth  rankin then the estate was lost  sir howard not permanently it is in my hands at present  rankin then how did ye get it back  sir howard with crafty enjoyment of his own cunning by hoisting the rogue with his own petard i had to leave matters as they were for many years for i had my own position in the world to make but at last i made it in the course of a holiday trip to the west indies i found that this dishonest agent had left the island and placed the estate in the hands of an agent of his own whom he was foolish enough to pay very badly i put the case before that agent and he decided to treat the estate as my property the robber now found himself in exactly the same position he had formerly forced me into nobody in the island would act against me least of all the attorney and solicitor general who appreciated my influence at the colonial office and so i got the estate back the mills of the gods grind slowly mr rankin but they grind exceeding small  lady cicely now i suppose if id done such a clever thing in england youd have sent me to prison  sir howard probably unless you had taken care to keep outside the law against conspiracy whenever you wish to do anything against the law cicely always consult a good solicitor first  lady cicely so i do but suppose your agent takes it into his head to give the estate back to his wicked old employer  sir howard i heartily wish he would  rankin openeyed you wish he would  sir howard yes a few years ago the collapse of the west indian sugar industry converted the income of the estate into an annual loss of about 150 pounds a year if i cant sell it soon i shall simply abandon itunless you mr rankin would like to take it as a present  rankin laughing i thank your lordship we have estates enough of that sort in scotland youre setting with your back to the sun leddy ceecily and losing something worth looking at see there he rises and points seaward where the rapid twilight of the latitude has begun  lady cicely getting up to look and uttering a cry of admiration oh how lovely  sir howard also rising what are those hills over there to the southeast  rankin they are the outposts so to speak of the atlas mountains  lady cicely the atlas mountains where shelleys witch lived well make an excursion to them tomorrow howard  rankin thats impoassible my leddy the natives are verra dangerous  lady cicely why has any explorer been shooting them  rankin no but every man of them believes he will go to heaven if he kills an unbeliever  lady cicely bless you dear mr rankin the people in england believe that they will go to heaven if they give all their property to the poor but they dont do it im not a bit afraid of that  rankin but they are not accustomed to see women going about unveiled  lady cicely i always get on best with people when they can see my face  sir howard cicely you are talking great nonsense and you know it these people have no laws to restrain them which means in plain english that they are habitual thieves and murderers  rankin nay nay not exactly that  lady cicely indignantly of course not you always think howard that nothing prevents people killing each other but the fear of your hanging them for it but what nonsense that is and how wicked if these people werent here for some good purpose they wouldnt have been made would they mr rankin  rankin that is a point certainly leddy ceecily  sir howard oh if you are going to talk theology  lady cicely well why not theology is as respectable as law i should think besides im only talking commonsense why do people get killed by savages because instead of being polite to them and saying howdyedo like me people aim pistols at them ive been among savagescannibals and all sorts everybody said theyd kill me but when i met them i said howdyedo and they were quite nice the kings always wanted to marry me  sir howard that does not seem to me to make you any safer here cicely you shall certainly not stir a step beyond the protection of the consul if i can help it without a strong escort  lady cicely i dont want an escort  sir howard i do and i suppose you will expect me to accompany you  rankin tis not safe leddy ceecily really and truly tis not safe the tribes are verra fierce and there are cities here that no christian has ever set foot in if you go without being well protected the first chief you meet well seize you and send you back again to prevent his followers murdering you  lady cicely oh how nice of him mr rankin  rankin he would not do it for your sake leddy ceecily but for his own the sultan would get into trouble with england if you were killed and the sultan would kill the chief to pacify the english government  lady cicely but i always go everywhere i know the people here wont touch me they have such nice faces and such pretty scenery  sir howard to rankin sitting down again resignedly you can imagine how much use there is in talking to a woman who admires the faces of the ruffians who infest these ports mr rankin can anything be done in the way of an escort  rankin there is a certain captain brassbound here who trades along the coast and occasionally escorts parties of merchants on journeys into the interior i understand that he served under gordon in the soudan  sir howard that sounds promising but i should like to know a little more about him before i trust myself in his hands  rankin i quite agree with you sir howrrd ill send felix drinkwotter for him he claps his hands an arab boy appears at the house door muley is sailor man here muley nods tell sailor man bring captain muley nods and goes  sir howard who is drinkwater  rankin his agent or mate i dont rightly know which  lady cicely oh if he has a mate named felix drinkwater it must be quite a respectable crew it is such a nice name  rankin you saw him here just now he is a convert of mine  lady cicely delighted that nice truthful sailor  sir howard horrified what the hooligan  rankin puzzled hooligan no my lord he is an englishman  sir howard my dear mr rankin this man was tried before me on a charge of street ruffianism  rankin so he told me he was badly broat up i am afraid but he is now a converted man  lady cicely of course he is his telling you so frankly proves it you know really howard all those poor people whom you try are more sinned against than sinning if you would only talk to them in a friendly way instead of passing cruel sentences on them you would find them quite nice to you indignantly i wont have this poor man trampled on merely because his mother brought him up as a hooligan i am sure nobody could be nicer than he was when he spoke to us  sir howard in short we are to have an escort of hooligans commanded by a filibuster very well very well you will most likely admire all their faces and i have no doubt at all that they will admire yours  drinkwater comes from the house with an italian dressed in a much worn suit of blue serge a dilapidated alpine hat and boots laced with scraps of twine he remains near the door whilst drinkwater comes forward between sir howard and lady cicely  drinkwater yr honors servant to the italian mawtzow is lawdship sr ahrd ellam marzo touches his hat er lidyship lidy winefleet marzo touches his hat hawtellian shipmite lidy hahr chef  lady cicely nodding affably to marzo

brarsbahnds respects to yr honors an e awites yr commawnds  rankin shall we go indoors to see him  sir howard i think we had better have a look at him by daylight  rankin then we must lose no time the dark is soon down in this latitude to drinkwater will ye ask him to step out here to us mr drinkwotter  drinkwater rawt you aw gavner he goes officiously into the house  lady cicely and rankin sit down as before to receive the captain the light is by this time waning rapidly the darkness creeping west into the orange crimson  lady cicely whispering dont you feel rather creepy mr rankin i wonder what hell be like  rankin i misdoubt me he will not answer your leddyship  there is a scuffling noise in the house and drinkwater shoots out through the doorway across the garden with every appearance of having been violently kicked marzo immediately hurries down the garden on sir howards right out of the neighborhood of the doorway  drinkwater trying to put a cheerful air on much mortification and bodily anguish narsty step to thet ere door tripped me hap it did raising his voice and narrowly escaping a squeak of pain kepn brarsbahnd he gets as far from the house as possible on rankins left rankin rises to receive his guest  an olive complexioned man with dark southern eyes and hair comes from the house age about 36 handsome features but joyless dark eyebrows drawn towards one another mouth set grimly nostrils large and strained a face set to one tragic purpose a man of few words fewer gestures and much significance on the whole interesting and even attractive but not friendly he stands for a moment saturnine in the ruddy light to see who is present looking in a singular and rather deadly way at sir howard then with some surprise and uneasiness at lady cicely finally he comes down into the middle of the garden and confronts rankin who has been glaring at him in consternation from the moment of his entrance and continues to do so in so marked a way that the glow in brassbounds eyes deepens as he begins to take offence  brassbound well sir have you stared your fill at me  rankin recovering himself with a start i ask your pardon for my bad manners captain brassbound ye are extraordinair lek an auld college friend of mine whose face i said not ten minutes gone that i could no longer bring to mind it was as if he had come from the grave to remind me of it  brassbound why have you sent for me  rankin we have a matter of business with ye captain  brassbound who are we  rankin this is sir howrrd hallam who will be well known to ye as one of her majestys judges  brassbound turning the singular look again on sir howard the friend of the widow the protector of the fatherless  sir howard startled i did not know i was so favorably spoken of in these parts captain brassbound we want an escort for a trip into the mountains  brassbound ignoring this announcement who is the lady  rankin lady ceecily waynflete his lordships sisterinlaw  lady cicely howdyedo captain brassbound he bows gravely  sir howard a little impatient of these questions which strike him as somewhat impertinent let us come to business if you please we are thinking of making a short excursion to see the country about here can you provide us with an escort of respectable trustworthy men  brassbound no  drinkwater in strong remonstrance nah nah nah nah look eah kepn

where you can put up as long as you please the customary charge is half a dollar a man per day and his food i charge double  sir howard i suppose you answer for your men being sturdy fellows who will stand to their guns if necessary  brassbound i can answer for their being more afraid of me than of the moors  lady cicely that doesnt matter in the least howard the important thing captain brassbound is first that we should have as few men as possible because men give such a lot of trouble travelling and then they must have good lungs and not be always catching cold above all their clothes must be of good wearing material otherwise i shall be nursing and stitching and mending all the way and it will be trouble enough i assure you to keep them washed and fed without that  brassbound haughtily my men madam are not children in the nursery  lady cicely with unanswerable conviction captain brassbound all men are children in the nursery i see that you dont notice things that poor italian had only one proper bootlace the other was a bit of string and i am sure from mr drinkwaters complexion that he ought to have some medicine  brassbound outwardly determined not to be trifled with inwardly puzzled and rather daunted madam if you want an escort i can provide you with an escort if you want a sunday school treat i can not provide it  lady cicely with sweet melancholy ah dont you wish you could captain oh if i could only show you my children from waynflete sunday school the darlings would love this place with all the camels and black men im sure you would enjoy having them here captain brassbound and it would be such an education for your men brassbound stares at her with drying lips  sir howard cicely when you have quite done talking nonsense to captain brassbound we can proceed to make some definite arrangement with him  lady cicely but its arranged already well start at eight oclock tomorrow morning if you please captain never mind about the italian i have a big box of clothes with me for my brother in rome and there are some bootlaces in it now go home to bed and dont fuss yourself all you have to do is to bring your men round and ill see to the rest men are always so nervous about moving goodnight she offers him her hand surprised he pulls off his cap for the first time some scruple prevents him from taking her hand at once he hesitates then turns to sir howard and addresses him with warning earnestness  brassbound sir howard hallam i advise you not to attempt this expedition  sir howard indeed why  brassbound you are safe here i warn you in those hills there is a justice that is not the justice of your courts in england if you have wronged a man you may meet that man there if you have wronged a woman you may meet her son there the justice of those hills is the justice of vengeance  sir howard faintly amused you are superstitious captain most sailors are i notice however i have complete confidence in your escort  brassbound almost threateningly take care the avenger may be one of the escort  sir howard i have already met the only member of your escort who might have borne a grudge against me captain and he was acquitted  brassbound you are fated to come then  sir howard smiling it seems so  brassbound on your head be it to lady cicely accepting her hand at last goodnight  he goes it is by this time starry night     act ii  midday a roam in a moorish castle a divan seat runs round the dilapidated adobe walls which are partly painted partly faced with white tiles patterned in green and yellow the ceiling is made up of little squares painted in bright colors with gilded edges and ornamented with gilt knobs on the cement floor are mattings sheepskins and leathern cushions with geometrical patterns on them there is a tiny moorish table in the middle and at it a huge saddle with saddle cloths of various colors showing that the room is used by foreigners accustomed to chairs anyone sitting at the table in this seat would have the chief entrance a large horseshoe arch on his left and another saddle seat between him and the arch whilst if susceptible to draughts he would probably catch cold from a little moorish door in the wall behind him to his right  two or three of brassbounds men overcome by the midday heat sprawl supine on the floor with their reefer coats under their heads their knees uplifted and their calves laid comfortably on the divan those who wear shirts have them open at the throat for greater coolness some have jerseys all wear boots and belts and have guns ready to their hands one of them lying with his head against the second saddle seat wears what was once a fashionable white english yachting suit he is evidently a pleasantly worthless young english gentleman gone to the bad but retaining sufficient selfrespect to shave carefully and brush his hair which is wearing thin and does not seem to have been luxuriant even in its best days  the silence is broken only by the snores of the young gentleman whose mouth has fallen open until a few distant shots half waken him he shuts his mouth convulsively and opens his eyes sleepily a door is violently kicked outside and the voice of drinkwater is heard raising urgent alarm  drinkwater wot ow wike ap there will yr wike ap he rushes in through the horseshoe arch hot and excited and runs round kicking the sleepers nah then git ap

torments for which he is conscious of having eminently qualified himself has his coat off and a bandage round his chest one of his supporters is a blackbearded thickset slow middleaged man with an air of damaged respectability namedas it afterwards appearsjohnson lady cicely walks beside marzo redbrook a little shamefaced crosses the room to the opposite wall as far away as possible from the

throws it on the table standing at his ease in his blue jersey  sir howard after a momentary flush of anger with a controlled force that compels brassbounds attention in spite of himself you seem to be in a strong position with reference to these men of yours  brassbound i am in a strong position with reference to everyone in this castle  sir howard politely but threateningly i have just been noticing that you think so i do not agree with you her majestys government captain brassbound has a strong arm and a long arm if anything disagreeable happens to me or to my sisterinlaw that arm will be stretched out if that happens you will not be in a strong position excuse my reminding you of it  brassbound grimly much good may it do you johnson comes in through the arch where is osman the sheikhs messenger i want him too  johnson coming captain he had a prayer to finish  osman a tall skinny whiteclad elderly moor appears in the archway  brassbound osman ali osman comes forward between brassbound and johnson you have seen this unbeliever indicating sir howard come in with us  osman yea and the shameless one with the naked face who flattered my countenance and offered me her hand  johnson yes and you took it too johnny didnt you  brassbound take horse then and ride fast to your master the sheikh sidi el assif  osman proudly kinsman to the prophet  brassbound tell him what you have seen here that is all johnson give him a dollar and note the hour of his going that his master may know how fast he rides  osman the believers word shall prevail with allah and his servant sidi el assif  brassbound off with you  osman make good thy masters word ere i go out from his presence o johnson el hull  johnson he wants the dollar  brassbound gives osman a coin  osman bowing allah will make hell easy for the friend of sidi el assif and his servant he goes out through the arch  brassbound to johnson keep the men out of this until the sheikh comes i have business to talk over when he does come we must keep together all sidi el assifs natural instinct will be to cut every christian throat here  johnson we look to you captain to square him since you invited him over  brassbound you can depend on me and you know it i think  johnson phlegmatically yes we know it he is going out when sir howard speaks  sir howard you know also mr johnson i hope that you can depend on me  johnson turning on you sir  sir howard yes on me if my throat is cut the sultan of morocco may send sidis head with a hundred thousand dollars bloodmoney to the colonial office but it will not be enough to save his kingdomany more than it would saw your life if your captain here did the same thing  johnson struck is that so captain  brassbound i know the gentlemans valuebetter perhaps than he knows it himself i shall not lose sight of it  johnson nods gravely and is going out when lady cicely returns softly by the little door and calls to him in a whisper she has taken off her travelling things and put on an apron at her chatelaine is a case of sewing materials  lady cicely mr johnson he turns ive got marzo to sleep would you mind asking the gentlemen not to make a noise under his window in the courtyard  johnson right maam he goes out  lady cicely sits down at the tiny table and begins stitching at a sling bandage for marzos arm brassbound walks up and down on her right muttering to himself so ominously that sir howard quietly gets out of his way by crossing to the other side and sitting down on the second saddle seat  sir howard are you yet able to attend to me for a moment captain brassbound  brassbound still walking about what do you want  sir howard well i am afraid i want a little privacy and if you will allow me to say so a little civility i am greatly obliged to you for bringing us safely off today when we were attacked so far you have carried out your contract but since we have been your guests here your tone and that of the worst of your men has changedintentionally changed i think  brassbound stopping abruptly and flinging the announcement at him you are not my guest you are my prisoner  sir howard prisoner  lady cicely after a single glance up continues stitching apparently quite unconcerned  brassbound i warned you you should have taken my warning  sir howard immediately taking the tone of cold disgust for moral delinquency am i to understand then that you are a brigand is this a matter of ransom  brassbound with unaccountable intensity all the wealth of england shall not ransom you  sir howard then what do you expect to gain by this  brassbound justice on a thief and a murderer  lady cicely lays down her work and looks up anxiously  sir howard deeply outraged rising with venerable dignity sir do you apply those terms to me  brassbound i do he turns to lady cicely and adds pointing contemptuously to sir howard look at him you would not take this virtuously indignant gentleman for the uncle of a brigand would you  sir howard starts the shock is too much for him he sits down again looking very old and his hands tremble but his eyes and mouth are intrepid resolute and angry  lady cicely uncle what do you mean  brassbound has he never told you about my mother this fellow who puts on ermine and scarlet and calls himself justice  sir howard almost voiceless you are the son of that woman  brassbound fiercely that woman he makes a movement as if to rush at sir howard  lady cicely rising quickly and putting her hand on his arm take care you mustnt strike an old man  brassbound raging he did not spare my motherthat woman he calls herbecause of her sex i will not spare him because of his age lowering his tone to one of sullen vindictiveness but i am not going to strike him lady cicely releases him and sits down much perplexed brassbound continues with an evil glance at sir howard i shall do no more than justice  sir howard recovering his voice and vigor justice i think you mean vengeance disguised as justice by your passions  brassbound to many and many a poor wretch in the dock you have brought vengeance in that disguisethe vengeance of society disguised as justice by its passions now the justice you have outraged meets you disguised as vengeance how do you like it  sir howard i shall meet it i trust as becomes an innocent man and an upright judge what do you charge against me  brassbound i charge you with the death of my mother and the theft of my inheritance  sir howard as to your inheritance sir it was yours whenever you came forward to claim it three minutes ago i did not know of your existence i affirm that most solemnly i never knewnever dreamtthat my brother miles left a son as to your mother her case was a hard oneperhaps the hardest that has come within even my experience i mentioned it as such to mr rankin the missionary the evening we met you as to her death you knowyou must knowthat she died in her native country years after our last meeting perhaps you were too young to know that she could hardly have expected to live long  brassbound you mean that she drank  sir howard i did not say so i do not think she was always accountable for what she did  brassbound yes she was mad too and whether drink drove her to madness or madness drove her to drink matters little the question is who drove her to both  sir howard i presume the dishonest agent who seized her estate did i repeat it was a hard casea frightful injustice but it could not be remedied  brassbound you told her so when she would not take that false answer you drove her from your doors when she exposed you in the street and threatened to take with her own hands the redress the law denied her you had her imprisoned and forced her to write you an apology and leave the country to regain her liberty and save herself from a lunatic asylum and when she was gone and dead and forgotten you found for yourself the remedy you could not find for her you recovered the estate easily enough then robber and rascal that you are did he tell the missionary that lady cicely eh  lady cicely sympathetically poor woman to sir howard couldnt you have helped her howard  sir howard no this man may be ignorant enough to suppose that when i was a struggling barrister i could do everything i did when i was attorney general you know better there is some excuse for his mother she was an uneducated brazilian knowing nothing of english society and driven mad by injustice  brassbound your defence  sir howard interrupting him determinedly i do not defend myself i call on you to obey the law  brassbound i intend to do so the law of the atlas mountains is administered by the sheikh sidi el assif he will be here within an hour he is a judge like yourself you can talk law to him he will give you both the law and the prophets  sir howard does he know what the power of england is  brassbound he knows that the mahdi killed my master gordon and that the mahdi died in his bed and went to paradise  sir howard then he knows also that englands vengeance was on the mahdis track  brassbound ay on the track of the railway from the cape to cairo who are you that a nation should go to war for you if you are missing what will your newspapers say a foolhardy tourist what will your learned friends at the bar say that it was time for you to make room for younger and better men you a national hero you had better find a goldfield in the atlas mountains then all the governments of europe will rush to your rescue until then take care of yourself for you are going to see at last the hypocrisy in the sanctimonious speech of the judge who is sentencing you instead of the despair in the white face of the wretch you are recommending to the mercy of your god  sir howard deeply and personally offended by this slight to his profession and for the first time throwing away his assumed dignity and rising to approach brassbound with his fists clenched so that lady cicely lifts one eye from her work to assure herself that the table is between them i have no more to say to you sir i am not afraid of you nor of any bandit with whom you may be in league as to your property it is ready for you as soon as you come to your senses and claim it as your fathers heir commit a crime and you will become an outlaw and not only lose the property but shut the doors of civilization against yourself for ever  brassbound i will not sell my mothers revenge for ten properties  lady cicely placidly besides really howard as the property now costs 150 pounds a year to keep up instead of bringing in anything i am afraid it would not be of much use to him brassbound stands amazed at this revelation  sir howard taken aback i must say cicely i think you might have chosen a more suitable moment to mention that fact  brassbound with disgust agh trickster lawyer even the price you offer for your life is to be paid in false coin calling hallo there johnson redbrook some of you there to sir howard you ask for a little privacy you shall have it i will not endure the company of such a fellow  sir howard very angry and full of the crustiest pluck you insult me sir you are a rascal you are a rascal  johnson redbrook and a few others come in through the arch  brassbound take this man away  johnson where are we to put him  brassbound put him where you please so long as you can find him when he is wanted  sir howard you will be laid by the heels yet my friend  redbrook with cheerful tact tut tut sir howard whats the use of talking back come along well make you comfortable  sir howard goes out through the arch between johnson and redbrook muttering wrathfully the rest except brassbound and lady cicely follow  brassbound walks up and down the room nursing his indignation in doing so he unconsciously enters upon an unequal contest with lady cicely who sits quietly stitching it soon becomes clear that a tranquil woman can go on sewing longer than an angry man can go on fuming further it begins to dawn on brassbounds wrathblurred perception that lady cicely has at some unnoticed stage in the proceedings finished marzos bandage and is now stitching a coat he stops glances at his shirtsleeves finally realizes the situation  brassbound what are you doing there madam  lady cicely mending your coat captain brassbound  brassbound i have no recollection of asking you to take that trouble  lady cicely no i dont suppose you even knew it was torn some men are born untidy you cannot very well receive sidi elwhats his namewith your sleeve half out  brassbound disconcerted ii dont know how it got torn  lady cicely you should not get virtuously indignant with people it bursts clothes more than anything else mr hallam  brassbound flushing quickly i beg you will not call me mr hallam i hate the name  lady cicely black paquito is your pet name isnt it  brassbound huffily i am not usually called so to my face  lady cicely turning the coat a little im so sorry she takes another piece of thread and puts it into her needle looking placidly and reflectively upward meanwhile do you know you are wonderfully like your uncle  brassbound damnation  lady cicely eh  brassbound if i thought my veins contained a drop of his black blood i would drain them empty with my knife i have no relations i had a mother that was all  lady cicely unconvinced i daresay you have your mothers complexion but didnt you notice sir howards temper his doggedness his high spirit above all his belief in ruling people by force as you rule your men and in revenge and punishment just as you want to revenge your mother didnt you recognize yourself in that  brassbound startled myselfin that  lady cecily returning to the tailoring question as if her last remark were of no consequence whatever did this sleeve catch you at all under the arm perhaps i had better make it a little easier for you  brassbound irritably let my coat alone it will do very well as it is put it down  lady cicily oh dont ask me to sit doing nothing it bores me so  brassbound in heavens name then do what you like only dont worry me with it  lady cicely im so sorry all the hallams are irritable  brassbound penning up his fury with difficulty as i have already said that remark has no application to me  lady cicely resuming her stitching thats so funny they all hate to be told that they are like one another  brassbound with the beginnings of despair in his voice why did you come here my trap was laid for him not for you do you know the danger you are in  lady cicely theres always a danger of something or other do you think its worth bothering about  brassbound scolding her do i think do you think my coats worth mending  lady cicely prosaically oh yes its not so far gone as that  brassbound have you any feeling or are you a fool  lady cicely im afraid im a dreadful fool but i cant help it i was made so i suppose  brassbound perhaps you dont realize that your friend my good uncle will be pretty fortunate if he is allowed to live out his life as a slave with a set of chains on him  lady cicely oh i dont know about that mr hi mean captain brassbound men are always thinking that they are going to do something grandly wicked to their enemies but when it comes to the point really bad men are just as rare as really good ones  brassbound you forget that i am like my uncle according to you have you any doubt as to the reality of his badness  lady cicely bless me your uncle howard is one of the most harmless of menmuch nicer than most professional people of course he does dreadful things as a judge but then if you take a man and pay him 5000 pounds a year to be wicked and praise him for it and have policemen and courts and laws and juries to drive him into it so that he cant help doing it what can you expect sir howards all right when hes left to himself we caught a burglar one night at waynflete when he was staying with us and i insisted on his locking the poor man up until the police came in a room with a window opening on the lawn the man came back next day and said he must return to a life of crime unless i gave him a job in the garden and i did it was much more sensible than giving him ten years penal servitude howard admitted it so you see hes not a bit bad really  brassbound he had a fellow feeling for a thief knowing he was a thief himself do you forget that he sent my mother to prison  lady cicely softly were you very fond of your poor mother and always very good to her  brassbound rather taken aback i was not worse than other sons i suppose  lady cicely opening her eyes very widely oh was that all  brassbound exculpating himself full of gloomy remembrances you dont understand it was not always possible to be very tender with my mother she had unfortunately a very violent temper and sheshe  lady cicely yes so you told howard with genuine pity for him you must have had a very unhappy childhood  brassbound grimily hell that was what my childhood was hell  lady cicely do you think she would really have killed howard as she threatened if he hadnt sent her to prison  brassbound breaking out again with a growing sense of being morally trapped what if she did why did he rob her why did he not help her to get the estate as he got it for himself afterwards  lady cicely he says he couldnt you know but perhaps the real reason was that he didnt like her you know dont you that if you dont like people you think of all the reasons for not helping them and if you like them you think of all the opposite reasons  brassbound but his duty as a brother  lady cicely are you going to do your duty as a nephew  brassbound dont quibble with me i am going to do my duty as a son and you know it  lady cicely but i should have thought that the time for that was in your mothers lifetime when you could have been kind and forbearing with her hurting your uncle wont do her any good you know  brassbound it will teach other scoundrels to respect widows and orphans do you forget that there is such a thing as justice  lady cicely gaily shaking out the finished coat oh if you are going to dress yourself in ermine and call yourself justice i give you up you are just your uncle over again only he gets £5000 a year for it and you do it for nothing  she holds the coat up to see whether any further repairs are needed  brassbound sulkily you twist my words very cleverly but no man or woman has ever changed me  lady cicely dear me that must be very nice for the people you deal with because they can always depend on you but isnt it rather inconvenient for yourself when you change your mind  brassbound i never change my mind  lady cicely rising with the coat in her hands oh oh nothing will ever persuade me that you are as pigheaded as that  brassbound offended pigheaded  lady cicely with quick caressing apology no no no i didnt mean that firm unalterable resolute ironwilled stonewall jackson thats the idea isnt it  brassbound hopelessly you are laughing at me  lady cicely no trembling i assure you now will you try this on for me im so afraid i have made it too tight under the arm she holds it behind him  brassbound obeying mechanically you take me for a fool i think he misses the sleeve  lady cicely no all men look foolish when they are feeling for their sleeves  brassbound agh he turns and snatches the coat from her then puts it on himself and buttons the lowest button  lady cicely horrified stop no you must never pull a coat at the skirts captain brassbound it spoils the sit of it allow me she pulls the lappels of his coat vigorously forward put back your shoulders he frowns but obeys thats better she buttons the top button now button the rest from the top down does it catch you at all under the arm  brassbound miserablyall resistance beaten out of him no  lady cicely thats right now before i go back to poor marzo say thank you to me for mending your jacket like a nice polite sailor  brassbound sitting down at the table in great agitation damn you you have belittled my whole life to me he bows his head on his hands convulsed  lady cicely quite understanding and putting her hand kindly on his shoulder oh no i am sure you have done lots of kind things and brave things if you could only recollect them with gordon for instance nobody can belittle that  he looks up at her for a moment then kisses her hand she presses his and turns away with her eyes so wet that she sees drinkwater coming in through the arch just then with a prismatic halo round him even when she sees him clearly she hardly recognizes him for he is ludicrously clean and smoothly brushed and his hair formerly mud color is now a lively red  drinkwater look eah kepn brassbound springs up and recovers himself quickly eahs the bloomin shike jest appeahd on the orawzn wiv abaht fifty men thyll be eah insawd o ten minnits they will  lady cicely the sheikh  brassbound sidi el assif and fifty men to

true believersno christians you understand  lady cicely then why did you take us  brassbound i took my uncle on purposeand sent word to sidi that he was here  lady cicely well thats a pretty kettle of fish isnt it  brassbound i will do what i can to save himand you but i fear my repentance has come too late as repentance usually does  lady cicely cheerfully well i must go and look after marzo at all events she goes out through the little door johnson redbrook and the rest come in through the arch with sir howard still very crusty and determined he keeps close to johnson who comes to

hallam you have one chance left the cadi of kintafi stands superior to the sheikh as the responsible governor of the whole province it is the cadi who will be sacrificed by the sultan if england demands satisfaction for any injury to you if we can hold the sheikh in parley until the cadi arrives you may frighten the cadi into forcing the sheikh to release you the cadis coming is a lucky chance for you  sir howard if it were a real chance you would not tell me of it dont try to play cat and mouse with me man  drinkwater aside to sir howard as brassbound turns contemptuously away to the other side of the room it ynt mach of a chawnst sr ahrd but if there was a ganbowt in mogador awbr awd put a bit on it aw would  johnson redbrook and the others return rather mistrustfully ushering in sidi el assif attended by osman and a troop of arabs brassbounds men keep together on the archway side backing their captain sidis followers cross the room behind the table and assemble near sir howard who stands his ground drinkwater runs across to brassbound and stands at his elbow as he turns to face sidi  sidi el aasif clad in spotless white is a nobly handsome arab hardly thirty with fine eyes bronzed complexion and instinctively dignified carriage he places himself between the two groups with osman in attendance at his right hand  osman pointing out sir howard this is the infidel cadi sir howard bows to sidi but being an infidel receives only the haughtiest stare in acknowledgement this pointing to brassbound is brassbound the franguestani captain the servant of sidi

drinkwater has his other arm redbrook hastens to relieve lady cicely of marzo taking him into the group behind brassbound lady cicely comes forward between brassbound and the sheikh to whom she turns affably  lady cicely proffering her hand sidi el assif isnt it how dye do he recoils blushing somewhat  osman scandalized woman touch not the kinsman of the prophet  lady cicely oh i see im being

oldest and most attached retainer osman be sure you choose me a good horse and get a nice strong camel for my luggage  osman after a moment of stupefaction hurries out lady cicely puts on her hat and pins it to her hair the sheikh gazing at her during the process with timid admiration  drinkwater chuckling shell mawch em all to church next sunder lawk a bloomin lot o cherrity kids you see if she

all turn apprehensively to the arch osman rushes in  osman the cadi the cadi he is in anger his men are upon us defend  the cadi a vigorous fatfeatured choleric whitehaired and bearded elder rushes in cudgel in hand with an overwhelming retinue and silences osman with a sounding thwack in a moment the back of the room is crowded with his followers the sheikh retreats a little towards his men and the cadi comes impetuously forward between him and lady cicely  the cadi now woe upon thee sidi el assif thou child of mischief  sidi sternly am i a dog muley othman that thou speakest thus to me  the

worterleoo buses they are on this cowst  brassbound folds up the letter looking glum  sir howard sharply well sir are we not to have the benefit of that letter your men are waiting to hear it i think

movement to defend themselves seize them  lady cicely oh please dont fight brassbound seeing that his men are hopelessly outnumbered makes no resistance they are made prisoners by the cadis followers  sidi attempting to draw his scimitar the woman is mine i will not forego her he is seized and overpowered after a homeric struggle  sir howard drily i told you you were not in a strong position captain brassbound looking implacably at him you are laid by the heels my friend as i said you would be  lady cicely but i assure you  brassbound interrupting her what have you to assure him of you persuaded me to spare him look at his face will you be able to persuade him to spare me     act iii  torrid forenoon filtered through small moorish windows high up in the adobe walls of the largest room in leslie rankins house a clean cool room with the table a christian article set in the middle a presidentially elbowed chair behind it and an inkstand and paper ready for the sitter a couple of cheap american chairs right and left of the table facing the same way as the presidential chair give a judicial aspect to the arrangement rankin is placing a little tray with a jug and some glasses near the inkstand when lady cicelys voice is heard at the door which is behind him in the corner to his right  lade cicely good morning may i come in  rankin certainly she comes in to the nearest end of the table she has discarded all travelling equipment and is dressed exactly as she might be in surrey on a very hot day sit ye doon leddy ceecily  lady cicely sitting down how nice youve made the room for the inquiry  rankin doubtfully i could wish there were more chairs yon american captain will preside in this and that leaves but one for sir howrrd and one for your leddyship i could almost be tempted to call it a maircy that your friend that owns the yacht has sprained his ankle and cannot come i misdoubt me it will not look judeecial to have captain kearneys officers squatting on the floor  lady cicely oh they wont mind what about the prisoners  rankin they are to be broat here from the town gaol presently  lady cicely and where is that silly old cadi and my handsome sheikh sidi i must see them before the inquiryor theyll give captain kearney quite a false impression of what happened  rankin but ye cannot see them they decamped last night back to their castles in the atlas  lady cicely delighted no  rankin indeed and they did the poor cadi is so terrified by all he has haird of the destruction of the spanish fleet that he darent trust himself in the captains hands looking reproachfully at her on your journey back here ye seem to have frightened the poor man yourself leddy ceecily by talking to him about the fanatical chreestianity of the americans ye have largely yourself to thank if hes gone  lady cicely allah be praised what a weight off our minds mr rankin  rankin puzzled and why do ye not understand how necessary their evidence is  lady cicely their evidence it would spoil everything they would perjure themselves out of pure spite against poor captain brassbound  rankin amazed do ye call him poor captain brassbound does not your leddyship know that this brasshound isheaven forgive me for judging hima precious scoundrel did ye not hear what sir howrrd told me on the yacht last night  lady cicely all a mistake mr rankin all a mistake i assure you you said just now heaven forgive you for judging him well thats just what the whole quarrel is about captain brassbound is just like you he thinks we have no right to judge one another and its sir howard gets £5000 a year for doing nothing else but judging people he thinks poor captain brassbound a regular anarchist they quarreled dreadfully at the castle you mustnt mind what sir howard says about him you really mustnt  rankin but his conduct  lady cicely perfectly saintly mr rankin worthy of yourself in your best moments he forgave sir howard and did all he could to save him  rankin ye astoanish me leddy ceecily  lady cicely and think of the temptation to behave badly when he had us all there helpless  rankin the temptation ay thats true yere ower bonny to be cast away among a parcel o lone lawless men my leddy  lady cicely naively bless me thats quite true and i never thought of it oh after that you really must do all you can to help captain brassbound  rankin reservedly no i cannot say that leddy ceecily i doubt he has imposed on your good nature and sweet disposeetion i had a crack with the cadi as well as with sir howrrd and there is little question in my mind but that captain brassbound is no better than a breegand  lady cicely apparently deeply impressed i wonder whether he can be mr rankin if you think so thats heavily against him in my opinion because you have more knowledge of men than anyone else here perhaps im mistaken i only thought you might like to help him as the son of your old friend  rankin startled the son of my old friend what dye mean  lady cicely oh didnt sir howard tell you that why captain brassbound turns out to be sir howards nephew the son of the brother you knew  rankin overwhelmed i saw the likeness the night he came here its true its true uncle and nephew  lady cicely yes thats why they quarrelled so  rankin with a momentary sense of ill usage i think sir howrrd might have told me that  lady cicely of course he ought to have told you you see he only tells one side of the story that comes from his training as a barrister you mustnt think hes naturally deceitful if hed been brought up as a clergyman hed have told you the whole truth as a matter of course  rankin too much perturbed to dwell on his grievance leddy ceecily i must go to the prison and see the lad he may have been a bit wild but i cant leave poor miless son unbefriended in a foreign gaol  lady cicely rising radiant oh how good of you you have a real kind heart of gold mr rankin now before you go shall we just put our heads together and consider how to give miless son every chancei mean of course every chance that he ought to have  rankin rather addled i am so confused by this astoanishing news  lady cicely yes yes of course you are but dont you think he would make a better impression on the american captain if he were a little more respectably dressed  rankin mebbe but how can that be remedied here in mogador  lady cicely oh ive thought of that you know im going back to england by way of rome mr rankin and im bringing a portmanteau full of clothes for my brother there hes ambassador you know and has to be very particular as to what he wears i had the portmanteau brought here this morning now would you mind taking it to the prison and smartening up captain brassbound a little tell him he ought to do it to show his respect for me and he will it will be quite easy there are two krooboys waiting to carry the portmanteau you will i know you will she edges him to the door and do you think there is time to get him shaved  rankin succumbing half bewildered ill do my best  lady cicely i know you will as he is going out oh one word mr rankin he comes back the cadi didnt know that captain brassbound was sir howards nephew did he  rankin no  lady cicely then he must have misunderstood everything quite dreadfully im afraid mr rankinthough you know best of coursethat we are bound not to repeat anything at the inquiry that the cadi said he didnt know you see  rankin cannily i take your point leddy ceecily it alters the case i shall certainly make no allusion to it  lady cicely magnanimously well then i wont either there they shake hands on it sir howard comes in  sir howard good morning mr rankin i hope you got home safely from the yacht last night  rankin quite safe thank ye sir howrrd  lady cicely howard hes in a hurry dont make him stop to talk  sir howard very good very good he comes to the table and takes lady cicelys chair  rankin oo revoir leddy ceecily  lady cicely bless you mr rankin rankin goes out she comes to the other end of the table looking at sir howard with a troubled sorrowfully sympathetic air but unconsciously making her right hand stalk about the table on the tips of its fingers in a tentative stealthy way which would put sir howard on his guard if he were in a suspicious frame of mind which as it happens he is not im so sorry for you howard about this unfortunate inquiry  sir howard swinging round on his chair astonished sorry for me why  lady cicely it will look so dreadful your own nephew you know  sir howard cicely an english judge has no nephews no sons even when he has to carry out the law  lady cicely but then he oughtnt to have any property either people will never understand about the west indian estate theyll think youre the wicked uncle out of the babes in the wood with a fresh gush of compassion im so so sorry for you  sir howard rather stiffly i really do not see how i need your commiseration cicely the woman was an impossible person half mad half drunk do you understand what such a creature is when she has a grievance and imagines some innocent person to be the author of it  lady cicely with a touch of impatience oh quite thatll be made clear enough i can see it all in the papers already our half mad half drunk sisterinlaw making scenes with you in the street with the police called in and prison and all the rest of it the family will be furious sir howard quails she instantly follows up her advantage with think of papa  sir howard i shall expect lord waynflete to look at the matter as a reasonable man  lady cicely do you think hes so greatly changed as that howard  sir howard falling back on the fatalism of the depersonalized public man my dear cicely there is no use discussing the matter it cannot be helped however disagreeable it may be  lady cicely of course not thats whats so dreadful do you think people will understand  sir howard i really cannot say whether they do or not i cannot help it  lady cicely if you were anybody but a judge it wouldnt matter so much but a judge mustnt even be misunderstood despairingly oh its dreadful howard its terrible what would poor mary say if she were alive now  sir howard with emotion i dont think cicely that my dear wife would misunderstand me  lady cicely no shed know you mean well and when you came home and said mary ive just told all the world that your sisterinlaw was a police court criminal and that i sent her to prison and your nephew is a brigand and im sending him to prison shed have thought it must be all right because you did it but you dont think she would have liked it any more than papa and the rest of us do you  sir howard appalled but what am i to do do you ask me to compound a felony  lady cicely sternly certainly not i would not allow such a thing even if you were wicked enough to attempt it no what i say is that you ought not to tell the story yourself  sir howard why  lady cicely because everybody would say you are such a clever lawyer you could make a poor simple sailor like captain kearney believe anything the proper thing for you to do howard is to let me tell the exact truth then you can simply say that you are bound to confirm me nobody can blame you for that  sir howard looking suspiciously at her cicely you are up to some devilment  lady cicely promptly washing her hands of his interests oh very well tell the story yourself in your own clever way i only proposed to tell the exact truth you call that devilment so it is i daresay from a lawyers point of view  sir howard i hope youre not offended  lady cicely with the utmost goodhumor my dear howard not a bit of course youre right you know how these things ought to be done ill do exactly what you tell me and confirm everything you say  sir howard alarmed by the completeness of his victory oh my dear you mustnt act in my interest you must give your evidence with absolute impartiality she nods as if thoroughly impressed and reproved and gazes at him with the steadfast candor peculiar to liars who read novels his eyes turn to the ground and his brow clouds perplexedly he rises rubs his chin nervously with his forefinger and adds i think perhaps on reflection that there is something to be said for your proposal to relieve me of the very painful duty of telling what has occurred  ladi cicely holding off but youd do it so very much better  sir howard for that very reason perhaps it had better come from you  lady cicely reluctantly well if youd rather  sir howard but mind cicely the exact truth  lady cicely with conviction the exact truth they shake hands on it  sir howard holding her hand fiat justitia ruat coelum  lady cicely let justice be done though the ceiling fall  an american bluejacket appears at the door  bluejacket captain kearneys cawmpliments to lady waynflete and may he come in  lady cicely yes by all means where are the prisoners  bluejacket party gawn to the jail to fetch em marm  lady cicely thank you i should like to be told when they are coming if i might  bluejacket you shall so marm he stands aside saluting to admit his captain and goes out  captain hamlin kearney is a robustly built western american with the keen squeezed wind beaten eyes and obstinately enduring mouth of his profession a curious ethnological specimen with all the nations of the old world at war in his veins he is developing artificially in the direction of sleekness and culture under the restraints of an overwhelming dread of european criticism and climatically in the direction of the indiginous north american who is already in possession of his hair his cheekbones and the manlier instincts in him which the sea has rescued from civilization the world pondering on the great part of its own future which is in his hands contemplates him with wonder as to what the devil he will evolve into in another century or two meanwhile he presents himself to lady cicely as a blunt sailor who has something to say to her concerning her conduct which he wishes to put politely as becomes an officer addressing a lady but also with an emphatically implied rebuke as an american addressing an english person who has taken a liberty  lady cicely as he enters so glad youve come captain kearney  kearney coming between sir howard and lady cicely when we parted yesterday ahfternoon lady waynflete i was unaware that in the course of your visit to my ship you had entirely altered the sleeping arrangements of my stokers i thahnk you as captain of the ship i am customairily cawnsulted before the orders of english visitors are carried out but as your alterations appear to cawndooce to the comfort of the men i have not interfered with them  lady cicely how clever of you to find out i believe you know every bolt in that ship  kearney softens perceptibly  sir howard i am really very sorry that my sisterinlaw has taken so serious a liberty captain kearney it is a mania of herssimply a mania why did your men pay any attention to her  kearney with gravely dissembled humor well i ahsked that question too i said why did you obey that ladys orders instead of waiting for mine they said they didnt see exactly how they could refuse i ahsked whether they cawnsidered that discipline they said well sir will you talk to the lady yourself next time  lady cicely im so sorry but you know captain the one thing that one misses on board a manofwar is a woman  kearney we often feel that deprivation verry keenly lady waynflete  lady cicely my uncle is first lord of the admiralty and i am always telling him what a scandal it is that an english captain should be forbidden to take his wife on board to look after the ship  kearney stranger still lady waynflete he is not forbidden to take any other lady yours is an extraordinairy countryto an amerrican  lady cicely but its most serious captain the poor men go melancholy mad and ram each others ships and do all sorts of things  sir howard cicely i beg you will not talk nonsense to captain kearney your ideas on some subjects are really hardly decorous  lady cicely to kearney thats what english people are like captain kearney they wont hear of anything concerning you poor sailors except nelson and trafalgar you understand me dont you  kearney gallantly i cawnsider that you have more sense in your wedding ring finger than the british ahdmiralty has in its whole cawnstitootion lady waynflete  lady cicely of course i have sailors always understand things  the bluejacket reappears  bluejacket to lady cicely prisoners coming up the hill marm  kearney turning sharply on him who sent you in to say that  bluejacket calmly british ladys orders sir he goes out unruffled leaving kearney dumbfounded  sir howard contemplating kearneys expression with dismay i am really very sorry captain kearney i am quite aware that lady cicely has no right whatever to give orders to your men  lady cicely i didnt give orders i just asked him he has such a nice face dont you think so captain kearney he gasps speechless and now will you excuse me a moment i want to speak to somebody before the inquiry begins she hurries out  kearney there is sertnly a wonderful chahrn about the british aristocracy sir howard hallam are they all like that he takes the presidential chair  sir howard resuming his seat on kearneys right fortunately not captain kearney half a dozen such women would make an end of law in england in six months  the bluejacket comes to the door again  bluejacket all ready sir  kearney verry good im waiting  the bluejacket turns and intimates this to those without  the officers of the santiago enter  sir howard rising and bobbing to them in a judicial manner good morning gentlemen  they acknowledge the greeting rather shyly bowing or touching their caps and stand in a group behind kearney  kearney to sir howard you will be glahd to hear that i have a verry good account of one of our prisoners from our chahplain who visited them in the gaol he has expressed a wish to be cawnverted to episcopalianism  sir howard drily yes i think i know him  kearney bring in the prisoners  bluejacket at the door they are engaged with the british lady sir shall i ask her  kearney jumping up and exploding in storm piercing tones bring in the prisoners tell the lady those are my orders do you hear tell her so the bluejacket goes out dubiously the officers look at one another in mute comment on the unaccountable pepperiness of their commander  sir howard suavely mr rankin will be present i presume  kearney angrily rahnkin who is rahnkin  sir howard our host the missionary  kearney subsiding unwillingly oh rahnkin is he hed better look sharp or hell be late again exploding what are they doing with those prisoners  rankin hurries in and takes his place near sir howard  sir howard this is mr rankin captain kearney  rankin excuse my delay captain kearney the leddy sent me on an errand kearney grunts i thought i should be late but the first thing i heard when i arrived was your officer giving your compliments to leddy ceecily and would she kindly allow the prisoners to come in as you were anxious to see her again then i knew i was in time  kearney oh that was it was it may i ask sir did you notice any sign on lady waynfletes part of cawmplying with that verry moderate request  lady cicely outside coming coming  the prisoners are brought in by a guard of armed bluejackets  drinkwater first again elaborately clean and conveying by a virtuous and steadfast smirk a cheerful confidence in his innocence johnson solid and inexpressive redbrook unconcerned and debonair marzo uneasy these four form a little group together on the captains left the rest wait unintelligently on providence in a row against the wall on the same side shepherded by the bluejackets the first bluejacket a petty officer posts himself on the captains right behind rankin and sir howard finally brassbound appears with lady cicely on his arm he is in fashionable frock coat and trousers spotless collar and cuffs and elegant boots he carries a glossy tall hat in his hand to an unsophisticated eye the change is monstrous and appalling and its effect on himself is so unmanning that he is quite out of countenancea shaven samson lady cicely however is greatly pleased with it and the rest regard it as an unquestionable improvement the officers fall back gallantly to allow her to pass kearney rises to receive her and stares with some surprise at brassbound as he stops at the table on his left sir howard rises punctiliously when kearney rises and sits when he sits  kearney is this another gentleman of your party lady waynflete i presume i met you lahst night sir on board the yacht  brassbound no i am your prisoner my name is brassbound  drinkwater officiously kepn brarsbahnd of the schooner thenksgiv  redbrook hastily shut up you fool he elbows drinkwater into the background  kearney surprised and rather suspicious well i hardly understahnd this however if you are captain brassbound you can take your place with the rest brassbound joins redbrook and johnson kearney sits down again after inviting lady cicely with a solemn gesture to take the vacant chair now let me see you are a man of experience in these matters sir howard hallam if you had to conduct this business how would you start  lady cicely hed call on the counsel for the prosecution wouldnt you howard  sir howard but there is no counsel for the prosecution cicely  lady cicely oh yes there is im counsel for the prosecution you mustnt let sir howard make a speech captain kearney his doctors have positively forbidden anything of that sort will you begin with me  kearney by your leave lady waynfiete i think i will just begin with myself sailor fashion will do as well here as lawyer fashion  lady cicely ever so much better dear captain kearney silence kearney composes himself to speak she breaks out again you look so nice as a judge  a general smile drinkwater splutters into a half suppressed laugh  redbrook in a fierce whisper shut up you fool will you again he pushes him back with a furtive kick  sir howard remonstrating cicely  kearney grimly keeping his countenance your ladyships cawmpliments will be in order at a later stage captain brassbound the position is this my ship the united states cruiser santiago was spoken off mogador latest thursday by the yacht redgauntlet the owner of the aforesaid yacht who is not present through having sprained his ankle gave me sertn information in cawnsequence of that information the santiago made the twenty knots to mogador harbor inside of fiftyseven minutes before noon next day a messenger of mine gave the cadi of the district sertn information in cawnsequence of that information the cadi stimulated himself to some ten knots an hour and lodged you and your men in mogador jail at my disposal the cadi then went back to his mountain fahstnesses so we shall not have the pleasure of his company here today do you follow me so far  brassbound yes i know what you did and what the cadi did the point is why did you do it  kearney with doo patience we shall come to that presently mr rahnkin will you kindly take up the parable  rankin on the very day that sir howrrd and lady cicely started on their excursion i was applied to for medicine by a follower of the sheikh sidi el assif he told me i should never see sir howrrd again because his master knew he was a christian and would take him out of the hands of captain brassbound i hurried on board the yacht and told the owner to scour the coast for a gunboat or cruiser to come into the harbor and put persuasion on the authorities sir howard turns and looks at rankin with a sudden doubt of his integrity as a witness  kearney but i understood from our chahplain that you reported captain brassbound as in league with the sheikh to deliver sir howard up to him  rankin that was my first hasty conclusion captain kearney but it appears that the compact between them was that captain brassbound should escort travellers under the sheikhs protection at a certain payment per head provided none of them were christians as i understand it he tried to smuggle sir howrrd through under this compact and the sheikh found him out  drinkwater rawt gavner thets jest ah it wors the kepn  redbrook again suppressing him shut up you fool i tell you  sir howard to rankin may i ask have you had any conversation with lady cicely on this subject  rankin naively yes sir howard qrunts emphatically as who should say i thought so rankin continues addressing the court may i say how sorry i am that there are so few chairs captain and gentlemen  kearney with genial american courtesy oh thats all right mr rahnkin well i see no harm so far its human fawlly but not human crime now the counsel for the prosecution can proceed to prosecute the floor is yours lady waynflete  lady cicely rising i can only tell you the exact truth  drinkwater involuntarily naow downt do thet lidy  redbrook as before shut up you fool will you  lady cicely we had a most delightful trip in the hills and captain brassbounds men could not have been niceri must say that for themuntil we saw a tribe of arabssuch nice looking menand then the poor things were frightened  kearney the arabs  lady cicely no arabs are never frightened the escort of course escorts are always frightened i wanted to speak to the arab chief but captain brassbound cruelly shot his horse and the chief shot the count and then  kearney the count what count  lady cicely marzo thats marzo pointing to marzo who grins and touches his forehead  kearney slightly overwhelmed by the unexpected profusion of incident and character in her story well what happened then  lady cicely then the escort ran awayall escorts doand dragged me into the castle which you really ought to make them clean and whitewash thoroughly captain kearney then captain brassbound and sir howard turned out to be related to one another sensation and then of course there was a quarrel the hallams always quarrel  sir howard rising to protest cicely captain kearney this man told me  lady cicely swiftly interrupting him you mustnt say what people told you its not evidence sir howard chokes with indignation  kearney calmly allow the lady to proceed sir howard hallam  sir howard recovering his selfcontrol with a gulp and resuming his seat i beg your pardon captain kearney  lady cicely then sidi came  kearney sidney who was sidney  lady cicely no sidi the sheikh sidi el assif a noble creature with such a fine face he fell in love with me at first sight  sir howard remonstrating cicely  lady cicely he did you know he did you told me to tell the exact truth  kearney i can readily believe it madam proceed  lady cicely well that put the poor fellow into a most cruel dilemma you see he could claim to carry off sir howard because sir howard is a christian but as i am only a woman he had no claim to me  kearney somewhat sternly suspecting lady cicely of aristocratic atheism but you are a christian woman  lady cicely no the arabs dont count women they dont believe we have any souls  rankin that is true captain the poor benighted creatures  lady cicely well what was he to do he wasnt in love with sir howard and he was in love with me so he naturally offered to swop sir howard for me dont you think that was nice of him captain kearney  kearney i should have done the same myself lady waynflete proceed  lady cicely captain brassbound i must say was nobleness itself in spite of the quarrel between himself and sir howard he refused to give up either of us and was on the point of fighting for us when in came the cadi with your most amusing and delightful letter captain and bundled us all back to mogador after calling my poor sidi the most dreadful names and putting all the blame on captain brassbound so here we are now howard isnt that the exact truth every word of it  sir howard it is the truth cicely and nothing but the truth but the english law requires a witness to tell the whole truth  lady cicely what nonsense as if anybody ever knew the whole truth about anything sitting down much hurt and discouraged im sorry you wish captain kearney to understand that i am an untruthful witness  sir howard no but  lady cicely very well then please dont say things that convey that impression  kearney but sir howard told me yesterday that captain brassbound threatened to sell him into slavery  lady cicely springing up again did sir howard tell you the things he said about captain brassbounds mother renewed sensation i told you they quarrelled captain kearney i said so didnt i  redbrook crisply distinctly drinkwater opens his mouth to corroborate shut up you fool  lady cicely of course i did now captain kearney do you want medoes sir howard want medoes anybody want me to go into the details of that shocking family quarrel am i to stand here in the absence of any individual of my own sex and repeat the language of two angry men  kearney rising impressively the united states navy will have no hahnd in offering any violence to the pure instincts of womanhood lady waynflete i thahnk you for the delicacy with which you have given your evidence lady cicely beams on him gratefully and sits down triumphant captain brassbound i shall not hold you respawnsible for what you may have said when the english bench addressed you in the language of the english forecastle sir howard is about to protest no sir howard hallam excuse me in moments of pahssion i have called a man that myself we are glahd to find real flesh and blood beneath the ermine of the judge we will all now drop a subject that should never have been broached in a ladys presence he resumes his seat and adds in a businesslike tone is there anything further before we release these men  bluejacket there are some dawcuments handed over by the cadi sir he reckoned they were sort of magic spells the chahplain ordered them to be reported to you and burnt with your leave sir  kearney what are they  bluejacket reading from a list four books torn and dirty made up of separate numbers value each wawn penny and entitled sweeny todd the demon barber of london the skeleton horseman  drinkwater rushing forward in painful alarm and anxiety its maw lawbrary gavner downt

hands in dumb entreaty  lady cicely touched dont burn his books captain let me give them back to him  kearney the books will be handed over to the lady  drinkwater in a small voice thenkyer lidy he retires among his comrades snivelling subduedly  redbrook aside to him as he passes you silly ass you drinkwater sniffs and does not reply  kearney i suppose you and your men accept this ladys account of what passed captain brassbound  brassbound gloomily yes it is trueas far as it goes  kearney impatiently do you wawnt it to go any further  marzo she leave out something arab shoot me she nurse me

bluejackets and the petty officer  sir howard to lady cicely cicely in the course of my professional career i have met with unscrupulous witnesses and i am sorry to say unscrupulous counsel also but the combination of unscrupulous witness and unscrupulous counsel i have met today has taken away my breath you have made me your accomplice in defeating justice  lady cicely yes arent you glad its been defeated for once she takes his arm to go out with him captain brassbound i will come back to say goodbye before i go he nods gloomily she goes out with sir howard following the captain and his staff  rankin running to brassbound and taking both his hands im right glad yere cleared ill come back and have a crack with ye when yon lunch is over god bless ye hs goes out quickly  brassbound and his men left by themselves in the room free and unobserved go straight out of their senses they laugh they dance they embrace one another they set to partners and waltz clumsily they shake hands repeatedly and maudlinly three only retain some sort of selfpossession marzo proud of having successfully thrust himself into a leading part in the recent proceedings and made a dramatic speech inflates his chest curls his scanty moustache and throws himself into a swaggering pose chin up and right foot forward despising the emotional english barbarians around him brassbounds eyes and the working of his mouth show that he is infected with the general excitement but he bridles himself savagely redbrook trained to affect indifference grins cynically winks at brassbound and finally relieves himself by assuming the character of a circus ringmaster flourishing an imaginary whip and egging on the rest to wilder exertions a climax is reached when drinkwater let loose without a stain on his character for the second time is rapt by belief in his star into an ecstasy in which scorning all partnership he becomes as it were a whirling dervish and executes so miraculous a clog dance that the others gradually cease their slower antics to stare at him  brassbound tearing off his hat and striding forward as drinkwater collapses exhausted and is picked up by redbrook now to get rid of this respectable clobber and feel like a man again stand by all hands to jump on the captains tall hat he puts the hat down and prepares to jump on it the effect is startling and takes him completely aback his followers far from appreciating his iconoclasm are shocked into scandalized sobriety except redbrook who is immensely tickled by their prudery  drinkwater naow look eah kepn that ynt rawt dror a lawn somewhere  johnson i say nothin agen a bit of fun capn but lets be gentlemen  redbrook i suggest to you brassbound that the clobber belongs to lady sis aint you going to give it back to her  brassbound picking up the hat and brushing the dust off it anxiously thats true im a fool all the same she shall not see me again like this he pulls off the coat and waistcoat together does any man here know how to fold up this sort of thing properly  redbrook allow me governor he takes the coat and waistcoat to the table and folds them up  brassbound loosening his collar and the front of his shirt brandyfaced jack youre looking at these studs i know whats in your mind  drinkwater indignantly naow yer downt nort a bit on it wots in maw mawnd is secrifawce seolfsecrifawce  brassbound if one brass pin of that ladys property is missing ill hang you with my own hands at the gaff of the thanksgivingand would if she were lying under the guns of all the fleets in europe he pulls off the shirt and stands in his blue jersey with his hair ruffled he passes his hand through it and exclaims now i am half a man at any rate  redbrook a horrible combination governor churchwarden from the waist down and the rest pirate lady sis wont speak to you in it  brassbound ill change altogether he leaves the room to get his own trousers  redbrook softly look here johnson and gents generally they gather about him spose she takes him back to england  marzo trying to repeat his success im im only dam pirate she saint i tell youno take any man nowhere  johnson severely dont you be a ignorant and immoral foreigner the rebuke is well received and marzo is hustled into the background and extinguished she wont take him for harm but she might take him for good and then where should we be  drinkwater brarsbahnd ynt the ownly kepn in the world wot mikes a kepn is brines an knollidge o lawf it ynt thet thers naow sitch pusson its thet you dunno where to look fr im the implication that he is such a person is so intolerable that they receive it with a prolonged burst of booing  brassbound returning in his own clothes getting into his jacket as he comes stand by all they start asunder guiltily and wait for orders redbrook you pack that clobber in the ladys portmanteau and put it aboard the yacht for her johnson you take all hands aboard the thanksgiving look through the stores weigh anchor and make all ready for sea then send jack to wait for me at the slip with a boat and give me a gunfire for a signal lose no time  johnson ay ay air all aboard mates  all ay ay they rush out tumultuously  when they are gone brassbound sits down at the end of the table with his elbows on it and his head on his fists gloomily thinking then he takes from the breast pocket of his jacket a leather case from which he extracts a scrappy packet of dirty letters and newspaper cuttings these he throws on the table next comes a photograph in a cheap frame he throws it down untenderly beside the papers then folds his arms and is looking at it with grim distaste when lady cicely enters his back is towards her and he does not hear her perceiving this she shuts the door loudly enough to attract his attention he starts up  lady cicely coming to the opposite end of the table so youve taken off all my beautiful clothes  brassbound your brothers you mean a man should wear his own clothes and a man should tell his own lies im sorry you had to tell mine for me today  lady cicely oh women spend half their lives telling little lies for men and sometimes big ones were used to it but mind i dont admit that i told any today  brassbound how did you square my uncle  lady cicely i dont understand the expression  brassbound i mean  lady cicely im afraid we havent time to go into what you mean before lunch i want to speak to you about your future may i  brassbound darkening a little but politely sit down she sits down so does he  lady cicely what are your plans  brassbound i have no plans you will hear a gun fired in the harbor presently that will mean that the thanksgivings anchors weighed and that she is waiting for her captain to put out to sea and her captain doesnt know now whether to turn her head north or south  lady cicely why not north for england  brassbound why not south for the pole  lady cicely but you must do something with yourself  brassbound settling himself with his fists and elbows weightily on the table and looking straight and powerfully at her look you when you and i first met i was a man with a purpose i stood alone i saddled no friend woman or man with that purpose because it was against law against religion against my own credit and safety but i believed in it and i stood alone for it as a man should stand for his belief against law and religion as much as against wickedness and selfishness whatever i may be i am none of your fairweather sailors thatll do nothing for their creed but go to heaven for it i was ready to go to hell for mine perhaps you dont understand that  lady cicely oh bless you yes its so very like a certain sort of man  brassbound i daresay but ive not met many of that sort anyhow that was what i was like i dont say i was happy in it but i wasnt unhappy because i wasnt drifting i was steering a course and had work in hand give a man health and a course to steer and hell never stop to trouble about whether hes happy or not  lady cicely sometimes he wont even stop to trouble about whether other people are happy or not  brassbound i dont deny that nothing makes a man so selfish as work but i was not selfseeking it seemed to me that i had put justice above self i tell you life meant something to me then do you see that dirty little bundle of scraps of paper  lady cicely what are they  brassbound accounts cut out of newspapers speeches made by my uncle at charitable dinners or sentencing men to deathpious highminded speeches by a man who was to me a thief and a murderer to my mind they were more weighty more momentous better revelations of the wickedness of law and respectability than the book of the prophet amos what are they now he quietly tears the newspaper cuttings into little fragments and throws them away looking fixedly at her meanwhile  lady cicely well thats a comfort at all events  brassbound yes but its a part of my life gone your doing remember what have i left see here he take up the letters the letters my uncle wrote to my mother with her comments on their cold drawn insolence their treachery and cruelty and the piteous letters she wrote to him later on returned unopened must they go too  lady cicely uneasily i cant ask you to destroy your mothers letters  brassbound why not now that you have taken the meaning out of them he tears them is that a comfort too  lady cicely its a little sad but perhaps it is best so  brassbound that leaves one relic her portrait he plucks the photograph out of its cheap case  lady cicely with vivid curiosity oh let me see he hands it to her before she can control herself her expression changes to one of unmistakable disappointment and repulsion  brassbound with a single sardonic cachinnation ha you expected something better than that well youre right her face does not look well opposite yours  lady cicely distressed i said nothing  brassbound what could you say he takes back the portrait she relinquishes it without a word he looks at it shakes his head and takes it quietly between his finger and thumb to tear it  lady cicely staying his hand oh not your mothers picture  brassbound if that were your picture would you like your son to keep it for younger and better women to see  lady cicely releasing his hand oh you are dreadful tear it tear it she covers her eyes for a moment to shut out the sight  brassbound tearing it quietly you killed her for me that day in the castle and i am better without her he throws away the fragments now everything is gone you have taken the old meaning out of my life but you have put no new meaning into it i can see that you have some clue to the world that makes all its difficulties easy for you but im not clever enough to seize it youve lamed me by showing me that i take life the wrong way when im left to myself  lady cicely oh no why do you say that  brassbound what else can i say see what ive done my uncle is no worse a man than myselfbetter most likely for he has a better head and a higher place well i took him for a villain out of a storybook my mother would have opened anybody elses eyes she shut mine im a stupider man than brandyfaced jack even for he got his romantic nonsense out of his penny numbers and such like trash but i got just the same nonsense out of life and experience shaking his head it was vulgarvulgar i see that now for youve opened my eyes to the past but what good is that for the future what am i to do where am i to go  lady cicely its quite simple do whatever you like thats what i always do  brassbound that answer is no good to me what i like is to have something to do and i have nothing you might as well talk like the missionary and tell me to do my duty  lady cicely quickly oh no thank you ive had quite enough of your duty and howards duty where would you both be now if id let you do it  brassbound wed have been somewhere at all events it seems to me that now i am nowhere  lady cicely but arent you coming back to england with us  brassbound what for  lady cicely why to make the most of your opportunities  brassbound what opportunities  lady cicely dont you understand that when you are the nephew of a great bigwig and have influential connexions and good friends among them lots of things can be done for you that are never done for ordinary ship captains  brassbound ah but im not an aristocrat you see and like most poor men im proud i dont like being patronized  lady cicely what is the use of saying that in my world which is now your worldour worldgetting patronage is the whole art of life a man cant have a career without it  brassbound in my world a man can navigate a ship and get his living by it  lady cicely oh i see youre one of the idealiststhe impossibilists we have them too occasionally in our world theres only one thing to be done with them  brassbound whats that  lady cicely marry them straight off to some girl with enough money for them and plenty of sentiment thats their fate  brassbound youve spoiled even that chance for me do you think i could look at any ordinary woman after you you seem to be able to make me do pretty well what you like but you cant make me marry anybody but yourself  lady cicely do you know captain paquito that ive married no less than seventeen men brassbound stares to other women and they all opened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me  brassbound then i shall be the first man you ever found to stand to his word  lady cicely part pleased part amused part sympathetic do you really want a wife  brassbound i want a commander dont undervalue me i am a good man when i have a good leader i have courage i have determination im not a drinker i can command a schooner and a shore party if i cant command a ship or an army when work is put upon me i turn neither to save my life nor to fill my pocket gordon trusted me and he never regretted it if you trust me you shant regret it all the same theres something wanting in me i suppose im stupid  lady cicely oh youre not stupid  brassbound yes i am since you saw me for the first time in that garden youve heard me say nothing clever and ive heard you say nothing that didnt make me laugh or make me feel friendly as well as telling me what to think and what to do thats what i mean by real cleverness well i havent got it i can give an order when i know what order to give i can make men obey it willing or unwilling but im stupid i tell you stupid when theres no gordon to command me i cant think of what to do left to myself ive become half a brigand i can kick that little gutterscrub drinkwater but i find myself doing what he puts into my head because i cant think of anything else when you came i took your orders as naturally as i took gordons though i little thought my next commander would be a woman i want to take service under you and theres no way in which that can be done except marrying you will you let me do it  lady cicely im afraid you dont quite know how odd a match it would be for me according to the ideas of english society  brassbound i care nothing about english society let it mind its own business  lady cicely rising a little alarmed captain paquito i am not in love with you  brassbound also rising with his gaze still steadfastly on her i didnt suppose you were the commander is not usually in love with his subordinate  lady cicely nor the subordinate with the commander  brassbound assenting firmly nor the subordinate with the commander  lady cicely learning for the first time in her life what terror is as she finds that he is unconsciously mesmerizing her oh you are dangerous  brassbound come are you in love with anybody else thats the question  lady cicely shaking her head i have never been in love with any real person and i never shall how could i manage people if i had that mad little bit of self left in me thats my secret  brassbound then throw away the last bit of self marry me  lady cicely vainly struggling to recall her wandering will must i  brassbound there is no must you can i ask you to my fate depends on it  lady cicely its frightful for

strange ecstasy holding his hands as he rises oh farewell with my hearts deepest feeling farewell farewell  brassbound with my hearts noblest honor and triumph farewell he turns and flies  lady cicely how glorious how glorious and what an escape  curtain    notes to captain brassbounds conversion  sources of the play  i claim as a notable merit in the authorship of this play that i have been intelligent enough to steal its scenery its surroundings its atmosphere its geography its knowledge of the east its fascinating cadis and kearneys and sheikhs and mud castles from an excellent book of philosophic travel and vivid adventure entitled mogrebelacksa morocco the most holy by cunninghame graham my own first hand knowledge of morocco is based on a mornings walk through tangier and a cursory observation of the coast through a binocular from the deck of an orient steamer both later in date than the writing of the play  cunninghame graham is the hero of his own book but i have not made him the hero of my play because so incredible a personage must have destroyed its likelihoodsuch as it is there are moments when i do not myself believe in his existence and yet he must be real for i have seen him with these eyes and i am one of the few men living who can decipher the curious alphabet in which he writes his private letters the man is on public record too the battle of trafalgar square in which he personally and bodily assailed civilization as represented by the concentrated military and constabular forces of the capital of the world can scarcely be forgotten by the more discreet spectators of whom i was one on that occasion civilization qualitatively his inferior was quantitatively so hugely in excess of him that it put him in prison but had not sense enough to keep him there yet his getting out of prison was as nothing compared to his getting into the house of commons how he did it i know not but the thing certainly happened somehow that he made pregnant utterances as a legislator may be taken as proved by the keen philosophy of the travels and tales he has since tossed to us but the house strong in stupidity did not understand him until in an inspired moment he voiced a universal impulse by bluntly damning its hypocrisy of all the eloquence of that silly parliament there remains only one single damn it has survived the front bench speeches of the eighties as the word of cervantes survives the oraculations of the dons and deys who put him too in prison the shocked house demanded that he should withdraw his cruel word i never withdraw said he and i promptly stole the potent phrase for the sake of its perfect style and used it as a cockade for the bulgarian hero of arms and the man the theft prospered and i naturally take the first opportunity of repeating it in what other lepantos besides trafalgar square cunninghame graham has fought i cannot tell he is a fascinating mystery to a sedentary person like myself the horse a dangerous animal whom when i cannot avoid i propitiate with apples and sugar he bestrides and dominates fearlessly yet with a true republican sense of the rights of the fourlegged fellowcreature whose martyrdom and mans shame therein he has told most powerfully in his calvary a tale with an edge that will cut the soft cruel hearts and strike fire from the hard kind ones he handles the other lethal weapons as familiarly as the pen medieval sword and modern mauser are to him as umbrellas and kodaks are to me his tales of adventure have the true cervantes touch of the man who has been thereso refreshingly different from the scenes imagined by bloodyminded clerks who escape from their servitude into literature to tell us how men and cities are conceived in the counting house and the volunteer corps he is i understand a spanish hidalgo hence the superbity of his portrait by lavery velasquez being no longer available he is i know a scotch laird how he contrives to be authentically the two things at the same time is no more intelligible to me than the fact that everything that has ever happened to him seems to have happened in paraguay or texas instead of in spain or scotland he is i regret to add an impenitent and unashamed dandy such boots such a hat would have dazzled dorsay himself with that hat he once saluted me in regent st when i was walking with my mother her interest was instantly kindled and the following conversation ensued who is that cunninghame graham nonsense cunninghame graham is one of your socialists that man is a gentleman this is the punishment of vanity a fault i have myself always avoided as i find conceit less troublesome and much less expensive later on somebody told him of tarudant a city in morocco in which no christian had ever set foot concluding at once that it must be an exceptionally desirable place to live in he took ship and horse changed the hat for a turban and made straight for the sacred city via mogador how he fared and how he fell into the hands of the cadi of kintafi who rightly held that there was more danger to islam in one cunninghame graham than in a thousand christians may be learnt from his account of it in mogrebelacksa without which captain brassbounds conversion would never have been written  i am equally guiltless of any exercise of invention concerning the story of the west indian estate which so very nearly serves as a peg to hang captain brassbound to mr frederick jackson of hindhead who against all his principles encourages and abets me in my career as a dramatist i owe my knowledge of those main facts of the case which became public through an attempt to make the house of commons act on them this being so i must add that the character of captain brassbounds mother like the recovery of the estate by the next heir is an interpolation of my own it is not however an invention one of the evils of the pretence that our institutions represent abstract principles of justice instead of being mere social scaffolding is that persons of a certain temperament take the pretence seriously and when the law is on the side of injustice will not accept the situation and are driven mad by their vain struggle against it dickens has drawn the type in his man from shropshire in bleak house most public men and all lawyers have been appealed to by victims of this sense of injusticethe most unhelpable of afflictions in a society like ours  english and american dialects  the fact that english is spelt conventionally and not phonetically makes the art of recording speech almost impossible what is more it places the modern dramatist who writes for america as well as england in a most trying position take for example my american captain and my english lady i have spelt the word conduce as uttered by the american captain as cawndooce to suggest very roughly the american pronunciation to english readers then why not spell the same word when uttered by lady cicely as kerndewce to suggest the english pronunciation to american readers to this i have absolutely no defence i can only plead that an author who lives in england necessarily loses his consciousness of the peculiarities of english speech and sharpens his consciousness of the points in which american speech differs from it so that it is more convenient to leave english peculiarities to be recorded by american authors i must however most vehemently disclaim any intention of suggesting that english pronunciation is authoritative and correct my own tongue is neither american english nor english english but irish english so i am as nearly impartial in the matter as it is in human nature to be besides there is no standard english pronunciation any more than there is an american one in england every county has its catchwords just as no doubt every state in the union has i cannot believe that the pioneer american for example can spare time to learn that last refinement of modern speech the exquisite diphthong a farfetched combination of the french eu and the english e with which a new yorker pronounces such words as world bird c i have spent months without success in trying to achieve glibness with it  to felix drinkwater also i owe some apology for implying that all his vowel pronunciations are unfashionable they are very far from being so as far as my social experience goes and i have kept very mixed company there is no class in english society in which a good deal of drinkwater pronunciation does not pass unchallenged save by the expert phonetician this is no mere rash and ignorant jibe of my own at the expense of my english neighbors academic authority in the matter of english speech is represented at present by mr henry sweet of the university of oxford whose elementarbuch des gesprochenen engliach translated into his native language for the use of british islanders as a primer of spoken english is the most accessible standard work on the subject in such words as plum come humbug up gum etc mr sweets evidence is conclusive ladies and gentlemen in southern england pronounce them as plam kam hambag ap gan etc exactly as felix drinkwater does i could not claim mr sweets authority if i dared to whisper that such coster english as the rather pretty dahn tahn for down town or the decidedly ugly cowcow for cocoa is current in very polite circles the entire nation costers and all would undoubtedly repudiate any such pronunciation as vulgar all the same if i were to attempt to represent current smart cockney speech as i have attempted to represent drinkwaters without the niceties of mr sweets romic alphabets i am afraid i should often have to write dahn tahn and cowcow as being at least nearer to the actual sound than down town and cocoa and this would give such offence that i should have to leave the country for nothing annoys a native speaker of english more than a faithful setting down in phonetic spelling of the sounds he utters he imagines that a departure from conventional spelling indicates a departure from the correct standard english of good society alas this correct standard english of good society is unknown to phoneticians it is only one of the many figments that bewilder our poor snobbish brains no such thing exists but what does that matter to people trained from infancy to make a point of honor of belief in abstractions and incredibilities and so i am compelled to hide lady cicelys speech under the veil of conventional orthography  i need not shield drinkwater because he will never read my book so i have taken the liberty of making a special example of him as far as that can be done without a phonetic alphabet for the benefit of the mass of readers outside london who still form their notions of cockney dialect on sam weller when i came to london in 1876 the sam weller dialect had passed away so completely that i should have given it up as a literary fiction if i had not discovered it surviving in a middlesex village and heard of it from an essex one some time in the eighties the late andrew tuer called attention in the pall mall gazette to several peculiarities of modern cockney and to the obsolescence of the dickens dialect that was still being copied from book to book by authors who never dreamt of using their ears much less of training them to listen then came mr ansteys cockney dialogues in punch a great advance and mr chevaliers coster songs and patter the tompkins verses contributed by mr barry pain to the london daily chronicle have also done something to bring the literary convention for cockney english up to date but tompkins sometimes perpetrates horrible solecisms he will pronounce face as fits accurately enough but he will rhyme it quite impossibly to nice which tompkins would pronounce as newts for example mawl enn rowd for mile end road this aw for i which i have made drinkwater use is the latest stage of the old diphthongal oi which mr chevalier still uses irish scotch and north country readers must remember that drinkwaters rs are absolutely unpronounced when they follow a vowel though they modify the vowel very considerably thus luggage is pronounced by him as laggige but turn is not pronounced as tern but as teun with the eu sounded as in french the london r seems thoroughly understood in america with the result however that the use of the r by artemus ward and other american dialect writers causes irish people to misread them grotesquely i once saw the pronunciation of malheureux represented in a cockney handbook by malerrerr not at all a bad makeshift to instruct a londoner but out of the question elsewhere in the british isles in america representations of english speech dwell too derisively on the dropped or interpolated h american writers have apparently not noticed the fact that the south english h is not the same as the neverdropped irish and american h and that to ridicule an englishman for dropping it is as absurd as to ridicule the whole french and italian nation for doing the same the american h helped out by a general agreement to pronounce wh as hw is tempestuously audible and cannot be dropped without being immediately missed the london h is so comparatively quiet at all times and so completely inaudible in wh that it probably fell out of use simply by escaping the ears of children learning to speak however that may be it is kept alive only by the literate classes who are reminded constantly of its existence by seeing it on paper  roughly speaking i should say that in england he who bothers about his hs is a fool and he who ridicules a dropped h a snob as to the interpolated h my experience as a london vestryman has convinced me that it is often effective as a means of emphasis and that the london language would be poorer without it the objection to it is no more respectable than the objection of a street boy to a black man or to a lady in knickerbockers  i have made only the most perfunctory attempt to represent the dialect of the missionary there is no literary notation for the grave music of good scotch  blackdown august 1900
