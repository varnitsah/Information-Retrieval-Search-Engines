johnson   oliver cromwell   benjamin franklin   queen christina     biographical stories  this small volume and others of a similar character from the same hand have not been composed without a deep sense of responsibility  the author regards children as sacred and would not for the world cast anything into the fountain of a young heart that might imbitter and pollute its waters  and even in point of the reputation to be aimed at juvenile literature is as well worth cultivating as any other  the writer if he succeed in pleasing his little readers may hope to be remembered by them till their own old agea far longer period of literary existence than is generally attained by those who seek immortality from the judgments of fullgrown men    chapter i  when edward temple was about eight or nine years old he was afflicted with a disorder of the eyes  it was so severe and his sight was naturally so delicate that the surgeon felt some apprehensions lest the boy should become totally blind  he therefore gave strict directions to keep him in a darkened chamber with a bandage over his eyes  not a ray of the blessed light of heaven could be suffered to visit the poor lad  this was a sad thing for edward  it was just the same as if there were to be no more sunshine nor moonlight nor glow of the cheerful fire nor light of lamps  a night had begun which was to continue perhaps for monthsa longer and drearier night than that which voyagers are compelled to endure when their ship is icebound throughout the winter in the arctic ocean  his dear father and mother his brother george and the sweet face of little emily robinson must all vanish and leave him in utter darkness and solitude  their voices and footsteps it is true would be heard around him he would feel his mothers embrace and the kind pressure of all their hands but still it would seem as if they were a thousand miles away  and then his studiesthey were to be entirely given up  this was another grievous trial for edwards memory hardly went back to the period when he had not known how to read  many and many a holiday had he spent at his hook poring over its pages until the deepening twilight confused the print and made all the letters run into long words  then would he press his hands across his eyes and wonder why they pained him so and when the candles were lighted what was the reason that they burned so dimly like the moon in a foggy night  poor little fellow so far as his eyes were concerned he was already an old man and needed a pair of spectacles almost as much as his own grandfather did  and now alas the time was come when even grandfathers spectacles could not have assisted edward to read  after a few bitter tears which only pained his eyes the more the poor boy submitted to the surgeons orders  his eyes were bandaged and with his mother on one side and his little friend emily on the other he was led into a darkened chamber  mother i shall be very miserable said edward sobbing  o no my dear child replied his mother cheerfully  your eyesight was a precious gift of heaven it is true but you would do wrong to be miserable for its loss even if there were no hope of regaining it there are other enjoyments besides what come to us through our eyes  none that are worth having said edward  ah but you will not think so long rejoined mrs temple with tenderness  all of usyour father and myself and george and our sweet emilywill try to find occupation and amusement for you  we will use all our eyes to make you happy  will they not be better than a single pair  i will sit by you all day long said emily in her low sweet voice putting her hand into that of edward  and so will i ned said george his elder brother school time and all if my father will permit me  edwards brother george was three or four years older than himselfa fine hardy lad of a bold and ardent temper  he was the leader of his comrades in all their enterprises and amusements  as to his proficiency at study there was not much to be said  he had sense and ability enough to have made himself a scholar but found so many pleasanter things to do that he seldom took hold of a book with his whole heart  so fond was george of boisterous sports and exercises that it was really a great token of affection and sympathy when he offered to sit all day long in a dark chamber with his poor brother edward  as for little emily robinson she was the daughter of one of mr temples dearest friends  ever since her mother went to heaven which was soon after emilys birth the little girl had dwelt in the household where we now find her  mr and mrs temple seemed to love her as well as their own children for they had no daughter except emily nor would the boys have known the blessing of a sister had not this gentle stranger come to teach them what it was  if i could show you emilys face with her dark hair smoothed away from her forehead you would be pleased with her look of simplicity and loving kindness but might think that she was somewhat too grave for a child of seven years old  but you would not love her the less for that  so brother george and this loving little girl were to be edwards companions and playmates while he should be kept prisoner in the dark chamber  when the first bitterness of his grief was over he began to feel that there might be some comforts and enjoyments in life even for a boy whose eyes were covered with a bandage  i thank you dear mother said he with only a few sobs and you emily and you too george  you will all be very kind to me i know and my fatherwill not he come and see me every day  yes my dear boy said mr temple for though invisible to edward he was standing close beside him  i will spend some hours of every day with you  and as i have often amused you by relating stories and adventures while you had the use of your eves i can do the same now that you are unable to read  will this please you edward  o very much replied edward  well then said his father this evening we will begin the series of biographical stories which i promised you some time ago    chapter ii  when evening came mr temple found edward considerably revived in spirits and disposed to be resigned to his misfortune  indeed the figure of the boy as it was dimly seen by the firelight reclining in a wellstuffed easychair looked so very comfortable that many people might have envied hun  when a mans eyes have grown old with gazing at the ways of the world it does not seem such a terrible misfortune to have them bandaged  little emily robinson sat by edwards side with the air of an accomplished nurse  as well as the duskiness of the chamber would permit she watched all his motions and each varying expression of his face and tried to anticipate her patients wishes before his tongue could utter them  yet it was noticeable that the child manifested an indescribable awe and disquietude whenever she fixed her eyes on the bandage for to her simple and affectionate heart it seemed as if her dear friend edward was separated from her because she could not see his eyes  a friends eyes tell us many things which could never be spoken by the tongue  george likewise looked awkward and confused as stout and healthy boys are accustomed to do in the society of the sick or afflicted  never having felt pain or sorrow they are abashed from not knowing how to sympathize with the sufferings of others  well my dear edward inquired mrs temple is your chair quite comfortable and has your little nurse provided for all your wants  if so your father is ready to begin his stories  o i am very well now answered edward with a faint smile  and my ears have not forsaken me though my eyes are good for nothing  so pray dear father begin  it was mr temples design to tell the children a series of true stories the incidents of which should be taken from the childhood and early life of eminent people  thus he hoped to bring george and edward and emily into closer acquaintance with the famous persons who have lived in other times by showing that they also had been children once  although mr temple was scrupulous to relate nothing but what was founded on fact yet he felt himself at liberty to clothe the incidents of his narrative in a new coloring so that his auditors might understand them the better  my first story said he shall be about a painter of pictures  dear me cried edward with a sigh  i am afraid i shall never look at pictures any more  we will hope for the best answered his father  in the mean time you must try to see things within your own mind  mr temple then began the following story    benjamin west  born 1738  died 1820  in the year 1735 there came into the world in the town of springfield pennsylvania a quaker infant from whom his parents and neighbors looked for wonderful things  a famous preacher of the society of friends had prophesied about little ben and foretold that he would be one of the most remarkable characters that had appeared on the earth since the days of william penn  on this account the eyes of many people were fixed upon the boy  some of his ancestors had won great renown in the old wars of england and france but it was probably expected that ben would become a preacher and would convert multitudes to the peaceful doctrines of the quakers  friend west and his wife were thought to be very fortunate in having such a son  little ben lived to the ripe age of six years without doing anything that was worthy to be told in history  but one summer afternoon in his seventh year his mother put a fan into his hand and bade him keep the flies away from the face of a little babe who lay fast asleep in the cradle  she then left the room  the boy waved the fan to and fro and drove away the buzzing flies whenever they had the impertinence to come near the babys face  when they had all flown out of the window or into distant parts of the room he bent over the cradle and delighted himself with gazing at the sleeping infant  it was indeed a very pretty sight  the little personage in the cradle slumbered peacefully with its waxen hands under its chin looking as full of blissful quiet as if angels were singing lullabies in its ear  indeed it must have been dreaming about heaven for while ben stooped over the cradle the little baby smiled  how beautiful she looks said ben to himself  what a pity it is that such a pretty smile should not last forever  now ben at this period of his life had never heard of that wonderful art by which a look that appears and vanishes in a moment may be made to last for hundreds of years  but though nobody had told him of such an art he may be said to have invented it for himself  on a table near at hand there were pens and paper and ink of two colors black and red the boy seized a pen and sheet of paper and kneeling down beside the cradle began to draw a likeness of the infant  while he was busied in this manner he heard his mothers step approaching and hastily tried to conceal the paper  benjamin my son what hast thou been doing inquired his mother observing marks of confusion in his face  at first ben was unwilling to tell for he felt as if there might be something wrong in stealing the babys face and putting it upon a sheet of paper  however as his mother insisted he finally put the sketch into her hand and then hung his head expecting to be well scolded but when the good lady saw what was on the paper in lines of red and black ink she uttered a scream of surprise and joy  bless me cried she  it is a picture of little sally  and then she threw her arms round our friend benjamin and kissed him so tenderly that he never afterwards was afraid to show his performances to his mother  as ben grew older he was observed to take vast delight in looking at the lines and forms of nature  for instance he was greatly pleased with the blue violets of spring the wild roses of summer and the scarlet cardinalflowers of early autumn  in the decline of the year when the woods were variegated with all the colors of the rainbow ben seemed to desire nothing better than to gaze at them from morn till night  the purple and golden clouds of sunset were a joy to him  and he was continually endeavoring to draw the figures of trees men mountains houses cattle geese ducks and turkeys with a piece of chalk on barn doors or on the floor  in these old times the mohawk indians were still numerous in pennsylvania  every year a party of them used to pay a visit to springfield because the wigwams of their ancestors had formerly stood there  these wild men grew fond of little ben and made him very happy by giving him some of the red and yellow paint with which they were accustomed to adorn their faces  his mother too presented him with a piece of indigo  thus he now had three colorsred blue and yellowand could manufacture green by mixing the yellow with the blue our friend ben was overjoyed and doubtless showed his gratitude to the indians by taking their likenesses in the strange dresses which they wore with feathers tomahawks and bows and arrows  but all this time the young artist had no paintbrushes nor were there any to be bought unless he had sent to philadelphia on purpose however he was a very ingenious boy aid resolved to manufacture paintbrushes for himself  with this design he laid hold uponwhat do you think  why upon a respectable old black cat who was sleeping quietly by the fireside  puss said little ben to the cat pray give me some of the fur from the tip of thy tail  though he addressed the black cat so civilly yet ben was determined to have the fur whether she were willing or not  puss who had no great zeal for the fine arts would have resisted if she could but the boy was armed with his mothers scissors and very dexterously clipped off fur enough to make a paintbrush  this was of so much use to him that be applied to madame puss again and again until her warm coat of fur had become so thin and ragged that she could hardly keep comfortable through the winter  poor thing  she was forced to creep close into the chimneycorner and eyed ben with a very rueful physiognomy  but ben considered it more necessary that he should have paintbrushes than that puss should be warm  about this period friend west received a visit from mr pennington a merchant of philadelphia who was likewise a member of the society of friends  the visitor on entering the parlor was surprised to see it ornamented with drawings of indian chiefs and of birds with beautiful plumage and of the wild flowers of the forest  nothing of the kind was ever seen before in the habitation of a quaker farmer  why friend west exclaimed the philadelphia merchant what has possessed thee to cover thy walls with all these pictures  where on earth didst then get them  then friend west explained that all these pictures were painted by little ben with no better materials than red and yellow ochre and a piece of indigo and with brushes made of the black cats fur  verily said mr pennington the boy hath a wonderful faculty  some of our friends might look upon these matters as vanity but little benjamin appears to have been born a painter and providence is wiser than we are  the good merchant patted benjamin on the head and evidently considered him a wonderful boy  when his parents saw how much their sons performances were admired they no doubt remembered the prophecy of the old quaker preacher respecting bens future eminence  yet they could not understand how he was ever to become a very great and useful man merely by making pictures  one evening shortly after mr penningtons return to philadelphia a package arrived at springfield directed to our little friend ben  what can it possibly be  thought ben when it was put into his hands who can have sent me such a great square package as this  on taking off the thick brown paper which enveloped it behold there was a paintbox with a great many cakes of paint and brushes of various sizes  it was the gift of good mr pennington  there were likewise several squares of canvas such as artists use for painting pictures upon and in addition to all these treasures some beautiful engravings of landscapes  these were the first pictures that ben had ever seen except those of his own drawing  what a joyful evening was this for the little artist  at bedtime he put the paintbox under his pillow and got hardly a wink of sleep for all night long his fancy was painting pictures in the darkness  in the morning he hurried to the garret and was seen no more till the dinnerhour nor did he give himself time to eat more than a mouthful or two of food before he hurried back to the garret again  the next day and the next he was just as busy as ever until at last his mother thought it time to ascertain what he was about  she accordingly followed him to the garret  on opening the door the first object that presented itself to her eyes was our friend benjamin giving the last touches to a beautiful picture he had copied portions of two of the engravings and made one picture out of both with such admirable skill that it was far more beautiful than the originals  the grass the trees the water the sky and the houses were all painted in their proper colors  there too where the sunshine and the shadow looking as natural as life  my dear child thou hast done wonders cried his mother  the good lady was in an ecstasy of delight  and well might she be proud of her boy for there were touches in this picture which old artists who had spent a lifetime in the business need not have been ashamed of many a year afterwards this wonderful production was exhibited at the royal academy in london  when benjamin was quite a large lad he was sent to school at philadelphia  not long after his arrival he had a slight attack of fever which confined him to his bed  the light which would otherwise have disturbed him was excluded from his chamber by means of closed wooden shutters  at first it appeared so totally dark that ben could not distinguish any object in the room  by degrees however his eyes became accustomed to the scanty light  he was lying on his back looking up towards the ceiling when suddenly he beheld the dim apparition of a white cow moving slowly over his head ben started and rubbed his eyes in the greatest amazement  what can this mean thought he  the white cow disappeared and next came several pigs which trotted along the ceiling and vanished into the darkness of the chamber  so lifelike did these grunters look that ben almost seemed to hear them squeak  well this is very strange said ben to himself  when the people of the house came to see him benjamin told them of the marvellous circumstance which had occurred  but they would not believe him  benjamin thou art surely out of thy senses cried they  how is it possible that a white cow and a litter of pigs should be visible on the ceiling of a dark chamber  ben however had great confidence in his own eyesight and was determined to search the mystery to the bottom  for this purpose when he was again left alone he got out of bed and examined the windowshutters  he soon perceived a small chink in one of them through which a ray of light found its passage and rested upon the ceiling  now the science of optics will inform us that the pictures of the white cow and the pigs and of other objects out of doors came into the dark chamber through this narrow chink and were painted over benjamins head it is greatly to his credit that he discovered the scientific principle of this phenomenon and by means of it constructed a cameraobscura or magiclantern out of a hollow box  this was of great advantage to him in drawing landscapes  well time went on and benjamin continued to draw and paint pictures until he had now reached the age when it was proper that he should choose a business for life  his father and mother were in considerable perplexity about him  according to the ideas of the quakers it is not right for people to spend their lives in occupations that are of no real and sensible advantage to the world  now what advantage could the world expect from benjamins pictures  this was a difficult question and in order to set their minds at rest his parents determined to consult the preachers and wise men of their society  accordingly they all assembled in the meetinghouse and discussed the matter from beginning to end  finally they came to a very wise decision  it seemed so evident that providence had created benjamin to be a painter and had given him abilities which would be thrown away in any other business that the quakers resolved not to oppose his inclination  they even acknowledged that the sight of a beautiful picture might convey instruction to the mind and might benefit the heart as much as a good book or a wise discourse  they therefore committed the youth to the direction of god being well assured that he best knew what was his proper sphere of usefulness  the old men laid their hands upon benjamins head and gave him their blessing and the women kissed him affectionately  all consented that he should go forth into the world and learn to be a painter by studying the best pictures of ancient and modern times  so our friend benjamin left the dwelling of his parents and his native woods and streams and the good quakers of springfield and the indians who had given him his first colors he left all the places and persons whom he had hitherto known and returned to them no more  he went first to philadelphia and afterwards to europe  here he was noticed by many great people but retained all the sobriety and simplicity which he had learned among the quakers  it is related of him that when he was presented at the court of the prince of parma he kept his hat upon his head even while kissing the princes hand  when he was twentyfive years old he went to london and established himself there as all artist  in due course of time he acquired great fame by his pictures and was made chief painter to king george iii and president of the royal academy of arts  when the quakers of pennsylvania heard of his success they felt that the prophecy of the old preacher as to little bens future eminence was now accomplished it is true they shook their heads at his pictures of battle and bloodshed such as the death of wolfe thinking that these terrible scene should not be held up to the admiration of the world  but they approved of the great paintings in which he represented the miracles and sufferings of the redeemer of mankind  king george employed him to adorn a large and beautiful chapel at windsor castle with pictures of these sacred subjects  he likewise painted a magnificent picture of christ healing the sick which he gave to the hospital at philadelphia  it was exhibited to the public and produced so much profit that the hospital was enlarged so as to accommodate thirty more patients  if benjamin west had done no other good deed than this yet it would have been enough to entitle him to an honorable remembrance forever  at this very day there are thirty poor people in the hospital who owe all their comforts to that same picture  we shall mention only a single incident more  the picture of christ healing the sick was exhibited at the royal academy in london where it covered a vast space and displayed a multitude of figures as large as life  on the wall close beside this admirable picture hung a small and faded landscape  it was the same that little ben had painted in his fathers garret after receiving the paintbox and engravings from good mr pennington  he lived many years in peace and honor and died in 1820 at the age of eightytwo  the story of his life is almost as wonderful as a fairy tale for there are few stranger transformations than that of a little unknown quaker boy in the wilds of america into the most distinguished english painter of his day  let us each make the best use of our natural abilities as benjamin west did and with the blessing of providence we shall arrive at some good end  as for fame it is but little matter whether we acquire it or not  thank you for the story my dear father said edward when it was finished  do you know that it seems as if i could see things without the help of my eyes  while you were speaking i have seen little bert and the baby in its cradle and the indians and the white cow and the pigs and kind mr pennington and all the good old quakers almost as plainly as if they were in this very room  it is because your attention was not disturbed by outward objects replied mr temple  people when deprived of sight often have more vivid ideas than those who possess the perfect use of their eyes  i will venture to say that george has not attended to the story quite so closely  no indeed said george but it was a very pretty story for all that how i should have laughed to see ben making a paintbrush out of the black cats tail  i intend to try the experiment with emilys kitten  o no no george cried emily earnestly  my kitten cannot spare her tail  edward being an invalid it was now time for him to retire to bed  when the family bade him good night he turned his face towards them looking very loath to part  i shall not know when morning comes said he sorrowfully  and besides i want to hear your voices all the time for when nobody is speaking it seems as if i were alone in a dark world  you must have faith my dear child replied his mother  faith is the souls eyesight and when we possess it the world is never dark nor lonely    chapter iii    the next day edward began to get accustomed to his new condition of life  once indeed when his parents were out of the way and only emily was left to take care of him he could not resist the temptation to thrust aside the bandage and peep at the anxious face of his little nurse  but in spite of the dimness of the chamber the experiment caused him so much pain that he felt no inclination to take another look  so with a deep sigh here signed himself to his fate  emily pray talk to me said he somewhat impatiently  now emily was a remarkably silent little girl and did not possess that liveliness of disposition which renders some children such excellent companions  she seldom laughed and had not the faculty of making many words about small matters  but the love and earnestness of her heart taught her how to amuse poor edward in his darkness  she put her knittingwork into his hands  you must learn how to knit said she  what without using my eyes cried edward  i can knit with my eyes shut replied emily  then with her own little hands she guided edwards fingers while he set about this new occupation  so awkward were his first attempts that any other little girl would have laughed heartily  but emily preserved her gravity and showed the utmost patience in taking up the innumerable stitches which he let down  in the course of an hour or two his progress was quite encouraging  when evening came edward acknowledged that the day had been far less wearisome than he anticipated  but he was glad nevertheless when his father and mother and george and emily all took their seats around his chair  he put out his hand to grasp each of their hands and smiled with a very bright expression upon his lips  now i can see you all with my minds eye said he  and now father pray tell us another story  so mr temple began   sir isaac newton  born 1642 died 1727  on christmas day in the year 1642 isaac newton was born at the small village of woolsthorpe in england  little did his mother think when she beheld her newborn babe that he was destined to explain many matters which had been a mystery ever since the creation of the world  isaacs father being dead mrs newton was married again to a clergyman and went to reside at north witham  her son was left to the care of his good old grandmother who was very kind to him and sent him to school in his early years isaac did not appear to be a very bright scholar but was chiefly remarkable for his ingenuity in all mechanical occupations he had a set of little tools and saws of various sizes manufactured by himself  with the aid of these isaac contrived to make many curious articles at which he worked with so much skill that he seemed to have been born with a saw or chisel in hand  the neighbors looked with vast admiration at the things which isaac manufactured  and his old grandmother i suppose was never weary of talking about him  hell make a capital workman one of these days she would probably say  no fear but what isaac will do well in the world and be a rich man before he dies  it is amusing to conjecture what were the anticipations of his grandmother and the neighbors about isaacs future life  some of them perhaps fancied that he would make beautiful furniture of mahogany rosewood or polished oak inlaid with ivory and ebony and magnificently gilded  and then doubtless all the rich people would purchase these fine things to adorn their drawingrooms  others probably thought that little isaac was destined to be an architect and would build splendid mansions for the nobility and gentry and churches too with the tallest steeples that had ever been seen in england  some of his friends no doubt advised isaacs grandmother to apprentice him to a clockmaker for besides his mechanical skill the boy seemed to have a taste for mathematics which would be very useful to him in that profession  and then in due time isaac would set up for himself and would manufacture curious clocks like those that contain sets of dancing figures which issue from the dialplate when the hour is struck or like those where a ship sails across the face of the clock and is seen tossing up and down on the waves as often as the pendulum vibrates  indeed there was some ground for supposing that isaac would devote himself to the manufacture of clocks since he had already made one of a kind which nobody had ever heard of before  it was set agoing not by wheels and weights like other clocks but by the dropping of water this was an object of great wonderment to all the people round about and it must be confessed that there are few boys or men either who could contrive to tell what oclock it is by means of a bowl of water  besides the waterclock isaac made a sundial  thus his grandmother was never at a loss to know the hour for the waterclock would tell it in the shade and the dial in the sunshine  the sundial is said to be still in existence at woolsthorpe on the corner of the house where isaac dwelt  if so it must have marked the passage of every sunny hour that has elapsed since isaac newton was a boy  it marked all the famous moments of his life it marked the hour of his death and still the sunshine creeps slowly over it as regularly as when isaac first set it up  yet we must not say that the sundial has lasted longer than its maker for isaac newton will exist long after the dialyes and long after the sun itselfshall have crumbled to decay  isaac possessed a wonderful faculty of acquiring knowledge by the simplest means  for instance what method do you suppose he took to find out the strength of the wind  you will never guess how the boy could compel that unseen inconstant and ungovernable wonder the wind to tell him the measure of its strength  yet nothing can be more simple  he jumped against the wind and by the length of his jump he could calculate the force of a gentle breeze a brisk gale or a tempest  thus even in his boyish sports he was continually searching out the secrets of philosophy  not far from his grandmothers residence there was a windmill which operated on a new plan  isaac was in the habit of going thither frequently and would spend whole hours in examining its various parts while the mill was at rest he pried into its internal machinery  when its broad sails were set in motion by the wind he watched the process by which the millstones were made to revolve and crush the grain that was put into the hopper  after gaining a thorough knowledge of its construction he was observed to be unusually busy with his tools  it was not long before his grandmother and all the neighborhood knew what isaac had been about  he had constructed a model of the windmill though not so large i suppose as one of the box traps which boys set to catch squirrels yet every part of the mill and is machinery was complete  its little sails were neatly made of linen and whirled round very swiftly when the mill was placed in a draught of air  even a puff of wind from isaacs mouth or from a pair of bellows was sufficient to set the sails in motion  and what was most curious if a handful of grains of wheat were put into the little hopper they would soon be converted into snowwhite flour  isaacs playmates were enchanted with his new windmill  they thought that nothing so pretty and so wonderful had ever been seen in the whole world  but isaac said one of them you have forgotten one thing that belongs to a mill  what is that asked isaac for he supposed that from the roof of the mill to its foundation he had forgotten nothing  why where is the miller  said his friend  that is truei must look out for one said isaac and he set himself to consider how the deficiency should be supplied  he might easily have made the miniature figure of a man but then it would not have been able to move about and perform the duties of a miller  as captain lemuel gulliver had not yet discovered the island of lilliput isaac did not know that there were little men in the world whose size was just suited to his windmill  it so happened however that a mouse had just been caught in the trap and as no other miller could be found mr mouse was appointed to that important office  the new miller made a very respectable appearance in his dark gray coat  to be sure he had not a very good character for honesty and was suspected of sometimes stealing a portion of the grain which was given him to grind  but perhaps some twolegged millers are quite as dishonest as this small quadruped  as isaac grew older it was found that he had far more important matters in his mind than the manufacture of toys like the little windmill  all day long if left to himself he was either absorbed in thought or engaged in some book of mathematics or natural philosophy  at night i think it probable he looked up with reverential curiosity to the stars and wondered whether they were worlds like our own and how great was their distance from the earth and what was the power that kept them in their courses  perhaps even so early in life isaac newton felt a presentiment that he should be able hereafter to answer all these questions  when isaac was fourteen years old his mothers second husband being now dead she wished her son to leave school and assist her in managing the farm at woolsthorpe  for a year or two therefore he tried to turn his attention to farming  but his mind was so bent on becoming a scholar that his mother sent him back to school and afterwards to the university of cambridge  i have now finished my anecdotes of isaac newtons boyhood  my story would be far too long were i to mention all the splendid discoveries which he made after he came to be a man  he was the first that found out the nature of light for before his day nobody could tell what the sunshine was composed of  you remember i suppose the story of an apples falling on his head and thus leading him to discover the force of gravitation which keeps the heavenly bodies in their courses  when he had once got hold of this idea he never permitted his mind to rest until he had searched out all the laws by which the planets are guided through the sky  this he did as thoroughly as if he had gone up among the stars and tracked them in their orbits  the boy had found out the mechanism of a windmill the man explained to his fellowmen the mechanism of the universe  while making these researches he was accustomed to spend night after night in a lofty tower gazing at the heavenly bodies through a telescope  his mind was lifted far above the things of this world he may be said indeed to have spent the greater part of his life in worlds that lie thousands and millions of miles away for where the thoughts and the heart are there is our true existence  did you never hear the story of newton and his little dog diamond one day when he was fifty years old and had been hard at work more than twenty years studying the theory of light he went out of his chamber leaving his little dog asleep before the fire  on the table lay a heap of manuscript papers containing all the discoveries which newton had made during those twenty years  when his master was gone up rose little diamond jumped upon the table and overthrew the lighted candle  the papers immediately caught fire  just as the destruction was completed newton opened the chamber door and perceived that the labors of twenty years were reduced to a heap of ashes  there stood little diamond the author of all the mischief almost any other man would have sentenced the dog to immediate death but newton patted him on the head with his usual kindness although grief was at his heart  o diamond diamond exclaimed he thou little knowest the mischief then hast done  this incident affected his health and spirits for some time afterwards but from his conduct towards the little dog you may judge what was the sweetness of his temper  newton lived to be a very old man and acquired great renown and was made a member of parliament and received the honor of knighthood from the king  but he cared little for earthly fame and honors and felt no pride in the vastness of his knowledge  all that he had learned only made him feel how little he knew in comparison to what remained to be known  i seem to myself like a child observed he playing on the seashore and picking up here and there a curious shell or a pretty pebble while the boundless ocean of truth lies undiscovered before me  at last in 1727 when he was fourscore and five years old sir isaac newton diedor rather he ceased to live on earth  we may be permitted to believe that he is still searching out the infinite wisdom and goodness of the creator as earnestly and with even more success than while his spirit animated a mortal body  he has left a fame behind him which will be as endurable as if his name were written in letters of light formed by the stars upon the midnight sky  i love to hear about mechanical contrivances such as the waterclock and the little windmill remarked george  i suppose if sir isaac newton had only thought of it he might have found out the steamengine and railroads and all the other famous inventions that have come into use since his day  very possibly he might replied mr temple and no doubt a great many people would think it more useful to manufacture steamengines than to search out the system of the universe  other great astronomers besides newton have been endowed with mechanical genius  there was david rittenhouse an americanlie made a perfect little watermill when he was only seven or eight years old  but this sort of ingenuity is but a mere trifle in comparison with the other talents of such men  it must have been beautiful said edward to spend whole nights in a high tower as newton did gazing at the stars and the comets and the meteors  but what would newton have done had he been blind or if his eyes had been no better than mine  why even then my dear child observed mrs temple he would have found out some way of enlightening his mind and of elevating his soul but come little emily is waiting to bid you good night  you must go to sleep and dream of seeing all our faces  but how sad it will be when i awake murmured edward    chapter iv  in the course of the next day the harmony of our little family was disturbed by something like a quarrel between george and edward  the former though he loved his brother dearly had found it quite too great a sacrifice of his own enjoyments to spend all his playtime in a darkened chamber  edward on the other hand was inclined to be despotic  he felt as if his bandaged eyes entitled him to demand that everybody who enjoyed the blessing of sight should contribute to his comfort and amusement  he therefore insisted that george instead of going out to play at football should join with himself and emily in a game of questions and answers  george resolutely refused and ran out of the house  he did not revisit edwards chamber till the evening when he stole in looking confused yet somewhat sullen and sat down beside his fathers chair  it was evident by a motion of edwards head and a slight trembling of his lips that he was aware of georges entrance though his footsteps had been almost inaudible  emily with her serious and earnest little face looked from one to the other as if she longed to be a messenger of peace between them  mr temple without seeming to notice any of these circumstances began a story  samuel johnson  born 1709  died 1784  sam said mr michael johnson of lichfield one morning i am very feeble and ailing today  you must go to uttoxeter in my stead and tend the bookstall in the marketplace there  this was spoken above a hundred years ago by an elderly man who had once been a thriving bookseller at lichfield in england  being now in reduced circumstances he was forced to go every marketday and sell books at a stall in the neighboring village of uttoxeter  his son to whom mr johnson spoke was a great boy of very singular aspect  he had an intelligent face but it was seamed and distorted by a scrofulous humor which affected his eyes so badly that sometimes he was almost blind  owing to the same cause his head would often shake with a tremulous motion as if he were afflicted with the palsy  when sam was an infant the famous queen anne had tried to cure him of this disease by laying her royal hands upon his head  but though the touch of a king or queen was supposed to be a certain remedy for scrofula it produced no good effect upon sam johnson  at the time which we speak of the poor lad was not very well dressed and wore shoes from which his toes peeped out for his old father had barely the means of supporting his wife and children  but poor as the family were young sam johnson had as much pride as any noblemans son in england  the fact was he felt conscious of uncommon sense and ability which in his own opinion entitled him to great respect from the world  perhaps he would have been glad if grown people had treated him as reverentially as his schoolfellows did  three of them were accustomed to come for him every morning and while he sat upon the back of one the two others supported him on each side and thus he rode to school in triumph  being a personage of so much importance sam could not bear the idea of standing all day in uttoxeter market offering books to the rude and ignorant country people  doubtless he felt the more reluctant on account of his shabby clothes and the disorder of his eyes and the tremulous motion of his head  when mr michael johnson spoke sam pouted and made an indistinct grumbling in his throat then he looked his old father in the face and answered him loudly and deliberately  sir said he i will not go to uttoxeter market  mr johnson had seen a great deal of the lads obstinacy ever since his birth and while sam was younger the old gentleman had probably used the rod whenever occasion seemed to require  but he was now too feeble and too much out of spirits to contend with this stubborn and violenttempered boy  he therefore gave up the point at once and prepared to go to uttoxeter himself  well sam said mr johnson as he took his hat and staff if for the sake of your foolish pride you can suffer your poor sick father to stand all day in the noise and confusion of the market when he ought to be in his bed i have no more to say  but you will think of this sam when i am dead and gone  so the poor old man perhaps with a tear in his eye but certainly with sorrow in his heart set forth towards uttoxeter  the grayhaired feeble melancholy michael johnson  how sad a thing it was that he should be forced to go in his sickness and toil for the support of an ungrateful son who was too proud to do anything for his father or his mother or himself  sam looked after mr johnson with a sullen countenance till he was out of sight  but when the old mans figure as he went stooping along the street was no more to be seen the boys heart began to smite him  he had a vivid imagination and it tormented him with the image of his father standing in the marketplace of uttoxeter and offering his books to the noisy crowd around him  sam seemed to behold him arranging his literary merchandise upon the stall in such a way as was best calculated to attract notice  here was addisons spectator a long row of little volumes here was popes translation of the iliad and odyssey here were drydens poems or those of prior  here likewise were gullivers travels and a variety of little giltcovered childrens books such as tom thumb jack the giant queller mother gooses melodies and others which our greatgrandparents used to read in their childhood  and here were sermons for the pious and pamphlets for the politicians and ballads some merry and some dismal ones for the country people to sing  sam in imagination saw his father offer these books pamphlets and ballads now to the rude yeomen who perhaps could not read a word now to the country squires who cared for nothing but to hunt hares and foxes now to the children who chose to spend their coppers for sugarplums or gingerbread rather than for picturebooks  and if mr johnson should sell a book to man woman or child it would cost him an hours talk to get a profit of only sixpence  my poor father thought sam to himself  how his head will ache  and how heavy his heart will be  i am almost sorry that i did not do as he bade me  then the boy went to his mother who was busy about the house  she did not know of what had passed between mr johnson and sam  mother said he did you think father seemed very ill today  yes sam answered his mother turning with a flushed face from the fire where she was cooking their scanty dinner  your father did look very ill and it is a pity he did not send you to uttoxeter in his stead  you are a great boy now and would rejoice i am sure to do something for your poor father who has done so much for you  the lad made no reply  but again his imagination set to work and conjured up another picture of poor michael johnson  he was standing in the hot sunshine of the marketplace and looking so weary sick and disconsolate that the eyes of all the crowd were drawn to him  had this old man no son the people would say among themselves who might have taken his place at the bookstall while the father kept his bed and perhaps but this was a terrible thought for samperhaps his father would faint away and fall down in the marketplace with his gray hair in the dust and his venerable face as deathlike as that of a corpse  and there would be the bystanders gazing earnestly at mr johnson and whispering is he dead  is he dead  and sam shuddered as he repeated to himself is he dead  o i have been a cruel son thought he within his own heart  god forgive me  god forgive me  but god could not yet forgive him for he was not truly penitent  had he been so he would have hastened away that very moment to uttoxeter and have fallen at his fathers feet even in the midst of the crowded marketplace  there he would have confessed his fault and besought mr johnson to go home and leave the rest of the days work to him  but such was sams pride and natural stubbornness that he could not bring himself to this humiliation  yet he ought to have done so for his own sake for his fathers sake and for gods sake  after sunset old michael johnson came slowly home and sat down in his customary chair  he said nothing to sam nor do i know that a single word ever passed between them on the subject of the sons disobedience in a few years his father died and left sam to fight his way through the world by himself  it would make our story much too long were i to tell you even a few of the remarkable events of sams life  moreover there is the less need of this because many books have been written about that poor boy and the fame that he acquired and all that he did or talked of doing after he came to be a man  but one thing i must not neglect to say  from his boyhood upward until the latest day of his life he never forgot the story of uttoxeter market  often when he was a scholar of the university of oxford or master of an academy at edial or a writer for the london booksellersin all his poverty and toil and in all his successwhile he was walking the streets without a shilling to buy food or when the greatest men of england were proud to feast him at their tablestill that heavy and remorseful thought came back to him i was cruel to my poor father in his illness  many and many a time awake or in his dreams he seemed to see old michael johnson standing in the dust and confusion of the marketplace and pressing his withered hand to his forehead as if it ached  alas my dear children it is a sad thing to have such a thought as this to bear us company through life  though the story was but half finished yet as it was longer than usual mr temple here made a short pause  he perceived that emily was in tears and edward turned his halfveiled face towards the speaker with an air of great earnestness and interest  as for george he had withdrawn into the dusky shadow behind his fathers chair    chapter v  in a few moments mr temple resumed the story as follows   samuel johnson  continued  well my children fifty years had passed away since young sam johnson had shown himself so hardhearted towards his father  it was now marketday in the village of uttoxeter  in the street of the village you might see cattledealers with cows and oxen for sale and pigdrovers with herds of squeaking swine and farmers with cartloads of cabbages turnips onions and all other produce of the soil  now and then a farmers redfaced wife trotted along on horseback with butter and cheese in two large panniers  the people of the village with country squires and other visitors from the neighborhood walked hither and thither trading jesting quarrelling and making just such a bustle as their fathers and grandfathers had made half a century before  in one part of the street there was a puppetshow with a ridiculous merryandrew who kept both grown people and children in a roar of laughter  on the opposite side was the old stone church of uttoxeter with ivy climbing up its walls and partly obscuring its gothic windows  there was a clock in the gray tower of the ancient church and the hands on the dialplate had now almost reached the hour of noon  at this busiest hour of the market a strange old gentleman was seen making his way among the crowd he was very tall and bulky and wore a brown coat and smallclothes with black worsted stockings and buckled shoes  on his head was a three cornered hat beneath which a bushy gray wig thrust itself out all in disorder  the old gentleman elbowed the people aside and forced his way through the midst of them with a singular kind of gait rolling his body hither and thither so that he needed twice as much room as any other person there  make way sir he would cry out in a loud harsh voice when somebody happened to interrupt his progress  sir you intrude your person into the public thoroughfare  what a queer old fellow this is muttered the people among themselves hardly knowing whether to laugh or to be angry  but when they looked into the venerable strangers face not the most thoughtless among them dared to offer him the least impertinence though his features were scarred and distorted with the scrofula and though his eyes were dim and bleared yet there was something of authority and wisdom in his look which impressed them all with awe  so they stood aside to let him pass and the old gentleman made his way across the marketplace and paused near the corner of the ivymantled church  just as he reached it the clock struck twelve  on the very spot of ground where the stranger now stood some aged people remembered that old michael johnson had formerly kept his bookstall the little children who had once bought picturebooks of him were grandfathers now  yes here is the very spot muttered the old gentleman to himself  there this unknown personage took his stand and removed the threecornered hat from his head  it was the busiest hour of the day  what with the hum of human voices the lowing of cattle the squeaking of pigs and the laughter caused by the merryandrew the marketplace was in very great confusion  but the stranger seemed not to notice it any more than if the silence of a desert were around him  he was rapt in his own thoughts  sometimes he raised his furrowed brow to heaven as if in prayer sometimes he bent his head as if an insupportable weight of sorrow were upon him  it increased the awfulness of his aspect that there was a motion of his head and an almost continual tremor throughout his frame with singular twitches and contortions of his features  the hot sun blazed upon his unprotected head but he seemed not to feel its fervor  a dark cloud swept across the sky and raindrops pattered into the marketplace but the stranger heeded not the shower  the people began to gaze at the mysterious old gentleman with superstitious fear and wonder  who could he be  whence did he come  wherefore was he standing bareheaded in the marketplace  even the schoolboys left the merryandrew and came to gaze with wideopen eyes at this tall strangelooking old man  there was a cattledrover in the village who had recently made a journey to the smithfield market in london  no sooner had this man thrust his way through the throng and taken a look at the unknown personage than he whispered to one of his acquaintances  i say neighbor hutchins would ye like to know who this old gentleman is  ay that i would replied neighbor hutchins for a queerer chap i never saw in my life  somehow it makes me feel small to look at him hes more than a common man  you may well say so answered the cattledrover  why thats the famous doctor samuel johnson who they say is the greatest and learnedest man in england  i saw him in london streets walking with one mr boswell  yes the poor boy the friendless sam with whom we began our story had become the famous doctor samuel johnson  he was universally acknowledged as the wisest man and greatest writer in all england  he had given shape and permanence to his native language by his dictionary thousands upon thousands of people had read his idler his rambler and his rasselas  noble and wealthy men and beautiful ladies deemed it their highest privilege to be his companions  even the king of great britain had sought his acquaintance and told him what an honor he considered it that such a man had been born in his dominions  he was now at the summit of literary renown  but all his fame could not extinguish the bitter remembrance which had tormented him through life  never never had he forgotten his fathers sorrowful and upbraiding look  never though the old mans troubles had been over so many years had he forgiven himself for inflicting such a pang upon his heart  and now in his old age he had come hither to do penance by standing at noonday in the marketplace of uttoxeter on the very spot where michael johnson had once kept his bookstall  the aged and illustrious man had done what the poor boy refused to do  by thus expressing his deep repentance and humiliation of heart he hoped to gain peace of conscience and the forgiveness of god  my dear children if you have grieved i will not say your parents but if you have grieved the heart of any human being who has a claim upon your love then think of samuel johnsons penance  will it not be better to redeem the error now than to endure the agony of remorse for fifty years  would you not rather say to a brother i have erred forgive me than perhaps to go hereafter and shed bitter tears upon his grave  hardly was the story concluded when george hastily arose and edward likewise stretching forth his hands into the darkness that surrounded him to find his brother  both accused themselves of unkindness each besought the others forgiveness and having done so the trouble of their hearts vanished away like a dream  i am glad  i am so glad said emily in a low earnest voice  now i shall sleep quietly tonight  my sweet child thought mrs temple as she kissed her mayest thou never know how much strife there is on earth  it would cost thee many a nights rest    chapter vi  about this period mr temple found it necessary to take a journey which interrupted the series of biographical stories for several evenings  in the interval edward practised various methods of employing and amusing his mind  sometimes he meditated upon beautiful objects which he had formerly seen until the intensity of his recollection seemed to restore him the gift of sight and place everything anew before his eyes  sometimes he repeated verses of poetry which he did not know to be in his memory until he found them there just at the time of need  sometimes he attempted to solve arithmetical questions which had perplexed him while at school  then with his mothers assistance he learned the letters of the string alphabet which is used in some of the institutions for the blind in europe  when one of his friends gave him a leaf of st marks gospel printed in embossed characters he endeavored to read it by passing his fingers over the letters as blind children do  his brother george was now very kind and spent so much time in the darkened chamber that edward often insisted upon his going out to play george told him all about the affairs at school and related many amusing incidents that happened among his comrades and informed him what sports were now in fashion and whose kite soared the highest and whose little ship sailed fleetest on the frog pond  as for emily she repeated stories which she had learned from a new book called the flower people in which the snowdrops the violets the columbines the roses and all that lovely tribe are represented as telling their secrets to a little girl  the flowers talked sweetly as flowers should and edward almost fancied that he could behold their bloom and smell their fragrant breath  thus in one way or another the dark days of edwards confinement passed not unhappily  in due time his father returned and the next evening when the family were assembled he began a story  i must first observe children said he that some writers deny the truth of the incident which i am about to relate to you  there certainly is but little evidence in favor of it  other respectable writers however tell it for a fact and at all events it is an interesting story and has an excellent moral  so mr temple proceeded to talk about the early days of   oliver cromwell  born 1599  died 1658  not long after king james i took the place of queen elizabeth on the throne of england there lived an english knight at a place called hinchinbrooke  his name was sir oliver cromwell  he spent his life i suppose pretty much like other english knights and squires in those days bunting hares and foxes and drinking large quantities of ale and wine  the old house in which he dwelt had been occupied by his ancestors before him for a good many years  in it there was a great hall hang round with coats of arms and helmets cuirasses and swords which his forefathers had used in battle and with horns of deer and tails of foxes which they or sir oliver himself had killed in the chase  this sir oliver cromwell had a nephew who had been called oliver after himself but who was generally known in the family by the name of little noll  his father was a younger brother of sir oliver  the child was often sent to visit his uncle who probably found him a troublesome little fellow to take care of  he was forever in mischief and always running into some danger or other from which he seemed to escape only by miracle  even while he was an infant in the cradle a strange accident had befallen hum  a huge ape which was kept in the family snatched up little noll in his fore paws and clambered with him to the roof of the house  there this ugly beast sat grinning at the affrighted spectators as if it had done the most praiseworthy thing imaginable  fortunately however he brought the child safe down again and the event was afterwards considered an omen that noll would reach a very elevated station in the world  one morning when noll was five or six years old a royal messenger arrived at hinchinbrooke with tidings that king james was coming to dine with sir oliver cromwell  this was a high honor to be sure but a very great trouble for all the lords and ladies knights squires guards and yeomen who waited on the king were to be feasted as well as himself and more provisions would be eaten and more wine drunk in that one day than generally in a month  however sir oliver expressed much thankfulness for the kings intended visit and ordered his butler and cook to make the best preparations in their power  so a great fire was kindled in the kitchen and the neighbors knew by the smoke which poured out of the chimney that boiling baking stewing roasting and frying were going on merrily  by and by the sound of trumpets was heard approaching nearer and nearer a heavy oldfashioned coach surrounded by guards on horseback drove up to the house  sir oliver with his hat in his hand stood at the gate to receive the king  his majesty was dressed in a suit of green not very new he had a feather in his hat and a triple ruff round his neck and over his shoulder was slung a huntinghorn instead of a sword altogether he had not the most dignified aspect in the world but the spectators gazed at him as if there was something superhuman and divine in his person  they even shaded their eyes with their hands as if they were dazzled by the glory of his countenance  how are ye man cried king james speaking in a scotch accent for scotland was his native country  by my crown sir oliver but i am glad to see ye  the good knight thanked the king at the same time kneeling down while his majesty alighted  when king james stood on the ground he directed sir olivers attention to a little boy who had come with him in the coach  he was six or seven years old and wore a hat and feather and was more richly dressed than the king himself  though by no means an illlooking child he seemed shy or even sulky and his cheeks were rather pale as if he had been kept moping within doors instead of being sent out to play in the sun and wind  i have brought my son charlie to see ye said the king  i hope sir oliver ye have a son of your own to be his playmate  sir oliver cromwell made a reverential bow to the little prince whom one of the attendants had now taken out of the coach  it was wonderful to see how all the spectators even the aged men with their gray beards humbled themselves before this child  they bent their bodies till their beards almost swept the dust they looked as if they were ready to kneel down and worship him  the poor little prince  from his earliest infancy not a soul had dared to contradict him everybody around him had acted as if he were a superior being so that of course he had imbibed the same opinion of himself  he naturally supposed that the whole kingdom of great britain and all its inhabitants had been created solely for his benefit and amusement  this was a sad mistake and it cost him dear enough after he had ascended his fathers throne  what a noble little prince he is  exclaimed sir oliver lifting his hands in admiration  no please your majesty i have no son to be the playmate of his royal highness but there is a nephew of mine somewhere about the house  he is near the princes age and will be but too happy to wait upon his royal highness  send for him man send for him said the king  but as it happened there was no need of sending for master noll while king james was speaking a rugged boldfaced sturdy little urchin thrust himself through the throng of courtiers and attendants and greeted the prince with a broad stare  his doublet and hose which had been put on new and clean in honor of the kings visit were already soiled and torn with the rough play in which he had spent the morning he looked no more abashed than if king james were his uncle and the prince one of his customary playfellows  this was little noll himself  here please your majesty is my nephew said sir oliver somewhat ashamed of nolls appearance and demeanor  oliver make your obeisance to the kings majesty  the boy made a pretty respectful obeisance to the king for in those days children were taught to pay reverence to their elders  king james who prided himself greatly on his scholarship asked noll a few questions in the latin grammar and then introduced him to his son  the little prince in a very grave and dignified manner extended his hand not for noll to shake but that he might kneel down and kiss it  nephew said sir oliver pay your duty to the prince  i owe him no duty cried noll thrusting aside the princes hand with a rude laugh  why should i kiss that boys hand  all the courtiers were amazed and confounded and sir oliver the most of all  but the king laughed heartily saying that little noll had a stubborn english spirit and that it was well for his son to learn betimes what sort of a people he was to rule over  so king james and his train entered the house and the prince with noll and some other children was sent to play in a separate room while his majesty was at dinner  the young people soon became acquainted for boys whether the sons of monarchs or of peasants all like play and are pleased with one anothers society  what games they diverted themselves with i cannot tell  perhaps they played at ball perhaps at blindmansbuff perhaps at leapfrog perhaps at prisonbars  such games have been in use for hundreds of years and princes as well as poor children have spent some of their happiest hours in playing at them  meanwhile king james and his nobles were feasting with sir oliver in the great hall  the king sat in a gilded chair under a canopy at the head of a long table  whenever any of the company addressed him it was with the deepest reverence  if the attendants offered him wine or the various delicacies of the festival it was upon their bended knees  you would have thought by these tokens of worship that the monarch was a supernatural being only he seemed to have quite as much need of those vulgar matters food and drink as any other person at the table  but fate had ordained that good king james should not finish his dinner in peace  all of a sudden there arose a terrible uproar in the room where the children were at play  angry shouts and shrill cries of alarm were mixed up together while the voices of elder persons were likewise heard trying to restore order among the children  the king and everybody else at table looked aghast for perhaps the tumult made them think that a general rebellion had broken out  mercy on us muttered sir oliver that graceless nephew of mine is in some mischief or other  the naughty little whelp  getting up from table he ran to see what was the matter followed by many of the guests and the king among them  they all crowded to the door of the playroom  on looking in they beheld the little prince charles with his rich dress all torn and covered with the dust of the floor  his royal blood was streaming from his nose in great abundance  he gazed at noll with a mixture of rage and affright and at the same time a puzzled expression as if he could not understand how any mortal boy should dare to give him a beating  as for noll there stood his sturdy little figure bold as a lion looking as if he were ready to fight not only the prince but the king and kingdom too  you little villain cried his uncle  what have you been about  down on your knees this instant and ask the princes pardon  how dare you lay your hands on the kings majestys royal son  he struck me first grumbled the valiant little noll and ive only given him his due  sir oliver and the guests lifted up their hands in astonishment and horror  no punishment seemed severe enough for this wicked little varlet who had dared to resent a blow from the kings own son  some of the courtiers were of opinion that noll should be sent prisoner to the tower of london and brought to trial for high treason  others in their great zeal for the kings service were about to lay hands on the boy and chastise him in the royal presence  but king james who sometimes showed a good deal of sagacity ordered them to desist  thou art a bold boy said he looking fixedly at little noll and if thou live to be a man my son charlie would do wisely to be friends with thee  i never will cried the little prince stamping his foot  peace charlie peace  said the king then addressing sir oliver and the attendants harm not the urchin for he has taught my son a good lesson if heaven do but give him grace to profit by it  hereafter should he be tempted to tyrannize over the stubborn race of englishmen let him remember little noll cromwell and his own bloody nose  so the king finished his dinner and departed and for many a long year the childish quarrel between prince charles and noll cromwell was forgotten  the prince indeed might have lived a happier life and have met a more peaceful death had he remembered that quarrel and the moral which his father drew from it  but when old king james was dead and charles sat upon his throne he seemed to forget that he was but a man and that his meanest subjects were men as well as he  he wished to have the property and lives of the people of england entirely at his own disposal  but the puritans and all who loved liberty rose against him and beat him in many battles and pulled him down from his throne  throughout this war between the king and nobles on one side and the people of england on the other there was a famous leader who did more towards the ruin of royal authority than all the rest  the contest seemed like a wrestlingmatch between king charles and this strong man and the king was overthrown  when the discrowned monarch was brought to trial that warlike leader sat in the judgment hall  many judges were present besides himself but he alone had the power to save king charles or to doom him to the scaffold  after sentence was pronounced this victorious general was entreated by his own children on their knees to rescue his majesty from death  no  said he sternly  better that one man should perish than that the whole country should be ruined for his sake  it is resolved that he shall die  when charles no longer a king was led to the scaffold his great enemy stood at a window of the royal palace of whitehall  he beheld the poor victim of pride and an evil education and misused power as he laid his head upon the block  he looked on with a steadfast gaze while a blackveiled executioner lifted the fatal axe and smote off that anointed head at a single blow  it is a righteous deed perhaps he said to himself  now englishmen may enjoy their rights  at night when the body of charles was laid in the coffin in a gloomy chamber the general entered lighting himself with a torch  its gleams showed that he was now growing old his visage was scarred with the many battles in which he had led the van his brow was wrinkled with care and with the continual exercise of stern authority  probably there was not a single trait either of aspect or manner that belonged to the little noll who had battled so stoutly with prince charles  yet this was he  he lifted the coffinlid and caused the light of his torch to fall upon the dead monarchs face  then probably his mind went back over all the marvellous events that had brought the hereditary king of england to this dishonored coffin and had raised himself a humble individual to the possession of kingly power  he was a king though without the empty title or the glittering crown  why was it said cromwell to himself or might have said as he gazed at the pale features in the coffinwhy was it that this great king fell and that poor noll cromwell has gained all the power of the realm  and indeed why was it  king charles had fallen because in his manhood the same as when a child he disdained to feel that every human creature was his brother he deemed himself a superior being and fancied that his subjects were created only for a king to rule over  and cromwell rose because in spite of his many faults he mainly fought for the rights and freedom of his fellowmen and therefore the poor and the oppressed all lent their strength to him  dear father how i should hate to be a king  exclaimed edward  and would you like to be a cromwell inquired his father  i should like it well replied george only i would not have put the poor old king to death  i would have sent him out of the kingdom or perhaps have allowed him to live in a small house near the gate of the royal palace  it was too severe to cut off his head  kings are in such an unfortunate position said mr temple that they must either be almost deified by their subjects or else be dethroned and beheaded  in either case it is a pitiable lot  o i had rather be blind than be a king said edward  well my dear edward observed his mother with a smile i am glad you are convinced that your own lot is not the hardest in the world    chapter vii  it was a pleasant sight for those who had eyes to see how patiently the blinded little boy now submitted to what he had at first deemed an intolerable calamity  the beneficent creator has not allowed our comfort to depend on the enjoyment of any single sense  though he has made the world so very beautiful yet it is possible to be happy without ever be holding the blue sky or the green and flowery earth or the kind faces of those whom we love  thus it appears that all the external beauty of the universe is a free gift from god over and above what is necessary to our comfort  how grateful then should we be to that divine benevolence which showers even superfluous bounties upon us  one truth therefore which edwards blindness had taught him was that his mind and soul could dispense with the assistance of his eyes doubtless however he would have found this lesson far more difficult to learn had it not been for the affection of those around him  his parents and george and emily aided him to bear his misfortune if possible they would have lent him their own eyes  and this too was a good lesson for him  it taught him how dependent on one another god has ordained us to be insomuch that all the necessities of mankind should incite them to mutual love  so edward loved his friends and perhaps all the world better than he ever did before  and he felt grateful towards his father for spending the evenings in telling him storiesmore grateful probably than any of my little readers will feel towards me for so carefully writing these same stories down  come dear father said he the next evening now tell us about some other little boy who was destined to be a famous man  how would you like a story of a boston boy asked his father  o pray let us have it cried george eagerly  it will be all the better if he has been to our schools and has coasted on the common and sailed boats in the frog pond  i shall feel acquainted with him then  well then said mr temple i will introduce you to a boston boy whom all the world became acquainted with after he grew to be a man  the story was as follows    benjamin franklin  born 1706  died 1790  in the year 1716 or about that period a boy used to be seen in the streets of boston who was known among his schoolfellows and playmates by the name of ben franklin  ben was born in 1706 so that he was now about ten years old  his father who had come over from england was a soapboiler and tallowchandler and resided in milk street not far from the old south church  ben was a bright boy at his book and even a brighter one when at play with his comrades  he had some remarkable qualities which always seemed to give him the lead whether at sport or in more serious matters  i might tell you a number of amusing anecdotes about him  you are acquainted i suppose with his famous story of the whistle and how he bought it with a whole pocketful of coppers and afterwards repented of his bargain  but ben had grown a great boy since those days and had gained wisdom by experience for it was one of his peculiarities that no incident ever happened to him without teaching him some valuable lesson  thus he generally profited more by his misfortunes than many people do by the most favorable events that could befall them  bens face was already pretty well known to the inhabitants of boston the selectmen and other people of note often used to visit his father for the sake of talking about the affairs of the town or province  mr franklin was considered a person of great wisdom and integrity and was respected by all who knew him although he supported his family by the humble trade of boiling soap and making tallow candles  while his father and the visitors were holding deep consultations about public affairs little ben would sit on his stool in a corner listening with the greatest interest as if he understood every word  indeed his features were so full of intelligence that there could be but little doubt not only that he understood what was said but that he could have expressed some very sagacious opinions out of his own mind  but in those days boys were expected to be silent in the presence of their elders  however ben franklin was looked upon as a very promising lad who would talk and act wisely by and by  neighbor franklin his fathers friends would sometimes say you ought to send this boy to college and make a minister of him  i have often thought of it his father would reply and my brother benjamin promises to give him a great many volumes of manuscript sermons in case he should be educated for the church  but i have a large family to support and cannot afford the expense  in fact mr franklin found it so difficult to provide bread for his family that when the boy was ten years old it became necessary to take him from school  ben was then employed in cutting candlewicks into equal lengths and filling the moulds with tallow and many families in boston spent their evenings by the light of the candles which he had helped to make  thus you see in his early days as well as in his manhood his labors contributed to throw light upon dark matters  busy as his life now was ben still found time to keep company with his former schoolfellows  he and the other boys were very fond of fishing and spent many of their leisure hours on the margin of the millpond catching flounders perch eels and tomcod which came up thither with the tide  the place where they fished is now probably covered with stone pavements and brick buildings and thronged with people and with vehicles of all kinds  but at that period it was a marshy spot on the outskirts of the town where gulls flitted and screamed overhead and saltmeadow grass grew under foot  on the edge of the water there was a deep bed of clay in which the boys were forced to stand while they caught their fish  here they dabbled in mud and mire like a flock of ducks  this is very uncomfortable said ben franklin one day to his comrades while they were standing midleg deep in the quagmire  so it is said the other boys  what a pity we have no better place to stand  if it mad not been for ben nothing more would have been done or said about the matter  butt it was not in his nature to be sensible of an inconvenience without using his best efforts to find a remedy  so as he and his comrades were returning from the waterside ben suddenly threw down his string of fish with a very determined air  boys cried he i have thought of a scheme which will be greatly for our benefit and for the public benefit  it was queer enough to be sure to hear this little chapthis rosycheeked tenyearold boytalking about schemes for the public benefit  nevertheless his companions were ready to listen being assured that bens scheme whatever it was would be well worth their attention they remembered how sagaciously he had conducted all their enterprises ever since he had been old enough to wear smallclothes  they remembered too his wonderful contrivance of sailing across the millpond by lying flat on his back in the water and allowing himself to be drawn along by a paper kite  if ben could do that he might certainly do anything  what is your scheme benwhat is it cried they all  it so happened that they had now come to a spot of ground where a new house was to be built  scattered round about lay a great many large stones which were to be used for the cellar and foundation  ben mounted upon the highest of these stones so that he might speak with the more authority  you know lads said he what a plague it is to be forced to stand in the quagmire yonderover shoes and stockings if we wear any in mud and water  see i am bedaubed to the knees of my smallclothes and you are all in the same pickle  unless we can find some remedy for this evil our fishing business must be entirely given up  and surely this would be a terrible misfortune  that it would that it would  said his comrades sorrowfully  now i propose continued master benjamin that we build a wharf for the purpose of carrying on our fisheries  you see these stones  the workmen mean to use them for the underpinning of a house but that would be for only one mans advantage  my plan is to take these same stones and carry them to the edge of the water and build a wharf with them this will not only enable us to carry on the fishing business with comfort and to better advantage but it will likewise be a great convenience to boats passing up and down the stream  thus instead of one man fifty or a hundred or a thousand besides ourselves may be benefited by these stones  what say you lads shall we build the wharf  bells proposal was received with one of those uproarious shouts wherewith boys usually express their delight at whatever completely suits their views  nobody thought of questioning the right and justice of building a wharf with stones that belonged to another person  hurrah hurrah shouted they  lets set about it  it was agreed that they should all be on the spot that evening and commence their grand public enterprise by moonlight  accordingly at the appointed time the whole gang of youthful laborers assembled and eagerly began to remove the stones  they had not calculated how much toil would be requisite in this important part of their undertaking the very first stone which they laid hold of proved so heavy that it almost seemed to be fastened to the ground  nothing but ben franklins cheerful and resolute spirit could have induced them to persevere  ben as might be expected was the soul of the enterprise  by his mechanical genius he contrived methods to lighten the labor of transporting the stones so that one boy under his directions would perform as much as half a dozen if left to themselves  whenever their spirits flagged he had some joke ready which seemed to renew their strength by setting them all into a roar of laughter  and when after an hour or two of hard work the stones were transported to the waterside bell franklin was the engineer to superintend the construction of the wharf  the boys like a colony of ants performed a great deal of labor by their multitude though the individual strength of each could have accomplished but little  finally just as the moon sank below the horizon the great work was finished  now boys cried ben lets give three cheers and go home to bed tomorrow we may catch fish at our ease  hurrah hurrah hurrah shouted his comrades  then they all went home in such an ecstasy of delight that they could hardly get a wink of sleep  the story was not yet finished but georges impatience caused him to interrupt it  how i wish that i could have helped to build that wharf exclaimed he it must have been glorious fun  ben franklin forever say i  it was a very pretty piece of work said mr temple  but wait till you hear the end of the story  father inquired edward whereabouts in boston was the millpond on which ben built his wharf  i do not exactly know answered mr temple but i suppose it to have been on the northern verge of the town in the vicinity of what are now called merrimack and charlestown streets  that thronged portion of the city was once a marsh  some of it in fact was covered with water    chapter viii  as the children had no more questions to ask mr temple proceeded to relate what consequences ensued from the building of bell franklins wharf   benjamin franklin  continued  in the morning when the early sunbeams were gleaming on the steeples and roofs of the town and gilding the water that surrounded it the masons came rubbing their eyes to begin their work at the foundation of the new house  but on reaching the spot they rubbed their eyes so much the harder  what had become of their heap of stones  why sam said one to another in great perplexity heres been some witchcraft at work while we were asleep  the stones must have flown away through the air  more likely they have been stolen answered sam  but who on earth would think of stealing a heap of stones cried a third  could a man carry them away in his pocket  the master mason who was a gruff kind of man stood scratching his head and said nothing at first  but looking carefully on the ground he discerned innumerable tracks of little feet some with shoes and some barefoot  following these tracks with his eye he saw that they formed a beaten path towards the waterside  ah i see what the mischief is said he nodding his head  those little rascals the boysthey have stolen our stones to build a wharf with  the masons immediately went to examine the new structure  and to say the truth it was well worth looking at so neatly and with such admirable skill had it been planned and finished  the stones were put together so securely that there was no danger of their being loosened by the tide however swiftly it might sweep along  there was a broad and safe platform to stand upon whence the little fishermen might cast their lines into deep water and draw up fish in abundance  indeed it almost seemed as if ben and his comrades might be forgiven for taking the stones because they had done their job in such a workmanlike manner  the chaps that built this wharf understood their business pretty well said one of the masons  i should not be ashamed of such a piece of work myself  but the master mason did not seem to enjoy the joke  he was one of those unreasonable people who care a great deal more for their own rights and privileges than for the convenience of all the rest of the world  sam said he more gruffly than usual go call a constable  so sam called a constable and inquiries were set on foot to discover the perpetrators of the theft  in the course of the day warrants were issued with the signature of a justice of the peace to take the bodies of benjamin franklin and other evildisposed persons who had stolen a heap of stones  if the owner of the stolen property had not been more merciful than the master mason it might have gone hard with our friend benjamin and his fellowlaborers  but luckily for them the gentleman had a respect for bens father and moreover was amused with the spirit of the whole affair  he therefore let the culprits off pretty easily  but when the constables were dismissed the poor boys had to go through another trial and receive sentence and suffer execution too from their own fathers  many a rod i grieve to say was worn to the stump on that unlucky night  as for ben he was less afraid of a whipping than of his fathers disapprobation  mr franklin as i have mentioned before was a sagacious man and also an inflexibly upright one  he had read much for a person in his rank of life and had pondered upon the ways of the world until he had gained more wisdom than a whole library of books could have taught him  ben had a greater reverence for his father than for any other person in the world as well on account of his spotless integrity as of his practical sense and deep views of things  consequently after being released from the clutches of the law ben came into his fathers presence with no small perturbation of mind  benjamin come hither began mr franklin in his customary solemn and weighty tone  the boy approached and stood before his fathers chair waiting reverently to hear what judgment this good man would pass upon his late offence  he felt that now the right and wrong of the whole matter would be made to appear  benjamin said his father what could induce you to take property which did not belong to you  why father replied ben hanging his head at first but then lifting eyes to mr franklins face if it had been merely for my own benefit i never should have dreamed of it  but i knew that the wharf would be a public convenience  if the owner of the stones should build a house with them nobody will enjoy any advantage except himself  now i made use of them in a way that was for the advantage of many persons  i thought it right to aim at doing good to the greatest number  my son said mr franklin solemnly so far as it was in your power you have done a greater harm to the public than to the owner of the stones  how can that he father asked ben  because answered his father in building your wharf with stolen materials you have committed a moral wrong  there is no more terrible mistake than to violate what is eternally right for the sake of a seeming expediency  those who act upon such a principle do the utmost in their power to destroy all that is good in the world  heaven forbid said benjamin  no act continued mr franklin can possibly be for the benefit of the public generally which involves injustice to any individual  it would be easy to prove this by examples  but indeed can we suppose that our allwise and just creator would have so ordered the affairs of the world that a wrong act should be the true method of attaining a right end  it is impious to think so  and i do verily believe benjamin that almost all the public and private misery of mankind arises from a neglect of this great truththat evil can produce only evilthat good ends must be wrought out by good means  i will never forget it again said benjamin bowing his head  remember concluded his father that whenever we vary from the highest rule of right just so far we do an injury to the world  it may seem otherwise for the moment but both in time and in eternity it will be found so  to the close of his life ben franklin never forgot this conversation with his father and we have reason to suppose that in most of his public and private career he endeavored to act upon the principles which that good and wise man had then taught him  after the great event of building the wharf ben continued to cut wickyarn and fill candlemoulds for about two years  but as he had no love for that occupation his father often took him to see various artisans at their work in order to discover what trade he would prefer  thus ben learned the use of a great many tools the knowledge of which afterwards proved very useful to him  but he seemed much inclined to go to sea  in order to keep him at home and likewise to gratify his taste for letters the lad was bound apprentice to his elder brother who had lately set up a printingoffice in boston  here he had many opportunities of reading new books and of hearing instructive conversation  he exercised himself so successfully in writing compositions that when no more than thirteen or fourteen years old he became a contributor to his brothers newspaper  ben was also a versifier if not a poet  he made two doleful balladsone about the shipwreck of captain worthilake and the other about the pirate black beard who not long before infested the american seas  when bens verses were printed his brother sent him to sell them to the townspeople wet from the press  buy my ballads shouted benjamin as he trudged through the streets with a basketful on his arm  wholl buy a ballad about black beard  a penny apiece a penny apiece  wholl buy my ballads  if one of those roughly composed and rudely printed ballads could be discovered now it would be worth more than its weight in gold  in this way our friend benjamin spent his boyhood and youth until on account of some disagreement with his brother he left his native town and went to philadelphia  he landed in the latter city a homeless and hungry young man and bought threepence worth of bread to satisfy his appetite  not knowing where else to go he entered a quaker meetinghouse sat down and fell fast asleep  he has not told us whether his slumbers were visited by any dreams  but it would have been a strange dream indeed and an incredible one that should have foretold how great a man he was destined to become and how much he would be honored in that very city where he was now friendless and unknown  so here we finish our story of the childhood of benjamin franklin  one of these days if you would know what he was in his manhood you must read his own works and the history of american independence  do let us hear a little more of him said edward not that i admire him so much as many other characters but he interests me because he was a yankee boy  my dear son replied mr temple it would require a whole volume of talk to tell you all that is worth knowing about benjamin franklin there is a very pretty anecdote of his flying a kite in the midst of a thunderstorm and thus drawing down the lightning from the clouds and proving that it was the same thing as electricity  his whole life would be an interesting story if we had time to tell it  but pray dear father tell us what made him so famous said george i have seen his portrait a great many tines  there is a wooden bust of him in one of our streets and marble ones i suppose in some other places  and towns and ships of war and steamboats and banks and academies and children are often named after franklin  why should he have grown so very famous  your question is a reasonable one george answered his father  i doubt whether franklins philosophical discoveries important as they were or even his vast political services would have given him all the fame which he acquired  it appears to me that poor richards almanac did more than anything else towards making him familiarly known to the public  as the writer of those proverbs which poor richard was supposed to utter franklin became the counsellor and household friend of almost every family in america  thus it was the humblest of all his labors that has done the most for his fame  i have read some of those proverbs remarked edward but i do not like them  they are all about getting money or saving it  well said his father they were suited to the condition of the country and their effect upon the whole has doubtless been good although they teach men but a very small portion of their duties    chapter ix  hitherto mr temples narratives had all been about boys and men  but the next evening he bethought himself that the quiet little emily would perhaps be glad to hear the story of a child of her own sex  he therefore resolved to narrate the youthful adventures of christina of sweden who began to be a queen at the age of no more than six years if we have any little girls among our readers they must not suppose that christina is set before them as a pattern of what they ought to be on the contrary the tale of her life is chiefly profitable as showing the evil effects of a wrong education which caused this daughter of a king to be both useless and unhappy  here follows the story   queen christina  born 1626 died 1689  in the royal palace at stockholm the capital city of sweden there was horn in 1626 a little princess  the king her father gave her the name of christina in memory of a swedish girl with whom he had been in love  his own name was gustavus adolphus and he was also called the lion of the north because he had gained greater fame in war than any other prince or general then alive  with this valiant king for their commander the swedes had made themselves terrible to the emperor of germany and to the king of france and were looked upon as the chief defence of the protestant religion  the little christina was by no means a beautiful child  to confess the truth she was remarkably plain  the queen her mother did not love her so much as she ought partly perhaps on account of christinas want of beauty and also because both the king and queen had wished for a son who might have gained as great renown in battle as his father had  the king however soon became exceedingly fond of the infant princess when christina was very young she was taken violently sick  gustavus adolphus who was several hundred miles from stockholm travelled night and day and never rested until he held the poor child in his arms  on her recovery he made a solemn festival in order to show his joy to the people of sweden and express his gratitude to heaven  after this event he took his daughter with him in all the journeys which he made throughout his kingdom  christina soon proved herself a bold and sturdy little girl  when she was two years old the king and herself in the course of a journey came to the strong fortress of colmar  on the battlements were soldiers clad in steel armor which glittered in the sunshine  there were likewise great cannons pointing their black months at gustavus and little christina and ready to belch out their smoke and thunder for whenever a king enters a fortress it is customary to receive him with a royal salute of artillery  but the captain of the fortress met gustavus and his daughter as they were about to enter the gateway  may it please your majesty said he taking off his steel cap and bowing profoundly i fear that if we receive you with a salute of cannon the little princess will be frightened almost to death  gustavus looked earnestly at his daughter and was indeed apprehensive that the thunder of so many cannon might perhaps throw her into convulsions  he had almost a mind to tell the captain to let them enter the fortress quietly as common people might have done without all this headsplitting racket  but no this would not do  let them fire said he waving his hand  christina is a soldiers daughter and must learn to bear the noise of cannon  so the captain uttered the word of command and immediately there was a terrible peal of thunder from the cannon and such a gush of smoke that it enveloped the whole fortress in its volumes  but amid all the din and confusion christina was seen clapping her little hands and laughing in an ecstasy of delight  probably nothing ever pleased her father so much as to see that his daughter promised to be fearless as himself  he determined to educate her exactly as if she had been a boy and to teach her all the knowledge needful to the ruler of a kingdom and the commander of an army  but gustavus should have remembered that providence had created her to be a woman and that it was not for him to make a man of her  however the king derived great happiness from his beloved christina it must have been a pleasant sight to see the powerful monarch of sweden playing in some magnificent hall of the palace with his merry little girl  then he forgot that the weight of a kingdom rested upon his shoulders  he forgot that the wise chancellor oxenstiern was waiting to consult with him how to render sweden the greatest nation of europe  he forgot that the emperor of germany and the king of france were plotting together how they might pull him down from his throne  yes gustavus forgot all the perils and cares and pompous irksomeness of a royal life and was as happy while playing with his child as the humblest peasant in the realm of sweden  how gayly did they dance along the marble floor of the palace this valiant king with his upright martial figure his warworn visage and commanding aspect and the small round form of christina with her rosy face of childish merriment  her little fingers were clasped in her fathers hand which had held the leading staff in many famous victories  his crown and sceptre were her playthings  she could disarm gustavus of his sword which was so terrible to the princes of europe  but alas the king was not long permitted to enjoy christinas society when she was four years old gustavus was summoned to take command of the allied armies of germany which were fighting against the emperor  his greatest affliction was the necessity of parting with his child but people in such high stations have but little opportunity for domestic happiness  he called an assembly of the senators of sweden and confided christina to their care saying that each one of them must be a father to her if he himself should fall in battle  at the moment of his departure christina ran towards him and began to address him with a speech which somebody had taught her for the occasion  gustavus was busied with thoughts about the affairs of the kingdom so that he did not immediately attend to the childish voice of his little girl  christina who did not love to be unnoticed immediately stopped short and pulled him by the coat  father said she why do not you listen to my speech  in a moment the king forgot everything except that he was parting with what he loved best in all the world  he caught the child in his arms pressed her to his bosom and burst into tears  yes though he was a brave man and though he wore a steel corselet on his breast and though armies were waiting for him to lead them to battle still his heart melted within him and he wept  christina too was so afflicted that her attendants began to fear that she would actually die of grief  but probably she was soon comforted for children seldom remember their parents quite so faithfully as their parents remember them  for two years more christina remained in the palace at stockholm  the queen her mother had accompanied gustavus to the wars  the child therefore was left to the guardianship of five of the wisest men in the kingdom  but these wise men knew better how to manage the affairs of state than how to govern and educate a little girl so as to render her a good and happy woman  when two years had passed away tidings were brought to stockholm which filled everybody with triumph and sorrow at the same time  the swedes had won a glorious victory at lutzen  but alas the warlike king of sweden the lion of the north the father of our little christina had been slain at the foot of a great stone which still marks the spot of that heros death  soon after this sad event a general assembly or congress consisting of deputations from the nobles the clergy the burghers and the peasants of sweden was summoned to meet at stockholm  it was for the purpose of declaring little christina to be queen of sweden and giving her the crown and sceptre of her deceased father  silence being proclaimed the chancellor oxenstiern arose  we desire to know said he whether the people of sweden will take the daughter of our dead king gustavus adolphus to be their queen  when the chancellor had spoken an old man with white hair and in coarse apparel stood up in the midst of the assembly  he was a peasant lars larrson by name and had spent most of his life in laboring on a farm  who is this daughter of gustavus asked the old man  we do not know her  let her be shown to us  then christina was brought into the hall and placed before the old peasant  it was strange no doubt to see a childa little girl of six years oldoffered to the swedes as their ruler instead of the brave king her father who had led then to victory so many times  could her baby fingers wield a sword in war  could her childish mind govern the nation wisely in peace  but the swedes do not appear to have asked themselves these questions old lars larrson took christina up in his arms and gazed earnestly into her face  he had known the great gustavus well and his heart was touched when he saw the likeness which the little girl bore to that heroic monarch  yes cried he with the tears gushing down his furrowed cheeks this is truly the daughter of our gustavus  here is her fathers browhere is his piercing eye  she is his very picture  this child shall be our queen  then all the proud nobles of sweden and the reverend clergy and the burghers and the peasants knelt down at the childs feet and kissed her hand  long live christina queen of sweden shouted they  even after she was a woman grown christina remembered the pleasure which she felt in seeing all of hose men at her feet and hearing them acknowledge her as their supreme ruler  poor child she was yet to learn that power does not insure happiness  as yet however she had not any real power  all the public business it is true was transacted in her name but the kingdom was governed by a number of the most experienced statesmen who were called a regency  but it was considered necessary that the little queen should be present at the public ceremonies and should behave just as if she were in reality the ruler of the nation  when she was seven years of age some ambassadors from the czar of muscovy came to the swedish court  they wore long beards and were clad in a strange fashion with furs and other outlandish ornaments and as they were inhabitants of a halfcivilized country they did not behave like other people  the chancellor oxenstiern was afraid that the young queen would burst out a laughing at the first sight of these queer ambassadors or else that she would be frightened by their unusual aspect  why should i be frightened said the little queen  and do you suppose that i have no better manners than to laugh  only tell me how i must behave and i will do it  accordingly the muscovite ambassadors were introduced and christina received them and answered their speeches with as much dignity and propriety as if sho had been a grown woman  all this time though christina was now a queen you must not suppose that she was left to act as she pleased  she had a preceptor named john mathias who was a very learned man and capable of instructing her in all the branches of science  but there was nobody to teach her the delicate graces and gentle virtues of a woman  she was surrounded almost entirely by men and had learned to despise the society of her own sex  at the age of nine years she was separated from her mother whom the swedes did not consider a proper person to be intrusted with the charge of her  no little girl who sits by a new england fireside has cause to envy christina in the royal palace at stockholm  yet she made great progress in her studies  she learned to read the classical authors of greece and rome and became a great admirer of the heroes and poets of old times  then as for active exercises she could ride on horseback as well as any man in her kingdom  she was fond of hunting and could shoot at a mark with wonderful skill  but dancing was the only feminine accomplishment with which she had any acquaintance  she was so restless in her disposition that none of her attendants were sure of a moments quiet neither day nor night  she grew up i am sorry to say a very unamiable person illtempered proud stubborn and in short unfit to make those around her happy or to be happy herself  let every little girl who has been taught selfcontrol and a due regard for the rights of others thank heaven that she has had better instruction than this poor little queen of sweden  at the age of eighteen christina was declared free to govern the kingdom by herself without the aid of a regency  at this period of her life she was a young woman of striking aspect a good figure and intelligent face but very strangely dressed  she wore a short habit of gray cloth with a mans vest over it and a black scarf around her neck but no jewels nor ornaments of any kind  yet though christina was so negligent of her appearance there was something in her air and manner that proclaimed her as the ruler of a kingdom  her eyes it is said had a very fierce and haughty look  old general wrangel who had often caused the enemies of sweden to tremble in battle actually trembled himself when he encountered the eyes of the queen  but it would have been better for christina if she could have made people love her by means of soft and gentle looks instead of affrighting them by such terrible glances  and now i have told you almost all that is amusing or instructive in the childhood of christina  only a few more words need be said about her for it is neither pleasant nor profitable to think of many things that she did after she grew to be a woman  when she had worn the crown a few years she began to consider it beneath her dignity to be called a queen because the name implied that she belonged to the weaker sex  she therefore caused herself to be proclaimed king thus declaring to the world that she despised her own sex and was desirous of being ranked among men  but in the twentyeighth year of her age christina grew tired of royalty and resolved to be neither a king nor a queen any longer  she took the crown from her head with her own hands and ceased to be the ruler of sweden  the people did not greatly regret her abdication for she had governed them ill and had taken much of their property to supply her extravagance  having thus given up her hereditary crown christina left sweden and travelled over many of the countries of europe  everywhere she was received with great ceremony because she was the daughter of the renowned gustavus and had herself been a powerful queen  perhaps you would like to know something about her personal appearance in the latter part of time life  she is described as wearing a mans vest a short gray petticoat embroidered with gold and silver and a black wig which was thrust awry upon her head  she wore no gloves and so seldom washed her hands that nobody could fell what had been their original color  in this strange dress and i suppose without washing her hands or face she visited the magnificent court of louis xiv  she died in 1689  none loved her while she lived nor regretted her death nor planted a single flower upon her grave  happy are the little girls of america who are brought up quietly and tenderly at the domestic hearth and thus become gentle and delicate women  may none of them ever lose the loveliness of their sex by receiving such an education as that of queen christina  emily timid quiet and sensitive was the very reverse of little christina  she seemed shocked at the idea of such a bold and masculine character as has been described in the foregoing story  i never could have loved her whispered she to mrs temple and then she added with that love of personal neatness which generally accompanies purity of heart it troubles me to think of her unclean hands  christina was a sad specimen of womankind indeed said mrs temple but it is very possible for a woman to have a strong mind and to be fitted for the active business of life without losing any of her natural delicacy  perhaps some time or other mr temple will tell you a story of such a woman  it was now time for edward to be left to repose  his brother george shook him heartily by the hand and hoped as he had hoped twenty times before that tomorrow or the next day neds eyes would be strong enough to look the sun right in the face  thank you george replied edward smiling but i am not half so impatient as at first  if my bodily eyesight were as good as yours perhaps i could not see things so distinctly with my minds eye  but now there is a light within which shows me the little quaker artist ben west and isaac newton with his windmill and stubborn sam johnson and stout noll cromwell and shrewd ben franklin and little queen christina with the swedes kneeling at her feet  it seems as if i really saw these personages face to face  so i can bear the darkness outside of me pretty well  when edward ceased speaking emily put up her mouth and kissed him as her farewell for the night  ah i forgot said edward with a sigh  i cannot see any of your faces  what would it signify to see all the famous people in the world if i must be blind to the faces that i love  you must try to see us with your heart my dear child said his mother  edward went to bed somewhat dispirited but quickly falling asleep was visited with such a pleasant dream of the sunshine and of his dearest friends that he felt the happier for it all the next day  and we hope to find him still happy when we meet again
