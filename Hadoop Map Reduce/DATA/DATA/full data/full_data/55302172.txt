55302172	ships company  by ww jacobs    illustration mr chase with his friend in his powerful grasp was doing his best as he expressed it to shake the life out of him    fairy gold   come and have a pint and talk it over said mr augustus teak  ive got reasons in my ead that you dont dream of alf  mr chase grunted and stole a sideglance at the small figure of his companion  all brains you are gussie he remarked  thats why it is youre so well off  come and have a pint repeated the other and with surprising ease pushed his bulky friend into the bar of the ship and anchor  mr chase mellowed by a long draught placed his mug on the counter and eyeing him kindly said  ive been in my lodgings thirteen years  i know said mr teak but ive got a partikler reason for wanting you  our lodger mr dunn left last week and i only thought of you yesterday  i mentioned you to my missis and she was quite pleased  you see she knows ive known you for over twenty years and she wants to make sure of only aving honest people in the ouse  she has got a reason for it  he closed one eye and nodded with great significance at his friend  oh  said mr chase waiting  shes a rich woman said mr teak pulling the others ear down to his mouth  she  when youve done tickling me with your whiskers said mr chase withdrawing his head and rubbing his ear vigorously i shall be glad  mr teak apologized  a rich woman he repeated  shes been stinting me for twentynine years and saving the moneymy moneymoney that i ave earned with the sweat of my brow  she as got over three undred pounds  ow much  demanded mr chase  three undred pounds and more repeated the other and if she had ad the sense to put it in a bank it would ha been over four undred by this time  instead o that she keeps it hid in the ouse  where  inquired the greatly interested mr chase  mr teak shook his head  thats just what i want to find out he answered  she dont know i know it and she mustnt know either thats important  how did you find out about it then  inquired his friend  my wifes sisters husband bert adams told me  his wife told im in strict confidence and i might ave gone to my grave without knowing about it only she smacked his face for im the other night  if its in the house you ought to be able to find it easy enough said mr chase  yes its all very well to talk retorted mr teak  my missis never leaves the ouse unless im with her except when im at work and if she thought i knew of it shed take and put it in some bank or somewhere unbeknown to me and i should be farther off it than ever  havent you got no idea  said mr chase  not the leastest bit said the other  i never thought for a moment she was saving money  shes always asking me for more for one thing but then women alway do  and look ow bad it is for hersaving money like that on the sly  she might grow into a miser pore thing  for er own sake i ought to get hold of it if its only to save her from erself  mr chases face reflected the gravity of his own  youre the only man i can trust continued mr teak and i thought if you came as lodger you might be able to find out where it is hid and get hold of it for me  me steal it dye mean  demanded the gaping mr chase  and suppose she got me locked up for it  i should look pretty shouldnt i  no you find out where it is hid said the other thats all you need do  ill find someway of getting hold of it then  but if you cant find it how should i be able to  inquired mr chase  cos youll ave opportunities said the other  i take her out some time when youre supposed to be out late you come ome let yourself in with your key and spot the hidingplace  i get the cash and give you tengoldensovereignsall to your little self  it only occurred to me after bert told me about it that i aint been in the house alone for years  he ordered some more beer and drawing mr chase to a bench sat down to a long and steady argument  it shook his faith in human nature to find that his friend estimated the affair as a twentypound job but he was in no position to bargain  they came out smoking twopenny cigars whose strength was remarkable for their age and before they parted mr chase was pledged to the hilt to do all that he could to save mrs teak from the vice of avarice  it was a more difficult undertaking than he had supposed  the house small and compact seemed to offer few opportunities for the concealment of large sums of money and after a fortnights residence he came to the conclusion that the treasure must have been hidden in the garden  the unalloyed pleasure however with which mrs teak regarded the efforts of her husband to put under cultivation land that had lain fallow for twenty years convinced both men that they were on a wrong scent  mr teak who did the digging was the first to realize it but his friend pointing out the suspicions that might be engendered by a sudden cessation of labour induced him to persevere  and try and look as if you liked it he said severely  why from the window even the back view of you looks disagreeable  im fair sick of it declared mr teak  anybody might ha known she wouldnt have buried it in the garden  she must ave been saving for pretty near thirty years week by week and she couldnt keep coming out here to hide it  taint likely  mr chase pondered  let her know casual like that i shant be ome till late on saturday he said slowly  then you come ome in the afternoon and take her out  as soon as youre gone ill pop in and have a thorough good hunt round  is she fond of animals  i blieve so said the other staring  why  take er to the zoo said mr chase impressively  take twopennorth o nuts with you for the monkeys and some stale buns forforfor animals as likes em  give er a ride on the elephant and a ride on the camel  anything else  inquired mr teak disagreeably  any more ways you can think of for me to spend my money  you do as i tell you said his friend  ive got an idea now where it is  if im able to show you where to put your finger on three undred pounds when you come ome itll be the cheapest outing you have ever ad wont it  mr teak made no reply but after spending the evening in deliberation issued the invitation at the suppertable  his wifes eyes sparkled at first then the light slowly faded from them and her face fell  i cant go she said at last  ive got nothing to go in  rubbish  said her husband starting uneasily  its a fact said mrs teak  i should like to go tooits years since i was at the zoo  i might make my jacket do its my hat im thinking about  mr chase meeting mr teaks eye winked an obvious suggestion  so thanking you all the same continued mrs teak with amiable cheerfulness ill stay at ome  owow much are they  growled her husband scowling at mr chase  all prices replied his wife  yes i know said mr teak in a grating voice  you go in to buy a hat at one and elevenpence you get talked over and flattered by a man like a barbers block and you come out with a fourandsix penny one the only real difference in hats is the price but women can never see it  mrs teak smiled faintly and again expressed her willingness to stay at home  they could spend the afternoon working in the garden she said her husband with another indignant glance at the right eye of mr chase which was still enacting the part of a camerashutter said that she could have a hat but asked her to remember when buying it that nothing suited her so well as a plain one  the remainder of the week passed away slowly and mr teak despite his utmost efforts was unable to glean any information from mr chase as to that gentlemans ideas concerning the hidingplace  at every suggestion mr chases smile only got broader and more indulgent  you leave it to me he said  you leave it to me and when you come home from a happy outing i ope to be able to cross your little hand with three undred golden quids  but why not tell me  urged mr teak  cos i want to surprise you was the reply  but mind whatever you do dont let your wife run away with the idea that ive been mixed up in it at all  now if you worry me any more i shall ask you to make it thirty pounds for me instead of twenty  the two friends parted at the corner of the road on saturday afternoon and mr teak conscious of his friends impatience sought to hurry his wife by occasionally calling the wrong time up the stairs  she came down at last smiling in a plain hat with three roses two bows and a feather  ive had the feather for years she remarked  this is the fourth hat it has been onbut then ive taken care of it  mr teak grunted and opening the door ushered her into the street  a sense of adventure and the hope of a profitable afternoon made his spirits rise  he paid a compliment to the hat and then to the surprise of both followed it up with anothera very little oneto his wife  they took a tram at the end of the street and for the sake of the air mounted to the top  mrs teak leaned back in her seat with placid enjoyment and for the first ten minutes amused herself with the life in the streets  then she turned suddenly to her husband and declared that she had felt a spot of rain  magination he said shortly  something cold touched him lightly on the eyelid a tiny pattering sounded from the seats and then swish down came the rain  with an angry exclamation he sprang up and followed his wife below  just our luck she said mournfully  best thing we can do is to stay in the car and go back with it  nonsense  said her husband in a startled voice itll be over in a minute  events proved the contrary  by the time the car reached the terminus it was coming down heavily  mrs teak settled herself squarely in her seat and patches of blue sky visible only to the eye of faith and her husband failed to move her  even his reckless reference to a cab failed  its no good she said tartly  we cant go about the grounds in a cab and im not going to slop about in the wet to please anybody  we must go another time  its hard luck but theres worse things in life  mr teak wondering as to the operations of mr chase agreed dumbly  he stopped the car at the corner of their road and holding his head down against the rain sprinted towards home  mrs teak anxious for her hat passed him  what on earths the matter  she inquired fumbling in her pocket for the key as her husband executed a clumsy but noisy breakdown on the front step  chill replied mr teak  ive got wet  he resumed his lumberings and the door being opened gave vent to his relief at being home again in the dry in a voice that made the windows rattle  then with anxious eyes he watched his wife pass upstairs  wonder what excuse old alfll make for being in  he thought  he stood with one foot on the bottom stair listening acutely  he heard a door open above and then a wild earsplitting shriek rang through the house  instinctively he dashed upstairs and following his wife into their bedroom stood by her side gaping stupidly at a pair of legs standing on the hearthstone  as he watched they came backwards into the room the upper part of a body materialized from the chimney and turning round revealed the sootstained face of mr alfred chase  another wild shriek from mrs teak greeted its appearance  hullo  exclaimed mr teak groping for the right thing to say hullo  whatwhat are you doing alf  mr chase blew the soot from his lips  iii come ome unexpected he stammered  butwhat areyou doing  panted mrs teak in a rising voice  ii was passing your door said mr chase passing your doorto go to my room toto ave a bit of a rinse when  yes said mrs teak  mr chase gave mr teak a glance the pathos of which even the soot could not conceal  when ii heard a pore little bird struggling in your chimbley he continued with a sigh of relief  being fond of animals i took the liberty of comin into your room and saving its life  mr teak drew a breath which he endeavoured in vain to render noiseless  it got its pore little foot caught in the brickwork continued the veracious mr chase tenderly  i released it and it flowedi mean flewup the chimbley  with the shamefaced air of a man detected in the performance of a noble action he passed out of the room  husband and wife eyed each other  thats alfthats alf all over said mr teak with enthusiasm  hes been like it from a child  hes the sort of man that ud dive off waterloo bridge to save the life of a drownding sparrow  hes made an awful mess said his wife frowning itll take me the rest of the day to clean up  theres soot everywhere  the rug is quite spoilt  she took off her hat and jacket and prepared for the fray  down below messrs  teak and chase comparing notes sought with much warmth to put the blame on the right shoulders  well it aint there said mr chase finally  ive made sure of that  thats something towards it  i shant ave to look there again thank goodness  mr teak sniffed  got any more ideas  he queried  i have said the other sternly  theres plenty of places to search yet  ive only just begun  get her out as much as you can and ill ave my hands on it afore you can say  soot  suggested mr teak sourly  any more of your nasty snacks and i chuck it up altogether said mr chase heatedly  if i wasnt hard up id drop it now  he went up to his room in dudgeon and for the next few days mr teak saw but little of him  to lure mrs teak out was almost as difficult as to persuade a snail to leave its shell but he succeeded on two or three occasions and each time she added something to her wardrobe  the assistant fortunehunter had been in residence just a month when mr teak returning home one afternoon stood in the small passage listening to a suppressed wailing noise proceeding from upstairs  it was so creepy that halfway up he hesitated and in a stern but trembling voice demanded to know what his wife meant by it  a louder wail than before was the only reply and summoning up his courage he pushed open the door of the bedroom and peeped in  his gaze fell on mrs teak who was sitting on the hearthrug rocking to and fro in front of a dismantled fireplace  whatwhats the matter  he said hastily  mrs teak raised her voice to a pitch that set his teeth on edge  my money she wailed  its all gone  all gone  money  repeated mr teak hardly able to contain himself  what money  allall my savings  moaned his wife  savings  said the delighted mr teak  what savings  money i have been putting by for our old age said his wife  three hundred and twentytwo pounds  all gone  in a fit of sudden generosity mr teak decided then and there that mr chase should have the odd twentytwo pounds  youre dreaming  he said sternly  i wish i was said his wife wiping her eyes  three hundred and twentytwo pounds in empty mustardtins  every hapennys gone  mr teaks eye fell on the stove  he stepped for ward and examined it the back was out and mrs teak calling his attention to a tunnel at the side implored him to put his arm in and satisfy himself that it was empty  but where could you get all that money from  he demanded after a prolonged groping  sasasaved it sobbed his wife for our old age  our old age  repeated mr teak in lofty tones  and suppose i had died first  or suppose you had died sudden  this is what comes of deceitfulness and keeping things from your husband  now somebody has stole it  mrs teak bent her head and sobbed again  ii had just been out for for an hour she gasped  when i came back i foufoufound the washhouse window smashed and  sobs choked her utterance  mr teak lost in admiration of mr chases cleverness stood regarding her in silence  whatwhat about the police  said his wife at last  police  repeated mr teak with extraordinary vehemence  police certainly not  dye think im going to let it be known all round that im the husband of a miser  id sooner lose ten times the money  he stalked solemnly out of the room and downstairs and safe in the parlour gave vent to his feelings in a wild but silent hornpipe  he cannoned against the table at last and subsiding into an easychair crammed his handkerchief to his mouth and gave way to suppressed mirth  in his excitement he forgot all about tea and the bereaved mrs teak made no attempt to come downstairs to prepare it  with his eye on the clock he waited with what patience he might for the arrival of mr chase the usual hour for his return came and went  another hour passed and another  a horrible idea that mr chase had been robbed gave way to one more horrible still  he paced the room in dismay until at nine oclock his wife came down and in a languid fashion began to set the suppertable  alfs very late said mr teak thickly  is he  said his wife dully  very late said mr teak  i cant thinkah there he is  he took a deep breath and clenched his hands together  by the time mr chase came into the room he was able to greet him with a stealthy wink mr chase with a humorous twist of his mouth winked back  weve ad a upset said mr teak in warning tones  eh said the other as mrs teak threw her apron over her head and sank into a chair  what about  in bated accents interrupted at times by broken murmurs from his wife mr teak informed him of the robbery  mr chase leaning against the doorpost listened with open mouth and distended eyeballs  occasional interjections of pity and surprise attested his interest  the tale finished the gentlemen exchanged a significant wink and sighed in unison  and now said mr teak an hour later after his wife had retired where is it  ah thats the question said mr chase roguishly  i wonder where it can be  ii hope its in a safe place said mr teak anxiously  where ave you put it  me  said mr chase  who are you getting at  i aint put it anywhere  you know that  dont play the giddy goat said the other testily  whereve you hid it  is it safe  mr chase leaned back in his chair and shaking his head at him smiled approvingly  youre a little wonder thats what you are gussie he remarked  no wonder your pore wife is took in so easy  mr teak sprang up in a fury  dont play the fool he said hoarsely wheres the money  i want it  now whereve you put it  go on said mr chase with a chuckle  go on  dont mind me  you ought to be on the stage gussie thats where you ought to be  im not joking said mr teak in a trembling voice and i dont want you to joke with me  if you think you are going off with my money youre mistook  if you dont tell me in two minutes where it is i shall give you in charge for theft  oh said mr chase  he took a deep breath  oh really  he said  i wouldnt ave thought it of you gussie  i wouldnt ave thought youd have played it so low down  im surprised at you  you thought wrong then said the other  trying to do me out o my twenty pounds thats what you are said mr chase knitting his brows  but it wont do my boy  i wasnt born yesterday  hand it over afore i lose my temper  twenty pounds i want of you and i dont leave this room till i get it  speechless with fury mr teak struck at him  the next moment the suppertable was overturned with a crash and mr chase with his friend in his powerful grasp was doing his best as he expressed it to shake the life out of him  a faint scream sounded from above steps pattered on the stairs and mrs teak with a red shawl round her shoulders burst hurriedly into the room  mr chase released mr teak opened his mouth to speak and then thinking better of it dashed into the passage took his hat from the peg and slamming the front door with extraordinary violence departed  he sent round for his clothes next day but he did not see mr teak until a month afterwards  his fists clenched and his mouth hardened but mr teak with a pathetic smile held out his hand and mr chase after a moments hesitation took it  mr teak still holding his friends hand piloted him to a neighbouring hostelry  it was my mistake alf he said shaking his head but it wasnt my fault  its a mistake anybody might ha made  have you found out who took it  inquired mr chase regarding him suspiciously  mr teak gulped and nodded  i met bert adams yesterday he said slowly  it took three pints afore he told me but i got it out of im at last  my missis took it herself  mr chase put his mug down with a bang  what  he gasped  the day after she found you with your head up the chimbley added mr teak mournfully  shes shoved it away in some bank now and i shall never see a hapenny of it  if you was a married man alf youd understand it better  you wouldnt be surprised at anything
