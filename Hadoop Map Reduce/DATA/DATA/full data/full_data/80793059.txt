80793059	the girl from kellers   by harold bindloss     original preparers note  this text was prepared from an edition published by frederick a stokes company new york 1917 it was published in england under the title sadies conquest      the girl from kellers    chapter i  the portrait  it was getting dark when festing stopped at the edge of a ravine on the saskatchewan prairie the trail that led up through the leafless birches was steep and he had walked fast since he left his work at the halffinished railroad bridge besides he felt thoughtful for something had happened during the visit of a montreal superintendent engineer that had given him a hint it was not exactly disturbing because festing had to some extent foreseen the line the superintendent would take but a post to which he thought he had a claim had been offered to somebody else the post was not remarkably well paid but since he was passed over now he would no doubt be disappointed when he applied for the next and it was significant that as he stood at the top of the ravine he first looked back and then ahead  in the distance a dull red glow marked the bridge where the glare of the throbbing blastlamps flickered across a muddy river swollen by melting snow he heard the ring of the riveters hammers and the clang of flungdown rails the whistle of a gravel train came faintly across the grass and he knew that for a long distance gangs of men were smoothing the roughly graded track  in front everything was quiet the palegreen sky was streaked along the horizon by a band of smoky red and the gray prairie rolled into the foreground checkered by clumps of birches and patches of melting snow in one place the figures of a man and horses moved slowly across the fading light but except for this the wide landscape was without life and desolate festing however knew it would not long remain a silent waste a change was coming with the railroad in a few years the wilderness would be covered with wheat and noisy gasoline tractors would displace the plowmans teams moreover a change was coming to him he felt that he had reached the trail fork and now must choose his path  he was thirty years of age and a railroad builder though he hardly thought he had much talent for his profession hard work and stubborn perseverance had carried him on up to the present but it looked as if he could not go much farther it was eight years since he began by joining a shovel gang and he felt the lack of scientific training he might continue to fill subordinate posts but the men who came to the front had been taught by famous engineers and held certificates  yet festing was ambitious and had abilities that sprang rather from character than technical knowledge and now wondered whether he should leave the railroad and join the breakers of virgin soil he knew something about prairie farming and believed that success was largely a matter of temperament one must be able to hold on if one meant to win then he dismissed the matter for a time and set off again with a firm and vigorous tread  spring had come suddenly as it does on the high saskatchewan plains and he was conscious of a strange bracing but vaguely disturbing quality in the keen air one felt moved to adventure and a longing for something new men with brain and muscle were needed in the wide silent land that would soon waken to busy life but one must not give way to romantic impulses stern experience had taught festing caution his views were utilitarian and he distrusted sentiment still looking back on years of strenuous effort that aimed at practical objects he felt that there was something he had missed one must work to live but perhaps life had more to offer than the money one earned by toil  the red glow on the horizon faded and an unbroken arch of dusky blue stretched above the plain he passed a poplar bluff where the dead branches cut against the sky the undergrowth had withered down and the wood was very quiet with the snowbleached grass growing about its edge but he seemed to feel the pulse of returning life the damp sod that the frost had lately left had a different smell then a faint measured throbbing came out of the distance and he knew the beat of wings before a harsh clanging call fell from the sky  he stopped and watched a crescent of small dark bodies plane down on outstretched wings the black geese were breaking their long journey to the marshes by the arctic sea they would rest for a few days in the prairie sloos and then push on again their harsh clamor had a note of unrest and rang through the dark like a trumpet call stirring the blood the brant and bernicle beat their way north against the roaring winds and man with a different instinct pressed on towards the west  it was a rich land that rolled back before him towards the setting sun birch and poplar bluffs broke the wide expanse there was good water in the winding creeks a black soil that the wheat plant loved lay beneath the sod and the hollows held shallow lakes that seldom quite dried up soon the land would be covered with grain already there were scattered patches on which the small homesteaders labored to free themselves from debt for the most part their means and tools were inadequate the haul to the elevators was long and many would fall an easy prey to the mortgage robber but things would soon be different the railroad had come for all that festing resolved that he would not be rash his pay was good in the meantime and he would wait  by and by a cluster of buildings rose out of the grass a light or two twinkled a frame house a sod stable and strawcovered wheat bins that looked like huge beehives grew into shape the homestead was good as homesteads in the back townships went but festing knew the land was badly worked charnock had begun well with money in the bank but luck had been against him and he had got slack indeed this was charnocks trouble when a job got difficult he did not stay with it  festing crossed the fall backset where the loam from the frostsplit clods stuck to his boots passed the sod stable noting that one end was falling down and was met on the veranda by charnocks dogs they sprang upon him with welcoming barks and pushing through them he entered the untidy livingroom charnock sat at a table strewn with papers that looked like bills and there was a smear of ink on his chin  hallo he said sit down and take a smoke while i get through with these  festing pulled a chair into his favorite corner by the stove and looked about when he had lighted his pipe the room was comfortless and bare with cracked board walls from which beads of resin exuded a moose head hung above a rack of expensive english guns a piano stood in a corner and lumps of the gumbo soil that lay about the floor had gathered among its legs greasy supper plates occupied the end of the table and the boards round the stove were blackened by the distillate that dripped from the joint where the pipe went through the ceiling these things were significant particularly the last since one need not burn green wood which had caused the tarry stain and the joint could have been made tight  then festing glanced at charnock the latter was a handsome man of about festings age he had a high color and an easy smile but he had so to speak degenerated since he came to canada festing remembered his keenness and careless goodhumor when he began to farm but disappointment had blunted the first though his carelessness remained he had been fastidious but one now got a hint of a coarse streak and there was something about his face that indicated dissipation yet festing admitted that he had charm  you dont look happy he remarked  i dont feel particularly happy charnock replied in fact the reckoning ive just made looks very like a notice to quit he threw festing a paper and swept the others into a drawer you might examine the calculations and see if theyre right im not fond of figures  that was obvious long since however if youll keep quiet for a few minutes  festing studied the paper which contained a rough statement of charnocks affairs the balance was against him but festing thought it might be wiped off or at least pulled down by economy and welldirected effort the trouble was that charnock disliked economy and of late had declined to make a fight festing doubted if he could be roused but meant to try  i see an error of a hundred dollars but that doesnt make much difference things look pretty bad but i imagine they could be straightened out  how long would it take you to put them straight  three years said festing when he had made a rough calculation that is if i got moderately good crops but id cut out drinks the pool game and some other extravagances you want to keep away from the settlement  youd cut out all that makes life bearable charnock replied and added while his face went hard besides three years is too long  festing thought he understood the portrait of an english girl hung on the wall behind the stove and charnock had already been some time in canada  anyhow the latter resumed you take much for granted if you count upon a moderately good crop i havent got one yet were told this is a great country for the small farmer and perhaps it is so long as he escapes a dry june summer hail rust and autumn frost as a matter of fact ive suffered from the lot  so have others but theyre making good  at a price they sweat when its light long enough sixteen hours a day deny themselves everything a man can go without and when the grain is sold the storekeeper or implement dealer takes all they get when the fellows sure of their honesty he carried them on for the sake of the interest until if theyre unusually lucky a bonanza crop helps them to wipe off the debt but do you imagine any slave in the old days ever worked so hard  festing knitted his brows he felt that charnock must be answered and he was not a philosopher  canadas a pretty hard country and the man without much capital who undertakes to break new soil must have nerve but he has a chance of making good and a few years of selfdenial do a man no harm in fact i expect hes better for it afterwards a fool can take life easily and do himself well while his dollars last  charnock smiled sourly ive heard something of this kind before youre a spartan but suppose we admit that a man might stand the strain what about a woman  that complicates the thing i suppose you mean an englishwoman  i do an englishwoman of the kind you used to know at home for example could she live on rancid pork molasses and damaged flour you know the stuff the storekeepers supply their debtors would you expect a delicately broughtup girl to cook for you and mend and wash your clothes besides making hers to struggle with chores that never end and be content for months with your society  festing pondered life on a small prairie farm was certainly hard for a woman for a man it was bracing although it needed pluck and resolution festing had both qualities perhaps in an unusual degree and his point of view was essentially practical he had grappled with so many difficulties that he regarded them as problems to be solved and not troubles to complain about he believed that what was necessary or desirable must be done no matter how hard it was one considered only the best way of removing an obstacle not the effort of mind and body it cost still he could not explain this to charnock he was not a moralizer or clever at argument  then halfconsciously he fixed his eyes on the portrait which he had often studied when the talk flagged the girl was young but there was something in the poise of her head that have her an air of distinction festing did not know if distinction was quite what he meant but could not think of a better term she looked at one with steady eyes her gaze was frank and fearless as if she had confidence in herself yet it was not an aggressive confidence but rather a calm that sprang from pridethe right kind of pride in a way he knew nothing about her but he was sure she would disdain anything that was shabby and mean he was not a judge of beauty but thought the arch of her brows and the lines of nose and mouth were good she was pretty but in admitting this one did not go far enough the pleasure he got from studying her picture was his only romantic weakness and he could indulge it safely because if he ever saw her it would be when she had married his friend  the curious thing was that she had promised to marry charnock bob was a good sort but he was not on this girls level and if she raised him to it would probably feel uncomfortable there he was slack and took the easiest way while a hint of coarseness had recently got more marked festing was not fastidious but he lived with cleareyed wiry men who could do all that one could expect from flesh and blood they quarreled about their wages and sometimes struck a domineering boss but they did their work in spite of scorching heat and biting frost raging floods snowslides and rocks that rolled down the mountain side and smashed the track never daunted them their character had something of the clean hardness of finely tempered steel but charnock was different  so you think of quitting festing said at length  im forced to quit im in too deep to get straight its possible that the man i owe most money might give me time but it would only mean that id slave for another year or two and come down after all i dont see why i should sweat and deny myself for somebody elses benefit particularly as im not fond of doing so for my own  then you have made a plan  charnock laughed id a notion of applying for a railroad job the pays pretty good and i daresay you could put me on the track  i could the trouble is that somebody else might afterwards put you off however if youd like to try  ill wait a bit i dont know that its prudent to plunge into things  it is if you plunge in and stop in until you struggle out with what you want come up to the track and ask for me when you decide to let the farm go  on the whole i think not said charnock whose look got somewhat strained you see i expect an offer of another post though nothings been fixed yet well let the matter drop in the meantime are you going to the long lake picnic  festing looked at him with surprise certainly not did you ever know me leave my job to go to a picnic  it might be better if you did my opinion is you think too much about your job  you think too little about yours festing rejoined anyhow what amusement do you think id get from lounging round long lake all day  the ducks ought to be plentiful and id lend you a gun in fact ill lend you my second team if youll drive the marvin girls over  no thanks said festing firmly somebody left flora marvin on my hands at the supper and i imagine she got very tired she certainly looked tired the girls about the settlement dont hide their feelings but whos going with you since you want the other team  i promised to take sadie keller  sadie keller festing exclaimed and paused rather awkwardly well of course i dont see why you shouldnt take her if she wants to go  charnock looked at him with amusement as shes the chief organizer of the picnic sadie does want to go for that matter it was her suggestion that i should bring you  i wont be there for one thing im too busy festing declared and soon afterwards got up its time i started back to camp  leaving the homestead he walked thoughtfully across the plain charnock had his faults but he was his friend and was now in trouble however as he had not the pluck to face his difficulties festing did not see how he could help then he did not like bobs taking miss keller to the picnic because he had met and thought her dangerous it was not that she had tried to flirt with him although she had done so he felt that if he had played up it might have been difficult afterwards to let the matter drop sadie was not a silly coquette she had a calculating bent ambition and a resolute character she would not flirt with anybody who was so to speak not worth powder and shot  festing did not know how miss keller rated his value but he was satisfied to remain a bachelor and had perhaps allowed her to understand this because she had since treated him with cold politeness now it looked as if she had thrown bob some favor which was ominous because sadie had generally an object of course if bob were free and content to marry a girl from the settlement sadie would not be a bad choice she certainly had some virtues but bob was not free and it was unthinkable that a man who had won the love of the girl whose portrait festing knew should be satisfied with another of sadies type  then festing pulled himself up he could not warn bob to be cautious or interfere with the girls plans supposing that she had made some besides it was charnocks affair not his by and by he dismissed the matter and thought about a troublesome job that must be undertaken in the morning    chapter ii  the picnic  the picnic at long lake was an annual function held as soon as the weather got warm enough to celebrate the return of spring winter is long and tedious on the high western plains where the frost is often arctic and little work can be done and after sitting by the redhot stove through the dark cold months the inhabitants of the scattered homesteads come out with joyful hearts to greet the sunshine there is however no slow transition rushing winds from the northwest sweep the sky the snow vanishes and after a week or two during which the prairie trails are impassable the bleached grass dries and green blades and flowers spring from the steaming sod  moreover the country round long lake has some beauty to the east it runs back bare and level with scarcely a tree to break the vast expanse but to the west low undulations rise to the edge of the next tableland sandhills mark the summits but the slopes are checkered with birches and poplars and creeks of clear water flow through the hollows in the shadow of thick bluffs there are many ponds and here and there a shallow lake shines amidst the sweep of grass the clear air and the distance the view commands give the landscape a distinctive charm one has a sense of space and freedom all the eye rests upon is cleancut  it was a bright morning when charnock drove up to the door of kellers hotel the street was onesided and for the most part of its length small shiplapboard houses boldly fronted the prairie a few had shallow verandas that relieved their bareness but the rest were frankly ugly and in some the front was carried up level with the roofridge giving them a harsh squareness of outline a plank sidewalk raised a foot or two above the ground ran along the street where the black soil was torn by wagon wheels  there was nothing attractive about the settlement and charnock had once been repelled by its dreariness he however liked society and as the settlement was the only center of human intercourse had acquired the habit of spending time there that ought to have been devoted to his farm he enjoyed a game of pool and to sit on the hotel veranda bantering the loungers was a pleasant change from driving the plow or plodding through the dust that rolled about the harrows for all that he knitted his brows as his light wagon lurched past the chinese laundry and the poolroom in the next block the place looked mean and shabby in the strong sunlight and with feelings he had thought dead reawaking he was conscious of a sharp distaste there was a choice he must shortly make and he knew what it would cost to take the line that might be forced on him  it was with a certain shrinking he stopped his team in front of the hotel the bare windows were open and the door was hooked back so that one could see into the hall where a row of tin washbasins stood on a shelf dirty towels were scattered about and the boarded floor was splashed the veranda on to which the hall opened was strewn with cigarends and burnt matches and occupied by a row of cheap wooden chairs above the door was painted the keller house the grocery in the next block and the poolroom bore the same owners name  when charnock stopped a man without a coat and with the sleeves of his fine white shirt rolled up came out he as rather an old man and his movements were slack his face was hard but on the whole expressionless  hallo he said late again the others have pulled out a quarter of an hour since  i saw them charnock answered with a languid hint of meaning didnt want to join the procession and thought they might load up my rig if i got here on time  keller looked hard at him as if he understood and then asked want a drink before you start  no thanks said charnock with an effort and keller going to the door shouted sadie  a girl came out on the veranda she was a handsome girl smartly dressed in white with a fashionable hat that had a tall plume her hair and eyes were black the latter marked by a rather hard sparkle her nose was prominent and her mouth firm her face was colorless but her skin had the clean smoothness of silk she had a firmly lined round figure and her manner was easy and confident sadie keller was then twentyone years of age  i thought you had forgotten to come bob she said with a smile  then you were very foolish you ought to have known me better charnock replied and helped her into the wagon  well you do forget things she resumed as he started the team  not those i want to remember besides if you really thought i had forgotten youd have been angry  how dyou know im not angry now  charnock laughed when youre angry everybody in the neighborhood knows  this was true sadie was young but there was something imperious about her she had a strong will and when it was thwarted was subject to fits of rage reserve was not among her virtues and charnocks languid carelessness sometimes attracted and sometimes annoyed her it marked him as different from the young men she knew and gave him what she called tone but it had drawbacks  let me have the reins i want to drive she said and added as the horses trotted across the grass beside the tornup trail you keep a smart team but theyre too light for much work about the farm  thats so still you see i like fast horses  they have to be paid for sadie rejoined  very true but i dont want to talk about such matters now then ive given up trying to make the farm pay when you find a things impossible its better to let it go  sadie did not reply she meant to talk about this later but preferred to choose her time her education had been rudimentary but she was naturally clever she liked admiration but was not to be led into foolishness by vanity sadie knew her value it had for some time been obvious that a number of the young farmers who dealt at the store and frequented the hotel did so for her sake and she was willing to extend her fathers trade in fact she helped to manage both businesses as cleverly as she managed the customers her charm was largely physical but she used it with caution one might indulge in banter and sadie had a ringing laugh that young men liked but there were limits that few who knew her overstepped one or two had done so but had been rebuked in a way they wished to forget sadie had the tricks of an accomplished coquette but something of the heart of a prude  the settlement got indistinct and crossing a low rise they drove past a birch bluff where the twigs were breaking into tiny points of green then they forded a creek and skirted a shallow lake from which a flock of ducks rose and flew north in a straggling wedge sandhills gleamed on the ridges tall cranes stalked about the hollows and when the team laboring through the loose soil crossed an elevation one could see the plain roll back into the far distance it was sharpcut to the horizon only the varying color that changed from soft blue to white and yellow in the foreground helped the eye to gage its vast extent the snow had bleached the grass which glittered like silver in the strong sunlight  a boisterous wind from the northwest drove whiteedged clouds across the sky but the air was soft with a genial warmth that drew earthy smells from the drying sod in places an emerald flush had begun to spread across the withered grass and small flowers like crocuses were pushing through the freshness and hint of returning life reacted on charnock and stirred his blood when he glanced at his companion he felt her physical allurement as he had not felt it before but now and then he resolutely looked away sadie had shown him marked favor but there was much he might lose  she would not have charmed him when he first came to the prairie with romantic hopes and vague ambitions he had been fastidious then and the image of a very different girl occupied his heart even now he knew the other stood for all that was best in life for tender romances and sweetness and high purpose helen had gracious qualities he had once halfreverently admired she loved pictures and books and music and was marked by a calm serenity that was very different from sadies restless force but it looked as if he had lost her and sadie who could break a horse and manage a hotel was nearer his level yet he hesitated he must choose one of two paths and when he had chosen could not turn back  you dont talk much sadie remarked at length guess you must be thinking about your mortgage  i was in a way it was rather useless and very rude however i wont think of it again until somebody makes me  thats a way of yours you think too late  im afraid i sometimes do so charnock admitted anyhow today im not going to think at all  sadie noted the reckless humor with which he began to talk but she led him on and they engaged in cheerful banter until long lake began to gleam among the woods ahead charnock skirted the trees and pulled up where a number of picketed teams and rigs stood near the waters edge farther along a merry party was gathering wood to build a fire and charnock did not find sadie alone again for some hours after he helped her down  in summer long lake has no great beauty and shrinks leaving a white saline crust on its wide margin of sunbaked mud but it is a picturesque stretch of water when the snow melts in spring and the reflections of the birches quiver on the smooth belt along its windward edge farther out the shadows of flying clouds chase each other across the flashing surface two or three leaky canoes generally lie among the trees and in the afternoon charnock dragged one down and helping sadie on board paddled up the lake  as they crept round a point flocks of ducks left the water and the air throbbed with a beat of wings that gradually died away the fire round which the others sat was out of sight and the rustle of the tossing birches emphasized the quietness charnock let the canoe drift and sadie looked up at him from her low seat among the wagon robes he had brought  what are you going to do about your farm she asked  i dont know yet and dont see why i should bore you with my troubles  pshaw said sadie you want to put the thing off but you know you cant  charnock made a gesture of humorous resignation very well i expect i wont be able to carry on the farm  no said sadie thoughtfully i dont think you could there are men who would be able but not you  i dare say youre right but youre not flattering charnock rejoined with a smile  sadie gave him a steady look your trouble is you laugh when you ought to set your lips and get busy one has got to hustle in canada  i have hustled in fact its hustling that has brought me low if i hadnt spent my money trying to break fresh land i wouldnt have been so deep in debt  and youd have had more time to loaf about the settlement  on the whole i dont think thats kind if i hadnt come to the settlement i wouldnt have seen you and thats about the only comfort i have left  a touch of color crept into sadies face but her thoughtful look did not change  well she said id surely have liked you to make good and dont know that we mightnt have got the mortgage held over but it wouldnt have been much use youd have started again and then got tired and not have stayed with it she spread out her hands impatiently thats the kind of man you are  im afraid its true charnock admitted but i hope you like me all the same  sadie was silent for a few moments but her color was higher and charnock mused he supposed she meant she could have persuaded her father to come to his help and it looked as if she well knew his failings still he felt rather amused than resentful  well let that go she resumed i want you to quit joking and listen were going to have a boom at the settlement as soon as the railroads opened and i and the old man can hardly manage the store and hotel weve got to have help somebody the boys like and we can trust well if you took hold the right way  she stopped but charnock understood keller was often ill and was getting old he could not carry on his rapidly extending business much longer and charnock might presently take his place but this was not all and he hesitated  do you think im fit for the job he asked  you could do it if you tried  charnock smiled its comforting to feel somebody trusts me and i see advantages in the plan you keep the books i think its very nice in the little back office when the lamps are lit and the store is shut we could make up the bills together  sadie blushed and he thought he had not seen her look so attractive she was remarkably pretty although there was now something about her that puzzled him it was something elusive that acted like a barrier keeping him away yet he knew the girl was fond of him if he wanted her he had but to ask and it was not on this account he hesitated he thought of a creepercovered house in england a house that had an air of quiet dignity he remembered the old silver the flowers in the shady rooms and the pictures the girl who moved about the rooms harmonized with her surroundings her voice was low and clear she had a touch of stateliness well he was ruined and she was far away but sadie was close by waiting for him for a moment he set his lips and then while his nerves tingled banished the disturbing doubts  dropping the paddle he leaned forward put his hand on the girls waist and drew her towards him he felt her yield and heard her draw a fluttering breath her head drooped so that he could not see her face she was slipping into his arms and then in the moment of surrender he felt her body stiffen she put her hands on his shoulder and pushed him back the canoe lurched and he had some trouble to prevent a capsize the water splashed against the rocking craft and sadie drawing away fixed her eyes on him she was breathless but rather from emotion than effort  dont do that again she said  charnock saw she meant it which was strange sadie knew and sometimes used her power of attraction but it was obvious that she was angry it looked as if he had chosen the wrong moment and he felt worse baffled and disappointed than he had thought possible  i wont he said as carelessly as he could you nearly threw us both into the water  i guess thats what i meant to do she answered fiercely  well i expect id have been able to pull you out suppose i ought to say im sorry but im not in fact sadie i dont quite understand  no she said you dont understand at all thats the trouble  charnock took out his tobacco pouch and began to make a cigarette sadies cold dignity was something new and he thought she could not keep it up if she did not break out in passionate anger she would soon come round as he finished the cigarette she turned to him with flashing eyes  put that tobacco away or ill throw it in the lake do you think you can kiss me when you like  i wish i could said charnock as a matter of fact i havent kissed you yet but im sorry if youre vexed  for a moment sadie hesitated and then fixed him with a fierce scornful gaze  oh she said youre cheap and youd make me as cheap as you you want things for nothing they must be given where other men would work and fight but you cant amuse yourself by making love to me  charnock felt humiliated if he had really offended her she could have rebuked him with a look or sign her unnecessary frankness jarred  very well i must ask you to forget it of course i was wrong but ill try not to vex you again what are we going to do now  paddle back to the others as quick as you can  throwing his cigarette into the water charnock turned the canoe it was a relief to be energetic because sadies demand for speed stung him he glanced at her now and then but she gave no sign of relenting her face was whiter than usual and her look was strained getting angry he drove the canoe down the lake with a curling wave at her bow until the paddle snapped in a savage stroke and he flung the haft away for a moment he hoped sadie would laugh but she did not  now youll have to paddle with your hands until you pick up the broken blade she said  charnock did so and afterwards awkwardly propelled the craft towards the camp fire he thought sadie might have suggested their landing and walking back but she was silent and calmly watched his clumsy efforts he was glad when they reached the beach where the others were and he helped her out an hour or two later he drove her home but she did not talk her anger had gone but she seemed strangely distant after helping her down at the hotel he waited a moment  cant we make this up and be friends again he asked  she gave him a curious steady glance not now it looks as if you didnt know me yet  then she left him and charnock drove home in a thoughtful mood he had some idea about what she meant and had been rather surprised by the pride she had shown sadie had certainly led him on but she was not altogether the girl he had thought    chapter iii  keller interferes  for two or three weeks after the picnic charnock did not meet sadie the rebuff he had got did not rankle much and was rather provocative than daunting but he understood why she had told him he made her cheap she meant to keep her caresses for her husband or declared lover and if he wanted her he must pay the regular price this was very proper from her point of view but from his the price was high  sadie was pretty capable and amusing but he was not sure he would like to see her every day in his house and at his table besides the house would really be hers and sadie would not forget this she was determined and liked her own way he had promised to marry another girl of a very different stamp but his conscience was clear on that point it was better for helens sake that he should give her up because he was on the edge of ruin and she was much too good for him irresolution however was perhaps his greatest failing and now he must decide he wavered and thought about what he had lost  there were days when he would not admit that all was lost and harnessing his team in the early morning drove the gangplow through the soil until the red sunset faded off the plain in his heart he knew the fight was hopeless festing for example in his place might perhaps make good but he had not the stamina for the long struggle all the same he worked with savage energy until his mood changed and he went off to hunt sandhill cranes he would sooner have gone to the poolroom but there was a risk of his meeting sadie at the settlement  in the meantime the days got warmer and a flush of vivid green spread across the grass the roaring wind that swept the tableland drove clouds that never broke across the dazzling sky and where there were belts of plowed land the harrows clanked across the furrows amidst a haze of blowing dust the ducks and geese had gone and red lilies began to sway above the rolling waves of grass farmer and hired man worked with tense activity but charnocks efforts were spasmodic and often slack  in the meantime trade was brisk at the settlement and keller found his business made demands on him that he could hardly meet it was rapidly growing and his strength got less indeed he would have sold out but for sadie the girl was clever and had tone he wanted her to find life smooth and taste pleasure her mother had not enjoyed the latter had helped him in a hard fight when dollars were very scarce and died worn out just before the tide turned since then he had schemed and sweated to make her childs future safe  now he thought he had done so but it had been a struggle and he knew he had held on too long keeping store in a wheatgrowing district was not a simple matter of selling groceries one was in reality a banker bills were not often paid until the crop was harvested farmers began without much money and one must know whom to trust indeed one often financed a hustler who had no capital and kept an honest man who had lost a crop on his feet but the risk was great and one felt the strain when there was rust and autumn frost  one bright afternoon keller stood on the sidewalk in front of the store he was not old but his hair was gray and his face was pinched it was rather a hard face for kellers glance was keen and his lips were generally firmly set yet he was liked by his customers now he was breathing hard because he had helped a farmer to put a heavy bag of flour in his wagon the farmer drove away and a cloud of dust the team stirred up blew down the street the fronts of the wooden houses were cracking in the hot sun there was not a tree to relieve the bare ugliness of the place and the glare was dazzling keller at first imagined this was why he could not see the wagon well but after a few moments he knew better  he went into the store with a staggering step and the rank smell of cheese and saltpork nauseated him the room felt very hot and was full of flies that buzzed in a tormenting cloud round his head he wanted quietness and made his way to the dark back office where he dropped into a chair  go to the hotel he ordered the clerk who entered after him tell jake to give you a big glass of the special whisky be quick but dont run and spill the stuff  the clerk came back in a few minutes and keller pulled himself together when he had drained the glass though his forehead was damp with sweat  now wheres the list of the truck gascoyne got he said ill look it up  sure you feel all right the clerk inquired  get the list said keller take that glass away  he picked up a pen but put it down when he found his hand shook and told the clerk to charge the goods when the latter had gone he sat still for some minutes and then opened a book of accounts he had had another warning sharper than the last and had better put things straight while he could with this object he worked later than usual and when he returned to the hotel called sadie into his private room the girl sat down and he studied her leaning his elbow heavily on the table  sadie had a strained look and had been quiet for the last week or two except when she was angry this indicated that her nerves were on edge and keller thought he knew why  i guess weve got to have a talk he said ive put it off but nows the time  sadie waited calmly she had courage and knew she must be frank with her father he did not as a rule say much but he noted things and understood  well he resumed ive built up a pretty good business here but ill have to quit and leave you some day and reckon you wont be satisfied to stop at the hotel all your life youre smart and a looker and i guess you want to go out and see the world thats all right and youll be able as far as dollars count but i cant go with you and you cant go alone  sadie shivered kellers face was pinched and she knew his health was not good although she did not know how bad it really was  i couldnt leave you anyway and hope youll be with me a long time yet  its possible said keller all the same i cant keep my grip on the business long and want a man to help but im not going to trust a stranger or a hired man you see where this leads  sadie saw and made a vague gesture though her glance was level  very well the man who carries on my business must be your husband now there are three or four of the boys in the settlement who could be taught to run the store and hotel but i allow you dont want me to choose from them have i got that right  yes said sadie with quiet calm although her heart beat none of them would suit  keller knitted his brows and his look was grave theyre good boys and if you had taken one of that bunch id have been satisfied i reckon the trouble is theyre my kind and belong where i do while you mean to go higher well thats right ive put up the dollars to give you a good time but you cant get where you want on your own feet he paused with a dry smile i allow youre smart enough to figure this out  i have said sadie theres much i dont know and couldnt learn here if im to move up my husband must help  then i only know two men round the settlement who could help festings my choice  a wave of color flushed sadies white skin but her voice was quiet he isnt mine i allow in some ways hes the better man but that doesnt count  keller looked hard at her i used to think your head would guide you not your heart but it seems youre like the restwell i was a very poor man when your mother married me now i like charnock and he has tone but if you take him theres a risk  i know the risk  its plain id stop the thing right now if you were a different girl but you know what you want and how to keep it when its got it looks as if you had made up your mind  sadies hands moved nervously she made a sign of agreement but did not speak and keller went on  anyhow youd better understand what youre up against sometimes youll have to hustle charnock and sometimes hold him tight you must keep him off the liquor and maybe stop him getting after other girls then when you sell out the business youll hold the dollars  for a moment sadie turned her head and then got up and stood by her fathers chair her look was strained but resolute as she put her hand on his arm  i know all that bob has plenty of faults but hes the man i love  keller took and pressed her hand he had some misgivings but he knew his daughter  we all like charnock and though i wouldnt trust him far i can trust you i think youve got that right and wont forget very well since you want charnock ill get him for you  sadie stooped and kissed him and then went out she was moved but there was nothing to be said her father was not a sentimentalist but he had never failed her and would not do so now when she sat down in her room however her face was grave her courage was high but she felt half afraid although she loved bob charnock life with him might be difficult he was older than she and knew much more but she must lead him and be firm where he was weak it was a hard task for an ignorant girl but she resolved to carry it out  next morning keller went down the street and entered a wooden building filled with gaudily painted mowers and plows he was not the man to waste time when he had made a plan and moreover felt that he had not much time to lose finding the implement dealer in his office he sat down breathing rather hard  you dont look very spry this morning the dealer remarked  i dont feel so bright the boys have been rushing me the last week or two say trade is booming now  it surely is i could sell more machines than ive got but ive got a lot of money standing out and after the bad harvest last fall dont know who to trust  they compared notes about their customers and presently the dealer remarked charnock was in a few days ago asking about a new wagon a mower and some small tools  ah said keller rather sharply then it looks as if he meant to hold on he reckoned not long since that hed have to quit but what did you tell him  to come again id like to keep bob charnock up but guess its dangerous owes me a pile how does he stand with you  keller supplied the information and the other looked thoughtful didnt know it was quite so bad as that i allow id better not let him have the goods  well i reckon hes trying the new man at concord smith said he met him there yesterday  the dealer frowned he hated to think of a customer going to somebody else in fact this was for a debtor an unpardonable offense  charnocks trouble is that hes not quite straight ought to have stayed with me told me how he was fixed and let me see what i could do if hes going to deal with the new man id better pull him up and try to get my money back  you cant get it said keller dryly he cant pay now and if you let him go on until harvest youll have a crowd of others with long bills fighting for whats left  looks like that the dealer agreed well id have liked to keep him going if hed stayed with me but i cant stand for losing the dollars he owes what are we going to do about the thing  keller explained his plans and after some argument the other agreed the decision they came to would bring charnocks farming to an end but keller left the office with some doubts his scheme was going to succeed but he wondered whether he had indulged sadie too far much depended on her firmness and she might find the job harder than she thought but on the whole he imagined she would be equal to the strain  a week later charnock sat one afternoon in the saddle of his gangplow tearing a row of furrows through the dusty sod the sweating horses moved leisurely and he did not urge them as he moodily watched the tangled grass part before the shares and vanish beneath the polished surface of the turnedup clods he was breaking new soil doing work that would be paid for in the future and knew the reward of his labor might never be his when he reached the end of the plowing he stopped and let the horses rest while he looked about  one side of the long furrows gleamed in the strong light and another team was moving towards him from the opposite end the sun was hot but the wind was fresh and thin clouds of dust blew across the plain still the belt he was plowing was good soil the firm black gumbo that holds the moisture the wheat plant needs there was something exhilarating in the rushing breeze and glow of light but charnock frowned and wondered why he had worked so long he had no real hope and admitted that he had continued his spasmodic efforts because he could not face defeat  for all that he had not been fighting entirely for his farm he wanted to keep his freedom to break through trammels that were getting tighter and try to regain something that he had lost sometimes he felt desperate but now and then saw an elusive ray of hope if he could hold out until harvest and reap a record crop  then his hired man driving the other plow waved his arm and charnock saw a rig lurch across a rise amidst a cloud of sand it was the mailcarrier going his round but he would not have come that way unless he had letters and charnock waited until the man arrived  heres your lot he said taking out three or four envelopes  charnocks hand shook as he opened the first it was large and had an official look and he found a number of unpaid accounts inside besides these there was a lawyers letter stating that certain dealers had instructed him to recover payment of the debts charnock owed he crushed the letter in his clenched hand and the veins stood out on his forehead while his face got red the blow he feared had fallen and he was ruined but when the shock began to pass he felt a faint relief it was something to be free from doubt and anxiety and there were consolations now he was beaten the line he must take was plain and it had some advantages  you can quit plowing and put the teams in the stable he said to the hired man  quit now exclaimed the other what about the machines  let them stop said charnock it seems they belong to my creditors who can look after them im going to concord and dont know when ill be back  he went off towards the homestead and half an hour later drove away across the plain    chapter iv  festing commits theft  the air was sharp and wonderfully invigorating when festing stopped for a few moments one evening outside charnocks homestead a row of sandhills glimmered faintly against the blue haze in the east but the western edge of the plain ran in a hard black line beneath a blaze of smoky red it was not dark but the house was shadowy and festing noticed a smell of burning as he entered  the top was off the stove in charnocks room and the flame that licked about the hole showed that the floor was strewn with torn paper charnock was busy picking up the pieces and when he threw a handful into the stove a blaze streamed out and the light shone upon the wall festing noted that the portrait that had hung there had gone and looking round in search of it saw a piece of the broken frame lying on the stove it was half burned and a thin streak of smoke rose from its glowing end festing remarked this with a sense of anger  what are you doing bob he asked  cleaning up charnock answered with a hoarse laugh as he sat down among the litter proper thing when you mean to make a fresh start suppose you take a drink and help  a whisky bottle and a glass stood on the table and festing thought charnock had taken some liquor although he was not drunk stooping down he began to pick up the papers which for the most part looked like bills there were however a few letters in a womans hand and by and by he found a bit of riband a glove and a locket that seemed to have been trampled on  are these to be burned he asked  yes said charnock dont want them about to remind meburn the lot  festing with some reluctance threw them into the stove he was not as a rule romantic but it jarred him to see the things destroyed they had no doubt once been valued for the givers sake dainty hands had touched them the locket had rested on somebodys white skin they were pledges of trust and affection and he had found them trampled by charnocks heavy boots among the dust and rubbish  youd get on faster if you used a brush he suggested  cant find the brush confounded things hidden itself somewhere cant remember where i put anything tonight suppose you dont see a small lace handkerchief about  festing said he did not and charnock made a gesture of resignation looks as if id burned it with the other truck but i got that from sadie and therell be trouble if she wants to know where its gone she may want to know some time sadie doesnt forget  did sadie give you the locket  she did not said charnock youre a tactless brute but theres something else i want and i dont know where it can have got  he upset a chair as he turned over some rubbish near the table under which he presently crawled while festing looking about noted a small white square laying half hidden by the stove picking it up he saw it was the portrait of the english girl and resolved with a thrill of indignation that charnock should not burn this he felt that its destruction would be something of an outrage  he glanced at charnock but the latters legs alone stuck out from under the table and as it was obvious that he could not see festing dusted the portrait and put it in his pocket by and by charnock crept out and got upon his feet it was dark now but the glow of the burning paper flickered about the room and touched his face his hair was ruffled his eyes were dull and his mouth had a slack droop festing felt some pity for the man though he was also sensible of scornful impatience the smell of burned paper disturbed him with its hint of vanished romance putting the lid on the stove he took the lamp from charnocks unsteady hand and when he had lighted it found a brush and set to work presently charnock made a vague sign of relief as he looked at the swept floor  all gone he remarked there was something i couldnt find suppose i burned it though i dont remember  theres nothing left said festing who felt guilty why did you destroy the things  charnock sat down and awkwardly lighted his pipe wanted to begin again with what they call a clean slate besides the stoves the best place for bills that bother you  you cant get rid of the debts by burning the bills  thats true said charnock with a grin unfortunately obvious in fact however i cut up my account book  i dont see how that would help  my creditors can now amuse themselves by finding out how i stand  festing frowned impatiently a rather childish trick it doesnt strike me as humorous  youre a disgustingly serious fellow charnock rejoined but you might be a bit sympathetic because ive had a nasty knock my creditors have come down on me and im going to be married  festing smiled he had some sense of humor and charnocks manner seemed to indicate that he felt he was confronted with two misfortunes  you must have known your creditors would pull you up unless you came to terms with them but one would expect you to please yourself about getting married  im not sure your jokes in good taste charnock answered sullenly but in a way one thing depended on the other perhaps i oughtnt to have said so but im upset tonight though i did expect to be pulled up it was a knock  no doubt are you going to marry sadie  i am have you any reason to disapprove  certainly not said festing sadies rather a friend of mine  in a sense this was true when festing first came to the prairie from a mountain construction camp where he had not seen a woman for twelve months he had felt sadies charm moreover he imagined that the girl liked him and consciously used her power although with a certain reserve and modesty for all that he fought against his inclination and conquered without much effort marriage had not much attraction for him but if he did marry he meant to choose a wife of a different type  sadies a very good sort charnock resumed she knows what we are and doesnt expect too much not the kind of girl to make ridiculous demands in fact sadie can make allowances  festing thought this was doubtful praise although it bore out his opinion of the girl for all that sadie might not be so willing to make allowances for her husband as for a lover of whom she was not quite sure  perhaps that kind of thing has advantages he said but i dont know  i do know said charnock ive tried the other way the feeling that youre expected to keep on a high plane soon gets tiresome besides it isnt natural its better to be taken for what you are  i suppose so festing assented anyway if sadies satisfied  charnock grinned although there was a touch of color in his face  youre not given to flattery but might use a little tact ive had a knock and am not quite sober so i cant argue the point then it isnt your business if sadies satisfied or not  thats so but what are you going to do when your creditors turn you out  everythings arranged im going to help keller at the hotel and store  festing got up well ive stopped longer than i meant i wish you good luck  well have a drink said charnock reaching for the bottle with an unsteady hand then he paused and gave festing a suspicious look its curious about that portrait i used to see you gazing at it and dont remember that i picked it up  no thanks said festing refusing the glass i think youve had enough in fact it might have been better when you were wiping the slate clean if you had put the bottle in the stove  he went out and walked back to the camp in the moonlight thinking hard he was angry with charnock but vaguely sorry bob had some virtues and was throwing himself away although when one came to think of it this was only true to some extent what one meant was that he was throwing away his opportunities of rising to a higher plane while bob was satisfied with his present level sadie was good enough for him perhaps too good life together might be hard for both and there was a touch of pathos in his burning all the tender tokens that bound him to the past though it was ominous that he kept the whisky he could however get as much liquor as he wanted at the hotel that is if sadie allowed it but there was some comfort in the thought that the girl was clever and firm  festing dismissed the matter and when he reached his shack at the bridge put the portrait on the table and sat down opposite he felt that he knew this girl whom he had never met very well something in her look had cheered him when he had difficulties to overcome he felt that they were friends she was calm and fearless and would face trouble with the level glance he knew although now and then when the lamp flickered in the draught he had thought she smiled they had been companions on evenings when charnock wanted to read the newspaper or the talk had flagged sometimes the window and door were open and the smell of parched grass came in sometimes the stove was redhot and the house shook in the icy blast festing admitted that it was not altogether for charnocks society he had visited the homestead  then he began to puzzle about a likeness to somebody he knew he had remarked this before but the likeness was faint and eluded him lighting his pipe he tried to concentrate his thoughts and by and by made an abrupt movement he had it when he was in british columbia engaged on the construction of a section of the railroad that was being built among the mountains he met a young englishman at a mining settlement the lad had been ill and was not strong enough to undertake manual labor which was the only occupation to be found in the neighborhood moreover he had lost his money in consequence festing gathered of his trusting dangerous companions  festing finding that he had been well educated and articled to a civil engineer got him a post on the railroad where he helped the surveyors dalton did well and showed himself grateful but when festing went to the prairie he lost touch with the lad the latter wrote to him once or twice but he was too busy to keep up the correspondence now he knew it was something in daltons face he found familiar in the portrait the girl had a steady level glance and the lad looked at one like that indeed it was his air of frankness that had persuaded festing to get him the post  but this led him nowhere he did not know the girls name and if it was the same as the lads it would not prove that they were related he pushed back his chair and got up it looked as if he was in some danger of becoming a romantic fool but he put the portrait carefully away soon after he had done so a man came in and sitting down lighted a cigarette  i wanted to see you festing but hadnt a chance all day he said probably you havent heard that ive got orders where to send the staff when the bridge is finished as it will be soon  festing looked up sharply kerr was his superior in the companys service but they were on good terms  i havent heard im anxious to know  kerr told him and festings face hardened  so marvin and i go on to the next prairie section since they want the best men on the difficult work in the mountains it means that were passed over  it does in a sense kerr agreed  then i think i know why you came said festing who pondered for a few moments he had courage and decision and it was his habit to face a crisis boldly now he resumed im going to ask your opinion of my prospects if i stay on the road  your records good youre sure of a post so long as theres any construction work going on  a post of a kind not the best kind where a man would have a chance of making his mark  well said kerr i think thats what i meant the headquarters bosses dont know us personally and judge by a mans training and the certificates hes got of course in spite of this talent will find its way and sometimes one gets there by a stroke of luck  festing smiled rather bitterly i have no marked talent and havent found it pay to trust to luck in fact my only recommendations are a kind of practical ability and a capacity for hard work i got on the road by doing chores and fought my way up  you are practical kerr agreed its your strong point but ive thought it sometimes kept you back  he paused when festing looked at him with surprise but resumed in a thoughtful voice when your jobs in front of you you see what must be done and do it well theres not a man on my section does that kind of thing better still im not sure you always see quite far enough you miss what lies ahead and sometimes so to speak whats lying all round concentrations good but one can concentrate too much however i didnt come to find fault but to let you know how matters are  thanks im going to look ahead and all round now and the situation strikes me as much like this if im content with a second or third best post i can stop if i want to go as far as my power of concentration may take me and find a place where i can use my independent judgment id better quit have i got that right  its what i tried to hint you can count on my recommendation when its likely to be of use but you said something that was rather illuminating you want to use your judgment  festing laughed i dont know that ive thought much about these matters but i am an individualist you get up against useless rules empty formalities and much general stupidity in organized effort and good work is often wasted when you see things that demand to be done you want to begin right there and get at the job if you wait to see if its yours or somebody elses youre apt not to start at all  your plan has drawbacks now and then kerr remarked but what are you going to do about the other matter  festing was silent for a few moments he had to make a momentous choice but had known that he must do so and did not hesitate  im going to quit and try farming after all i dont know very much about railroad building up to now ive got on rather by determination than knowledge then if i stop with you ill come up against a locked door whenever i try to push ahead  there are locked doors in other professions  thats so but in a big organization you must knock and ask somebody to let you through and unless you have a properly stamped ticket they turn you back when the jobs your own you beat down the door  ive seen farmers who tried that plan left outside with badly jarred hands frost and rust and driving sand are difficult obstacles  oh yes said festing but theyre natural obstacles you know what youre up against and can overcome them if youre stubborn enough what i really mean is you dont trust to somebody elses good opinion whether you fail or not depends upon yourself  well said kerr getting up i think youre making the right choice but hope you wont forget me when you leave us youll have a friend in the companys service as long as im on the road  he went out and festing lighted his pipe now he had come to a decision there was much that needed thought but to begin with he knew of a suitable piece of land living in camp he had saved the most part of his pay and had inherited a small sum from an english relative in consequence he could buy the land build a comfortable wooden house and have something over to carry him on until he sold his first crop  he resolved to buy the land and set the carpenters to work but could not leave the railroad for a month when it would be rather late to make a start then he had worked without a break for twelve years for the most part at camps where no amusement was possible and resolved to take a holiday he would go back to england where he had a few friends although his relatives were dead this was of course an extravagance but after the selfdenial he had practised there was some satisfaction in being rash lighting another pipe he abandoned himself to pleasant dreams of his first holiday    chapter v  a rash promise  a few days before he started for england festing went over to charnocks homestead which was shortly to be sold the evenings were getting light and although festing had finished his days work before he left the bridge the glow of sunset flooded charnocks livingroom the strong red light searched out the signs of neglect and dilapidation the broken boots and harness that needed mending the dust sticking to the resinstains on the cracked walls and the gumbo soil on the dirty floor as charnock glanced up a level ray touched his face and showed a certain sensual coarseness that one missed when the light was normal festing however knew the look and although he had not remarked it when he first met charnock thought it had always been there  the change he had noted in his friend was only on the surface charnock had not really deteriorated in canada the qualities that had brought him down had been overlaid by a spurious grace and charm but it now looked as if moral slackness might develop into active vice on the whole he thought sadie would have trouble with bob but this was not his business  ive come to say goodbye he remarked i wont see you again until my return and expect youll be married then  yes said charnock shortly i suppose you have made some plans for your trip where are you going to stop in england  festing told him and he looked surprised i didnt know you had friends in that neighborhood will you be with them some time  a month anyway then i may come and go  charnock pushed his chair back out of the light well this makes it easier theres something i want to ask we are friends and ive let you give me good advice though i havent always acted on it i dont know if this gives me a claim  if theres anything i can do  there is said charnock who hesitated for a few moments i want you to go and see helen dalton shes the girl i ought to have married and doesnt live very far from your friends  ah said festing with a start it was her portrait you meant to burn  charnock gave him a sharp glance just so i imagine i did burn it because i couldnt find it afterwards  there was silence for a few moments while festing wondered whether the other suspected him bob had an air of frankness but was sometimes cunning this however was not important and festing was strongly moved by the thought that he might see the girl  why do you want me to go he asked  in order that you can tell her how i was situated i want her to know why i was forced to give her up  but you have written and stated your reasons  of course but ive no talent for explanation and in a letter you say too little or too much probably i didnt say enough then you cant tell how far the person written to will understand and questions rise but will you go  festing wanted to go although he saw his task might be embarrassing he had been some time in western canada where people are frank and do not shrink from dealing with delicate matters then charnock was his friend  it will be an awkward job but you can indicate the line you think i ought to take  the line is plain you will tell helen what it means to lose ones crop and try to make her understand the struggle ive hadhow the weather was against me and the debts kept piling up until i was ruined you can describe the havoc made by drought and frost and cutting sand then theres the other side of the matter the hardships a woman must bear on the plains when moneys scarce the loneliness the monotonous drudgery the heat the arctic cold  miss dalton looks as if she had pluck she wouldnt be easily daunted  do you think i dont know but when you meet her youll see that the life we lead is impossible for a girl like that  it looks as if you wanted me to be your advocate festing remarked rather dryly im to make all the excuses for you i can and prove that you were justified in breaking your engagement i doubt if im clever enough  charnock stopped him no perhaps i used excuses but my object is not to clear myself he paused and colored well admit that helen lost nothing when i gave her up but a girl particularly a young romantic girl feels that kind of thing and it might hurt worse if she thought she had loved a wastrel i want her to feel that i broke my engagement for her sake when nothing else was possible that might soften the blow and i really think its true  how much of it is true festing asked bluntly  ah said charnock youre an uncompromising fellow you meant that if youd had my debts and difficulties you could have made good  i might but we both know two or three other men whom id have backed to do so  for all that youll admit that the thing was impossible for me  festing knitted his brows i believe you could have overcome your difficulties that is if you had really made an effort and faced the situation earlier but since you hadnt nerve enough i dare say it was impossible  you forget one thing i hadnt time at the best it would have taken me three or four years to get straight and as you havent much imagination i suppose you dont realize what helens trials would have been in the meanwhile an engaged girls situation isnt easy when her lover is away she stands apart forbidden much others may enjoy and helen would have had to bear her friends contemptuous pity for being bound to a man who had turned out a failure or worse  i expect thats true festing agreed however theres another difficulty suppose i persuade miss dalton that you made a plucky fight and only gave her up when you were beaten she may refuse to let you go and insist on coming out to help  charnock started but with a rather obvious effort recovered his calm you must see your suggestions stupid helen cant come out im going to marry sadie  i forgot said festing well since you urge me ill do what i can although i dont like the job  he left the homestead shortly afterwards but felt puzzled as he walked across the plain when he suggested that miss dalton might resolve to join and help her lover charnock had looked alarmed this was strange because although festing had for a moment forgotten sadie it was ridiculous to imagine that bob had done so then why had he started there were however one or two other things that disturbed festing who felt that he had made a rash promise but the promise had been made and he must do his best to carry it out  he had a fine voyage and a week after his arrival in the old country walked up and down the terrace of a house among the hills in the north of england his host was an old friend of the family who had shown festing some kindness when he was young and his daughter muriel approved her fathers guest she liked the rather frank brownskinned athletic man whom she had joined on the terrace he was a new and interesting type but although she was two or three years the younger and attractive their growing friendship was free from possible complications muriel as festing had learned was going to marry the curate  after the roar of activity at the bridge where the hammers rang all day and often far into the night he found his new surroundings strangely pleasant in canada he had lived in the wilds on the vast bare plains and among snowy mountains where man grappled with nature in her sternest mood thundering snowslides swept away ones work icy rocks must be cut through and savage green floods threatened the halfbuilt track when the glaciers began to melt every day had brought a fresh anxiety and now he welcomed the slackening of the strain the struggle had left its mark on him one saw it in his lean muscular symmetry his quiet alertness and selfconfidence but he could relax and found the english countryside had a soothing charm  the sun was low and rugged hills cut against the palesaffron sky the valley between was filled with blue shadow but in the foreground a river twinkled in the fading light feathery larches grew close up to the house and a beck splashed in the gloom among their trunks farther off a dog barked and there was a confused bleating of sheep but this seemed to emphasize the peaceful calm  its wonderfully quiet festing remarked i cant get used to the stillness i feel as if i was dreaming and would wake up to hear the din of the rivers and the ballast roaring off the gravel cars however i have some business to do tomorrow that im not keen about can one see knott scar from here  its the blue ridge about six miles off the dark patch on its slope is a big beech wood  then do you know the daltons  oh yes said muriel helen dalton is a friend of mine although the scars some way off i see her now and then but are you going there  i am i wish it wasnt needful festing answered rather gloomily  ah said muriel giving him a sharp glance helen was to have married a man in canada but the engagement was broken off do you know him  i do thats why im going to the scar ive promised to explain matters as far as i can  muriel studied his disturbed face with a twinkle of amusement well im sorry for helen it must have been a shock for all that i thought the engagement a mistake  then you have seen charnock  once hes a friend of some people helen used to stay with in the south but i met him at the scar handsome and charming in a way but i thought him weak  what are miss daltons people like  dont you want to know what helen is like  no said festing i know her already that is ive seen her picture  muriel glancing at him keenly did not understand his look but replied helen lives with her mother and aunt but its hard to describe them they are not old but seem to date back to other times in fact theyre rather unique nowadays like very dainty old china youd expect them to break if they were rudely jarred you feel they ought to smell of orris and lavender  ah said festing i was a fool to promise charnock ive never met people like that and am afraid theyll get a jar tomorrow  i dont think you need be afraid muriel replied theyre not really prudish or censorious though they are fastidious  and is miss dalton like her mother and aunt  in a way helen has their refinement but shes made of harder stuff she would wear better among strains and shocks  festing shook his head girls like her ought to be sheltered and kept from shocks after all theres something to be said for charnocks point of view your delicate english grace and bloom ought to be protected and not rubbed off by the rough cares of life  i dont know if youre nice or not muriel rejoined with a laugh anyway you dont know many english girls and your ideas about us are oldfashioned we are not kept in lavender now besides it isnt the surface bloom that matters and fine stuff does not wear out it takes a keener edge and brighter polish from strenuous use and helen is fine stuff  so i thought said festing quietly and stopped at the end of the terrace the bleating of sheep had died away and except for the splash of the beck a deep silence brooded over the dale the sun had set and the landscape was steeped in soft blues and grays into which woods and hills slowly melted  its remarkably pleasant here he said not a sign of strain and hurry things seem to run on welloiled wheels perhaps the greatest change is to feel that one has nothing to do  but you had holidays now and then in canada  no said festing anyhow ive had none for a very long time of course there are lonely places and in winter the homesteads on the plains are deadly quiet but i was always where some big job was rushed along hauling logs across the snow driving them down rivers and after i joined the railroad checking calculations and trackgrading in the rain it was a fierce hustle from sunrise to dark with all your senses highly strung and your efforts speeded up  then one can understand why its a relief to lounge but would that satisfy you long  festing laughed it would certainly satisfy me for a time but after that i dont know its a busy world and theres much to be done  muriel studied him as they walked back along the terrace he wore no hat and she liked the way he held his head and his light springy step though she smiled as she noted that he pulled himself up to keep pace with her it was obvious that he was not used to moving leisurely then his figure although spare was well proportioned and his rather thin face was frank he had what she called a fineddown look but concentrated effort of mind and body had given him a hint of distinction he was a man who did things and she wondered what helen who was something of a romantic dreamer would think of him then she reflected with a touch of amusement that he would probably find the errand his friend had given him embarrassing  you dont look forward to seeing the daltons tomorrow she remarked  thats so festing admitted i didnt quite know what id undertaken when i gave my promise the thing looks worse in england in fact it looks very nearly impossible just now  but you are going  festing spread out his hands certainly what can i do charnock hustled me into it he has a way of getting somebody else to do the things he shirks but i gave him my word  and thats binding remarked muriel who was half amused by his indignation she thought charnock deserved it but festing could be trusted  i wish i could ask your advice he resumed you could tell me what to say but as i dont know if charnock would approve it mightnt be the proper thing  muriel was keenly curious to learn the truth about her friends love affair but she resisted the temptation because she liked festing she would not persuade him to do something for which he might afterwards reproach himself  no she said perhaps you oughtnt to tell me but i dont think you need be nervous if you have the right feeling you will take the proper line  then they went into the house where the curate was talking to gardiner    chapter vi  festing keeps his word  next afternoon festing leaned his borrowed bicycle against the gate at knott scar and walked up the drive he had grave misgivings but it was too late to indulge them and he braced himself and looked about with keen curiosity the drive curved and a bank of shrubs on one side obstructed his view but the scar rose in front with patches of heather glowing a rich crimson among the gray rocks beneath these a dark beech wood rolled down the hill on the other side there was a lawn that looked like green velvet his trained eye could detect no unevenness the smooth surface might have been laid with a spirit level festing had seen no grass like this in canada and wondered how much labor it cost  then he came to the end of the shrubs and saw a small creepercovered house with a low wall pierced where shallow steps went up along the terrace the creeper was in full leaf and dark but roses bloomed about the windows and brightred geraniums in urns grew upon the wall he heard bees humming and a faint wind in the beech tops but the shadows scarcely moved upon the grass and a strange drowsy quietness brooded over the place indeed the calm was daunting he felt he belonged to another world and was intruding there but went resolutely up the shallow steps  two whitehaired ladies received him in a shady oldfashioned room with a low ceiling there was a smell of flowers but it was faint and he thought it harmonized with the subdued lighting of the room a horizontal piano stood in a corner and the dark polished rosewood had dull reflections some music lay about but not in disorder and he noted the delicate modeling of the cabinet with diamond panes it had been taken from he knew nothing about furniture but he had an eye for line and remarked the taste that characterized the rest of the articles there were a few landscapes in watercolor and one or two pieces of old china of a deep blue that struck the right note of contrast with the paleyellow wall  festing felt that the house had an influence a gracious influence perhaps but vaguely antagonistic to him he had thought of a house as a place in which one ate and slept but did not expect it to mold ones character surroundings like this were no doubt helen daltons proper environment but he came from the outside turmoil where men sweated and struggled and took hard knocks  in the meantime he talked to and studied the two ladies although they had white hair they were younger than he thought at first and much alike it was as if they had faded prematurely from breathing too rarefied an atmosphere and shutting out rude but bracing blasts still they had a curious charm and he had felt a hint of warmth in mrs daltons welcome that puzzled him  we have been expecting you bob told us you would come she said in a low sweet voice and added with a smile i wanted to meet you  festing wondered what bob had said about him but for a time they tactfully avoided the object of his visit and asked him questions about his journey then mrs dalton got up  helen is in the garden shall we look for her  she took him across the lawn to a bench beneath a copper beech and festing braced himself when a girl got up she wore white and the shadow of the leaves checkered the plain dress he noted the unconscious grace of her pose as she turned towards him and her warm color which seemed to indicate a sanguine temperament helen dalton was all that he had thought and something more he knew her level penetrating glance but she had a virility he had not expected the girl was somehow stronger than he portrait  perhaps i had better leave you to talk to mr festing mrs dalton said presently and moved away  helen waited with a calm that festing thought must cost her much and moving a folding chair he sat down opposite  i understand bob told you i would come he said you see he is a friend of mine  yes she replied with a faint sparkle in her eyes he hinted that you would explain matters i think he meant you would make some defense for him  festing noted that her voice was low like her mothers but it had a firmer note he could be frank with her but there was a risk that he might say too much  well he said i may make mistakes in fact it was with much reluctance i promised to come and if bob hadnt insisted he paused and pulled himself together on the surface of course his conduct looks inexcusable but he really has some defense and i think you ought to hear it for your own sake  perhaps i ought she agreed quietly well i am willing  festing began by relating charnocks troubles he meant her to understand the situation and supplied rather confusing particulars about prairie farming and mortgages for all that the line he took was strong he showed how charnocks embarrassments prevented his offering her comforts she would find needful and saving her from the monotonous toil an impoverished farmers wife must undertake in the meantime but unconsciously he threw some light on charnocks vacillating character  when he stopped helen mused for a few minutes although she had got a shock when charnock gave her up she knew her lover better than when she had promised to marry him he came home once in the winter and she had remarked a change bob was not altogether the man she had thought there were things that jarred and his letters gradually made this plainer still she had meant to keep her promise and his withdrawal hurt she had borne something for his sake because her mother and her relations had not approved the engagement then she roused herself and turned to festing  you have done your best for your friend and bob ought to be grateful but you both start from a wrong point why do you take it for granted that i would shrink from hardship  i didnt imagine you would shrink festing declared for all that bob was right the life is too hard for a girl brought up like you he hesitated a moment i mean for a girl brought up in your surroundings  helen smiled and he knew it was a sign of courage but had a vague feeling that he understood why she did so as he looked about the sighing in the beech tops had died away and the shadows did not move upon the lawn a heavy smell of flowers came from the borders and the house seemed to be sleeping in the hot sunshine everything was beautiful wellordered and tranquil but he knew if he stayed there long he would hear the cry of the black geese and the clang of flungdown rails ring through the soporific calm something in the girls face indicated that she might find the calm oppressive and sympathize with him  what is bob going to do now he has lost his farm she asked after a time  in one respect he wont be much worse off they expect a boom at the settlement and hell manage the hotel and store and poolroom for keller the old man will probably retire soon and bob will get the business  but why should the proprietor give the business to bob  hes sadies father festing answered with some surprise  but who is sadie  festing looked up sharply and saw that helen was puzzled and suspicious her eyes were harder and her mouth was set  ah he said dont you know  a wave of color flushed helens face but her voice was level i dont know it looks as if bob had not told me the most important thing do you mean that he is going to marry miss keller  festing felt pitiful he saw that she had got a shock but she bore it pluckily and he tried to conquer his indignant rage charnock had let him believe he had told her he ought to have realized that the fellow could not act straight  i thought you knew he stammered  thats obvious helen replied with an effort for calm but tell me something about miss keller  sadie runs the hotel and helps at the store shes rather pretty and intelligent in fact shes generally capable and a good manager  you seem to know her well since you call her sadie  oh said festing everybody calls her sadie  you mean in the bar and poolroom i understand the latters a public billiardsaloon  festing felt that he must do sadie justice she had her virtues and although he was very angry with charnock he did not want helen to think the fellow had given her up for a worthless rival still he was not sure if his putting the girl in a favorable light would soften the blow or not  to begin with they dont employ women in a canadian bar then sadies quite a good sort and understands bobperhaps better than an english girl could she was brought up on the plains and knows all about the life we lead  you imply that she is not fastidious and will be lenient to her husbands faults that she will bring him down to her level  well said festing who thought helen did not know charnocks dissipated habits i imagine shell keep him there and thats something i mean she wont let him sink below her level sadies shrewd and determined then marriage is a problem to men like bob farming the plains girls of the type they have been used to and would naturally choose couldnt stand the hardships  so they are satisfied with a lower type with any girl who pleases their eye  i dont think thats quite fair festing objected besides lower is rather vague  then would you for example be satisfied with a girl like miss keller  certainly not said festing with incautious firmness anyway not now ive seen a different kind in the old country  helen turned her head and said nothing for a few moments then she got up  i think you have had a difficult task mr festing and i must thank you for the way you have carried it out we wont speak of it again but perhaps if muriel gardiner  she hasnt asked me any questions or hinted that she is curious  there was a gleam of amusement in helens eyes so you imagined she wasnt interested well you can tell her about bobs losses and farming troubles you understand these matters and it will save me something  festing made a sign of agreement and helen went with him to the terrace where mrs dalton told him when he would find them at home if he wished to come again he was glad to leave because he thought the interview had been difficult for helen but her mother had made him feel that if he came back he would be welcome this was not altogether conventional politeness he imagined she wanted to see him although she was obviously willing to let him go then  he puzzled about it and other matters as he rode back helen dalton was finer than her picture he had no doubt been awkward and had hurt her by his clumsiness while she had got a painful shock but had borne it with unflinching pluck her calm had not deceived him since he knew what it cost and her smile had roused his pity because it was so brave then his anger against charnock returned with extra force the fellow as usual had shirked his duty and left him to tell the girl he had really given her up because he meant to marry somebody else festing thought she was too just to blame him for bobs fault but he had been forced to witness her humiliation and she would no doubt avoid him because of this well he had done with bob although he would see him once on his return and tell him what he thought  then he heard a shout and saw a farmer trying to move a loaded cart out of his way he had not noticed that he was riding furiously down a hill but he sped past the cart upon the grassy margin of the road and laughed as he went on his mood had changed and he resolved that he would go back to the creepercovered house when helen had had time to recover and his society would be less disturbing after all mrs dalton had told him he might come  in the evening he walked up and down the terrace with muriel and told her why he had gone to knott scar although he was satisfied with relating charnocks financial troubles and said nothing about his engagement to sadie he could not say that muriel actually led him on but he felt that she would be disappointed if he did not take her into his confidence  of course i saw you knew all about it she said when he stopped besides i expected that helen would give you leave to tell me it would make things easier for her and be more authentic  i should expect miss dalton to think of that  muriel smiled perhaps not well i imagine its lucky charnock released her helen is much too good for him i suppose you thought you took the proper line in laying all the stress you could upon the hardships  i did i thought she couldnt stand the strain she would have had to bear  how did she take that  she seemed surprised as if she didnt think it much of a reason for charnock letting her go  frankly i dont think it was  you havent been to canada the life is hard  it doesnt seem to have broken down your health or nerve  thats different a man gets used to hardships and discomfort theyre sometimes bracing  a very masculine attitude then men alone have pluck and endurance  there are two kinds of pluck festing rejoined i dare say you surpass us in the moral kindim sure miss dalton has more than charnock but theres the other physical courage and if you like physical strength  muriel looked amused and you imagine helen is deficient there well i suppose you dont know shes the best tennis player in the county and a daring rockclimber girls are taking to mountaineering now you know but are you going back to the daltons  festing thought she gave him a keen glance but answered steadily i am going back but not for some time i want to go but it might be kinder if i kept away  well its a very proper feeling and youre rather nice but you talked about going to see the mountains for a few days when do you start  i dont know yet everything here is so charming and im getting the habit of lazy enjoyment it will need an effort to go away  youre certainly nice muriel rejoined smiling however you might tell me when you do think of starting i dont want you to be away when we have arranged something to amuse you and then as i know the mountains i can indicate an interesting tour you might miss much if you didnt know where to go and what you ought to see  festing promised and she left him and went back to the house with a thoughtful smile that hinted that she had begun to make an amusing plan muriel was romantic and rather fond of managing her friends affairs for their good    chapter vii  helen takes the lead  festing was glad to sit down when he reached the bottom of a chasm that divided the summits of two towering fells he had crossed the higher of the two without much trouble except for a laborious scramble over large rough stones but the ascent of the other threatened to be difficult it rose in front a wall of splintered crag seamed by deep gullies for the strata was tilted up nearly perpendicular all the gullies were climbed by expert mountaineers but this needed a party and a rope and the other way round the shoulder of the great rock was almost as hard festing knew the easiest plan was to descend a neighboring hollow from which he would find a steep path to the top  lighting his pipe he glanced at his watch it was three oclock in the afternoon and having been on his feet since breakfast he felt tired the nails he had had driven into his light american boots hurt his feet and the boots were much the worse for the last few days wear muriel had carefully planned the trip and then delayed his start by a week because she wanted to take him to a tennis party since he could not play tennis much festing did not see why she had done so but agreed when she insisted  so far he had followed her instructions and admitted that she had directed him well because it was hard to imagine there was anything in england finer than the country he had seen the mountains had not the majestic grandeur of the british columbian ranges but they were wild enough and pierced by dales steeped in sylvan beauty the chasm in which he now rested had an impressive ruggedness  blinks of sunshine touched the lower face of the crag and in their track the dark rock glittered with a steely luster but trails of mist rolled among the crannies above below a precipitous slope of small stones that the dalesmen call a scree ran down to a hollow strewn with broken rocks and across this he could distinguish the blurred flat top of another height the mountain dropped to a dale that looked profoundly deep although he could not see its bottom  the light was puzzling for the most part the sky was clear and the gleams of sun were hot but heavy black clouds drifted about and a thick gray haze obscured the lower ground rain and mist would be dangerous obstacles but festing understood that he could reach the dale in about two hours steady walking muriel had told him where to stop indeed she had been rather particular about this and had recommended him to spend two days in the neighborhood luckily there would be no crags to climb if he kept the path across the summit for he had found it easier to reach the top of the hills than get down by a different line  a rattle of stones made him look up and he saw two girls silhouetted in a flash of sunshine against the face of the crag they carried bulging rucksacks and were coming down towards him picking their way among the tumbled rocks he could not see the face of the first but noticed her light poise and graceful movements as she sprang from stone to stone the other followed cautiously and festing thought she limped but when the first stopped to wait for her and lifted her head he felt a curious thrill it was helen dalton  he sat still knowing his gray clothes would be hard to distinguish among the stones and wondering what to do he did not want to force his society upon the girl just yet but would be disappointed if she passed she came on and when her eyes rested on him he got up a flush of embarrassment colored her face but she stopped and greeted him with a smile  mr festing how did you get here  i came over the pike said festing im going to the dale  so are we said helen who presented him to her companion  festing remarked that they wore jackets that had a tanned look unusually short skirts and thick nailed boots then he thought helens eyes twinkled  you would not have expected to find me engaged in anything so strenuous as this  it is rather strenuous miss jardine broke in you can stand if you like im going to sit down  they found a flat stone and when festing leaned against another helen resumed we meant to try the stairs but have had a hard day and alison is lame  i hurt my foot miss jardine explained besides im from the level midlands and we have been walking since breakfast that doesnt matter to helen she is never tired  festing thought helen looked remarkably fresh exertion and the mountain air had brought a fine color to her face her eyes were bright and there was a hint of vigor in her resting pose moreover he had studied the stairs which led behind the shoulder of the crag to the summit one could get up if one was thin enough to squeeze through a gap between two rocks but nerve and agility would be required  but you must climb pretty well if you meant to get up the stairs he said  i know the carnarvon range but only go there now and then and one needs some training to keep pace with people born among the fells who walk like mountain goats  had she said a mountain deer festing would have approved for he had noted helens easy balance and fearless grace as she crossed the ragged blocks of stone then a rumble of distant thunder rolled among the crags and miss jardine resumed we ought to fix upon the best way down  the best is a rather elastic term helen rejoined the easiest would be to go back by the way we came  its much too far  the shortest is up the crag by the stairs or the gully on the other side the regular track takes us down near the bottom of the next dale and then back over the top  thats unthinkable miss jardine declared  well said helen thoughtfully theres a short line down the scree and across the shoulder of the fell below but its steep and rough there are some small crags too but theyre not much of an obstacle when theyre dry  they set off and festing noticed helens confidence on the scree the descent was safe but looked daunting because their figures made a sharp angle with the gravel slope and now and then a mass of dislodged stones rushed down hill sometimes the girl allowed herself to slide sometimes she ran a few yards and sprang but she did not stumble or lose her balance miss jardine was cautious and festing kept near her carrying her sack  at the bottom they came to a wide belt of massive stones fallen from the heights above and their progress was slow one had to measure the gaps between the blocks and step carefully across while the stones were ragged and had sharp corners festing was unable to look up and followed helen but after a time miss jardine stopped and he saw that the crags were smothered in leaden cloud and all the sky was dark  i must have a few minutes rest the tired girl declared  as they sat down on the edge of a ponderous slab there was a crash of thunder that rolled from rock to rock and a few big drops fell then as the echoes died away the hillside was hidden by a curtain of driving rain one end of the slab was tilted and they crept into the hollow underneath  it will be awkward if this goes on miss jardine remarked  these thunderstorms seldom last said helen i expect we have seen the worst and we must start again as soon as we can see  festing thought she was anxious to get down but miss jardine grumbled about the rain and then turned to him  it was a relief to give you my sack and i was glad to see it didnt bother you i suppose you are used to these mountains  no said festing this is the first time ive climbed a hill for amusement  but you are a climber you have balance trust your feet and not your hands and know how to step on a loose stone  festing laughed i used to do something of the kind as a matter of business you see i helped mark out the line for a new railroad in british columbia and rocks are plentiful in that country  it must be a wonderful place said helen i have a photograph of the gorge at the foot of the glacier where the line went through you had stern work when you laid the rails in winter  festing looked at her in surprise for he had worked to the edge of exhaustion and run many risks at the spot but while he wondered how she knew helen got up  i think the rain is stopping and we can start she said  there was not much rain but thick mist rolled across the top of the hill they were now level with and everything below was blotted out leaving the stones they crossed a belt of boggy grass where their feet sank but festing felt it a relief to have done with the rocks the narrow tableland they were crossing was comfortingly flat and he looked forward to descending a long grassy slope when they reached the edge however he got a rude disappointment for the mist rolled up in waves with intervals between and when a white cloud passed a gray light shone down into the gulf at his feet  in the foreground there was a steep slope where rock ledges broke through the wet turf and in one place a chasm cleft the hill he could not see the bottom for it was filled with mist but the height of the rock wall hinted at its depth a transverse ravine ran into the chasm and he could hear the roar of a waterfall then the mist rolled up in a white smother and blotted everything out  we cross the beck said helen then we go nearly straight down keeping this side of the big ghyll  as far away as possible i hope i dont like its look miss jardine remarked  festing agreed with her so far as he could see the descent looked forbidding but there was no sign of the skys clearing and it was obvious that they must get down the thunder had gone but the mist brought a curious searching damp and a cold wind had begun to blow he was glad to think helen knew the way  she took them down a steep pitch where small rocky ledges dropped nearly vertical among patches of rotten turf and it was needful to get a good grip with ones hands as well as with ones feet festing helped miss jardine when he could but he had an unpleasant feeling that a rash step might take him over the edge of a precipice sometimes he could see helen in front and sometimes for a few moments her figure was lost in the mist he was glad to note that she was apparently going down with confidence  after a time the slope got easier and she stopped lifting her hand festing found her looking into a ravine through which water flowed it was not very deep but its sides were perpendicular seeing that miss jardine was some distance behind she looked at festing with a quiet smile  there is a place where one can cross without much trouble but i dont know whether to go up or down  festing felt his heart beat it looked as if she had taken him into her confidence and asked his help  not down i think that would take us to the big ghyll lets try up and cross at the first practicable spot  helen made a sign of agreement and when miss jardine joined them they turned back along the edge of the ravine by and by helen stopped where patches of wet soil checkered the steep rock and a mountainash offered a hold almost immediately below the spot the stream plunged over a ledge and vanished into the mist  festing looked at helen the descent would be awkward if not dangerous but he could trust her judgment it was the first time he had allowed a woman to give him a lead in a difficulty and he admitted that he would not have done so had his guide been anybody else  i think we can get across and i dont want to go too far up she said if you dont mind helping alison  ill throw the sacks across first festing replied  he swung them round by the straps and let them go and when the last splashed into a boggy patch on the other side miss jardine laughed  im selfishly glad that one is yours if helens had fallen a foot short it would have gone over the fall but i expect she had a reason for taking the risk where our clothes have gone we must follow  helen seized a tuft of heather and sliding down reached a narrow shelf four or five feet below then a small mountainash gave her a fresh hold and she dropped to the top of a projecting stone below this there was another shelf and some boggy grass after which a bank of earth dropped nearly straight to the stream  how we shall get down the last pitch isnt very obvious miss jardine remarked i suppose we will see when we arrive it isnt my resolution that gives way but my foot you might go first  festing dropped on to the first shelf and she came down into his arms the shock nearly flung him off but he steadied her with an effort and seized the stem of the small tree  looks like a tightwire trick he said glancing at the stone however if we miss it theres another ledge below  he reached the stone and balancing on it with one foot kicked a hole in the spongy turf finding this would support him he held out his hand  now as lightly as you can  the girl came down struck the stone with her foot and slipped but festing had time to clutch her first he could not hold her back but he could steady her and for a moment felt his muscles crack and the peat tear out from the hole in the bank then his hands slipped and he fell gasping and red in face upon the shelf beside the girl  thank you you did that rather well she said it looks as if i were heavier than you thought  while he had been occupied festing imagined he had heard a splash and now looking down saw helen standing on a boulder in the stream she gave him an approving nod before she sprang to the next stone and he felt a thrill of pleasure she knew his task was difficult and was satisfied with him  when they came to the scar where the floods had torn away the bank he hesitated it was some distance to the water and there was no hold upon the wall of soil which was studded with small round stones  helen slid his companion remarked i imagine she chose her time the sitting glissade isnt elegant but if youll go first and wait  festing leaned back with his shoulders against the bank and pushed off he alighted in the water and miss jardine coming down kicked his arm he saved her from a plunge into the stream but thought she looked something the worse for wear as they made their way from stone to stone the other bank was easier and for a time they had not much trouble in going down hill but the mist was very thick and presently the steep slope broke off close in front helen stopped and beckoned festing  looking down he saw the wet face of a crag drop into the rolling vapor for eight or nine feet it was perpendicular and afterwards ran down at a very steep slant but immediately below there was a gully with a foot or two of level gravel at its top  this is not the regular track helen said however i think i know the gully  festing pondered the rock looked daunting but one might get down to the patch of gravel the trouble was that one could not see what lay below and it might be difficult to climb back if this was needful  i could get as far as the edge yonder he suggested  no said helen you dont know the gully and if im mistaken about it you could help me up  thats true still id sooner go  helen shook her head and although she did not speak he felt there was something delightful in her consulting him they had come to know each other on the misty hillside in a way that would not have been possible in conventional surroundings he had seen a possibility of the girl so to speak shutting him out in selfdefense because he had had some part in her humiliation but he thought that risk had gone  well he resumed what do you propose  im going to see if this is the place i think you can steady me  festing lay down with his head over the edge and found a grip for his toes and knees there were a few cracks in the rock and helen had got half way down before she took his hands he felt the strain and braced himself determined that he would be pulled over before he let her fall  loose me now she said  have you got a safe hold for your foot festing gasped  i think i have let go  make sure first he answered with a sobbing breath  she looked up into his set face and although the strain was heavy he thrilled as he saw her smile the smile indicated courage and trust  im quite safe she said and he let her go  she leaned cautiously over the next edge but after a moment or two turned and waved her hand  this is the way i thought send alison down  miss jardine descended with some help from both and festing dropped safely on the gravel he leaned against the rock to get his breath and helen turned to him with a twinkle  you doubted my nerve once i suppose that was why you didnt let go  im sometimes dull said festing just now however i wanted to make certain i could help you back  helen laughed well i dare say you could have lifted me but it would have been simpler to lower me your coat  they went down the gully where jambed stones made rude steps and reaching the bottom found a belt of grass that led them to the head of a dale the mist was thinner and presently a few scattered houses appeared across the fields the path they followed forked and helen stopped at the turning  the hotel is yonder to the right she said we are going to the hall where they sometimes take people in  festing remembered that muriel had indicated the hall which he understood was a wellbuilt farm as his stopping place he wanted to go there but thought there was some risk of its looking as if he meant to force his society on the girls he took the path helen indicated and when he had gone some distance stopped hesitated and then went on  the girls noted this and miss jardine said i suppose he remembered that he has my sack or else his heart failed him  helen looked at her in surprise did you forget  i did not miss jardine admitted i thought i wouldnt spoil the plot it looked as if he wanted an excuse for meeting us again but i think i wronged him that sudden stop was genuine  the sack is yours said helen dryly but you will need the things inside  i imagine i will get them before long although it doesnt seem to have struck him that my clothes are damp its rather significant that he went on when he could have run across the field and caught us up have you known him long  i met him once said helen with an impatient frown  rather a good type miss jardine remarked i think i should like canadians if theyre all like that  he isnt a canadian  then he hasnt been in england for some time and so far as my knowledge goes men like variety of course to some extent he saw us under a disadvantage mountaineering clothes are comfortable but one cant say much more  dont be ridiculous helen rejoined and went on across the field    chapter viii  a debt of gratitude  after dinner festing walked across the fields to the farm it was raining and a cold wind swept the dale but a fire burned in the room into which he was shown and the curtains were drawn helen and miss jardine got up when he came in and put the rucksack on the table  im sorry i forgot this until id gone some distance he said then i couldnt find anybody to send with it  no doubt you wanted your dinner miss jardine suggested  festing saw that she wore a different dress that looked rather large  no he said it wasnt the dinner that stopped me besides it didnt strike me that  that i might need my clothes well i dont suppose it would strike you but since you have come across in the rain wont you stop  festing found an old leather chair and sitting down looked about with a sense of satisfaction for the fire was cheerful after the raw cold outside the room was large and oldfashioned with heavy beams across the low ceiling there was a tall clock and a big black oak chest curled rams horns and brass candlesticks twinkled on the mantel an old copper kettle threw back red reflections near the fire his companions occupied opposite sides of a large sheepskin rug and he felt that both had charm though they were different the contrast added something to the charm  miss jardines skin was a pure white her hair and eyes were nearly black and she had a sparkling and perhaps rather daring humor helens colors were rose and cream her hair changed from warm brown to gold as it caught the light and her eyes were calm and gray she was younger than the other and he thought her smile delightful but as a rule she was marked by a certain gravity her wide brows and the firm lines of her mouth and nose hinted at pride and resolution  i hope your foot is better he said to miss jardine  yes thanks it mainly needed rest and i must confess that i didnt find it altogether a drawback when we stopped at the bottom of the big crag i should have had to go up if i hadnt been lame  you were not disappointed because you couldnt reach the top  miss jardine laughed helen was she makes it a rule to accomplish what she undertakes i wasnt disappointed then though i am now perhaps one really enjoys mountaineering best afterwards you like to think how adventurous you have been but its sometimes difficult while the adventures going on  thats true festing agreed still you feel sorry if as we say you are unable to put the thing over  helen gave him a sympathetic smile yes one feels that  it depends upon ones temperament miss jardine objected i know my limits though helen does not know hers when i cant get what im out for im satisfied with less one cant always have the best  its worth trying for anyway festing replied  he was afraid this sounded priggish miss jardine got up  well im not much of a philosopher and had better put out some of the clothes you brought to dry although it was thoughtful of you to throw your bag into the bog instead of mine  that was an accident festing declared i meant to throw them both across  miss jardine picked up the sack theres nobody else here and a wet evenings dreary i hope you wont go before i come back  i wont said festing they have only a deaf tourist and two tired climbers who seem sleepy and badtempered at the hotel  miss jardines eyes twinkled well she said as she went out i suppose its a fair retort  festing colored and looked at helen apologetically you see i have lived in the woods  i expect that has some advantages said helen who liked his frank embarrassment however it was lucky i met you today you didnt come back to see us and there is something she hesitated and then gave him a steady glance you are not so much a stranger to us as you imagine  festing wondered what she meant and whether she knew about the portrait but she resumed as a matter of fact my mother and i felt that we knew you rather well  i dont understand  some time since you found a young englishmen in a western mining town he had been ill and things had gone against him  ah said festing sharply of course i ought to have knownhe looked like you i mean i ought to have known the name was he a relative  my brother helen replied  she was silent for a moment or two and then went on in a tone that made festings heart beat you gave him work and helped him to make a new start he was too proud to tell us about his difficulties  it cost me nothing there was a job waiting afterwards he got on by his own merits i had nothing to do with that  but you gave him his chance we cant forget this george was younger than me i have no other brother and was very fond of him indeed i think we owe you much and my mother is anxious to give you her thanks  is he all right now i lost sight of him when they sent me to another part of the road it was my faulthe wrote but im not punctual at answering letters and hadnt much time  he is in the chief construction office helen replied in his last letter he told us about the likelihood of his getting some new promotion she paused and resumed with a smile i dont suppose you know you were a hero of his  i didnt know as a rule the young men we had on the road seemed to find their bosses amusing and rather patronized them of course they were fresh from a scientific college or engineers office and for the most part we had learned what we knew upon the track  but you knew it well george wrote long letters about the struggle you had at the canyon some fight he called it  well said festing quietly we were up against it then the job was worth doing  i know george told us how the snowslide came down and filled the head of the gorge with stones and broken trees and washouts wrecked the line you built along its side he said it was a job for giants clinging to the face of the precipice while you blew out and built onunderpinning isnt itthe first construction track but he declared the leaders were fine they were where the danger was in the blinding rain and swirling snowand the boys as he called them would always follow you  festing colored but helen went on we were glad when the worst was over that he had had this training it was so clean a fight  we were dirty enough often festing objected with an effort at humor when things were humming we slept in our working clothes which were generally stained with mud and engine grease then i dont suppose you know how dissipated a man looks and feels when he has breathed the fumes of giantpowder  she stopped him with a half imperious glance i know its the convention to talk of such things as a joke but you didnt feel that in the canyon then it was a stubborn fight of the kind that man was meant to wage if you win in trade and politics somebody must lose but a victory over nature is a gain to all and when your enemies are storms and floods cheating and small cunning are not of much use  that is so festing agreed smiling when youre sent to cut through an icy rock or relay the steel across the gap a snowslide has made its obvious if you have done the job or not this has some drawbacks because if you dont make good you often get fired  but that was not what drove you on you must have had a better motive for making good  festing felt embarrassed the girl was obviously not indulging a sentimental vein she felt what she frankly hinted at and although he generally avoided imaginative talk her remarks did not sound cheap or ridiculous  well he said the fear of getting fired is a pretty strong incentive to do ones best but i suppose when one gets up against big things there is something else after all one hates to be beaten  helens eyes sparkled and she gave him a sympathetic nod the hate of being beaten distinguishes man from the ape and puts him on the side of the angels  then miss jardine came in somewhat to the relief of festing who felt he could not keep up long on helens plane besides he was not altogether sure he understood her last remark  i heard said miss jardine helens sometimes improving but perhaps she was right just now the ape is cunning but acquiescent and accepts things as they are man protests and fights to make them better at least he ought to though one cant say he always does  festing did not reply and she sat down and resumed but i suppose you havent many shirkers in canada  i imagine we have as many wastrels as there are anywhere else but as a rule one doesnt find them in the woods and on the plains when they leave the cities theyre apt to starve  youre a grim lot work or starve is a stern choice particularly if one has never done either it looks as if you hadnt much use for purely ornamental people but what about the halftaught women who dont know how to work what do you do with them  theyre not numerous then one can always learn and i imagine every woman can cook and manage a house  youre taking much for granted though yours seems to be the conventional view but how did you learn railroad building for example  by unloading ties and shoveling ballast on the track the trouble was that i began too late  what did you do before that  sometimes i worked in sawmills and sometimes packedthat means carrying thingsfor survey parties and went prospecting  in the wilds it sounds interesting wont you tell us about it  festing complied awkwardly at first and then with growing confidence he did not want to make much of his exploits but there was a charm in talking about things he knew to two clever and attractive girls and they helped him with tactful questions indeed he was surprised to find they knew something about the rugged country in which he wandered he told them about risky journeys up lonely rivers in the spring adventurous thrusts into the wilderness where hardship was oftener to be found than valuable minerals and retreats with provisions running out before the arctic winter  something of the charm of the empty spaces colored his narratives as he drew from memory halffinished pictures of the mad riot of primitive forces when the ice broke up and the floods hurled the thundering floes among the rocks and of tangled woods sinking into profound silence in the stinging frost moreover he unconsciously delineated his own character and when he stopped the others understood something of the practical resource and stubbornness that had supported him  it was encouraging to see they were not bored but he did not know that miss jardine had found him an interesting study and had skilfully led him on he was a new type to both girls although helen was nearer to him than the other and sympathized where her companion was amused festings ideas were cleancut his honesty was obvious and she noted that he did not know much about the lighter side of life yet she saw that sternly practical as he was he had a vague feeling for romance  will you stay on the railroad when its finished she asked presently  ive left it i hadnt the proper training to carry me far and as the road is opening up the country ive bought a prairie farm  but do you know much about farming  i dont as a matter of fact not many of the boys do know much when they begin but somehow they make progress on the plains it isnt what you know that counts but the capacity for work and staying with your job thats what one really needs if you see what i mean  i think i do miss jardine replied a victorian philosopher whose opinions you seem to hold said something of the kind he claims that genius takes many different forms but is not different in itself that is if you have talent you can do what you like build railroads for example and then succeed on a farm  festing laughed goodhumoredly its a pretty big thing to claim but that man was near the mark they live up to his theories on the plains where shams dont count and efficiencys the test i dont mean that the boys have genius but gift and perseverance seem to be worth as much anyhow one can generally trust them to make good when they undertake a job they dont know much about  helen mused charnock who knew something about farming had tried it and failed but she thought festing would succeed the man looked determined and in a way ascetic he could deny himself and concentrate knowledge was not worth as much as character but she was content to let miss jardine lead the talk  one understands said the latter that farmings laborious and not very profitable work  its always laborious festing agreed it may be profitable that depends you see  he went on using plain words but with some force of imagination to picture the wheatgrowers hopes and struggles but he did more for as he talked helen was conscious of the romance that underlay the patient effort she saw the empty silent land rolling back to the west the oxteams slowly breaking the first furrow and then the big percheron horses and gasoline tractors taking their place wooden shacks dotted the white grass the belts of green wheat widened wagons and afterwards automobiles lurched along the rutted trails then the railroad came brick homestead and windmills rose and cities sprang up as it were in a night everything was fluid there was no permanence rules and customs altered before they got familiar a new nation with new thoughts and aims was rising from the welter of tense activity  then festing got up with an apologetic air im afraid ive stopped too long and talked too much still the big movement out there is fascinating and people in this country dont grasp its significance i felt id like to make you understand then you didnt seem  if we had been bored it would have been our fault but we were not bored at all miss jardine replied at least i wasnt and dont think helen was  helen added her denial and gave festing her hand when he had gone miss jardine looked at her with a smile  he was interesting she remarked talks better than he knows and i suppose we ought to feel flattered because he took our comprehension for granted after all it was rash to talk about canadian progress to two english girls  you made him talk helen rejoined its the first time ive known you interested in geography  miss jardine laughed i was interested in the man he told us a good deal about himself although it would have embarrassed him if hed guessed the curious thing is that he imagines hes practical while hes really a reckless sentimentalist  helen did not answer and picked up a book but she thought more about festing than about what she read    chapter ix  festing loses his temper  next morning festing got breakfast early and set off down the dale this was not the way muriel had indicated but he thought it better to avoid temptation the girls had received him graciously at the farm and had perhaps listened with unusual patience but if he overtook them in the morning the thing might look too marked besides he doubted if it was advisable that helen should see him again so soon since he might remind her of matters she wished to forget  the selfdenial cost him something and he went down the dale irresolutely stopping once or twice to look back it was annoying to feel himself so weak because he had seldom vacillated in canada but had chosen the proper line and then stuck to it as a matter of fact he had generally had a definite object and definite plans for its attainment although he had an object now he was otherwise at a loss  he meant to marry helen life was strenuous on the plains and at first there might be hardships but if she loved him she would not flinch her portrait had not done her justice he dwelt upon her fearless confidence as she came down the screes her light sure step and agile pose these things indicated strength of mind and body and he knew if the need came she would make good use of both  by and by he thought of charnock with keener anger than he had yet felt bob was a weak fool and something worse he had broken the promise and then tricked his friend the fellows character was warped he could not go straight but tried to escape the consequences of his folly in a maze of crooked ways the worst was that consequences could not be shirked if the real offender avoided them they fell upon somebody else and now festing had to pay bob had prejudiced him with helen she would probably never quite forget that he knew what she had suffered  then he remembered that he had meant to spend a week or two in london and made his way towards a valley through which a railway ran although he wanted to see helen he was half afraid and imagined that the longer he waited the less risk he would run of his society jarring next day he left the hills but did not greatly enjoy his visit to town london was much like montreal where the buildings were as fine only they did not dig up so many streets and fill the air with cement from the towering blocks of new offices the english liked permanence while the canadians altered their cities from day to day besides he wanted to go back to the north as soon as it was prudent  on the evening of his return it rained hard and he talked to muriel in her drawingroom he liked muriel gardiner and she frankly enjoyed his society it did not matter that she sometimes seemed to find him amusing when he was serious a fire burned in the grate for the summer evening was cold his low chair was comfortable and muriel holding a fan to shield her face sat opposite in the soft light of a shaded lamp that left much of the room in shadow the circle of subdued illumination gave one a pleasant feeling of seclusion and made for mutual confidence but festing was silent for a time thinking rather hard  he was getting used to english comforts which did not seem so enervating as he had imagined but he could give them up and would indeed be forced to do so when he occupied his prairie homestead a man could go without much that people in england required and be the better for the selfdenial but it might be different for a girl long habit might make comfort and artistic surroundings actual necessities it was however encouraging to remember helens cheerfulness as she led him among the crags in the rain she had pluck and could bear fatigue and hardship besides there need not be much hardship after all  presently muriel gave him a careless glance helen told me she met you in the hills and you came over to the hall where she and alison jardine stopped now you have had an opportunity of correcting your first impression what do you think of her  what i have always thought festing replied  muriel looked at him with surprise and then laughed oh yes i remember you saw her portrait first well you have more imagination than i thought but i understand you didnt see helen again although she and alison went over part of the route i marked out for you  festing thought her manner was too careless and felt suspicious but he said i changed my plans i thought it might look significant if i overtook the girls one doesnt expect an accident to happen twice  perhaps you did the proper thing but did you want to overtake them  i did said festing quietly still i felt id better not  muriel was silent for a few moments and then remarked selfdenial such as you practised deserves a reward and i met mrs dalton while you were away she asked me to bring you over when you came back i suppose you know what she wants  yes said festing who looked disturbed do you  mrs dalton told me you helped george when he needed help although he had no particular claim  he was ill and unfit for hard work  was that the only difficulty  i dont see what you mean said festing with some embarrassment  then ill be frank in what kind of company did you find the lad you see i know something about him  if you insist hed got into bad hands  that was what i suspected and i think mrs dalton knows george was not very steady when he was at home and got into some trouble before he left the office of a civil engineer in fact this was why he went to canada  but i dont see what it has to do with me  i wonder whether you are as dull as you pretend george is mrs daltons only son although he had faults she and helen are very fond of him now it would have been something if you had merely helped him out of a difficulty but you did much more you gave him his chance of making up for past follies he has been steady ever since and i understand is now getting on very well it looks as if you had used some moral influence  i didnt try said festing dryly i gave him his job and told him id have him fired if he shirked  you didnt consciously try but its possible to influence people without knowing however as mrs dalton has too much tact to overwhelm you by her gratitude you neednt be afraid of going to the scar with me although you seem to hesitate about meeting helen  festing who pondered for a few moments felt that the girl was studying him she had shown a rather embarrassing curiosity but he though she meant to be his friend  did you know miss dalton was in the mountains when you planned my walking tour he asked  i did know said muriel with a direct glance perhaps i was rash but if so im not afraid to own my fault i suppose you understand why i sent you where i did  in one way your objects plain for all that im puzzled  muriel smiled as helen is my friend you ought to be flattered doesnt it look as if i was satisfied with you  well let that go you took something for granted i suppose you see you might have been mistaken about my feelings  then no harm would have been done muriel rejoined and putting down her fan gave him a steady look was i mistaken  you were not said festing quietly i mean to marry miss dalton if she is willing im anxious to know what chance ive got  i cant tell you that perhaps i have gone far enough but georges reformation is a good certificate of your character and helen and her mother owe you a debt of gratitude  festing colored rather angrily my helping the lad was so to speak an accident i dont want to be judged by this and wont urge the debt miss dalton must take me on my merits  you have pluck its a bold claim said muriel in a dry tone and then got up as gardiner and the curate came in  next day festing went to the scar and when mrs dalton received him she put her hand gently on his arm she said enough but not too much and he was moved as he saw the moisture glisten in her eyes  i dont deserve this he answered awkwardly i found the lad in some trouble but hadnt to make much effort to help him out in fact it was the kind of thing one does without thinking and forgets  ah said mrs dalton the consequences of ones deeds follow one whether theyre good or bad then she gave him a very friendly smile but perhaps we had better join the rest outside  festing found helen in the garden with her aunt and some friends but the others left them by and by and they walked alone among the flowers the day was calm the light clear and the shadow of the dark beeches on the hill crept slowly across the lawn beyond a low hedge woods smooth pastures and fields of ripening corn rolled back and melted into the blue shadow beneath the rugged fells it seemed to festing that the peaceful sylvan landscape was touched by a glamour that centered in the fresh beauty of the girl sometimes they were silent and sometimes they talked about the mountains but when they went back to the house he thought they had got nearer  he returned to the scar without muriel a week later and went again and one evening stood with helen on the terrace gentle rain had fallen for most of the day but it had stopped and a band of palesaffron glimmered under heavy clouds in the west moisture dripped from the motionless branches and the air was hot the lamps had just been lighted in the house and a yellow glow streamed out  ive stayed longer than i meant and forgot my lamp festing remarked however this has happened before and i hope i havent stayed longer than i ought  we will let you go now said helen for one thing i must get up early  eight oclock festing suggested  no said helen smiling i am always up before but it will be six oclock tomorrow i want to gather some mushrooms they ought to be plentiful after a day like this  is six oclock a particularly suitable time  five oclock might be better if you dont go early you often find that somebody has been round the fields first  festing asked where she expected to find the mushrooms and when she told him said very well ill meet you it only means half an hours journey on your fine english road that is if the bicycle holds up  but why do you want to gather mushrooms  i dont want to gather mushrooms i really want to see you where i think you belong  in the fields helen suggested humorously  no said festing i dont mean in the fields ive seen you in the afternoon when the suns on the ripening corn and the leaves are dark and thick but they stand for fulfilment and thats not your proper setting once or twice ive stopped until evening but you dont belong to the dusk  then where do i belong  to the sunrise when the earth is fresh and the day is getting bright promise is your sign fulfilment hasnt come  helen colored and as she turned her head it struck her as portentous that she glanced towards the saffron streak that glimmered in the west when she looked back however her face was calm  ah she said i wonder how and where the fulfilment will come sometimes i think of it and feel afraid my life has been so smooth  you wont flinch if you have to bear some strain  helen gave him her hand well you must go now i will expect you tomorrow  she stood looking towards the fading light for some time after his figure melted into the shadows on the drive her heart beat and she felt a thrill for she admitted that the man had power to move her as yet she would not ask herself how far his power went but she knew the question must be answered soon other men had flattered her and she had smiled knowing what their compliments were worth but she could not smile now then she roused herself and went in quietly  festing met her next morning while the sun rose above the rounded masses of the beech wood and entering a dewy pasture they skirted a fence halfsmothered in briars both felt invigorated by the freshness of the morning and brushed across the sparkling grass engaged in careless talk by and by as helen stooped to pick a mushroom a shrill scream came from beyond the fence and she rose with an angry color in her face  oh she said that spoils everything  what is it festing asked as the pitiful scream rose again  a rabbit choking in a snare she answered with a look of horror  festing leaped across a ditch and plunged into the briars helen heard the rotten fencerails smash and he vanished behind the thorny branches that closed across the gap she was glad he had gone so quickly partly because it was her wish and partly because she saw the cry of pain had moved him she liked to think he was compassionate  as a matter of fact festings pity was soon mixed with rage as he came upon a scene of barbarous cruelty three or four rabbits lay quiet upon the grass but there were others that struggled feebly at his approach their eyes protruding and strangling wires cutting into their throats he thought they were past his help but one rolled round with halfchoked screams and he ran to it first it was difficult to hold the struggling animal while he opened the thin brass noose but he set it free and it lay paralyzed with fear for a few moments before it ran off  then he released the others as gently as he could their dewdraggled bodies felt cold and limp and the wire had bitten deep into the swollen flesh two however feebly crawled away and he carried another to the mouth of a burrow after which he wiped the dew and blood from his hands while his lips set in a firm line he hoped he was not a sentimentalist and admitted that man must kill to eat moreover he had used the rifle in the northern wilds once a hungry cinnamon bear had raided the camp and he remembered a certain big bull moose that was clean sport for a man who faced such antagonists must shoot quick and straight but this torturing of small defenseless creatures revolted him still he admitted that it might not have done so quite so much but for the pain it caused the girl  helen glanced at him with some surprise when he went back to the fence she had not seen him look like that  ive let them go but two or three are dead he remarked i suppose theyve been lying there all night  im afraid so they come out to feed at dusk its horribly cruel  its devilish why dont you stop it is the field yours  it goes with the house and when we let the grazing i stipulated that no snares should be laid but there was some mistake and the tenant claimed the rabbits we said he could shoot them and i understand hes disputing with the agent but where are you going  im going back to finish the job these particular snares wont be used again if you like ill come over every evening and pull the blamed things up  i dont think that will be necessary helen answered with a strained laugh  she felt disturbed and excited when festing turned away her life had been smooth and she did not think she had seen a man seized by savage anger certainly not a man she knew festing was angry and no doubt justly but at the scar the primitive vein in human nature was decently hidden now she did not know if she were jarred or not then she heard voices and going nearer the fence tried to see through the briars  festing with a pocketknife and some brass wire in his hand confronted a big slouching man who carried a heavy stick and a net bag bits of fur stuck to the fellows clothes and there was blood on his dirty hands a halfgrown lad with another stick waited rather uneasily in the background  what might you be doing the man inquired  im cutting up your snares festing replied what have you got to say about it  the other gave him a slow sullen look only that youd better leave the snares alone how many rabbits  four said festing pulling up another snare and cutting the noose  then that will be five shillings ill say nothing about the snares wires cheap  festing laughed its a dead bluff light out of this field before i put you off  the man hesitated his eyes fixed on festings hardset face perhaps a way out might have been found but the lad precipitated matters running to the mouth of the burrow he picked up a halfdead rabbit that was trying to crawl away and leered at festing as he raised his stick the blow was not struck for festing leaped across the grass and next moment the boy fell beside the burrow he was unhurt but too surprised to move because he had never seen anybody move as fast as the man who threw him down  then festing heard steps behind and turned in time to guard his head with his right arm it felt numb and he was half dazed by a shock of pain but he struck savagely with his left hand and his knuckles jarred on bone the others stick dropped and when they grappled festing was relieved to feel his arm was not broken his muscles were hard and well trained his blood was hot and a struggle of the kind was not altogether a novelty when liquor is smuggled into a construction camp a section boss must sometimes use physical force or relinquish his command  he staggered and nearly fell as his leg was seized it looked as if the lad had come to his masters help but one could not be fastidious and a savage backward kick got rid of the new antagonist the other was powerful and stubborn and festing spent a strenuous few minutes before he threw him into the sand beside the burrow  im pretty fresh and ready to start again if you are he said still i reckon you have had enough  the fellow got up scowling and told the lad to bring his bag  youll hear more about this he rejoined and slouched off  festing went back and helen started when he jumped across the ditch his jacket was torn his lip was cut and his face was bruised he looked dishevelled but not at all embarrassed in fact there was a gleam of halfhumorous satisfaction in his eyes  the snares are all cut up he said i broke the fellows stick and threw away the pegs  helen felt a strange desire to laugh there was something ridiculous in his naïve triumph but she was not really amused in fact her confused sensations were puzzling  did you hurt him she asked  i hope so said festing i rather think i did and dont expect hell come back while im about however as i cant come here as often as id like it might be better to see your agent in the meantime well look for some mushrooms  but dont you want to bathe your face  i forgot that i probably look the worse for wear said festing who wiped his cut lip still if i met your mother she might get a shock and now i come to think of it im no doubt jarring you so ill go off and see your agent if youll tell me where he lives  its some distance and we dont do things so quickly here i must talk to my mother first besides the agent may not have got up  then ill sit on the doorstep but what is there to talk about you dont want your rabbits tortured so that somebody may make thirty cents apiece it has got to be stopped and why not stop it now where does the fellow live  helen told him and added but you cant go like that  no i suppose not said festing doubtfully it wont make a long round if i call at gardiners ill come back later and tell you how ive fixed things up  he lifted his badly crushed hat and when he turned away helen laughed a halfhysterical laugh his fierce energy had so to speak left her breathless she was shaken by confused emotions it was for her sake he had plunged into the quarrel but she felt disturbed by his savageness for all that something in her approved and it was really this that troubled her picking up the basket she crossed the field with a very thoughtful look    chapter x  helen decides  some weeks had passed since festing went to gather mushrooms when he sat one evening on the terrace in front of gardiners house his brows were knit and he had in his had a letter from kerr at the construction camp the back of the letter was covered with penciled calculations but he presently put it down and looked moodily about  the larches that sheltered the house had been in full leaf when he came but now they were getting bare one could see the hills through a fine network of twigs dotted with minute tassels of gold the beeches and oaks looked solid yet but the former shone warm brown and red against the others fading green withered leaves fluttered down and the smell of a burning heap hung in the damp air  the touches of brown and gold in the landscape hinted that time was passing winter was already advancing across the wastes of northern canada and the geese and ducks were flying south festing heard in fancy the brants changing cry that always filled him with unrest but the letter in his hand was a clearer call kerr had offered him a contract for hauling a quantity of telegraph posts and logs across the snow and his calculations indicated that the work ought to be profitable it would keep him occupied all winter one could buy horses cheap when harvest was over and sell them advantageously when plowing began in the spring besides the money he earned would help him to stock his farm and furnish his homestead well  he had loitered in england long enough he would never forget this holiday for he had learned what happiness life might have in store but it was a happiness that could not be attained by romantic dreams he must earn it by tense effort and was willing to pay the price this was the reason he must get back to work for all that he had doubts and was glad when muriel came along the terrace and sat down on the bench  you look unusually thoughtful she said  i have something to think about i find i must go back to canada very soon  muriel made an abrupt movement you are going away but we thought she paused and resumed does helen know  not yet i must tell her it will cost me something to leave but ive got to go perhaps you had better see what kerr has to say  he gave her the letter and after waiting until she had read it went on i cant let this chance pass i want the money  i think i understand said muriel still you havent told me much  he was silent for a few moments and looked very grave but she had for some time imagined that he was bearing a strain  well he said im up against things and cant see my way that is i do see where i mean to go but dont know if i ought  the problems not exactly new however if you will state it clearly  ill try said festing one can trust you in fact i wanted to tell you before  he explained his difficulties practical and moral and when he finished muriel said it comes to thisyou are in love with helen and mean to marry her but hesitate because you fear she may find the life too hard  its a big risk for an english girl she must give up everything while i have all to gain  but suppose she were willing  the trouble is that she doesnt know what she may have to bear  muriel smiled its a risk that many girls must run but after all it depends upon what she values most  comfort leisure refined friends and other things you enjoy here are worth much to a girl  all this is true muriel agreed and pausing continued with a blush still these things dont satisfy every need and perhaps my example may be some encouragement fred isnt very clever and will probably never be rich but id sooner face poverty with him than marry a prince  festing bowed thank you for that freds a very good sort i knew you had pluck  i really think helen is pluckier and stronger than me but i imagine you have already made up your mind  i have for all that im afraid if i have bad luck helen will have to pay i know she was willing to marry charnock but she was very young then and he was rich compared with me  then i suppose a little money would be a useful help  it would in one way festing agreed the trouble is that i havent much only enough to make a fair start if im economical  for a moment muriel looked amused but her seriousness returned well let that go you seem to forget that you dont stand alone i should have found it hard to forgive fred if he had decided whether he ought to marry or not without consulting me its a girls right not her lovers to say what she values most and how much she is willing to bear if helen loves you shes entitled to be given the choice  ah said festing i dont know if she loves me yet  muriels eyes twinkled that is something you must find out for yourself but perhaps i have said enough  she went back to the house and festing sat still in the gathering dark he had made up his mind and felt encouraged but he saw difficulties that must be met  next day he went to the scar and found that helen was not at home but mrs dalton and her sister received him and for a time he talked about things that did not matter it was dull and damp outside and a bright wood fire burned in the grate the lowceilinged room was very warm its comfort seemed enervating and he felt braced as he thought of the windswept prairie then he knew his remarks were vague and disconnected it was a relief to plunge into the business he had come about  i had better tell you that i am going to ask helen to marry me he said  mrs dalton did not look surprised and he thought miss graham smiled perhaps he had been abrupt but he did not care  you have done what is proper in warning my sister first miss graham remarked but mrs dalton was silent for a few moments  you imply that helen doesnt know she said  she does not ive been careful not to give her a hint festing declared i was afraid to alarm her by so to speak rushing things youre not used to it in england  miss grahams amusement was plainer the caution you exercised must have cost you something  after all you havent known helen long mrs dalton resumed  thats so in a way but five minutes was long enough i knew id never marry anybody else when i saw her in the garden the first day i came  he thought miss graham gave him an approving look but he turned to mrs dalton  i hope you will give your consent but of course if you object or theres anything you want to ask  mrs dalton roused herself she felt breathless as if she had been carried along at an unusual pace  to begin with she said quietly i cannot object to you we know something about your character you helped my son helped him more than you perhaps thought but there is something i must ask she hesitated and then resumed you have seen the life helen leads with us she has never had to use much selfdenial what have you to offer her in canada  not much in fact thats partly why i came first to you i felt you should be warned thats really what i meant  you are honest miss graham interposed you want my sisters approval but dont think it essential  festing looked at mrs dalton if you refused i wouldnt be altogether daunted i might wait but that is all this is a matter helen must decide  yes all the same it is my duty to guard her from a possible mistake  very well ill make matters as plain as i can to begin with i havent much money and although im building a good homestead a western farm is very different from the scar theres none of the refinement you have round you a man must work from sunrise until its dark and there are many demands upon a woman for all that i can guard against helen suffering actual hardship in fact she shall suffer nothing i can save her from its the pressure of things one cant control and her own character that may cause the strain if i know her she wont stand by and watch when theres much that ought to be done  she would not but how long do you expect the strain to last  not very long two years three years i cant tell when you break new land you work hard and wait the railroad throws out branches elevators are built small towns spring up and while you improve your holding comfort and often prosperity comes to you  but in the meantime a little capital would help  of course said festing the trouble is i havent much but i think i have enough to provide all thats strictly necessary  he thought mrs dalton gave her sister a warning glance but she said well you have my consent to ask helen but if she is willing to run the risk there is a stipulation i must make  so long as you consent ill agree to anything festing declared i cant repay you for your trust but ill try to deserve it  mrs dalton told him where helen had gone and setting off to meet her he presently saw her come round a bend in a lane the sun had set and tall oaks growing along the hedgerows darkened the lane but a faint crimson glow from the west shone between the trunks to the east the quiet countryside rolled back into deepening shadow for a moment festing hesitated as he watched the girl advance it was rash to uproot this fair bloom of the sheltered english garden and transplant it in virgin soil swept by the rushing winds then he went forward resolutely  helen gave him her hand and moved on with disturbed feelings for there was something different in his look  if you dont mind well stop a minute i have something to say to begin with im going back to canada  she looked up sharply and then waited with forced calm until he resumed that precipitates matters because i must learn if ive hoped for too much before i go i was a stranger when i came here and you were kind  you were not a stranger helen said quietly george told us about you and for his sake  i dont want you to be kind for georges sake but my own id sooner you liked me for what i am with all my faults  if its any comfort i think i really do like you helen admitted with a strained smile  well enough to marry me  helen colored but gave him a level glance ah she said arent you rash you hardly know me yet  im not rash at all i knew you long ago your portrait hung in charnocks house and i used to study it on winter nights it told me what you were and when i saw you under the copper beech i knew you very well still now i have seen you your picture had lost its charm  then you have it helen asked  festing gave her a russia leather case and her face flushed red  did bob give you this  no said festing quietly i stole it  and the case  the case was made in montreal i went to winnipeg but could get nothing good enough  helen turned her head it was a long way to winnipeg from the prairie bridge and she was moved that he had made the journey to find a proper covering for her picture  you must have valued the portrait she remarked shyly  i did but it wont satisfy me now as soon as i met you i fell in love with you somehow i think you must have seen  yes said helen quietly i did see  festing summoned his selfcontrol you must know what you decide i must live in canada my homestead may seem rude and bare after your mothers beautiful house and i tried to show you what a prairie farm is like  i think i know helen said and gave him a quick tender look still such things dont really matter  then festing stepped forward and took her in his arms  an hour later he sat talking to mrs dalton and miss graham in the drawingroom  i am glad you have agreed to wait and come back for helen in the spring but i ought to tell you something now because it may make a difference in your plans mrs dalton remarked you admitted that some of the difficulties you and helen would have to meet might be avoided if you had a little more capital  it would certainly make a difference but i have got no more  helen has some money mrs dalton replied  festing knitted his brows i didnt suspect this  that is obvious miss graham interposed  festing got up moved a pace or two and stopped how much has she got  mrs dalton told him and he frowned then she had better keep it id sooner you tied it up  isnt that unreasonable miss graham asked  its a mans business to support his wife i dont want to live on helens money besides ive made my plans  i dont think you quite understand mrs dalton rejoined after all it is not a large sum and can be used for helens benefit it may save her from some discomfort and give her advantages you could not provide  festing pondered for a few moments and then answered thoughtfully yes i see this and cant refuse well perhaps the safest way would be to transfer the land i bought to helen and record it in her name its bound to go up in value and couldnt be taken from her unless she borrowed on a mortgage the arrangement would set free my capital and enable us to run the homestead on more comfortable lines then he paused and asked did charnock know about the money  he did not said mrs dalton we thought it better not to tell him but we can trust you  thank you said festing who was silent for a time  he had wondered whether he had misjudged charnock in one respect but saw that he had not the fellow was a cur and would not have married sadie if he had known about helens money but this did not matter  well he resumed if you agree to my proposition well get a lawyer to fix it up in a way its some relief to know helen has enough and now im going to talk to her  he found her in the next room and she gave him a smile i expect mother has told you im not as poor as you thought are you pleased or not  im pleased for your sake because theres not much risk of your finding things too hard but id have been proud to marry you if you had nothing at all  not even a certain prettiness helen asked  your beautys something to be thankful for but after all its so to speak an accident like your money it wasnt your beauty but you i fell in love with  helen blushed ah she said now youre very nice indeed    chapter xi  sadie uses pressure  it was getting cold in the small back office when sadie put down her pen and went into the store she was cramped with sitting for she had been occupied with accounts for several hours and the stove had burned low  you can quit now steve she said to the clerk put out the lights but dont lock up im going to wait until the boss comes  the clerk turned his head to hide a smile because he knew where charnock was and thought mrs charnock might have to wait some time but he did as he was told and when he went out sadie stood shivering at the door she had married charnock late in the fall and now it was march but there was no sign yet of returning spring the sky was dark and a bitter wind from the prairie blew down the empty street blocks of squarefronted houses stood out harshly against the snow which sparkled here and there in a ray of light the settlement looked ugly and very desolate and sadie studied it with a feeling of weariness and disgust it seemed strange that she had once thought it a lively place but this was before she met charnock who had taught her much  shutting the door she returned to the office and glanced critically at her reflection in a mirror on the wall she had been ill in consequence of the strain she had borne while her father was sick and looked older her face was thin and she felt tired but her skin had not lost its silky whiteness and her black dress hung in becoming lines it was a wellcut dress for sadie was extravagant in such matters and knew how to choose her clothes she had lost the freshness that had marked her but had gained something a touch of dignity that she thought of as style  sitting down at the desk she began to muse keller had fallen ill soon after her wedding it was a painful illness and as skilled help was scarce she had nursed him until he died he was a plain storekeeper but she knew he was in many ways a bigger and better man than bob he demanded all that was his but he kept his word and when he undertook a thing put it over which bob seldom did shortly before he died he gave sadie good advice  you got the man you wanted and now its your job to look after him head him off the liquor and keep your hands on the dollars ive fixed things sos they belong to you  another time he asked for certain accounts and after studying them remarked you want to watch the business and run it all its worth you have a husband to work for now and i guess a man like bob comes expensive still if you can guild him right hes not all a fool  sadie had not resented this she knew it was true and her father had not meant to sneer he was a blunt man and generally talked like that and sadie sometimes did so well she had not been cheated because she knew what bob was before they married and although ambition had something to do with it she loved him for all that she had got some rude jars and now passion was dying her love was colored by a certain halfmaternal protection bob must be watched and guarded  her ambition however remained she had beauty and intelligence and wanted to win a place in cultured society bob could help her and she was tired of the dreary settlement but she was practical money would be needed if they were to move to one of the cities and although trade was good gathering dollars was slow work when one had an extravagant husband while she had been ill bob was left in charge of the business and on recovering her first task had been to find out how he had managed now she had found out and got something of a shock  the room got colder but bob had made some entries in a cashbook she could not understand and opening the book again she spent some time in calculations that threw no fresh light on the matter then she heard steps and turned as charnock came in  he took off his furcoat and sadie frowned as he dropped it into a dusty corner it was an expensive coat but one could not teach bob to take care of things then he kissed her and sat down on the edge of the table  youre getting prettier sadie that thoughtful look of yours is particularly fetching but i can see youre tired put those books away and lets get home  sadie knew what his compliments were worth although they had not lost their charm he wanted to put things off but she must be firm  you make me tired and i havent finished with the books weve got to have a talk  i like you best when you dont talk you sometimes say too much charnock replied besides a girl like you ought to be satisfied with being seen youre worth looking at  sadie gave him a quick glance he had recently become fastidious about his clothes and she did not grudge the dollars he spent on them his taste was good and he looked very graceful as he turned to her with a smile on his face the hint of dissipation it had worn was not so marked for she had some power over him and used it well but she thought he had been indulging there was however no use in getting angry with bob  you were at wilkinsons again she said you promised youd stop off going there i suppose he set up the whisky  i didnt take much it wasnt good whisky not like ours that reminds meim not much of a business man but ive had a happy thought my notion is we give the boys better liquor than they want they wouldnt know the difference if we kept cheaper stuff  sadie frowned because she had accepted her fathers business code his charges were high but it had been his boast that kellers delivered the goods one paid for then she realized that bob had nearly succeeded in putting off the threatened talk  no she said thats bad business in the end when youd had some whisky wilkinson got out the cards  oh well you know you stopped me playing a quiet game at home and three or four of the boys were there then a brandon realestate man asked for the cards  how much were you out when you finished the game  not much said charnock with some hesitation  how much  if you insist about ten dollars  sadie made a gesture of impatience but after all he might have had a heavier loss  ten dollars and a headache next morning for an evenings card game you surely dont know much bob but look at this statement and tell me where the moneys gone  charnock took the paper she gave him and colored  i never thought it was as much as that upon my word i didnt  wheres it gone sadie demanded  ive been unlucky said charnock who began a confused explanation  he had heard of a building lot on the outskirts of winnipeg to which he had been told a new street line would run he had paid for a time option on the site and now it appeared that the trolley scheme had been abandoned then somebody had given him a hint about a deal in grain that the speculators could not put over it looked a safe snap and he had sold down but the market had gone up and his margin was exhausted when he stopped sadies eyes flashed scornfully but she controlled her anger  youre a fool bob you never learn she said wearily anyhow you have got to cut out this kind of thing the business wont stand for it long well as you cant be trusted with dollars ill have to put you on an allowance i hate to be mean but if you waste what i give you youll get no more  charnocks face got red this is rather a nasty knock not that i want your money but the things humiliating  do you think it isnt humiliating to me  perhaps it is said charnock with a halfashamed look i admit i have been something of an ass but you are mean in a sense what are you going to do with your money if you dont intend to spend it  use if for making more anyhow until i get enough  when will you have enough  when i can sell out the business and live where i want give you the friends you ought to have instead of lowdown gamblers and whiskytanks if youd take hold and work bob wed be rich in a few years the boys like you you could do all the trade and the boom thats beginning will make this settlement a big place but i guess theres no use in talkingand im ill and tired  sadies pose got slack and she leaned her arms on the table with her face in her hands charnock feeling penitent tried to comfort her  youre a very good sort sadie and mean well ill go steady and try not to bother you again but we wont say any more about it now are those new letters the mail hadnt come when i left  she gave him two envelopes and after reading part of the first letter he started and the paper rustled in his hand  whats the matter she asked have you lost some money i dont know about  i havent charnock answered with a hoarse laugh the letters from some english friends you head that festing had gone back to the old country well hes going to be married soon and will bring his wife out  do you know her who is she  yes i know her very well shes helen dalton  the girl you ought to have married sadie exclaimed whats she like i guess you have her picture though you havent shown it me  i had one but havent now i meant to burn the thing but suspect that festing stole it confound him  sadie was silent for a few moments and then gave charnock a searching look anyhow i dont see why that should make you mad you let her go and took me instead do you reckon shed have been as patient with you as i am  no said charnock rather drearily helen isnt patient and i dare say id have broken her heart you have done your best for me and i expect you find it a hopeless job for all that i never thought festing  its done with sadie rejoined quietly although there was some color in her face if the girl likes festing what has it to do with you besides as he has located some way back from the settlement theres no reason you should meet him or his wife then she frowned and got up but the place is very cold well go home  charnock put out the light and locked the door but he was silent as they walked across the snow to the hotel and sadie wondered what he thought there was no doubt he was disturbed or he would have tried to coax her into abandoning her resolution to put him on an allowance she meant to be firm about this  for the next two or three weeks charnock occupied himself with his duties and everything went smoothly at the store and hotel he was popular in the neighborhood since his weaknesses were rather attractive than repellent to people who did not suffer from them men who drove long distances from their lonely farms liked a cheerful talk and to hear the latest joke others enjoyed a game of cards in the back office when mrs charnock was not about besides it was known that kellers was straight one got full weight and value when one dealt there  trade moreover was unusually good settlers looking for land filled the hotel and now elevators were to be built farmers hired extra labor and broke new soil household supplies were purchased on an unprecedented scale and when snow melted the hotel stables were occupied by roughcoated teams while wagons foul with the mud of the prairie trails waited for their loads in front of the store sadie felt cheered and encouraged and although bob sometimes spent in careless talk an hour or two that might have been better employed she was willing to make up for his neglect by extra work in the office at night he was doing well and she began to be hopeful  one evening however when there were goods to be entered and bills written out he went home for supper and did not come back sadie stopped in the office long after the clerk had gone but when she put down her pen the stove was out and she was surprised to find how late it was she felt tired and annoyed for she had been busily occupied since morning and suspected that bob was telling amusing stories while she did his work then in shutting up the store she forgot her rubber overshoes and the sidewalk was plastered with sticky mud she wore rather expensive slippers and thought they would be spoiled  charnock was not about when she entered the hotel and the guests seemed to have gone to bed the light was out in the office and the big lounge room where lumps of halfdry mud lay upon the board floor was unoccupied the bellboy who was using a brush amidst a cloud of dust said he did not think the boss had gone upstairs and with sudden suspicion sadie entered a dark passage that led to a room where commercial travelers showed their goods she opened the door and stopped just inside her head tilted back and an angry sparkle in her eyes  the room was very hot and smelt of liquor tobacco and kerosene the lamp had been turned too high and its cracked chimney was black charnock and three others sat round a table on which stood a bottle and four glasses one of the glasses had upset and there was a pool bordered by soaked cigarash on the boards the men were playing cards and a pile of paper money indicated that the stakes were high sadie knew them all and deeply distrusted one whom she suspected of practising on her husbands weaknesses she disliked another and the third did not count she looked up rather awkwardly and she saw that charnock had taken too much liquor  good evening boys she said i want to lock the doors and guess you dont know how late it is  wilkinson the man she distrusted took out his watch he had a horse ranch some distance off and the farmers called him a sport as a matter of fact he was a successful petty gambler but generally lost his winnings by speculating in realestate and wheat  its surely late mrs charnock he agreed still i dare say you can give us a quarter of an hour  five minutes sadie answered you can cut the game youre playing when you like im tired but ill wait  wilkinson looked at charnock but stopped arranging his cards well im ready to quit bobs made a scoop the last few deals and i reckon ive not much chance of getting my money back  go way sadie go way right now charnock interrupted you gotta put up a fair game and i cant stop when ive all the boys dollars in my pocket  sadie was sometimes tactful but her anger was quick and she disliked to hear her husband use western idioms moreover she expected him to be polite  well she said i guess thats a change your dollars are generally in their wallets but this game has to stop  mossup the man she did not like turned in his chair he was not sober and his manners were not polished at the best of times he sold small tools and hardware for a winnipeg wholesale firm  say you might call a bellboy that whiskys rank i want a different drink  charnock got up with an awkward movement but sadie did not want his help  drinks are served in the bar and the bar is shut she said  im stopping here i hired this room and as long as i pay its mine were not in manitoba and i guess the law  sadie silenced him imperiously she understood his reference to manitoba where regulations dealing with liquor are strictly enforced  i make the law at kellers and this hotel is not a gambling saloon mr wilkinson cork that bottle and put it on the shelf  as wilkinson obeyed mossup put his hand on his arm to hold him back but charnock interfered  you sit down right now understand everybody what mrs charnock says goes  certainly wilkinson agreed get off to bed mossup youll have a swelled head all right tomorrow as it is ill put out the light mrs charnock guess ill do it better than bob  think i cant put out a common old lamp charnock inquired destroy the blamed thing fore i let it beat me  youre not going to try said wilkinson who hustled him and mossup out of the room and then held the door open for sadie  she thanked him but felt that if she had ground to fear resentment it was not mossups but his wilkinson had manners but she knew he did not like to be robbed of an easy victim and it was possible that he had let bob win until he was drunk enough to be fleeced she waited a few moments to let the others go and then went upstairs and stopped in a passage that led to her room her face was hot and she breathed fast for her part in the scene had cost her something it would have been different had charnock not been there she could have dealt with the others but he had made her ashamed then she heard his step and turned with passionate anger as he came along the passage he stopped and looked at her with drunken admiration  by george youre a fine thing sadie handsomest and pluckiest woman in the township  sadie said nothing but her pose stiffened and her lips set tight  look your best when youre angry charnock went on not quite so tractive too pale and want animation when youre calm  she did not answer but felt a quiver of repulsion his voice was thick his eyes had a stupid amorous look and he smelt of whisky sadie was not remarkably fastidious she had for several years managed a hotel and had used her physical charm to attract the man but she was jarred as yet she made no appeal to the better side of bobs nature if it had a better side and his sensual admiration revolted her  charnock felt puzzled and somewhat daunted but tried to put his arm round her waist sadie seized his shoulders and pushed him violently back  dont you touch me you drunken hog she said  he gazed at her in dull surprise and then braced himself sadie had moods but generally came round if he made love to her besides although she was in one of her rages her attitude was irresistibly inciting  im your husband anyhow now dont be a silly little fool  she drew back as he advanced and picked up a mop it was used for polishing board floors and had a long handle  youre my husband when youre sober i didnt marry a whiskytank if you touch me bob ill knock you down  charnock stopped when sadie spoke like that she meant what she said she looked at him steadily for a moment or two and then put down the mop and turned away he durst not follow and when she entered a room close by he shrugged with halfbewildered resignation and stumbled off  sadie leaning with labored breath against the rail of her bed heard him fall down the three or four steps in the middle of the passage and afterwards get up and go on again then she laughed a strained hysterical laugh    chapter xii  the sacrifice  charnock hesitated about meeting sadie at breakfast but found her calm and apparently goodhumored he felt embarrassed and his head ached but she made him some strong coffee in a way he liked sadie did not often sulk and he was grateful because she said nothing about what had happened on the previous night indeed he was on the point of telling her so but her careless manner discouraged him and he resolved instead that he would stop gambling and keep as steady as he could after all sadie was really treating him well she might for example have stopped his getting liquor he meant to brace up and give her no more trouble  he kept his resolve for a fortnight and then one morning a man brought him a note from wilkinson asking him to drive over to the range charnock told the man he could not go but presently put down his pen and looked out of the open window of the office of the store the last of the snow had vanished some time since and round white clouds drifted across the sky flying shadows streaked the wide plain which gleamed like silver in the sunshine and the bleached grass rolled in long waves before the breeze there was something strangely exhilarating in the air and the dusty office smelt of saltpork and cheese it was a glorious day for a drive he need not stay long at wilkinsons and the team needed exercise moreover sadie was not about and would not come home until afternoon he might get back before her he hesitated for a few minutes and then sent an order to the stable  at midnight he had not returned and sadie sat in the office at the hotel making futile efforts to fix her attention on a newspaper the guests had gone to bed and the building was very quiet but she had kept the ostler up he might be needed and she could trust him not to talk  at length she heard the sound she listened for a beat of hoofs and rattle of wheels came down the street it was their team she knew their trot but she wondered anxiously whether bob was driving when the rig stopped she went to the door where the ostler stood with a lantern and caught her breath as wilkinson got down there was nobody else on the seat of the light wagon and charnock had set off with a different rig  wheres bob she asked in a strained voice  we put him inside said wilkinson he wasnt quite able to sit up id have kept him all night only that i reckoned you might be scared  sadie putting her foot on the wheel when the ostler held up the light saw charnock lying on a bundle of sacks he was in a drunken stupor  help bill bring him in she said with stony calm  wilkinson and the other lifted the unconscious man and staggering along a passage awkwardly climbed the stairs they put him on his bed and were going out when sadie stopped them  thank you bill hold the team for a few minutes she said and turned to wilkinson i want you to wait in the office  then she shut the door and after unfastening charnocks collar and vest stood looking at him for a minute or two he had not wakened but she had seen him like this before and was not alarmed his face was flushed and the veins on his forehead were prominent his clothes were crumpled and sprinkled with bits of hay sadie studied him with a feeling of helplessness that changed to contemptuous pity her romantic dreams and ambitions had vanished and left her this  as she turned away her mood changed again after all he was her husband and she had schemed to marry him she was honest with herself about this and admitted that bob had not really loved her much but he needed her and she must not fail him there was some comfort in remembering that he had sought no other woman her rivals were cards and liquor and she did not mean that they should win obeying a sudden impulse she turned back and kissed his hot face and then noting the smell of whisky flushed and went out with a firm step  when she entered the office however her face was hard and white she did not sit down but leaned against a desk opposite wilkinson  why did you ask bob out to the range  wilkinson did not like her look it hinted that she was in a dangerous mood but he answered goodhumoredly i thought he wanted a change you hold him too tight mrs charnock bob wont stand for being kept busy indoors all day he wont make a clerk  he wont said sadie im beginning to see it now but you dont care a straw for bob you wanted a pick on me because i made you cut out your game that night  no said wilkinson with a gesture of protest i certainly thought you were too smart although it was not my business anyhow if you let him have a quiet game with his friends at home  pshaw i know you jake wilkinson better than bob does you meant to make him drunk this evening and empty his wallet and i guess you didnt find it hard  wilkinsons face got red but he saw he would gain nothing by denial besides there was a matter he was anxious about  it wasnt hard to empty his wallet because he had only a few small bills  yes i fixed that how much did you win from him when he was drunk  he got drunk afterwards wilkinson objected then i didnt win it all there were three or four others  sadie smiled rather grimly how much  she got a jar when wilkinson told her but she fixed him with steady eyes  you knew what he had in his wallet but let him go on you thought kellers would stand for the debt  yes said wilkinson with some alarm we certainly thought so  very well kellers makes good take the pen and right out a bill like thisr charnock debtor in losses on a card game  you know its never done  its going to be done now or you wont get your cheque i know what im up against in you and your gang  wilkinson hesitated but he needed the money and made out the bill after examining it sadie wrote a cheque  ive paid you once for kellers sake but you had better stop the card games after this bobs not my partner in the business and no more of my dollars will go on gambling  ah said wilkinson sharply youre smarter than i thought  sadie gave him a searching glance and he noted an ominous tenseness in her pose and her drawnback lips he said afterwards that she looked like a wild cat  anyhow i think i have you fixed theres nothing doing in making bob drunk again but you had better understand whats going to happen if you try the next time you drive over to the settlement after my husband ill whip you in the street with a riding quirt  wilkinson put the cheque in his pocket and picked up his hat  on the whole i guess id better not risk it he said and went out  sadie let him go and then went limply upstairs she felt worn out and her brain was dull she could not think and a problem that demanded solving must wait until the morning after looking into the room where charnock lay and seeing that he was sleeping heavily she went to bed  next morning she shut herself in the office at the store and gave the clerks strict orders that she was not to be disturbed opening a drawer she took out a rough balance sheet which showed that the business was profitable and expanding fast things were going very well in spite of bobs extravagance and she thought she had prevented his wasting any more money in three or four years she could sell the hotel and store for a large sum and as she thought of it give herself a chance  she was young clever and attractive and had recently tried to cultivate her mind it was laborious work and she had not much time but the clergyman of the little episcopal church gave her some guidance and she made progress for one thing she was beginning to talk like bob and thought he noticed this although she had not told him about her studies she meant to be ready to take her part in a wider and brighter life when she left the settlement knowing little about large towns she exaggerated the pleasures they could offer montreal for example was a city of delight she had been there twice and had seen the ice palace glitter against the frosty sky the covered skating rinks the jingling sleighs and the toboggans rushing down the long white slides then she remembered afternoon drives in summer on the wooded slopes of the mountain and evenings spent among the garish splendors of dominion park where myriads of lights threw their colored reflections upon the river since then however her taste had got refined and she now admitted that if she lived at montreal it might be better to cut out dominion park  but she pulled herself up it looked as if these delights were not for her she could enjoy them if she wanted in a few years time but the risk was great bob might go to pieces while she earned the money that would open the gate of fairyland although she had checked the pace a little he was going the wrong way fast sadie knitted her dark brows as she nerved herself to make a momentous choice  on the one hand there was everything she longed for on the other much that she dislikedmonotonous work the loneliness of the frozen prairie in the bitter winter the society at very long intervals of farmers who talked about nothing but their crops and the unslackening strain of activity in the hot summer sadie thought of it with shrinking she would soon get old and faded and bob for whose sake she had done so might turn from her yet there was danger for him if they stayed at the settlement he had too many friends and whisky was always about she must save him from the constant temptation and must do so now  for all that she struggled there were specious arguments for taking the other course bob had failed as a farmer and would certainly fail again if left to himself but farming was the only occupation on the lonely prairie loneliness was essential because he must be kept away from the settlements but she saw the weak point in this reasoning because bob need not be left to himself she would so to speak stand over him and see he did his work well it looked as if she must let her ambitions go and she got up straightening her body with a little resolute jerk  tell the boss i want him she said to the clerk  charnock came in looking haggard and somewhat ashamed and sadie knew she had made the right choice when he sat down where the light touched his face for a moment he blinked and frowned  i wish youd pull down that blind he said the suns in my eyes and i cant get round the desk  sadie did so and then silently gave him wilkinsons bill he gazed at the paper with surprise and colored  id no idea i lost so much why did you pay him  because you cant said sadie he thought you had a share in the business when he risked his dollars  i suppose that means you told him i wasnt your partner  it does  i see said charnock with some dryness you thought hed leave me alone if he knew i wasnt worth powder and shot well i believe its very possible then he paused and smiled i can imagine his astonishment when you asked for a bill and must admit that youre a sport all the same its humiliating to have my friends told you dont trust me with money  the trouble is i cant trust you now you listen bob this tanking and gambling has got to be stopped  im afraid ive given you some bother charnock answered penitently for all that im not so bad as i was in fact i really think im steadying down by degrees and since you have paid my debts i dont mind promising  by degrees wont do you have got to stop right off besides you know how much your promises are worth  charnock colored thats rather cruel sadie but i suppose its deserved  i dont mean what you think not your promise to miss dalton sadie answered with some embarrassment you told me you wouldnt drive over to wilkinsons again and the first time i wasnt about you went very well since i cant trust you round the settlement were going to quit ive decided to sell out the business as soon as i can get the price i want  sell the store and hotel charnock exclaimed i suppose you know youd get three or four times as much if you held on for a few years  thats so but whats going to happen to you while i wait  charnock turned his head for a moment and then looked up with a contrite air  by george sadie you are fine but i cant allow this sacrifice  you wont be asked sadie rejoined with forced quietness she was moved by charnocks exclamation but durst not trust him or herself there was a risk of his persuading her to abandon the plan if he knew how deeply she was stirred  well he said what do you propose to do  take a farm far enough from town to make it hard for you to drive in and out donaldsons place would suit he quits in the fall you know and we hold his mortgage  charnock got up and walked about the floor then he stopped opposite his wife  you mean well sadie and youre very generous he said with some emotion still you ought to see the plan wont work i had a good farm and made a horrible mess of things  you wont do that now ill be there sadie rejoined  charnock did not answer but gave her a curious look and she pondered for a moment or two he was obviously moved but one could not tell how far his emotions went and she knew he did not want to listen she understood her husband and knew he sometimes deceived himself  no he resumed its too big a sacrifice you like people about you and would see nobody but me and the hired man while i admit im enough to jar a womans nerves then think of the work the manual work you couldnt live as the bachelors live among dust and dirt and its a big undertaking to keep a homestead clean when you cant get proper help besides theres the baking cooking and washing while you have done nothing but superintend id hate to see you worn and tired and you know youre not so patient then i get slack if things go wrong and if i slouched about brooding when i ought to be at work it would make you worse  sadie smiled thats very nice bob but how much are you thinking about me and how much about yourself  to tell the truth i dont know charnock replied with naïve honesty anyhow i am thinking about you  that is what i like but theres no use in talking since i can make this business go i can run a farm and see no other way my plans made and im going to put it over  charnock was silent for some moments and then turned to her with a look in his face she had not seen  i dont want to farm but if you can stand it for my sake i must try you will need some patience sadiei may break out at times if the strain gets too hard one cant help running away when one is something of a cur but ill come back ashamed and sorry and pitch in again since you mean to stand by me perhaps ill win out in the end  bending down suddenly he kissed her and then went to the door she heard it shut and sat still but her eyes filled with tears bob had not promised much but she thought he meant to keep his word now and doubts that had troubled her melted away she did not grudge the sacrifice she had made for a ray of hope had begun to shine it was however characteristic that after musing for a minute or two she took out some notepaper and began to write since the business must be sold there was nothing to be gained by delay and she gave a winnipeg agent clear instructions then she went out and hid her annoyance when she saw charnock sitting languidly on the hotel veranda  has wilkinson sent back our rig she asked  he has but the team has done enough where are you going  to look at donaldsons farm i want you to come along go across and ask martin if hell let you have his team  charnock got up with a resigned shrug you are a hustler sadie its not many minutes since you decided about the thing  i dont see what id get by waiting and you may as well make up your mind that youre going to hustle too now get busy and go for martins team    chapter xiii  an unexpected meeting  it was a bright afternoon and whiteedged clouds rolled across the sky before a fresh northwest wind when helen festing rode up to a birch bluff on the prairie the trees made a musical rustling as they tossed their branches tufted with opening leaves the sweep of white grass was checkered by patches of green that gleamed when the light touched them and faded as the shadows swept across the plain there was something strangely invigorating in the air but when she reached the bluff helen pulled up her horse and looked about  she missed the soft blue haze that mellowed the landscape among the english hills every feature was sharp and the colors were vivid ocher green and silver gleaming with light distant bluffs stood out with sharp distinctness she thought the new country was like its inhabitants they were marked by a certain primitive vigor and their character was clearly defined neither the land nor the people had been tamed by cultivation yet one missed the delicate halftones on the prairie but one heard and thrilled to the ringing note of endeavor  when she looked west the land was empty to the horizon and a flock of big sandhill cranes planed down the wind an animal she thought was an antelope moved swiftly through the waves of rippling grass when she turned east she saw a plume of black smoke roll across the sky and the tops of three elevators above the edge of the plain it was a portent a warning of momentous change in which she and her husband must play their part what that part would be she could not tell but the curtain was going up and on the whole she approved the stage and scenery  helen had been some time in canada and did not feel daunted the sunshine and boisterous winds were bracing one felt optimistic on the high plains and the wide outlook gave a sense of freedom she had many duties but did not find them burdensome or feel the strain of domestic labor she had been warned about for one thing her money had enabled festing to arrange his household better than he had expected and hire useful help  she took a rough trail through the bluff picking her way among the holes and rotting stumps and as she rode out the horse plunged after calming the startled animal she saw a dirty handkerchief snapping in the wind at the top of a stick close by a team cropped the grass and the end of a big plow projected from the back of a wagon there seemed to be nobody about but after riding on a few yards she saw a man lying among some bushes with a pipe in his mouth he looked half asleep but got up as she advanced and she stopped her horse with a jerk and tried to preserve her calm charnock stood looking at her with a halfembarrassed smile  bob she exclaimed i didnt think id ever meet you  i hope it wasnt a shock and we were bound to meet sooner or later the distance between our homesteads isnt great  helen had heard where his homestead was indeed festing had told her that if he had known charnock was coming to donaldsons farm he would have located farther off she would sooner have avoided the meeting but since it had happened she must not cut it too short  but what is the handkerchief for she asked and why were you lying there  its a signal of distress another trail crosses the rise a mile off and i was waiting in the hope that somebody might come along  helen now noted that a wheel of the wagon leaned to one side and he remarked her glance  the patent bush has got loose in the hub he resumed i took the pin out and then saw i might have trouble if the wheel came off it has been threatening to play this trick for some time  then why didnt you put the bush right before you started  i dont know i expect you think its typical  helen laughed bob was taking the proper line and she studied him with curiosity he looked older than she thought but remembering festings hints she did not see the mark of dissipation she had expected indeed charnock having spent a sober month or two under sadies strict supervision looked very well his face was brown his eyes twinkled and his figure was athletic he did not seem to need her pity but she felt compassionate after all she had loved him and he had married a girl from a bar  but where were you taking the plow she asked  to the smiths one of the free preemptors has a forge some distance off and if im lucky i may find him at home  you wont find him at home if you stop here  thats obvious said charnock still you see the plows too heavy for me to lift out unless i do get it out i cant try to put the wheel right  then why not take it to pieces  the trouble is you need a bent spanner to get at some of the bolts  they give you spanners with the plows and theres a box on the frame to put them in ive seen stephen use the things  just so charnock agreed stephens methodical but when i want my spanner it isnt in the box  you never were very careful helen remarked  i dont know if theres much comfort in feeling that ive paid for my neglect  helen smiled she was not going to be sentimental if you mean that you lost the spanner you dont seem to have suffered much i think you were asleep when i rode up but i was surprised to hear you had begun to farm again do you like it and how are you getting on  i like a number of things better but thats not allowed to make much difference sadie has decided that farming is good for me however i am making some progress though as you know my temperament ill admit that im being firmly helped along  there was silence for a few moments and helen pondered bob had generally been tactful and she thought his humor was rather brave he no doubt imagined she would soon learn all about his affairs and meant to make the best of things  in the meantime charnock quietly studied her she looked very fresh and prettier than he thought although she had not ridden much in england he noted the grace and confidence with which she managed the spirited range horse for all that he was rather surprised by his sensations he had expected to feel some embarrassment and sentimental tenderness when they met but she left him cold his pulse had not quickened a beat still it would be good for sadie to know helen who could teach her much and she unconsciously gave him a lead  well she said i must get home i shall no doubt see you now and then  not often if you leave it to accident he replied with a smile if you like to arrange the thing theres a nice point of etiquette you occupied your homestead before we came to ours but you see we were on the prairie first anyhow id be glad if you will let me bring sadie over  helen thought he was going too far she did not want to arrange for a meeting and would sooner not receive his wife after all the girl had supplanted her still she was curious and could not refuse  im often busy and daresay mrs charnock is while stephen does not stop work until late however if you like to take your chance  thank you said charnock well take the risk of finding you not at home now perhaps it wouldnt be much trouble if you told jasper im in difficulties youll see his place when you cross the ravine near the bluff  helen rode away but when she saw jaspers farm it was a mile off the trail and she had to cross a broken sandy belt for all that she smiled as she made the round it was typical of bob to send her he might have tethered his horses and walked the distance but he had a talent for leaving to somebody else the things he ought to do  after supper she sat on the veranda while festing leaned against the rails the house was built of shiplap boards with a roof of cedar shingles and wooden pillars supporting the projecting eaves it had been improved and made comfortable with helens money and with the land about it registered as belonging to her festing had insisted on this rather against her will because she had meant to make it a gift to him the wind as usual at sunset had dropped and clear green sky touched with dull red on the horizon overhung the plain the air was cold and bracing sound carried far and the musical chime of cowbells came from a distant bluff there were not many cattle in the neighborhood but the government was trying to encourage stockraising and had begun to build creameries  helen meditatively studied her husband festing had been plowing since sunrise and looked tired something had gone wrong with his gasoline tractor and she knew he had spent two or three hours finding out the fault this had annoyed him because time was valuable and he was impatient of delay helen approved his industry and the stubborn perseverance that led to his overcoming many obstacles but sometimes thought he took things too hard and exaggerated their importance now as he leaned against the balustrade he had the physical grace of a welltrained athlete but she thought his look was fretful and his mind too much occupied  i met bob by the long bluff as i rode home she said  festing looked up sharply well i suppose you were bound to meet him before long what was he doing at the bluff  waiting for somebody to help him with his wagon helen answered with a laugh a wheel was coming off  that was like bob he has a rooted objection to helping himself when it means an effort  for all that you were a friend of his  im not his friend now ive done with the fellow  its rather awkward helen remarked thoughtfully he asked if he might bring his wife over and although i wasnt very gracious i could not refuse  oh well it doesnt matter as i wont have a minute until the sowing is finished ill be out when he comes if he stayed with his work just now it would be better for him  helen was silent for a moment stephen was made of much finer stuff than bob but he had not the latters graceful humor and his curtness jarred  theres no reason you should resume your friendship if you dont like she said all the same i think you ought to be polite to my guests  i cant pretend the house is yours but i dont want the fellow here  but why do you dislike him so much  i dont think you need ask me that its dangerous ground but you see  i have forgiven him helen answered smiling indeed if i hadnt done so long since it would be easy to forgive him now at first i did feel dreadfully humiliated but i soon saw what he had saved me from and of course if he had kept his promise i could not have married you  festing looked at her with surprise in spite of her refinement helen would now and then talk calmly about matters he shrank from mentioning but after the lead she had given him he could be frank  well he said i havent forgiven him yet i couldnt pretend friendship with anybody who had slighted you besides when i found out how he had cheated me it was the worst moment of my life i thought you would never speak to me again because through the fellows treachery it was i who hurt you  youre very nice stephen helen replied coloring but thats all finished dont you like bobs wife i really dont want to meet her but one mustnt be a coward  you couldnt be a coward sadie has her virtues and is certainly much too good for bob but i dont want her here for all that frankly shes not your sort and shes meddlesome im not afraid shell make you discontented but i cant have a girl like that telling you how your house ought to be run although youre a beginner you manage very well and id object to improvements on somebody elses plan  helen smiled when you talk like that youre charming but well say no more about it you look tired are you sure you are not working too hard the last time jasper came he seemed surprised when he saw the ground you had broken i imagined he thought you were trying to do too much  as she spoke she glanced at the wide belt of plowing that broke the delicate green and silver of the grass in the foreground the rows of clods shone with an oily gleam in the fading light farther off the rows converged and melted into a sweep of purplebrown that narrowed as it crossed a distant rise there were two other belts one where white grasses broke through the harrowtorn sod and another flat and smooth where the landpacker had rolled in the seed all told of strenuous effort in which sweating men and horses had been aided by tractor machines  jaspers conservative and i feel i ought to do as much as i can festing replied when you bought the place you rather put me on my mettle  helen gave him a sharp glance i note that you spoke of it as my house when you ought to have said ours i dont like that stephen  it is yours i let you buy it because its value must go up and the moneys safe im glad of course that you have comforts i couldnt have given you but its my business to support my wife and ive got to increase my capital i want to give you things you like bought with money i have earned  you really want to feel independent of me helen suggested with a smile i suppose its an honest ambition but isnt the distinction you try to make ridiculous  perhaps in a way festing agreed all the same your help makes it my duty to do my best i dont want to feel i might be forced to fall back on your dollars  you are ridiculous stephen helen rejoined however lets talk about something else  the talked goodhumoredly until the dew and growing cold drove them in next morning helen got up while the sun rose from behind a bluff on the edge of the plain but when she went out on the veranda she saw the gasoline tractor and gangplow lurch across the rise this indicated that festing had been at work for some time and she looked thoughtful as she went back into the house  stephen was doing too much and she wondered whether he could keep it up things however might be easier when the crop was sown and if not she must insist upon his hiring extra help she liked to see him keen about his work but for the last few weeks he had scarcely had a minute to talk to her and she could not allow him to wear himself out after all her money gave her some power and there was no reason she should not use the power for her husbands benefit    chapter xiv  sadie finds a friend  the sun shone hot on the rippling grass but it was cool on the shady veranda where helen sat in a basket chair a newspaper lay close by and the loose leaves fluttered now and then but she did not notice that it was in some danger of blowing away she had been occupied since early morning but was not quite asleep for she was vaguely conscious of a rhythmic drumming by and by she raised her head with a jerk and glanced at the watch on her wrist it was three oclock and she had been dozing for an hour then the drumming fixed her attention and she saw a rig lurch along the uneven trail the horses were trotting fast and there were two people in the light wagon  helen saw that one was charnock the other who held the reins was no doubt his wife and helen was sorry that festing was at work beyond the rise she would have liked him to be there when she received her visitors but did not think it prudent to send for him the rig was near the house now and as she got up her dress moved the newspaper which was caught by a draught and blew down the stairs and across the grass it flapped in the fresh wind and fell near the horses feet  this was too much for the rangebred animals to stand and they reared and plunged and then began to back away from the fluttering white object charnock jumped out and ran towards their heads but sadie raised her whip with a gesture of command  dont butt in bob im going to take them past  charnock stood back obediently though his alert pose hinted that he was ready to run forward if he were needed and helen studied his companion  sadie dressed in black and white with a black feather in her white hat was braced back on the driving seat with one hand on the reins while she used the whip there was a patch of bright color in her face her eyes flashed and the rigidity of her figure gave her an air of savage resolution she looked a handsome virago as she battled with the powerful horses which plunged and kicked while the wagon rocked among the ruts helen watched the struggle with somewhat mixed feelings this was the girl for whom bob had given her up  after an exciting minute or two sadie forced the horses to pass the fluttering paper and then pulled them up  wheres stephen she asked  helen said he was harrowing on the other side of the rise and sadie getting down signed to charnock  put the team in the stable and then go and look for festing dont come back too soon  then she came towards the house and helen felt halfannoyed and halfamused stephen did not like to be disturbed when he was busy and she knew what he thought of bob moreover she wondered with some curiosity what mrs charnock had to say to her sadie sat down and waited until she recovered breath  you know who i am she remarked presently bob can drive all right but hes too easy with the team i dont see why i should get down before i want because the horses are scared by a paper  perhaps it was better to make them go on but they nearly upset you helen agreed with a smile  sadie gave her a steady criticizing glance but her naïve curiosity softened her rudeness  well i wanted to see you looks as if bob was a fool in one way but i guess i can see him through what hes up against on the prairie better than you  helen had been prejudiced against mrs charnock but her blunt sincerity was disarming besides she had expected something different a hint of defiance or suspicious antagonism  its very possible she said everything is strange here i feel rather lost sometimes and have much to learn  sadie studied her closely and after pondering for a few moments resumed when i was driving over i didnt know how i was going to take you in fact ive been bothering about it for some time i thought you might be dangerous  you thought i might be dangerous helen exclaimed with rising color surely you understand  now you wait a bit and let me finish well i might have come now and then found out what i could and given you a hint or two until we saw how things were going to be but thats not my way and i reckon its not yours very well we have got to have a talk and put the thing over to begin with i somehow feel i can trust you and neednt be disturbed  then im afraid you are rash helen rejoined with a resentment that was softened by a touch of humor you cant form a reliable opinion because you dont know me  thats so but i know bob  helen laughed she ought to be angry for mrs charnock was taking an extraordinary line but perhaps it was the best line because it would clear the ground she said nothing and sadie went on  how do you like it here  very much i like the open country and the fresh air then i think i like the people and one has so much to do that there is not time to feel moody its bracing to find every minute occupied by something useful  if you feel that way about it youll make good and youve got a fine man for your husband when festing first came to the bridge i didnt know if id take him or bob in fact i thought about it for quite a time  helens eyes sparkled mrs charnock was going too far but she controlled her resentment  after all were you not taking something for granted  well said sadie thoughtfully if id tried hard i might have got steve then but i dont know if id have been any happier with him hed have gone his own way and taken me along a good way perhaps but it wouldnt have been mine bobs different sometimes he has to be hustled and sometimes led but you get fond of a man you must take care of then everybody likes bob and he kind of grows on you i dont know how it is but you cant get mad with him  helen thought there was something humiliating to bob in his wifes patience but she was moved mrs charnock loved her husband though she knew his faults then sadie resumed in a harder voice  anyhow hes mine and i know how to keep what belongs to me  i imagine you will keep him i have no wish to take him away  well thats why i came i wanted to see you and now im satisfied bob needs a friend like your husband and he puts steve pretty high if you can see your way to let us drive over now and then evenings  helen pondered this stephen might object but he was not unreasonable and his society would certainly be good for bob she was not altogether pleased by the thought of the charnocks visits but sadies resolve to help her husband had touched her then there was something flattering in the hint that she and stephen could take a part in his reformation  very well she said i hope you will come when you like it will do stephen no harm to get a rest instead of hurrying back to work after supper  sadie looked grateful well certainly come ive talked to you as id have talked to nobody else but you know bob most as well as i do but perhaps theres enough said wont you show me the house  helen realized that she had made an alliance with mrs charnock for bobs protection and was conscious of a virtuous thrill the work she had undertaken was good but she remembered with faint uneasiness that she had pledged her husband to it without his consent she showed sadie the house and while there was much the latter admired she made from her larger knowledge of the plains a number of suggestions that helen thought useful by and by bob returned with festing for supper and stopped for another hour when he and sadie had gone festing frowned as he glanced at his watch  its too late to finish the job i wanted to do tonight he said and indicated the dark figures of a man and horses silhouetted against the sunset on the crest of the rise theres jules coming home he couldnt get on without me  helen pretended not to notice his annoyance after all youre not often disturbed and a little relaxation is good ive no doubt you had an amusing talk with bob  bob bored me badly though we didnt talk much i was driving the discharrows and he lay in the grass i had to stop for a few minutes every time i reached the turning and listen to his remarks  and you feel you deserve some sympathy helen said with a laugh well i suppose it was an infliction to be forced to talk  festings annoyance vanished i mustnt make too much of it i really dont object to talking when ive finished my work  when do you finish your work stephen  thats a fair shot in summer i stop when its too dark to see the annoying thing wasnt so much the stopping as bobs attitude he lay there with his pipe looking as if nothing would persuade him to work and his smile hinted that he thought delaying me an excellent joke i believe i was polite but certainly hope he wont come back  helen thought it was not the proper time to tell him about the invitation she had given sadie and she said idleness seems to jar you  it does i dislike the man who demands the best to eat and drink and wont use his brain or muscle if he can help in this country the things immoral the fellows obviously a cheat we live by our labor raising grain and cattle  but what about the people in the towns  a number of them handle our products and supply us with tools of course there are speculators and realestate boomsters who gamble with our earnings but their job is not as easy as it looks they run big risks and bear some strain still if it was left to me id make them plow  helen laughed youre rather drastic stephen but if one takes the long view i dare say you are right  then lets take the narrowest view we can when a farmer who hasnt much money loafs about the poolroom and lies on his back smoking its plain that hes taking advantage of somebody else perhaps the things shabbiest when he puts his responsibilities on his wife thats what bob does  im afraid he does helen admitted and mused while festing lighted his pipe  stephen was not a prig and she recognized the justice of his arguments but he was rather hard and his views were too clearcut he saw that a thing was good or bad but could not see that faults and virtues sometimes merged and there was good in one and bad in the other  well she said i like mrs charnock and she is certainly energetic and practical she went over the house and suggested some improvements for example you are building a windmill pump for the cattle and it wouldnt cost very much to bring a pipe to the house a tap is a great convenience and would save jules time filling up the tank  it will need a long pipe and cost more than sadie thinks but ill have it done however i wish i had thought of it and she hadnt made the suggestion i dont want sadie interfering with our house  but you dont dislike mrs charnock  not in a way but i dont know that i want to see her here sadie has a number of good points but shes rather fond of managing other folks affairs then shes not your kind  on the whole helen was not displeased mrs charnocks bold statements that she could have got stephen if she had wanted had jarred but it looked as if she had made an empty boast  i thought you were a democrat she remarked smiling  so i am in general but when its a matter of choosing my wifes friends im an exclusive aristocrat thats the worst of having theories they dont apply all round  helen thought his utilitarian dislike of idleness was open to this objection but it was not the time to urge bobs cause she would wait for another opportunity when stephen had not been delayed and she made him a humorous curtsey  sometimes youre rather bearish and sometimes youre very nice she said and went into the house  the charnocks returned a week later and came again at regular intervals while helen rode over to their house now and then festing refused to accompany her and sometimes grumbled but on the whole tolerated charnocks visits so long as they did not delay his work nothing must be allowed to interfere with that for he was uneasily conscious that he had set himself too big a task his dislike to using his wifes money had spurred him on and he had sown a very large crop at a heavy expense for labor horses and machines now he must spare no effort to get his money back and much depended on the weather indeed he was beginning to feel the strain of the unrelaxing exertion and care about details and this sometimes reacted upon his temper still he must hold out until the crop was reaped after which he could go easy during the winter months  one hot afternoon he lay under a mower in a sloo where the melted snow had run in spring and the wild grass now grew tall it made good hay and the fierce sun had dried it well so that he had only to cut and haul it home but something had gone wrong with the machine and after taking out the broken knife he dismantled the driving gear when he crawled out with a greasy cogwheel in his hand he was soaked with perspiration and his overalls were stained by oil the mosquitoes that did not as a rule venture out in the strong wind and sun had bitten him badly while he lay in the grass  you had better wait for ten minutes and take a smoke said charnock who had come up quietly and sat in the shade of the partlyloaded wagon youll get on faster when you have cooled down  you believe in waiting dont you festing rejoined  charnock laughed i feel justified in going slow just now sadie has given me a day off and when she doesnt think i ought to work it certainly isnt necessary it saves you some bother if you can leave that sort of thing to your wife  pshaw said festing you make me tired  he picked up the broken knife and looked at charnock bob was bantering him exaggerating his slackness as a matter of fact the fellow was not so lazy as he pretended sadie was beginning to wake him up stephen did not know if he had forgiven him or not but they had gradually dropped back into something like their old relations  you might take off the broken blades he resumed youll find new ones in the box they ought to be riveted but if you use the short bolts and file down the nuts i dare say theyll run through the guides  then he crawled back under the machine and did not come out until he head a rattle of wheels wilkinson whom he knew and disliked stopped his team close by and began to talk to charnock this annoyed festing because he was nearly ready to replace the knife  i called at your place and found you were out wilkinson remarked they told me where you had gone and when i saw festings wagon i reckoned you might have gone with him you come here pretty often dont you  steves patient charnock replied with a twinkle im not sure he enjoys my visits but he puts up with them  well i want you to drive over tomorrow evening a man you know from winnipeg is coming to see me about a deal in brandon building lots the thing looks good and ought to turn out a snap  the trouble is i havent much money to invest charnock answered and festing thought he was hesitating it looked as if wilkinson had not seen him yet for he was standing behind the machine  i understand you have a bigger interest in the farm than you had in the hotel and something might be arranged anyhow come over and hear what our friend has to say  youll be a fool if you go bob festing interposed  i dont know that this is your business wilkinson rejoined i havent suggested that you should join us  you know i wouldnt join you i had one deal with you and thats enough no doubt you remember selling me the brown horse  you tried the horse before you bought him  i did he was quiet then but ive since suspected that he was doped anyhow he nearly killed my hired man  wilkinson laughed you had your trial and backed your judgment know more about machines than horses dont you  i didnt know the man i dealt with then you warranted the brute goodtempered and easy to drive ill give you five dollars if youll take him out of the stable and harness him now  i havent time said wilkinson didnt charge you high and guess youve got to pay for learning your business the trouble is youre too sure about yourself and reckoned youd make a splash at farming without much trouble anyhow i dont want to sell charnock a horse hes a better judge than you  hes not much judge of building lots if your friend has got a safe snap why do you want to let charnock in  wilkinson began to look impatient i came over to talk to charnock and if he likes the deal its not your affair  it is my affair if you stop him when hes helping me festing rejoined if hes a fool hell talk to you some other time if hes wise he wont just now id sooner you drove off my farm  wilkinson gave him a curious look very well i reckon the place is yours or your wifes then he turned to charnock are you coming over bob  no said charnock irresolutely i dont think i will  he lighted his pipe when wilkinson started his team and presently remarked on the whole im glad you headed him off because i might have gone you mean well stephen but that man doesnt like you and ive sometimes thought he doesnt like sadie  it doesnt matter if he likes me or not said festing lets get on with the mower    chapter xv  the cheque  the northwest breeze was fresher than usual when one afternoon helen rode through a belt of sandhills on her way to the charnock farm clouds of dust blew about the horses feet and now and then fine grit whistled past her head she had her back to the boisterous wind but she urged the horse until they got behind a grove of scrub poplars then she rolled up her veil and wiped her face before she looked about  round dark clouds rolled across the sky as they had done since spring but for nearly a month none had broken a low ridge streaked by flying shadows ran across the foreground and waves of dust rose and fell about its crest sandy belts are common on parts of the prairie and when they fringe cultivated land are something of a danger in a dry season because the loose sand travels far before the wind  beyond the sandhills the level grass was getting white and dry and in the distance the figures of a man and horses stood out against a moving cloud of dust helen supposed he was summerfallowing but did not understand the dust because when she last passed the spot the soil looked dark and firm she remembered that festing had been anxious about the weather  riding on she saw the roof of the charnock homestead above a straggling bluff and her thoughts centered on its occupants strange as the thing was she had come to think of sadie as her friend her loyalty and her patience with her husband commanded respect and now it looked as if they would be rewarded bob was taking an interest in his farm and had worked with steady industry for the last month or two helen thought she deserved some credit for this she had had a part in bobs reformation and had made stephen help  sadie trusted her and no suspicion or jealousy marked their relations indeed helen wondered why she had at one time been drawn to bob were she free to do so she would certainly not marry him now still she had loved him and this gave her thoughts about him a vague sentimental gentleness it was a comfort to feel that she had done something to turn his wandering feet into the right path  when she reached the homestead she found sadie looking disturbed her face was hard but her eyes were red and helen suspected that she had been crying it was obvious that something serious had happened because sadies pluck seldom broke down  im glad you came the latter said im surely in trouble  helen asked what the trouble was and sadie told her in jerky sentences charnock had started for the railroad early that morning and after he left she discovered that he had written a cheque payable to wilkinson  its not so much the money but to feel he has cheated me and broken loose when i thought he was cured she concluded he has been going steady but now that brute has got hold of him hell hang around the settlement tanking and betting for a week or two then hell be slack and moody and leave the farm alone and ill have to begin the job again  sadie paused with tears in her eyes and then pulled herself together pshaw she said im a silly fool before you came i thought id quit and let bob go his own way but im not beaten yet if wilkinson wants him theres going to be some fight now i want you to ride over with me to the fellows place  helen felt sympathetic sadies resentment was justified and she looked rather refined when angry her stiff pose lent her a touch of dignity her heightened color and the sparkle in her eyes gave her face the charm of animation moreover her want of reserve no longer jarred reserve is not very common on the plains  but you must tell me something about it first helen replied how did you find out he had written the cheque  i suspected something after hed gone and looked for his chequebook hed torn out a form but hadnt filled up the tab bobs silly when hes cunning and didnt think about his blotter the top sheet was nearly clean and i read what hed written in a lookingglass  why did he give wilkinson the money  i guess its to speculate in wheat or buildinglots and bob will certainly lose it all but thats not what makes me mad after all its his money hes been saving it since he steadied down i can manage bob if hes left alone and thought id cut out the friends he shouldnt have wilkinson was the only danger left but hes a blamed tough proposition  helen knew festing disliked the man but she felt puzzled the sum is not very large she said i dont quite see why wilkinson thought it worth while  it shows hes pinched for money and theres some hope in that then he doesnt like me and i imagine he has a pick on your husband stephen froze him off one day when he was getting after bob anyhow i mean to get the money back  but can you it is bobs cheque  im going to try the bank deals with me sadie answered but come along i hear the hired man bringing the rig  when they got into the vehicle helen remarked that sadie had brought a flexible riding whip since the quirt was useless for driving helen wondered what she meant to do with it the trail they took ran through the grass a sinuous riband of hardbeaten soil that flashed where it caught the light it was seamed by ruts and fringed by wild barley but in places the grass had spread across it leaving gaps into which the horses legs and the wheel sank the smell of wild peppermint rose from among the crackling stalks as the team brushed through now and then a prairiehen got up and small animals like english squirrels squatted by the trail until the wheels were nearly upon them and then dived into holes  the gophers are surely plentiful sadie remarked dont know that ive seen so many around before and thats going to be bad for the grain theyre generally worst when the crop is poor  do you think the crop will be poor  sadie glanced at the sky which was a dazzling blue flooded with light except where the scattered clouds drove by  we didnt get the june rains and the frostdamp has gone down pretty deep then we have had very few thunderstorms and the sand is blowing bad it makes trouble in parts of manitoba but the scrub trees in our sandhills generally hold it up what does steve think  he hasnt told me sometimes he looks anxious but he doesnt talk about it much  thats steves way i dont know if its a good way he sees when hes up against a hard thing and makes his own plans now i want to know my husbands troubles you feel better when you can talk  helen agreed with sadie she often wished stephen would talk to her about his anxieties he wanted to save her and had confidence in himself but she felt that he left her out too much  how does the sand damage the wheat she asked  cuts the stalk takes time of course but the sharp grit puts down the grain like a binder knife if it blows through the field long enough however im not worrying much about that there are worse things than the sand and drought were fools and make our real troubles thats whats the matter with us  helen smiled sadie was amusing when philosophized but helen thought her views were sound she had chosen a stern country but its stinging cold and boisterous winds were invigorating and with pluck one could overcome its material obstacles it was human weaknesses that made for unhappiness  well she said we must hope the rain will come but hadnt we better go by the long bluff the new man has put a fence across the other trail  sadie left the trail and as they crossed a hollow the tall grass rustled about the horses legs it had lost its verdure the red lilies and banks of yellow flowers had withered on their parched stalks when they reached the level the grass was only a few inches high and the wide plain rolled back in the strong light shining paleyellow and gray it was only when the shadows passed that one could see streaks and patches of faded green in the distance a cluster of roofs broke the bare expanse and helen knew they marked the wilkinson ranch a horse and buggy approached it looking very small and she glanced at sadie who said nothing although her face was stern by and by the latter stopped her team in front of the homestead and fastened the reins to a post  now she said you sit on the veranda and wait for me it was wilkinsons rig we saw and ill find him in  wilkinson looked up from the table at which he was writing when sadie entered the room he was on the whole a handsome man but was rather fat and his black eyes were unusually close together this perhaps accounted for the obliquity of his glance which some believed conveyed a useful hint about his character he was neatly dressed in light summer clothes although the farmers generally wore brown overalls as he got up his look indicated that he was trying to hide his annoyance  this is something of a surprise mrs charnock he said politely however if theres anything i can do  you can sit down again in the meantime sadie replied and occupied a chair opposite with the quirt on her knee to begin with if youre writing to your winnipeg friend you had better wait a bit  im not writing to winnipeg but dont see what this has to do with your visit  then you havent sent off bobs cheque yet i mean to get it back  wilkinson saw that he had made a rash admission mrs charnock was cleverer than he thought  if bob wants it back why didnt he come himself  he doesnt know i have come sadie answered calmly  wilkinson studied her and did not like her look her face was hard her color higher than usual and her eyes sparkled ominously  well he said you told me you would pay no more of your husbands debts but this is not a debt besides the money must be bobs since he gave me the cheque  why did he give it you  the question was awkward because wilkinson did not want to state that he had persuaded bob to join him in a speculation this was the best construction that could be put upon the matter and he did not think it would satisfy mrs charnock  why does a man give another a cheque he rejoined with a look of goodhumor that he did not feel  the best reason i know of isfor value received but this doesnt apply you allowed it wasnt a debt so bob has got no value  one sometimes pays for value one expects to get  sadie laughed scornfully if thats what bob has done hell get badly stung theres nothing coming to him from a deal with you i guess you dont claim he made you a present of the money  i dont said wilkinson with a frown for he thought he saw where she was leading him  very well one pays for something one has got or is going to get and as we can rule out both reasons the cheque is bad in fact its not worth keeping better give it me back  your argument looks all right mrs charnock but you dont start from sure ground how do you know theres nothing coming to your husband  i know you sadie rejoined anyhow the cheque is certainly bad theyll turn it down if you take it to the bank  wilkinson made an abrupt movement you cant stop your husbands cheque you dont mean he hasnt the dollars to meet it  i dont said sadie with an angry flush bob is honest the moneys there but if you think the bank will pay when i tell them not go and see the manager knows me and he knows you  wilkinson saw that he was beaten but tried to hide his anger well it looks as if bob was lucky he has a wife who will take care of him and i reckon he needs something of the kind however heres the cheque i want a receipt  sadie wrote the receipt and he noted that her hand shook as she got up he glanced at the quirt  did you ride over i thought i heard a rig  i drove said sadie looks as i neednt have brought the quirt well im glad you agreed about the cheque being bad i meant to get it anyhow  wilkinson gave her a curious look but said nothing and she went out  ive saved bobs money she told helen as she started the team wilkinson saw my arguments and didnt kick as much as i expected but he certainly doesnt like me any better i think hell make trouble if he can  that seems unlikely helen remarked i imagine that as you have beaten him hell be glad to let the matter drop no doubt he wanted the money and was vexed because he had to give it up but i hardly think hell try to revenge himself on you men dont do these things  my husband and yours dont but wilkinson is different sadie answered  charnock had not returned when she reached the farm and after helen left she sat on the veranda feeling disturbed bob had told her he was going to the railroad to bring out some goods but he could have got back two or three hours earlier then wilkinson no doubt knew where he had gone a small settlement with two new hotels had sprung up round the station and as the place was easily reached by the construction gangs there was now and then some drunkenness and gambling for all that sadie did not mean to anticipate trouble and set about some household work that her drive had delayed it got dark before she finished but bob did not come and she went outside again  the night was clear and refreshingly cold after the scorching day the wind had dropped everything was very quiet and she could see for some distance across the plain the hollows were picked out by belts of darker shadow and the scattered bluffs made dim gray blurs but nothing moved on the waste and she did not hear the beat of hoofs she listened for  for a time she sat still lost in gloomy thought bobs relapse had been a bitter disappointment because she had begun to hope that the danger of his resuming his former habits was past he had stuck to his work which seemed to absorb his interest and had looked content there was ground for believing that with a little judicious encouragement he might make a good farmer and sadie did not grudge the patient effort necessary to keep him in the proper path now he had left it again and might wander far before she could lead him back  for all that she did not mean to give up she had fought hard for bob and was resolved to win while there was a ray of comfort the woman she had at first thought a danger was her best friend and she felt for helen festing a grateful admiration that sometimes moved her deeply helen had many advantages that she could not have combated had they been used against her grace polish and a knowledge of the world in which bob had lived but helen was on her side sadies admiration was perhaps warranted but she undervalued her own patience and courage  at length she got drowsy and forgot her troubles she did not think she really went to sleep but after a time she got up with a start a beat of hoofs and rattle of wheels had roused her and she saw a rig coming towards the house for a minute or two she stood shivering and trying to brace herself if bob was driving things might be better than she thought but when the horses stopped another man got down  perhaps youd better rouse out your hired man mrs charnock he said awkwardly ive got your husband here but its going to take two of us to bring him in  sadie brought a lamp and with her mouth firmly set looked into the rig bob lay upon some sacks in an ungainly attitude and the jolting had not broken his heavy sleep it was some time since he had come home like this and sadie felt dejected and tired then with an effort she went to waken the hired man  they carried charnock in and when she had given the driver some money she sat down and indulged her passionate indignation wilkinson had sent the rig but had not been prompted by kindness when he told the man to drive bob back it was his revenge for his defeat he had found bob made him drunk when there was nothing to be gained by doing so and sent him home like this the fellow was poisonmean but she thought him rash he had struck her a cruel blow but she did not mean to sit still and nurse the wound she must strike back with all the force she could use and make him sorry he had provoked her to fight then putting off her halfformed plans until next day she went to bed    chapter xvi  a counterstroke  when sadie got up next morning she ordered the buggy to be brought round and then went to look at charnock he was asleep of which she was rather glad because there was something to be said and she was highly strung she could not trust her temper yet and might go too far bob was generally docile particularly when repentant but it was possible to drive him into an obstinate mood when nothing could be done with him she was angry but her anger was mainly directed against wilkinson  after breakfast she drove off across the plain it was about eight oclock but the sun was hot the breeze was not so fresh as usual and a bank of dark clouds rolled up above the prairies edge they looked solid and their rounded masses shone an oily black and she wondered whether they promised one of the thunderstorms that often broke upon the plains on summer afternoons she would have welcomed the savage downpour even if it had spoiled her clothes  sadie was getting anxious about the crop its failure would mean a serious loss and she hated to see labor and money wasted but this was not all knowing the risks the farmer ran on newlybroken land she had not adventured too much of her capital on the first years harvest but success might encourage bob while failure would certainly daunt him he would work for an object he was likely to gain but if disappointed regretted the exertions he had made and refused with humorous logic to be stirred to fresh effort  im not convinced that farmings my particular duty he once said when i plow its in the expectation of cashing the elevator warrants for the grain if im not to reap the crop it seems to me that working fourteen hours a day is a waste of time that might be agreeably employed in shooting or riding about  sadie urged that one got nothing worth having without a struggle bob rejoined if you get the thing you aim at the struggles justified if you dont you think of what youve missed while you were uselessly employed of course if you like a struggle you have the satisfaction of following your bent but hustling is a habit that has no charm for me  sadie reflected that the last remark was true bob never hustled his talk and movements were marked by a languid grace that sometimes pleased and sometimes irritated her it was difficult to make him angry and she was often silenced by his whimsical arguments when she knew she was right but he was her husband and she meant to baulk the man who hoped to profit by his carelessness  then she urged the horse it was a long drive to the settlement where she had kept the hotel and she had not been there for some time the goods she and her neighbors bought came from the new settlement on the railroad which was not far off but she had an object in visiting the other it was noon when she reached the hotel and sat down to dinner in the familiar room she did not know if she was pleased or disappointed to find the meal served as well as before but her thoughts were not cheerful while she ate she remembered her ambitions and her resolve to leave the dreary plains and make her mark in toronto or montreal now her dreams had vanished and she must grapple with dull realities that jarred her worse than they had done  the diningroom was clean but unattractive with its varnished board walls bare floor and wiremesh filling the skeleton door which a spring banged to before the mosquitoes could get in there were no curtains or ventilatorfans the room was very hot and the glaring sunshine emphasized its ugliness then it was full of flies that fell upon boards and tables from the poisonous papers and a big gramophone made a discordant noise sadie remembered kellers pride in the machine and how he had bought it to amuse the boys after hearing an electric organ in a montreal restaurant yet she knew her craving for society must be gratified at such places as this a rare visit to the settlement was the only change from monotonous toil  when she offered her mealticket at the desk the clerk shook his head  you dont need to open your wallet in this house the boss left word hed be glad to see you at the store  sadie who had meant to see the proprietor complied and found him and his wife in the back office where she and bob had often sat the woman gave sadie a friendly smile  i hope they served you well when youre in town we want you to use the house like it still belonged to you  sadie made a suitable reply she had charged a good price for the business but had stuck to the keller traditions and made a straight deal stock and furniture had been justly valued and when the buyers examined the accounts she had frankly told them which debts were doubtful and which were probably bad it was about these things they wished to talk to her and she meant to indulge them  hows trade she asked to give them a lead  in one way its good replied the man were selling out as fast as we can get the truck but theres a point i want your views about the cheque i gave you wiped off most all the capital i had wholesalers put up their prices if you make them wait and a number of the boys have a bad habit of letting their bills run on now if you can give me some advice  certainly said sadie who thought the woman looked anxious suppose you read out the names and what they owe  the man opened a ledger and she told him what she knew about his customers whom he could trust and whom he had better refuse further credit then she looked thoughtful when he said wilkinson of the range  he didnt deal with us  but you know everybody round here and can tell me if hes likely to make good the man urged  how much does he owe you sadie asked  the man named a rather large sum and she pretended to consider  well she replied the boys have probably told you that wilkinsons not a friend of mine and since thats so im not going to say much about his character  its not his character were curious about do you know how hes fixed  sadie was silent for a few moments the others were young and newly married and had admitted that the purchase of the business had strained their resources it was plain that a large bad debt might involve them in difficulties wilkinson had forced her to fight and she meant to show him no mercy but she must say nothing that could afterwards be brought up against her  character counts for as much as dollars she remarked that was my fathers motto and he was never afraid to take steep chances by backing an honest man although he had debts on his books for three or four years it was seldom a customer let him down but he cut out a crook as soon as he suspected what the fellow was however you want to know how wilkinson stands well its a sure thing he finds dollars tight  anyhow a man cant disown his debts in this country  thats so but if hes a farmer the homestead laws stop your seizing his house and land and part of his stock unless he has mortgaged them to you if somebody else holds a mortgage you generally get stung  the trouble is that if youre too hard on a customer he tells his friends and the opposition gets his trade and theirs  sure said sadie kellers let the opposition have that kind of trade a crooks friends are generally like himself and theres not much profit in selling goods to folk who dont mean to pay  has wilkinson given a mortgage the man asked  if he had its got to be registered you can find out at the record office and i guess it would pay you to go and see  well i hear hes just sold a good bunch of horses that means hell have some money for a while  then you had better take your bills over and get them paid before the moneys gone sadie answered in a meaning tone  if you had the store would you risk his being able to pay all right and afterwards dropping you  i certainly would said sadie id harness my team and start for the range right now  the woman looked at her husband thats my notion tom youd better go she said and turned to sadie it would hit us hard if wilkinsons bill got much longer and he let us down  sadie left them and went to a new store farther up the street after which she called on an implement dealer who occasionally speculated in real estate and mortgages and one or two others she knew them all and they knew that on business matters her judgment was sound it was plain that they were suspicious about wilkinson but so far undecided what to do they had doubts but hesitated to admit that they had been rash and shrank from using means that might cost them a customer sadie gave one information she had gathered from another and added hints of what she herself knew the tact she used prevented their guessing that she had an object and she did little more than bring their own suspicions to a head but she was satisfied when she returned to the hotel  when the horse had rested she drove out of the settlement for some distance a wire fence ran along the dusty graded road but it ended at a hollow seamed by deep ruts that united on the other side where a trail emerged then for a mile or two she passed new scattered homesteads with their windmills and wooden barns until these dropped behind and she drove across the empty wilderness no rain had fallen the sky was getting clear and green and a vivid crimson sunset burned on the edge of the grass the air was now cool and although she was anxious about the weather sadie felt more cheerful than when she had come  she had no scruples about what she had done for one thing she had kept to the truth when she might have made her hints more damaging by a little exaggeration her antagonist had struck her a treacherous blow he was dangerous and must be downed then she smiled with grim humor as she admitted that she had perhaps done enough for a time wilkinsons creditors were on his track it would be amusing to watch them play her game  it was dark when she reached the farm and found charnock waiting on the veranda he looked dull but not embarrassed and there was nothing to indicate that he had been disturbed by her absence sadie did not tell him where she had been and did not talk much she had found out that it was better not to make things too easy for bob  i suppose you have a headache you deserve it she said im tired and dont want to hear your excuses now  i really havent begun to make excuses charnock answered  then dont begin its late and you have got to start for the bluff at sunup and haul those fenceposts home the job has been hanging on too long and must be finished tomorrow  it will be finished before dinner charnock replied as a matter of fact i brought in most of the posts today  sadies look softened but she did not mean to be gracious yet  i reckoned youd be loafing round the house and finding fault she said and left him  when she had gone charnock smiled sadie would no doubt come round tomorrow and it was lucky she knew nothing about the cheque he had given wilkinson but he wondered where she had been now he came to think of it wilkinson had said nothing abut the cheque when they met at the railroad settlement but after all there was perhaps no reason he should do so  about seven oclock one evening a fortnight later festing threw down the cantpole he had been using to move a big birch log and lighting his pipe stopped and looked about a shallow creek flowed through a ravine at the edge of the tall wheat and below the spot where he stood its channel was spanned by the stringers of an unfinished bridge the creek had shrunk to a thread of water but festing who had been wading about its bed was wet and splashed with mire moreover he had torn his threadbare overalls and his hot face was smeared where he had rubbed off the mosquitoes with dirty hands  the evening was hot he felt tired and moody and his depression was not relieved when he glanced at the wheat there was no wind now but the breeze had been fresh and the ears of grain that were beginning to emerge from their sheaths dropped in a sickly manner the stalks had a ragged look and fine sand lay among the roots the crop was damaged particularly along its exposed edge although it might recover if there was rain festing studying the sky saw no hope of this the soft blue to the east and the luminous green it melted into with the harsh red glare of the sinking sun threatened dry and boisterous weather unless a change came soon the wheat would be spoiled  it was obvious that he had sown too large a crop and the work this implied had overtaxed his strength he had felt the strain for some time and now things were going against him it got worse hope might have braced him but the thought of failure was depressing for all that there were economies he must practise at the cost of extra labor and bridging the creek would lessen the cost of transport and enable him to sell one of his teams he was late for supper but wanted to finish part of the work before he went home  by and by he saw helen stop at the edge of the ravine her face was hot as if she had been walking fast and she looked vexed  you have kept us waiting half an hour and dont seem ready yet she said  im not ready festing replied and stopped abruptly very sorry i forgot all about it he resumed  helen made a gesture of annoyance she had invited some of their neighbors to supper and had spent the day preparing the feast things however had gone wrong the stove had got too hot and spoiled her choicest dishes  you forgot she exclaimed it really isnt often i trouble you with guests  thats lucky because i havent much time for entertaining people im overworked just now  helen hesitated because she was afraid she might say too much she admired his persevering industry but had begun to feel that he was slipping away from her and devoting himself to his farm sometimes she indulged an angry jealousy and then tried to persuade herself it was illogical  then why give yourself another task by building the bridge she asked  i tried to explain that i can get the thing done with less trouble when the creek is nearly dry and if we had to use the ford when hauling out the grain it would mean starting with a light load or keeping a team of horses there when ive built the bridge and graded back the road we can take the full number of bags across and that makes for economy it looks as if ill have to be severely economical soon  helen colored she thought he did not mean to vex her but he had ventured on dangerous ground  you know that what is mine is yours she said  in a way it is but i put all my capital into the stock and crop and must try to get it back i cant ask my wife for money if i loaf about and lose my own  you dont loaf helen rejoined but if you lose your crop from causes you cant prevent happening there is no reason you shouldnt accept my help  i know youre generous and would give me all you had but  helen shook her head you dont see the matter in the right way yet but well let it go get your jacket and come back at once  must i come festing asked irresolutely  isnt it obvious  i dont think so cant you tell the folks id forgotten and started something i must finish  i cant said helen sharply it hurts to know you had forgotten the farm is lonely and i havent many friends but i cant tell outsiders how little that matters to you  im sorry festing answered with some embarrassment still i think youre exaggerating nobody would look at it like that our neighbors know one has to stay with ones work  bob finds time to go about with his wife  he does said festing dryly driving about is easier than farming and bob has no scruples about living on his wifes money i expect that was his object when he married her theres another thing i forgot hes coming tonight  he and sadie have been at the house some time  festing made a sign of resignation i could stand the others better they know what we may have to face but nothing bothers bob and its hard to play up to his confounded cheerfulness when youre not in the mood then i suppose ive got to put on different clothes  helen forced a smile when they first came to the homestead stephen had changed his clothes for supper and afterwards devoted himself to her amusement sometimes playing chess and sometimes listening while she sang then as the days got longer he had gradually grown careless contenting himself with changing his jacket and half an hours talk until at length he sat down to the meal in dusty overalls and hurried off afterwards helen had tried to make excuses for him but felt hurt all the same stephen was getting slovenly and neglecting her  its plain that you must take off those muddy overalls she said  they went back and supper was delayed while festing changed he forced himself to be polite when he joined his guests but it cost him something and the dishes helen had carefully prepared were spoiled on the whole he felt grateful to sadie and bob who kept the others in goodhumor and relieved him from the necessity of leading the talk but he was glad when they left  when the rigs melted into the shadowy plain he stood on the veranda and yawned  well he remarked thats over and it will be some time before they need come back i hope none of them will think they have to ask us out in return  you gave them a very plain hint helen said bitterly  festing did not answer and went into the house he felt he had not been tactful but he was very tired and if he ventured an explanation might make things worse besides he must get up at four oclock next morning  helen sat still for some time looking out on the prairie she was beginning to feel daunted by its loneliness except for sadie charnock visitors seldom came to the farm her neighbors lived at some distance but she had hoped to plan a round of small reunions that would break the monotony stephen however had shown her that she could expect no help from him and had actually forgotten her first party she felt wounded it was hard to think that so long as he had work to do she must resign herself to being left alone    chapter xvii  festing uses force  a week or so after the supper party festing started for the settlement with some pieces of a binder in his wagon he had bought the machine secondhand and meant to replace certain worn parts before harvest began although he doubted if this was worth while the drought was ripening the grain prematurely and some of it was spoiled but he must try to save as much as possible reaching the edge of the wheat he stopped the team irresolutely half tempted to turn back because it seemed unlikely that the old binder need be used  the wind had fallen the mosquitoes were about and bit his face and neck everything was strangely quiet it was very hot and masses of leaden cloud darkened the horizon festing however had given up hoping for rain which would not make much difference if it came now  the front of the wide belt of grain was ragged and bitten into hollows by the driving sand the torn stalks drooped and slanted away from the wind while others that had fallen lay about their roots farther in the damage was less but the ears were halffilled and shriveled the field was particolored for the dull dark green had changed to a dingy sapless hue and the riper patches had a sickly yellow tinge instead of a coppery gleam  festings face hardened if he thrashed out half the number of bushels he had expected he would be lucky he had staked all he had on the chances of the weather and had lost it was his first failure and came as a rude shock to his selfconfidence he felt shaken and disgusted with himself for it looked as if he had been a rash fool still if rain came now he might save enough to obviate the necessity of using helens money she would give him all he asked for but this was a matter about which he felt strongly and she knew his point of view  driving on he met the mailcarrier who gave him a letter it was from kerr his former chief on the railroad who had been moved to a new section on the pacific slope he told festing about certain difficulties they had encountered and the latter felt a curious interest indeed he looked back with a touch of regret to the strenuous days he had spent at the construction camps the work was hard but one was provided with the material required and efficient tools then there was freedom from the responsibility he felt now one did ones best and the company took the risk  festings interest deepened when at the end of the letter kerr told him about a contract for which nobody seemed anxious to tender it was a difficult undertaking but kerr thought a bold resourceful man could carry it out with profit he did not know if it would appeal to festing although prairie farmers sometimes went to work with their teams on a new track when their harvest was poor kerr ended with the hope that this was not the case with festing  the latter sat still for a few minutes with his brows knit and then started his team it was too late to think of railroad contracts he had chosen his line and must stick to it but his look was irresolute as he drove on  some time after festing reached the settlement wilkinson and three or four others sat smoking in the poolroom this supplied a useful hint about their character because supper would not be ready for an hour or two and industrious people were busily occupied the room was hot the floor and green tables were sprinkled with poisoned flies and the wooden chairs were uncomfortably hard but it was cooler than the sidewalk and the men lounged with their feet on the empty stove  does anybody feel like another game one asked  no said the man he looked at ive lost three dollars and thats all i can spare cant spare it for that matter but its gone im going broke if this weather lasts  thats nothing remarked another some of us have been broke since we came here you get used to it therell be other folks in a tight place if the rain doesnt come but it wont make much difference to you wilkinson i guess the storekeepers have you fixed now  wilkinson frowned he knew the remark was prompted by malice because he had won the money his companion had lost the fellow however had not exaggerated his creditors had recently stopped supplies and made demands with which he was unable to comply and since they were obviously consulting each other it looked as if he would be sold up and forced to leave the neighborhood somebody had put them on his track and he suspected mrs charnock he meant to punish her if he could  ive certainly got to sell off a bunch of young horses sooner than i meant i expect youve seen the notices he said and added with a sneer theyd have made a much better price if i could have kept them until the spring and nows your chance if you have any dollars to invest its a sure snap for anybody wholl help me hold them over  one of the men laughed ironically and another asked why dont you try charnock he used to be a partner of yours and hes more money than the rest of us  wilkinson saw his opportunity his companions were loafing gossips and those who were married would tell their wives in a very short time the rumor he meant to start would travel about the neighborhood and there was enough truth in it to make it dangerous and hard to deny  charnocks deadbeat hes as poor as you  his wife has plenty dollars anyhow  thats so but shes not going to give him any more wilkinson rejoined he married sadie for her money and now he hasnt sense enough to stick to her  it was obvious that he had secured the others attention for they waited eagerly with their eyes fixed on him the room was quiet but a rig came up the street and the rattle of wheels and harness drowned the sound of steps outside nobody noticed that the door which was not quite shut opened wider  what do you mean by that one asked  bobs running after mrs festing old sweetheart of his in england though he turned her down to marry sadie now shes got hold of him againtired of festing or has a pick on mrs charnock perhaps anyhow bobs round the festing place all the time and i dont know that i blame him much mrs festings a looker and sadies a difficult woman to live with  but what has festing got to say  wilkinson laughed festings a bit of a sucker and doesnt know hes scared about the big crop he has sown and thinks of nothing but the weather and his farm while bob goes over when hes off at work but i guess theres trouble coming soon  its coming now said somebody and wilkinsons jaw fell slack and he sat with his mouth open as festing strode into the room  the latter had come to look for a smith and hearing wilkinsons voice as he went up the steps waited for a moment or two he was too late in one sense because the harm had been done but he could not steal away although the course he meant to take was not very logical judgment would be given against him if he did nothing his sunburned face was rather white and he stood very stiff with muscles braced looking down at wilkinson  get up you slanderous brute and tell them its a lie he said  ill be shot if i will said wilkinson who got on his feet reluctantly you know its true  then he flung up his arm a second too late for festing struck him a smashing blow and he staggered with the blood running down his face  he recovered in a moment and seizing a billiard cue brought the thick end down on festings head festing swayed halfdazed but grasped the cue and they struggled for its possession until it broke in the middle and wilkinson flung his end in the others face after this for a minute or two the fight was close and confused and both made the most of any advantage that offered  in western canada personal combat is not hampered by rules the main thing is to disable ones antagonist as quickly as possible and festing knew that wilkinson would not be scrupulous he must not be beaten particularly since his defeat would to some extent confirm the slander  he grappled with wilkinson as a precaution because another cue stood near and with a tense effort threw him against the empty stove the shock was heavy enough to bring the stovepipe down and a cloud of soot fell upon the struggling men while the pipe rolled noisily across the floor wilkinson however stuck to him and they reeled up and down between the wall and table getting an arm loose now and then to strike a blow and scattering the chairs nobody interfered or cleared the ground and by and by wilkinson caught his foot and fell down bringing festing with him after this they fought upon the floor rolling over among the chairs until their grip got slack both got up breathing hard and festing gasped  tell them youre a liar its the last chance youll get  wilkinson did not answer but struck him before he could guard and the fight went on again amidst a cloud of dust that rose from the dirty boards then it ended suddenly for festing got his left arm free as he forced his antagonist towards the open door he struck with savage fury and wilkinson reeling backwards across the narrow veranda plunged down the stairs and fell into the street he did not get up and festing leaned against the wall and wiped his bleeding face  pick up the hog and take him to the hotel he said and tried to fill his pipe with shaking hands while the rest went out  other people joined them in the street and festing stealing away as a crowd began to gather went to the implement store where he washed his face and brushed his damaged clothes there was a cut on his forehead and his jacket was badly torn while some of the soot that had fallen upon it would not come off after a rest and a smoke however he did not feel much worse and the dealer going to the hotel brought back news that wilkinson had driven home  i guess you have done all you could and can let the fellow go he said my notion is he wont be in the neighborhood long  an hour later festing drove out of the settlement with a strip of sticking plaster on his forehead and his jacket clumsily mended the sky was now a curious leaden color and the wild barley shone a livid white against the dark riband of the trail the air was very hot and there was not a breath of wind festing noted that the horses were nervous and trotted fast although they had made a long journey now and then they threw up their heads and snorted and swerved violently when a gopher ran across the trail or a prairiehen got up the flies seemed to have gone but the mosquitoes were out in clouds and the hand with which he slapped his face and neck was soon smeared with small red stains he could not hold the whip but it was not needed because the team rather required to be checked than urged  when the trail permitted he let them go and swung lost in gloomy thoughts with the jolting of the rig the damaging part of wilkinsons statement was false but since part was true the tale would spread and some would believe the worst it was impossible to doubt helen but he was angry with her she had let her ridiculous notion of reforming bob carry her away festing did not think bob could be reformed but it was sadies business not helens besides he had objected to her encouraging the fellow to hang about the homestead and she had disregarded his warnings now the thing must be stopped and it would be horribly disagreeable to tell her why she had been obstinate and rash but after all she meant well and would be badly hurt he began to feel sorry for her and his angry thoughts centered on charnock  it was of course ridiculous to imagine that bob was seriously trying to make love to helen he knew her character too well all the same the fellow might amuse himself by mild indulgence in romantic sentiment he was a fool and a slacker and had now humiliated helen for the second time the longer festing thought about it the angrier he got and when he roused himself as the horses plunged down the side of a ravine he was surprised to note how far he had gone he had just time to tighten the reins and guide the team across the open log bridge at the bottom and as they plodded up the other side saw that he had better get home as soon as possible  the drooping leaves of the birches in the hollow flittered ominously and when he reached the summit a bluff that stood out from the plain two or three miles off suddenly vanished it looked as if a curtain had been drawn across the grass the horses set off at a fast trot and the rig jolted furiously among the ruts it would not be dark for an hour but the gray obscurity that had hidden the bluff was getting near at its edge and about a mile off a pond shone with a strange sickly gleam  then a dazzling flash fell from the cloud bank overhead and touched the grass a stunning crash of thunder rolled across the sky and the team plunged into a frantic gallop festing braced himself in a vain attempt to hold them for the trail was half covered with tall grass and broken by badger holes he was soon breathless and dazzled for the lightning fell in forked streaks that ran along the plain and the trail blazed in front of the horses feet thunder is common in canada but it is on the high central plains that the storms attain their greatest violence  the team plunged on and festing jolting to and fro durst not lift his eyes from the trail the storm would probably not last long and might do some good if it were followed by moderate rain but he was not sure that moderate rain would fall by and by a few large drops beat upon his hat there was a roar in the distance and a cool draught touched his face it died away but the next puff was icy cold and the roar got louder he looked up for he knew what was coming but there was not a bluff in sight that would shield him from the wind  turning down his hatbrim against the increasing rain he let the horses go he need not try to hold them the storm would stop them soon it broke upon him with a scream and a shower of sand and withered grass he staggered as if he had got a blow and then leaned forward to resist the pressure the horses swerved and he had trouble to keep them on the trail but their speed slackened and they fell into a labored trot for a few minutes they struggled against the gale and then the roar festing had heard behind the scream drowned the rumbling thunder he threw up his arm to guard his face as the terrible hail of the plains drove down the blast  it fell in oblique lines of ragged lumps of ice hammering upon the wagon and bringing the horses to a stop they began to plunge turning half round while one pressed against the other in an effort to escape the savage buffeting festing let them have their way at the risk of upsetting the rig and presently they stopped with their backs to the wind he let the reins fall and the hail beat upon his bowed head and shoulders like a shower of stones the horses stood limp and trembling as powerless as himself  their punishment did not last long the hail got thinner and the lumps smaller the roar diminished and festing heard it recede across the plain the wind was still savage but it was falling and the thunder sounded farther off there was a savage downpour of drenching rain and when this moderated he pulled himself together and turning the horses resumed his journey he was wet to the skin his shoulders were sore and his face and hands were bruised and cut pieces of ice some as large as hazelnuts lay about the wagon and the wild barley lay flat beside the trail not a blade of grass stood upright as far as he could see and the ruts in which the wheels churned were full of melting hail and water  it was getting dark when his homestead rose out of the plain a shadowy group of buildings marked by two or three twinkling lights he was wet and cold but he stopped by the wheat and nerved himself to see what had happened to the crop he had not had much hope but for all that got something of a shock there was no standing grain the great field looked as if it had been mown bruised stalks and torn blades lay flat in a tattered tangled mass splashed with sticky mud the rain that might have saved him had come too late and was finishing the ruin the sand and hail had made  then the downpour thickened and the light died out and he drove to the house he could see in the morning if any remnant of the crop could be cut but there would not be enough to make much difference hope had gone and his face was stern when he called the hired man and got down stiffly from the dripping rig    chapter xviii  helen makes a mistake  when festing had changed his clothes he entered the small sittingroom with an effort at cheerfulness the room was unusually comfortable for a prairie homestead the floor was stained rugs were spread on the polished boards and helen had drawn the curtains which harmonized in color with the big easy chairs there were books in wellmade cases and two or three good pictures on the painted walls while a tall brass lamp with a deep shade threw down a soft light helen had put a meal on the table and festing sat down with a feeling that was half uneasiness and half content  while he ate he glanced at his wife she wore a pretty and rather fashionable dress that she kept for evenings she looked fresh and vigorous although the summer had been hot and she worked hard the numerous petty difficulties she had to contend with had left no mark her courage had always been evident but she had shown a resolution that festing had not quite expected he admired it in a way but it was sometimes awkward when they took a different point of view  there was a charm in coming back to a home like this when he was tired and disappointed but its taste and comfort were now disturbing for one thing he had perhaps not made the best use of his privileges and for another helen might have to be satisfied with a simpler mode of life it hurt him to think of this because he had hoped to beautify the house still further so that she should miss nothing she had been used to in the old country it was obvious that she understood something of his misfortune for her look was sympathetic but she let him finish his supper before she began to talk  your jacket is badly torn stephen she remarked when he lighted his pipe and how did you cut your face  the hail was pretty fierce  it was terrible we never had storms like that in england i was frightened when i thought of your being out on the prairie but i dont mean the small bruises how did you cut your forehead  oh that said festing awkwardly i did it when i fell over a stove at the settlement the pipe came down and i imagine the edge struck me  you would have known if it hit you nor not  well it might have been the top of the stove the molding was sharp  but how did you fall against the stove helen persisted  festing did not want to tell her about the fight with wilkinson he had resolved to say nothing about the matter until morning  i tripped there was a chair in the way and it caught my foot  helen did not look altogether satisfied but let the matter go  has the hail done much damage to the wheat  yes said festing with grim quietness i imagine it has done all the damage that was possible so far as i could see the crops wiped out  they were sitting near together and helen leaning forward put her hand on his arm with a gesture of sympathy  poor stephen im dreadfully sorry it must have been a blow  festings hard look softened it was when i stopped beside the wreck i felt knocked out but getting home braced me up i begin to feel i might have had a worse misfortune and mustnt exaggerate the importance of the loss  helen was silent for a few minutes but she was sensible of a certain relief she was sorry for her husband but there was some compensation since it looked as if a ray of light had dawned on him although she had struggled against the feeling she was jealous of the farm that had kept him away from her  i think you sowed too large a crop and you could not have gone on working as you have done she said it would have worn you out  festing put down his pipe and looked at her with surprise you dont seem to understand that ill have to work harder than before  i dont understand said helen taking away her hand to begin with its impossible then id hoped the loss of money serious as it is would have made you cautious and in a sense more content  you hoped the loss of the money festing exclaimed did you ever know losing money make anybody content the things absurd  helen made a gesture of protest stephen dear try to see what i mean you have been doing too much running too big risks and fixing all your thought upon the farm it has made you irritable and impatient and the strain is telling on your health this could not go on long and although im truly sorry the wheat is spoiled its some relief to know you will be forced to be less ambitious besides its foolish to be disturbed neither of us is greedy and we have enough in fact we have much that i hardly think you value as you ought  i havent enough thats the trouble  oh said helen you know that all i have belongs to both  it doesnt festing answered in a stubborn tone you dont seem to realize yet that i cant change my views about this matter ive lost most of my money but thats no reason i should lose my wifes besides since you bought the farm you havent a large sum left he paused and indicated the handsome rugs and furniture then it costs a good deal to live up to this kind of thing  we can change that i can manage with less help and be more economical there is much that we can go without i wouldnt mind at all stephen if it would help you to take things easily  festing colored no i cant let you suffer for my rashness its my business to give you all the comforts you need  ah said helen i like you to think of me but somethings due to pride i wonder how much  i dont know said festing rather wearily im what i am and havent much time to improve myself for that matter ill have less time now  then what do you mean to do  make the most of what i have left id hoped to give you a change this wintertake you to montreal and go skating and tobogganing but thats done with i believe i have money enough to begin again in a small way and work up it may take me two or three years to get back to where i was but somehow i will get back  then you are going on as before concentrating all your mind upon the farm taking no rest denying yourself every pleasure you might have had  im afraid thats the only way its a pretty grim outlook but i think i can stand the strain  then i suppose i must try said helen very quietly  she was silent afterwards and festing lit his pipe something stood between them and she felt that it was not less dangerous because their motives were good had they differed from selfishness agreement might have been easier but an estrangement that sprang from principle was hard to overcome she wanted to help her husband and keep him to herself he meant to save her hardship and carry out a task that was properly his but perhaps their motives were not so fine as they looked suppose there was shabby jealousy on her side and false pride on his well stephen was tired and could not see things in the proper light and it was some relief when he got up and went out helen picked up a book in the hope of banishing her uneasy thoughts  next morning festing came in for breakfast feeling gloomy and preoccupied he had not slept much and got up early to examine the damaged grain it looked worse than he had thought and for the most part must be burned off the ground there were patches that might with difficulty be cut but he hardly imagined the stooks would pay for thrashing moreover he had bought and fed a number of expensive percheron horses which ought to have been used for harvesting and hauling the grain to the railroad and had engaged men at lower wages than usual on the understanding that he kept them through the winter now there was nothing for both to do although their maintenance would cost as much as before  he read kerrs letter again if he had not been married it would have given him a chance of overcoming his difficulties a man and a team of horses could do all that was required on the farm in winter and he could have taken the others to british columbia kerr would arrange for free transport and if he was lucky he might earn enough on the railroad to cover part of his loss but this was impossible he could not leave helen  then there was the other matter he had not yet told her what wilkinson had said but she must be told and bobs visits must stop the trouble was that he had already vexed her by refusing her help and this would not make his delicate task easier besides he was not in the mood to use much tact his nerves were raw the shock he had got had left him savage and physically tired for all that the thing could not be put off  he said nothing until breakfast was over and then asking helen to come with him went on to the veranda the sun was hot the sky clear and thin steam drifted across the drenched plain had the storm come without the hail a few weeks sooner it would have saved his crop but now the vivifying moisture seemed to mock him it had come too late the wheat had gone struggling with a feeling of depression he turned to his wife  theres something we must talk about and i hope youll be patient with me if you get a jar  he leaned against the balustrade nervously fingering his pipe and helen sat down opposite she felt curious and disturbed  well she said  to begin with ill tell you what happened at the settlement yesterday you must remember that the statements are wilkinsons  helens color rose and when he stopped her face was flushed and her eyes were very bright  ah she said in a strained voice but what did you do  festing smiled rather grimly i dragged the brute about the floor and threw him into the street i dont know that it was a logical denial of the slander but it was what the others expected and i had to indulge them  and that was how you cut your forehead  yes said festing and for a few moments helen tried to regulate her thoughts  she felt shocked and disgusted but did not mean to let her anger master her because there were matters that must be carefully weighed indeed it was something of a relief to dwell upon the first to hear of festings thrashing her traducer had given her a pleasant thrill but all the same she vaguely disapproved he had not taken a dignified line and had really made things worse it was humiliating to feel that she had been the subject of a vulgar poolroom brawl  could you not have found a better way to silence him she asked  i could not i was afraid you wouldnt like it but you must try to understand that i was forced to play up to local sentiment english notions of what is becoming dont hold good here you cant stop a man like wilkinson with a supercilious look if id let the thing go the boys would have thought his statements true and the tale is bad enough to deal with  helen gave him a steady look but her color was high and her face was hard  but you know it isnt true  of course said festing with quiet scorn all that the brute insinuated is absolutely false bobs a fool but he knows you and im beginning to think hes a little in love with his wife  ah said helen i knew you knew but i felt i must hear you say so  festing hesitated one difficulty had vanished but there was another and he hoped helen would see his point of view  for all that in a way there was some truth in the story enough in fact to make it dangerous and i think you have been rash bob has been here too often and you will remember i objected to his coming  you did said helen you were rather disagreeable about it but you objected because he liked to talk and kept you from your work  he certainly talked general conversation is all right in english country houses where nobody had much to do but casual chatterers who insist on talking when youre busy are a disgusting nuisance in canada however i dont think thats worth arguing about  it is not said helen with a smile besides i know your opinions about that point what do you wish me to do  warn sadie to keep bob at home theres no reason she shouldnt visit you but you cant go there  the color returned to helens face and she got up she looked stately with her air of injured pride  do you mean that i should rule my conduct to suit the ideas of the drunken loafers at the settlement poolroom  oh said festing impatiently try to be sensible you have done a foolish thing but you neednt make it worse the trouble is that those loafers opinions will be reflected all round the neighborhood wilkinson wont say anything more at least he wont when im about but i cant keep on throwing out people who agree with him  that is plain if you were not so angry the remark would be humorous  im not angry festing rejoined  well i am said helen and i think i have some grounds must i let those tipsy gossips dictate when i may see my friends  does it matter if you see them or not you dont really care for bob  no said helen trying to be calm in a way i dont care for bob that is im glad i didnt marry him but i dont see why i should stop him coming here when sadie wants to bring him shes my friend and she knows it does bob good im too angry to flatter you stephen but you have some influence  festing laughed all the influence ive got wont go far with bob i dont say the fellows vicious but hes an extravagant slacker and a fool which is perhaps as bad anyhow if he can be reformed at all its sadies business and ive no doubt she finds it an arduous job theres no use in an outsider meddling and your anxiety for his improvement might be misunderstood in fact it has been seriously misunderstood  you seem to have made up your mind about the matter helen remarked with a curious look  i have perhaps the easiest way would be for you to give sadie a hint  suppose i refuse  then i shall have to talk to bob after all that might be better  helen flushed but her color faded and her face got white you are willing to let this scurrilous gossip influence you as far as that do you mean to forbid my friends coming to see me  i wont have bob hanging round my house the wastrel has done you harm enough  you forget something helen rejoined in a strained cold voice the house is mine  she knew her mistake as she saw the change in festings look and weakly turned her head when she looked back it was too late his hands were clenched and his gaze was fixed  ii didnt quite mean that she faltered  anyhow its true said festing quietly the farm is yours as well and i admit you have no grounds for being satisfied with the way ive managed your property you wont have much trouble in getting a better steward  helen glanced at him with a hint of fear but i dont want anybody else do you mean to give up the farm  yes as soon as i can arrange things for you im going to british columbia for a time ive been offered a railroad contract and as its a job i know something about i maynt fail at that  and you will leave me alone to face this slander  the remedys in your hands im powerless if you wont use it i cant forbid bob coming here you can  helen hesitated it was unfortunate that both were in an abnormal mood they had borne some strain and the shock of the disaster to the crop had left them with jangled nerves this clouded helens judgment but reenforced her pride she had meant well when she tried to help sadie with bob and could not give way to her husbands unreasonable prejudice this was a matter of principle she could help bob and must not be daunted by vulgar gossip  no she said i cant break my promise to sadie for the reasons you give you must do what you think best  festing made a sign of acquiescence and went down the steps while helen bit her lip she wanted to call him back but somehow could not it might be easier if he would look round but he went on across the grass and his step was resolute although his head was bent then she got up and going to her room sat down trembling she had let her best chance go stephens resolve would stiffen for when he had made a choice he was hard to move besides he had wounded her deeply he did not seem to understand that if he went away he would give people ground for thinking the slander true he ought to have seen this if he had thought about her perhaps he had seen it and refused to let it influence him well if he wanted a reconciliation he must make the first offer  in the meantime festing went to look for the foreman whom he could trust after some talk the man agreed to manage the farm for the winter on the terms festing indicated then the latter asked if the other men would go with him to the pacific slope and finding them willing went back to his office and carefully studied his accounts he was glad to think that helen had sufficient help and that the staid scottish housekeeper would take care of her by and by he wrote a note and then drove off to the settlement he did not come back until next morning but his plans were made and he only waited a telegram from kerr three or four days later the telegram arrived  all fixed it ran pass for transport mailed come along soon as possible    chapter xix  sadie sees a way  soon after festing started for british columbia sadie drove over to the farm because she had heard about the fight in the poolroom and suspected why he had gone at first she found it difficult to break down helens reserve but the latter could not resist her frank sympathy and softening by degrees allowed herself to be led into confidential talk sadie waited until she thought she understood the matter and then remarked  so you stuck to your promise that youd help me with bob although you saw what it would cost well i wouldnt be surprised if you hated us  it wasnt altogether the promise helen replied we were both highly strung and i thought stephen hard and prejudiced it seemed ridiculous that he should care what the loafers said but i dont hate you the fault was really mine and i want a friend  well said sadie i feel ive got to help put this trouble right if i can she paused and asked with some hesitation will steve be away long  i dont know helen answered dejectedly he hinted that he might not come until spring i think he means to stop until he has earned enough to make him independent thats partly my faulti said something rash if i hadnt had more money than him it wouldnt have happened  sadie smiled my having more money wont make trouble between me and bob he doesnt mind how much ive got but i suppose you want steve back  of course its all i want but the matter is not as simple as it looks i dont think he will come back as long as hes poor and if he does he wont use my capital and things will be as before if he earns some money i should feel hurt because he was obstinate and wouldnt let me help thats why i dont know what to do i wish id never had the money  sadie thought helen had some ground she had not mentioned yet for her distress moreover it looked as if she still felt she had a grievance against festing and their clashing ideas about the money did not altogether account for this  i guess youre keeping something back  helens reserve had broken down she was half ashamed because she had lost it but she felt the need of sympathy and sadie could be trusted  he didnt see or didnt mind that his going away would bear out the wicked story she exclaimed with sparkling eyes i feel that was the worst  i dont know that it looks quite as bad as you think its a common thing for a farmer who has lost his crop to go off and work on a new railroad particularly if he has teams the construction boss can use anyhow i guess the thing will come right and ill help if i can but i want to see my way before i move  helen did not answer and soon afterwards sadie left the homestead she said nothing to charnock about her visit but started for the settlement next morning and informed herself about what had happened at the poolroom and what people thought then she drove home and getting back at dusk sat down opposite charnock who lounged in a basket chair with a pipe in his mouth her eyes twinkled with rather grim humor  you dont look as if anything bothered you she said  its possible charnock agreed i suppose im lucky because i have nothing much to bother about  you wouldnt bother about it anyhow you leave that kind of thing to me  charnock gave her a quick glance she was not angry which was something of a relief because sadie was difficult when she let herself go besides he was not conscious of having done anything to vex her since he gave wilkinson the cheque but she looked resolute  ive a good excuse he answered ive got a remarkably capable wife  well cut out the compliments i dont think you have seen any of the boys from the settlement since festing left  charnock said he had not done so and she gave him a thoughtful look  i suppose you cant remember when you last did something useful something that would help somebody else  its a painful confession but i cant remember still ive some experience of being helped along a way i didnt want to go which leads me to believe its often kinder to leave folks alone  anyhow you have done some harm  im afraid thats true i dont know that i meant to do much harm but its generally easier than doing good for example ive given you some trouble but at the moment i cant think of a new offense  you can quit joking and put down that newspaper it looks as if you didnt know why festing left  charnock said he could not guess and got up abruptly when sadie told him he kicked the newspaper out of his way and crossed the floor with angry strides his face was red when he stopped in front of his wife  you dont believe the lying tale  no said sadie calmly if i had believed it i wouldnt have talked to you like this  thank you now we have cleared the ground im certainly going to do something ill begin by driving over to wilkinsons tomorrow and ill take a whip  festing tended to that matter before he left and making another circus wont help besides wilkinson has got to quit youll see notices about his sale soon i fixed that up  charnock laughed youre a marvel sadie but the brute deserves it well if i mustnt thrash him whats your plan  youll go to british columbia and bring festing back  i will by george said charnock we owe him and helen much and the job is obviously mineby joining festing i give wilkinson the lie youre clever and i expect you saw this anyhow ill start but festings an obstinate fellow suppose he wont come back  he maynt at first if so youll have to wait  charnock turned away and walked about the floor while sadie watched him pleased but curious bob was rather hard to move but he was moved now he came back and sitting down looked at her thoughtfully  i imagine you are giving me a bigger job than you know if festing has taken the railroad contract hell probably stop until he had carried it out now i dont imagine id find it amusing to loaf about and watch him work for one thing its pretty cold in the ranges after the snow comes  well said sadie  charnock leaned forward with an apologetic smile id like to take a share in the contract and help him through that is of course if he wont come back at once but theres a difficulty i havent the cash  you want me to give you some  yes i shouldnt feel much surprised if you refused ive squandered your money before but this time i mean business cant you see that i have so to speak got my chance at last  i dont quite see you have had many chances  i have charnock agreed but there was a new note in his voice and a look in his eyes that sadie had not often seen ive been a fool but perhaps it doesnt follow that im incapable of change however lets be practical the crop is spoiled we have no grain to haul in and therell be nothing doing here while the snow is on the ground well if festing can get some of his money back why cant i ive wasted yours long enough and now if i cant bring him home ill stop with him until we both make good  you mean that bob  i do give me a chance to prove it  sadie got up and putting her hands on his shoulders kissed him very well you shall have all the money you want  then she went back to her chair and turned her head she had borne with her husbands follies and fought hard for him sometimes with hope and sometimes in desperation but always with unflinching courage now it looked as if she had won victory was insecure yet and there was a risk that it might turn to defeat but sadie never shrank from a daring venture for a moment she could not speak her heart was full  hallo said charnock who got up and came towards her crying sadie will you miss me as much as that  sadie hastily wiped her eyes yes bob ill miss you all the time but if youll come back the man you are now ill wait as long as you like  ill try said charnock simply im not going to protest but you deserve a much better husband than youve got if i cant come back better fit to live with you i wont come back at all  i wouldnt like that sadie answered smiling uncertainly but i guess i know what you mean ill wait dear because i know you are going to make good  then feeling that she had said enough she began to make plans something might be saved from the ruined crop and she had better keep a heavy team but charnock could have the other horses if they were required she could carry on whatever work was possible after the frost set in and would pay off one of the hired men charnock approved and after a time sadie leaned back in her chair  its all fixed but perhaps we maynt need these plans she said remember youre really going there to bring festing home  thats understood however i dont think hell come and if so it will be helens money that prevents him if hes foolish enough to doubt her i can put him right which will be something  yes said sadie with a sigh well if he wont come you must stop and do the best you can  in the meantime festing reached the railroad camp it was raining when the construction train rolled noisily through a mountain gorge and he stood at the door of the caboose looking out three or four hundred feet below a green river streaked with muddy foam brawled among the rocks for the track had been dug out of a steep hillside festing knew this was difficult work one could deal with rock although it cost much to cut but it was another matter to bed the rails in treacherous gravel and the fanshaped mounds of shale and soil that ran down to the waters edge showed how loose the ground was and the abruptness of the slope above the silver mist drifted about the black firs that clung to the side of the mountain and in the distance there was a gleam of snow some of the trees had fallen and it was significant that for the most part they did not lie where they fell they had slipped down hill and the channels in the ground indicated that the shock had been enough to start a miniature avalanche which had carried them away the pitch was near the slant engineers call the angle of rest but festing thought there was rock not far beneath which prevented the solidification of the superincumbent soil it looked as if his contract would be difficult and he would earn his pay  as the cars passed he saw the ballast creep about the ends of the ties which reached to the edge of the descent and in places small streams of gravel had run down leaving hollows round the timber the harsh jolting indicated the consequences but he knew that in the west railroads are built as fast as possible and made safe afterwards for that matter he had often run risks that would have daunted engineers used to conservative english methods in the meantime the speed was slackening and by and by the harsh tolling of the locomotive bell echoed among the pines tents iron huts and rude log shacks slipped past men in muddy slickers drew back against the bank and then the train stopped  festing got down into the water that flowed among the ties and kerr came forward in dripping slickers  if you want help to get the teams out ill send some of the boys he said if not you had better come along and ill show you your shack i told our cook to fix your supper and ill be glad to sit down for a time out of the wet  festing followed him along the descending track which presently ended at a ledge of rock sixty or seventy feet above the river wire ropes spanned the gap between the banks and near the middle a rock islet broke the surface of the savage flood here men were pouring cement into holes among the foundations of an iron frame while suspended trollies clanged across the wires on the other bank was a small flat where shacks of log and bark stood among dripping tents the roar of the river filled the gorge but its deep note was broken by the rattle of hammers clash of shovels and clang of throwndown rails  the sounds of keen activity stirred festings blood he had a touch of constructive genius but lack of specialized training had forced him into the ranks of the pioneers others must add the artistic finish and divide the prizes of ultimate victory his part was to rough out the work and clear the way but he was satisfied with this and something in him thrilled as he heard in the crash of a blasting charge mans bold challenge to the wilderness kerr waited with a twinkle of understanding amusement while festing looked about and then took him up the hill  you have come back he remarked well i guessed you would come after all this is your job its here you belong  that is so in a sense festing dryly agreed it looks as if my job was to get tired and wet and dirty while others got the dollars but its a job with different sides farmings as much a part of it as this and has very similar disadvantages  theres an altruistic theory that the dollars dont count but its easier to believe when you draw your wages regularly and ive known it break down when an engineer was offered a more lucrative post anyhow i reckon its our business to make good even if our pay isnt equal to our desserts which happens pretty often when you work on the railroad  if you work on a farm you often dont get paid at all  kerr laughed and indicated the pines that rolled up the hill in somber spires  well theres your raw material and you wont have much trouble to bring the logs down though you may find stopping them from plunging into the river a harder thing however you have some notion of what youre up against and ill show you the plans and specifications when we get out of the rain  he stopped in front of a small log shack and opening the door beckoned festing in there was an earth floor and a bunk filled with swamphay was fixed to the wall two or three campchairs stood about and a fire of scented cedar logs burned on the clay hearth a chinaman dressed in very clean blue clothes was putting a meal on the table festing hung up his wet slickers and sat down with a vague sense of satisfaction it was plain that he must go without many comforts he had enjoyed at the farm but he felt strangely at home  kerr took supper with him and afterwards threw some papers on the table and lighted his pipe half an hour later festing looked up  i imagine ive got the hang of things and ill make a start tomorrow your way of underpinning the track is pretty good but i dont like that plan you cant hold up the road long with lumber the work wont stand  i dont know if your objection springs from artistic delight in a good job or british caution anyhow you ought to know that in this country we dont want work to stand our aim is to get it finished if the track holds up until we can start the freight traffic running its as much as we expect well improve it afterwards as the dollars come in  a freight train in a canadian river isnt a very uncommon object festing rejoined however its my business to cut the logs and do the underpinning as well as i can on the whole and barring accidents i see some profit on the job im grateful to you for putting it in my way  your thanks are really due to somebody else the head contractor is not allowed to sublet work without our approval and although i recommended your being given a chance the decision rested with another man  whos that  hell probably look you up tonight kerr replied with a twinkle they sent him from headquarters to see how were getting on but ill leave you the plans were working nights with the blastlamps and ive got to be about when the new shift makes a start  he went away and festing studied the drawings he had undertaken to cut and dress to size the heavy logs required for the lower posts of trestles and foundation piles so far he did not apprehend much difficulty but he would run some risk over the underpinning of part of the track in order to make a secure and permanent roadbed it would have been necessary to cut back the hillside for some distance and then distribute the spoil about the slope below but the engineers had chosen a quicker and cheaper plan heavy timbers would be driven into the face of the hill to make a foundation for the track which would be partly dug out of and partly built on to the declivity where the main piles reached the rock the plan would be safe but where they were bedded in gravel there was danger of their giving way under a heavy load festing knew he must share the risk of this happening with the head contractor  by and by somebody knocked at the door and he got up abruptly as a man came in  dalton he exclaimed  the other smiled and threw off his wet slickers it was getting dark but the firelight touched his face and festing studied him with surprise the lad whom he had not seen for some years had grown into a man and had moreover a look of quiet authority he had made rapid progress if he had as kerr had stated been sent to report upon the latters work  you dont seem to have expected me though to some extent im responsible for your being here he said however im remarkably glad we have met again  festing awkwardly conscious that his welcome was somewhat cold indicated a chair and sitting down opposite began to fill his pipe dalton sometimes wrote to helen but had not mentioned his being sent to british columbia  well he said i was glad to hear you had got a move up once or twice but it looks as if you had gone farther than i thought  i had the advantage of a proper training and the reputation of the engineer who gave it me counted for something although i might never have got my chance in this country but for you now im happy if ive been able to show my gratitude when kerr brought your name forward i told him to see you got the contract  you did more than you knew said festing it looks as if you hadnt heard from helen  not for a time i hope shes well id thought about coming west to see you but couldnt get away and she talked about your going to montreal this winter  thats off of course its plain you dont know that helen and i have quarreled  dalton looked up sharply but was silent for a moment or two  this is a nasty knock he said i dont know if my relation to you justifies my venturing on dangerous ground but do you feel at liberty to tell me what you quarreled about  festing decided that charnocks part in the matter must be kept dark it was unthinkable that dalton should imagine he suspected his wife  to put it roughly we differed about what you might call a principle although helens money had something to do with the thing you see i lost my crop and she was hurt because i wouldnt use her capital  i dont see altogether dalton rejoined in fact your objection seems unusual  he pondered for a minute or two and festing marked the change in him dalton had a reserve and thoughtfulness he had not expected he had grown very like helen  a quarrel about a principle is apt to be dangerous he resumed although you are probably both wrong you can persuade yourselves you are right then while i was glad to hear about your wedding ill admit that i saw some difficulties helen has a strong will and is sometimes rather exacting while youre an obstinate fellow and a little too practical i must wait until i know more than i do now but might be of some use as a peacemaker isnt it possible to compromise cant you meet half way  not in the meantime i cant go home until im able to run the farm without your sisters help theres some risk of her despising me if i did go  you may be right i cant judge dalton thoughtfully agreed now i could of course find an excuse for getting you dismissed but i know you both too well to imagine that plan would work you would go somewhere else while though helen is generous theres a hard streak in her i really think shed like you better afterwards if you carried your intentions out  he paused and smiled she got the money you object to in a very curious wayby refusing to indulge the wishes of our only rich relation i was more compliant because his plans met my views and he paid for my education but when he died we found helen had got her share and mine i understand he told his lawyer that he still thought her wrong but if she thought she was right she was justified in refusing and he admired her pluck  she has pluck said festing on the whole i dont think that makes things much better for me anyhow ive taken this contract and ive got to stay with it  ill help you as far as i can said dalton who soon afterwards left the shack    chapter xx  festing gets to work  mist rolled among the pines and it was raining hard when festing led his team down the hill he wore big rubber boots and slickers and a heavy log trailed behind the horses through the mud some distance above the river the slope was gradual and it was necessary to haul the logs to the skidway he had built they would then run down without help indeed the difficulty was to stop them when they reached the track festing was wet and dirty and the sweating horses were splashed when he stopped to unhook the chain three or four men came up with cantpoles and struggling in the churnedup mire rolled the log to the top of the incline  a shallow undulating trough scored the hillside crossed at short intervals by small logs split up the middle and laid with their round sides on top it looked something like a switchback railway only that while the incline varied all the undulations ran down hill a few logs rested insecurely on the top skids and the men put the one festing had brought below the rest then they threw down their poles and festing looked about  water filled the hollows in the wavy line of skids which vanished at the edge of a steeper dip and reappeared below to plunge out of sight again its end was banked up with wet gravel near the track festing could not see the track but the opposite side of the river was visible with the island near which two wireropes skimmed the surface of the flood a man stood on the skids about half way down and presently waved his arm  watch out below he shouted and signed to festing all clear you can start her off  festing seized a handspike and the skids groaned as the big log began to move the men helped and sprang back as it gathered speed water flew up the bark tore off in crumpled flakes and the wet timber smoked the other logs were smaller and easier launched but they did not gain the momentum of the first which plunged furiously down hill and flung up its thin end as it leaped over the edge of the dip  shes surely hitting up the pace one of the men remarked  the mud is greasing the skids said festing who began to run down the incline when the man below shouted  two of the others followed but stopped at the top of the last pitch which ended in the bank of gravel close above the track the logs spread out at intervals rushed down rising and falling on the uneven skids showers of mud and water marked their progress there was a crash as a smashed skid was flung into the air and a roar when the leading mass plowed through fallen gravel stones shot out and festing saw smoke and sparks but the logs rushed on and he wondered anxiously whether the bank would stop them so far it had served its purpose but he was doubtful about it now and hoped there was nobody on the track beneath  the big log reached the bank and ran half way up the short incline before its speed slackened much festing held his breath as he watched for some gravel cars had come down the track and he could not tell where they were the log was going slower but he doubted if it would stop  it plowed on through the gravel which shot up all round and then the end of the bank seemed to fall away there was a shower of stones the butt of the log went down and its after end tilted up then it lurched out of sight and there was a heavy crash below after this festing heard a confused din and imagined though he could not see the mass of timber plunging down the precipitous slope smashing rocks and scattering gravel as it went the noise stopped he heard a splash and as the following logs leaped the broken bank the first shot half its length out of water and falling again drove down stream  the rope at the island caught it while a trolley ran down but the straining wire curved and parted and the trolley fell into the river as the log swept on the others followed and vanished in a turmoil of muddy foam and festing went down to the track things might have been worse for nobody was hurt although some yards of roadbed had been carried away and a derrick he had built to put the logs on the cars was smashed as he studied the damage a wet and angry engineer ran up  you have got to stop your blamed logs jumping down like that theyve broken a steel rope and theres a new trolleyskip in the river  im sorry festing answered ill try to get the skip out as soon as possible and you can trust me to stop more logs getting away for my own sake  therell be trouble if you let your lumber loose on me and i want the skip soon said the other a stranger asked for you a few minutes ago and i sent him up the hill  he went away and festings men came up  pretty rough luck boss one remarked what are we going to do about it  well grade up the gravel dump to begin with and then make a new derrick festing answered gloomily it doesnt look as if id get much profit on the first weeks work  he moved off and as he scrambled up the bank met a man coming down both stopped abruptly and festing frowned  what in thunder has brought you bob he asked  they told me you were up the hill charnock said smiling i came in on the last construction train  but why did you come  i suppose you meanwhy did i come to bother you again well the explanation will take some time and its confoundedly muddy and raining hard when are you likely to be unoccupied  festing tried to control his annoyance the accident had disturbed him and he was not pleased to see charnock whom he did not wish to make free of his shack  what have you been doing since you arrived he asked  sitting in the bunkhouse and waiting for the rain to stop then i got dinner with the boys and afterwards went to see a rather nice young fellow called dalton i told him i was a friend of yours and he half promised to give me a job  you dont seem to know who he is festing remarked  i dont but i thought he looked hard at me when he heard my name however dont disturb yourself on my account im pretty comfortable in the bunkhouse  very well you had better come to my shack when work stops i cant leave my men now  charnock strolled off with his usual languid air and festing resumed his work he could not imagine what charnock wanted but wished he had stopped away in the meantime he had much to do and drove his men hard until a steamwhistle hooted and they threw down their tools his supper was ready when he reached the shack but charnock had not arrived and although this was something of a relief he felt annoyed he had told him to come when work stopped but the fellow was never punctual an hour later charnock walked in  i thought id better wait until after supper he said my coming now leaves you more at liberty to turn me out  to begin with id like to know why you came at all  sadie thought it was time i did something useful and i agreed its obvious that if anything useful can be done im the proper person to undertake the job now you understand me shall i go on  festing nodded charnocks careless good humor had vanished he looked embarrassed but resolute as if he meant to carry out a disagreeable task this was something new for bob  very well the latter resumed in order to clear the ground do you imagine im in love with your wife  im sure helen is not in love with you festing rejoined  thats much but we have got to talk about the other side of the matter said charnock quietly i went to your home with sadie because i thought she and helen could learn something from each other while i suspect she thought your society was good for me its obvious that helen agreed and sadie and i will always be grateful for her staunchness in sticking to us although you disliked it whether im worth the quarrel or not is another thing i hope you understand me as far as ive gone  festing made a sign and charnock continued very well there was a time when i loved helen or honestly thought i did but i imagine we had both found out our mistake when i gave her up its certain that she would not have been satisfied with me our romance came to nothing and was done with long since theres now no woman who could rouse the feeling i have for my wife  he got up and leaned upon his chair with his eyes fixed on festing when i told you i was going to be married you showed your confounded supercilious pity you thought i was making a fatal mistake well youre not a clever fellow stephen but that was the worst blunder you ever made marrying sadie is perhaps the only wise thing i have done she has borne with my follies hustled me when i needed it and helped me to fight my weaknesses and if theres any hope of my being a useful man i owe it to her now its obvious that i cant draw comparisons but i think you see where this leads  i do see said festing who felt somewhat moved he had not heard charnock talk like this before and the note in his voice was significant he smiled to ease the strain as he replied comparisons would be particularly awkward just now bob besides theyre unnecessary im convinced  then theres no reason you shouldnt go home and ive come to take you back  festing shook his head there are two reasons in the first place ive taken a contract  that fellow dalton would probably let you off  its uncertain and i dont mean to ask you dont seem to know that dalton is helens brother  charnock laughed then ive no doubt he knows who i am his manner ought to have given me a hint the situation has a touch of ironical humor and perhaps the strangest thing is that we should now be better friends than we have been yet but what still prevents your going back  helens money i cant beg from her after refusing the only thing she has asked  youre a bit of a fool charnock remarked with a grin ive begged from sadie often and imagine she liked me for it anyhow she expected it but if you have made up your mind i expect i cant persuade you  festings gesture indicated an unshaken resolve and charnock said then im going to stop and see you through  thats ridiculous said festing who was strongly moved now you must think of sadie you cant stop i wont allow it  charnocks eyes twinkled i expect sadie will bear the separation for one thing we lost our crop and shell save money while im away shes not parsimonious but she hates to waste dollars and must have found me expensive now and then then i mean to earn something and can imagine her surprise when i show her my wages check  on the surface his mood was humorous but festing got a hint of something fine beneath but he said you mustnt stay and id sooner you didnt joke  then ill be serious but after this theres no more to be said dont imagine its altogether for your sake im going to stay you know what i owe sadie and i want to show that her labor has not all been lost in fact ive got my opportunity and mean to seize it then if you feel some reparation is due to your wife you can finish the work you made her drop help me to cut out liquor and stay with my job and if you have trouble with your contract ill help all i can is it a bargain  its a bargain said festing quietly now i think well talk about something else  he sat still for some time after charnock left his bitterness against his wife had gone and it was plain that he had been a fool for all that he could not go home yet the money was still an obstacle pride forbade his letting helen support him moreover he felt that to act against his convictions now would cost him her respect there was perhaps no ground for supposing she felt much respect for him but he meant to keep all she had  then he got up and straightened the blankets in his bunk the sooner he finished his contract the sooner he could return and there was much to be done next morning the job had not begun well  he got up at sunrise and spent several days repairing the damage the accident had caused after which for a time things went smoothly then one morning he stood on a rocky ledge of the island waiting while two of his men dragged an iron pulley backwards and forwards along a trolley wire  the morning was clear and cold and the snow had crept nearer the belt of dwindling pines that looked like matches tufted with moss they grew in size as they rolled down the tremendous slopes until they towered above the track in tall dark spires the mist had gone rocks and trees and glistening summits were sharply cut but the valley was rather marked by savage grandeur than beauty there was something about its aspect that struck a warning note it had a look of belonging to a halffinished world into which man might only venture at his peril  the river had fallen and its turbid green had faded for the frost had touched the glaciers that fed it on the heights but the stream ran fast swirling round the island and breaking into eddies in one place a white streak marked a rebound of the current from an obstacle below and it was across this spot the men dragged the pulley a chain and hook hung from the latter and they were fishing for the skip that was lost when the log broke the rope  festing had spent the most part of the previous day trying different plans for grappling the skip but the fast currents and smooth side of the big steel bucket had baffled him his efforts had cost time and money and he began to realize that he must give it up or try dangerous means the chain stopped and tightened as the hook struck something below the surface but next moment it moved on again and when this had happened a number of times festing raised his hand  you can quit boys he said and turned to a man close by she must have fallen with the shackles where the hook cant get hold but i think shes only about three feet under water  the other studied the broken surface the water was not transparent but here and there a darker patch indicated a rock below the eddies made a revolving slack along the bank but near the skip joined the main current in its downstream rush  ive a notion theres a gully between her and us he remarked anyhow well try to wade if you like  festing threw off his jacket and plunged in when he had gone a few feet he was up to his waist and it cost him an effort to keep his feet after two or three more steps the bottom fell away and floundering savagely he sank to his shoulders then his companion pulled him back  the gullys there all right the man remarked when they clambered out say that waters surely cold  it will be colder soon when the ice comes down and if the skips to be got out we must get her now i think i could reach her by swimming  the other looked doubtful but festing took off his heavy boots and picking up the end of the rope they had used to move the pulley walked to the edge of the island he was now a short distance above the skip and hoped the eddies would help him to reach the ledge it rested on before he was swept past but he must avoid being drawn into the main stream since there was not much chance of landing on the foamswept rocks lower down making sure he had enough slack rope he plunged in  an eddy swung him outshore towards the dangerous rush the cold cramped his muscles and cut his breath but he was already below the spot he had left and there was no time to lose the white streak that marked the skip seemed to forge upstream to meet him and he swam savagely until he was in the broken water and something struck his foot then he arched his back and dived groping with his hands he grasped the slippery side of the skip and felt the shackle loop with some trouble he got the rope through and then tried to put his feet on the bottom they were swept away and he came up gasping knowing he had made a mistake that might cost him dear  he held the end of the rope but had been carried several yards downstream and the lost ground must be regained the rope was rather a hindrance than a help since the men on the bank could only haul him back to the skip and drag him under water while he must pull the slack through the loop as he struggled to land if he got out of the eddies he would be swept past the island but he did not mean to let the rope go yet  a revolving eddy swung him inshore but the reflux caught and drove him a few yards lower down the men were shouting but he could not tell what they said the roar of water bewildered him and he fixed his eyes upon the rocks that slid past until a wave washed across his face for a moment or two he saw nothing and then was vaguely conscious that a trolley was running down the wire above an indistinct object hung from the trolley and next moment fell away from it a dark body splashed into the water vanished and came up close by then he was seized by the shoulder and driven towards the bank  the men had stopped shouting and ran into the water at the islands lower end festing drifted towards them but it looked as if he would be carried past the drag of the rope kept him back and his strength was going but he braced himself for an effort and felt a helping push then somebody seized his hand he was pulled forward and felt bottom as he dropped his feet in another few moments he staggered up the bank and gave the nearest man the end of the rope  stick to that he gasped and turned to see who had helped him  bob he exclaimed  charnock dashed the water from his hair and face thought you mightnt make it and jumped on a trolley they were loosing off but we had better change our clothes  come to my shack said festing signal them to send a trolley boys    chapter xxi  charnock tries his strength  the skip that crossed the river was loaded and charnock and festing were forced to wait until it came back they climbed to a platform on the bridgepier and stood for some minutes shivering in the wind the skip would only carry one and when it arrived charnock made festing get in  you were in the water longest he said get aboard as quick as you can  festing was swung across the river but waited until charnock arrived when they ran up the hill to the formers shack the fire was out and festings face was blue while charnocks teeth chattered as he threw off his clothes festing gave him another suit  im afraid theyre not very dry but theyre the best ive got he said you did a plucky thing bob  not at all and you would no doubt have landed if i hadnt come you see the skip was starting and i didnt stop to think but its horribly cold wheres your towel  he put on the halfdry clothes and went to the door im not often in such a hurry to get back to work but if i dont move ill freeze see you later  stop a moment festing called do you find the bunkhouse comfortable  its not luxurious but doesnt leak very much unless it rains unusually hard  then why not come up here at night i havent another bunk or id have suggested it before but a carload of shiplap has arrived and i dare say kerr will let me have a few boards  thanks id like that said charnock who hurried away  soon afterwards festing resumed his work kerr allowed him to take the boards and when he had finished his supper charnock came in sitting down by the fire he filled his pipe  theres more room here and you can dry your clothes he remarked stretching out his legs to the blaze  were going to talk about what happened this morning festing replied i was getting exhausted when you jumped off the skip  after all i only gave you a push now and then i was fresh and imagine i swim better than you  its possible i dont swim very well  then why did you go into the rapid i call it a blamed silly thing  i felt i had to recover the skip  not at all said charnock with a grin the skip could have stopped where it was for a man who thinks much youre ridiculously illogical got no proper sense of relative values your business is to carry out your contract and not risk your life for a rusty bucket  you risked yours  i didnt the only risk i ran was knocking your head off with my heavy boots but if you hadnt begun the folly i wouldnt have jumped if the river had been full of the companys skips  then the door opened and the head contractors engineer came in  you did a plucky thing today festing he began but charnock interrupted  dont spoil my argument mr norton ive been proving he made a fool of himself  then there were two of you norton rejoined the trolley was running fast and if you had dropped a few yards farther out you wouldnt have got back he turned to festing i was rather mad about it when you broke the wire and of course wanted the skip still i didnt mean you to take a risk like that we could have fixed the thing  a matter of bookkeeping charnock suggested much depends on how you charge up your costs and one understands that doing it cleverly leads to promotion the worst is when you come to the total  ill talk to you later youre up against a big proposition festing but if you find yourself in a tight place and ive a man or two to spare or can help  thanks i may take advantage of your promise festing replied and norton turned to charnock  you are doing better than i expected when dalton sent you along  i imagine my recent activity would surprise my friends and youre a stranger however i suppose ive got to keep it up so long as i work on the road  thats sure said the other dryly well i didnt think it prudent to give you much at first and now ill mark you up an extra fifty cents  he stopped a few minutes and when he went out charnock laughed not a bad sort but im puzzled by my satisfaction at getting three dollars more a week if i wanted a check not long since id only to look penitent and go to sadie  after this they sat smoking quietly for a time and then charnock drew up his legs and frowned  whats the matter festing asked  nothing much said charnock ive got a bit of a weakness i dont think you know about neuralgic i imagine it grips me here he indicated the region between his belt and chest comes and goes when im not quite up to my proper form  then i expect jumping into the river and standing about in wet clothes brought it on  no i have had it before besides ive often been as wet so have you anyhow the pains going and theres a thing i forgot to mention i met wilkinson this afternoon  festing knitted his brows wilkinson what do you think has brought him  chance and sadies scheming ive cause to suspect she forced him off his ranch though she would probably wish she hadnt meddled if she knew shed sent him here as he looked surprised when he saw me i imagine hed no particular object in coming except that he wanted a job  did you speak to him  i did not its very possible hed have resented my remarks then i was on the companys business and the foreman was about  well said festing thoughtfully it might be better to keep out of his way as far as you can i dont know that hes likely to do us harm but wish he had gone somewhere else  they let the matter drop and talked about other things until they went to bed next morning broke bracingly cold but thin mist rolled among the pines a few hundred feet above the track for the most part the climate of the interior of british columbia is dry and there are belts where artificial irrigation is employed but some of the valleys form channels for the moist winds from the pacific except in the bitter coldsnaps it was seldom that the white peaks above the track were visible and now something in the atmosphere threatened heavy rain  charnock began his work as usual with the gravel gang it was his business to spread the ballast thrown off the cars by the plow that traveled along the train and although the labor was not exhausting it had tried his strength at first his muscles however were hardening and until the last few days he had been able to scatter heavy shovelfuls of stones with a dexterous jerk that distributed them among the ties  streaks of dingy haze that looked like steam rose from the river the fresh smell of pines hung about the track and the clash of shovels and ringing of hammers mingled harmoniously with the deeptoned roar of the rapids the cold braced the muscles and stirred the blood and the sounds of activity had an invigorating influence while the day was young but charnock felt slack his pain had gone but he was conscious of a nervous tension and knew what it meant a small blister on his hand annoyed him he growled at comrades who got in his way and swore when the gravel fell in the wrong place somehow he could not get the stuff to go where it ought  for all that he felt no serious inconvenience until about eleven oclock when a stinging pain spread across the front of his body for a few moments he leaned on his shovel and gasped but the pang moderated and he roused himself when the foreman looked his way he must try to hold out for another hour and he savagely attacked his pile of stones when the echoes of the whistle filled the hollow he had some trouble in reaching the bunkhouse but felt better after dinner and a smoke which he enjoyed sitting on a box by the stove but the time for rest was short the foreman drove him out and feeling very sore and stiff he resumed work  about four oclock another pang shot through him and he dropped his shovel and sat down on a heap of ties hoping to get a few minutes rest before the gravel train came up the pain was troublesome but not dangerous it might only bother him for a day or two but it might last a week rest was the best cure but sick men were not wanted at the camp one must work or go and when a cascade of gravel poured off the cars as the plow moved along he pulled himself together  it began to rain soon afterwards and he had left his slickers at the bunkhouse but he stuck to his work while the sweat the effort caused him ran down his face until the whistle blew then he went limply up the hill to festings shack  i thought id have supper with you if you dont mind he said felt i couldnt stand for joining the boys theyve annoyed me all day and eat like hogs  festing gave him a sharp glance bob did not often lose his temper but he looked morose  of course i dont mind sit down  charnock did so and when festing had filled his plate resumed this food is decently cooked and i like my supper served and not thrown at me still in view of what were charged for board its annoying to think the contractor will be richer for a meal i havent got  its a new thing to find you parsimonious i hope youll keep it up  charnocks gloomy face softened i mean to im thinking of sadies feelings when i come home with a wad of fivedollar bills she wont be surprised shell get a shock  he talked with better humor during the meal but was silent afterwards and sat with halfclosed eyes stretching out his feet towards the crackling logs although the pain had nearly gone it would no doubt begin again in the morning and he might have some trouble in hiding his weakness from the foreman he could lay off for a day or two but as his wages would stop and his board would be charged it would cost him something besides if he laid off once or twice he would be told to leave  this however did not account for his moodiness he knew of no cure except rest but it was easy to find relief a small dose of spirit would banish the pain for a time the remedy was dangerous particularly to him since it offered an excuse for repeated indulgence and he struggled with the temptation liquor was difficult to get because there was no settlement for some distance and the engineers had tried to cut off supplies but it could be got in fact charnock knew where he could buy as much whisky as he wanted at something above its proper price so far he had not done so but continued selfdenial would require a stern effort a drink would banish the pain and enable him to work  he had not known it fail since he drove over to wilkinsons one afternoon when he had been loading prairie hay since early morning and had forgotten his lunch he reached the homestead scarcely able to sit upright on the driving seat and a man asked him what was the matter when charnock told him he sent wilkinson for whisky  i know all about it the blamed thing grips me now and then if i work too hard and cut out a meal he said ill fix you up for the rest of the day but wont answer for your feeling pert tomorrow  as a matter of fact charnock had felt worse but obtained relief by increasing the dose indeed he had once or twice done so with unfortunate consequences but after sadie bought the farm and saw he led a regular life the pain had gone and had not returned until he went to work on the track now he was not going to give in but did not want to talk and was glad that festing was occupied with some calculations and left him alone  next morning he felt better and had two days ease after which the pain wrung him for the rest of the week somehow he stuck to his work and his comrades who were rudely sympathetic helped him to elude the foremans watchfulness it was obvious that he could not keep it up but the trouble often ended suddenly then an evening came when he could scarcely drag himself to the bunkhouse for supper it had rained all day and the building was overheated by a glowing stove and filled with the smell of rank tobacco and steaming clothes charnock could not eat the roughly served food and for a time sat slack and limp with the sweat upon his face and his arms on the table then he got on his feet awkwardly and set off for festings shack  the rain and cold revived him but walking was difficult and when he reached the shack he fell into a chair festing was not in and charnock remembered he had said something about having extra work to do it was dark but the log fire threw out a red light and by and by charnock glancing round as the shadows receded thought there was something unusual on the table it looked like a bottle but they kept no liquor in the shack festing was abstemious but charnock suspected that he had practised some selfdenial for his sake  he waited until a blaze sprung up and then his relaxed pose stiffened it was a bottle of whisky better stuff than the railroaders generally drank for he knew the label moreover when the light touched the glass the yellow reflection showed that it was full he got up and approached the table wondering how the liquor came there until he saw some writing on the label picking up the bottle he read his own name  he put it down abruptly and stood with his hand clenched the veins swelled on his forehead and the pain nearly left him as he fought with temptation it was some weeks since he had tasted liquor but this was not all a drink would give him relief from the gnawing ache and perhaps a nights sound sleep if he could get that he might be well for most of the next day but he shrank from the remedy there was liquor enough to last some days but the next bottle would not last as long and he knew there would be another he must resist and conquer his craving now  he opened the door and picked up the bottle by the neck with a swing of his arm he could throw it among the pines he wanted to hear it smash victory could be won by a quick movement but afterwards the touch of the glass and the way the yellow liquid gleamed in the light fired his blood if he was to win an enduring victory he must fight to a finish  leaving the bottle in the light he moved his chair and sat down close by after which he looked at his watch he would give himself half an hour if he could hold out now he need not be afraid again because the odds against him would never be so heavy the craving was reenforced by pain and bodily fatigue his jangled nerves demanded a stimulant yet to win would make the next conflict easier and he had resources that he tried to marshal against the enemy  the rough work on the track had given him confidence he had always had physical courage and muscular strength and it was something to feel he could hold his own with his comrades at a strenuous task moreover his saving festing from the river had restored his selfrespect but he had stronger allies and his face got hot as he thought of the two women who had fought for him when he had scarcely tried to help himself  sadie had given up her ambitions and was content to live at the lonely farm because she thought it best for him he remembered the bitter disappointments he had brought her and how he had found her sitting depressed and tired at his neglected work when he came home from some fresh extravagance sometimes she had met him with the anger he deserved but as a rule she had shown a patience that troubled him now then there was helen who had borne slander and estrangement from her husband for his sake both had made costly sacrifices of which he was unworthy but it was unthinkable that the sacrifices should be made in vain  perhaps it was his imagination or the proximity of relief but the physical torment he suffered got worse he could not sit straight and leaned forward with head bent and hands grasping the sides of his chair until he looked at his watch ten minutes had gone but he must hold out for twenty minutes more fumbling awkwardly in his pocket he got his tobacco pouch he did not want to smoke but could occupy some time by filling his pipe and did so with slow deliberation then he let the match go out as an idea dawned on him the bottle had been put there with an object  wilkinson hated sadie he had struck at her and injured helen but had plotted a harder blow the plot had however miscarried for charnock almost forgot his pain in his fury the fellow was a dangerous reptile and could not be allowed to hurt sadie by his poisonous tricks charnock meant to punish him but must first overcome the insidious ally the other had counted on he looked at his watch again a quarter of an hour had gone he felt stronger and more confident for all that the fight was stern and at length festing entering quietly was surprised to find charnock sitting with his watch in his hand his brows were knit his face looked pinched and damp  what are you doing bob he asked  trying my strength said charnock who got up three minutes yet to go but i think we can take it that ive won  i dont understand is this a joke  do i look as if im joking charnock rejoined with a forced smile anyhow id like you to notice that im perfectly sober and this bottle has not been opened although ive sat opposite it for nearly half an hour id have finished the halfhour if you had not come in  festing picked up the bottle and read the writing who brought the thing here  i suspect wilkinson he knows a drink would stop the pain  ah said festing quietly i think i understand you have made a good fight bob and i believe youve won but well take precautions it will be some satisfaction to throw out the stuff  he went to the door but charnock stopped him  hold on i mean to keep the satisfaction to myself give me the cursed thing  festing put the bottle in his hand and opening the door charnock swung it round his head and let it go there was a crash as it struck a tree and he went back to his chair  thats done with its remarkable but i dont feel as sore as i did perhaps the effort of resisting was a counterirritant however we have said enough about it tell me how you got on with the job that kept you late    chapter xxii  festings new partner  charnock felt better next morning and luck favored him an accident to the gravel train disorganized the work and he and some others were dismissed for the afternoon he went to festings shack and making himself comfortable by the fire opened a tattered book and enjoyed several hours of luxurious idleness after his exertions in the rain and mud it was delightful to bask in warmth and comfort and rest his aching limbs the next day was sunday and he lounged about the shack sometimes reading and sometimes bantering his comrade the pain had gone and he felt cheerful  when he returned to work on monday he was sent with a bag of bolts to the bridge and presently reached a spot where the heavy rain had washed away the track for about a dozen yards the terrace cut in the hillside had slipped down leaving a narrow shelf against the bank the shelf broke off near the middle where a gully had opened in the hill water flowed through the gap and in order to get across one must pick a way carefully over the steep wet slope this however would save a toilsome climb and charnock jerking the bag higher on his shoulders went on  a few minutes later he saw wilkinson come round a corner one of them would have to go back to let the other pass and it would be difficult to turn if they met at the gully charnock did not mean to give way and with his arms crooked to support his load he required some room there was no way up the torn bank and on the other side a nearly perpendicular slope of wet soil and gravel ran down to the river in places the surface was broken by small halfburied firs  when both were near the gully wilkinson stopped and charnock whose head was bent thought he had not known who he was he certainly looked surprised and charnock was conscious of rather grim amusement as he guessed the reason wilkinson had no doubt not expected him to be capable of carrying a heavy bag along the dangerous ledge  hallo he said the boys told me you were crippled by your pains  i was the pains gone  rests a good cure said wilkinson you got laid off on saturday didnt you  the curiosity that had made charnock stop was satisfied since wilkinsons work kept him at some distance from the gravel gang it looked as if he had made inquiries about charnock and had probably been surprised to learn he had started with the others there was however no use in taxing the fellow with trying to make him drunk because he would deny that he knew anything about the whisky or declare that he had sent it with a friendly object  yes he said but i didnt need the cure as badly as you think however im not in a talkative mood and this bag is heavy ill trouble you to get out of the way  wilkinson looked hard at him charnock knew why he had sent the whisky and meant to quarrel but was shrewd enough to choose his ground  you can dump your bag and wait until i get past  not at all said charnock i dont see why i should pick up the load again to convenience you anyhow im going on and the thing takes up some room  wilkinson measured the distance across the gap he imagined he could reach the other side first and squeeze against the bank when charnock must take the outside and would probably fall he did not mean to be forced back particularly as there were men at work not far off who had no doubt noted charnocks aggressive attitude the latter however was quicker than he thought and reached the dangerous spot before wilkinson got across splashing and slipping in the mud he advanced recklessly and wilkinson could not turn back moreover he could not strike charnock because he was in the workmens view and the railroaders would not approve his attacking an apparently defenseless man he thought charnock knew this but the fellow was not as defenseless as he looked the heavy bag gave him a certain stability and momentum  if you come any farther before i find a hold well both go down he said  it looks like that charnock agreed i dont mean to stop  wilkinson clutched at the slippery bank but the wet gravel tore out it was impossible to get up and if he tried to scramble down he might not stop until he fell into the river he glanced at charnocks set face and got something of a shock he had thought the fellow meant to bluff and would give way if he were resolutely met charnock was impulsive but never stayed with a thing now however he looked dangerous  driving his boots into the mud wilkinson braced himself with one foot so placed that it might trip his antagonist then he set his lips as he met the shock charnock struck him with his shoulder and forced him backwards by the weight of the bag the mud slipped under his feet he staggered and clawed at the bank but his fingers found no hold they plowed through the miry gravel and falling face downwards he rolled down the hill  charnock lurched across the gully and stopped when he reached the shelf wilkinson had swung round on his descent and his head was lowest he was sliding down rather slower and there were some trees not far off charnock did not care if he brought up among them or not and watched with a curious dispassionate interest the fellow looked ridiculous as he went down scattering the gravel with his hands he was in some danger but this was his affair  wilkinson rolled against the thin branches of a halfburied tree which caught and turned him partly round the branches broke and he went down sideways until he and a wave of loosened gravel struck another tree this stopped him and charnock plodded on until he was off the shelf  better go down and fetch him boys he shouted to the other men i reckon hes not much the worse except in temper and youll find a rope a piece back up the track  he saw them start and then resumed his journey whether he was hurt or not wilkinson could talk for he was pouring out scurrilous epithets charnock laughed as he stamped through the mud his antagonist had got the worst of it and there was a satisfactory explanation of their quarrel they had met on a narrow path and neither would give way but as charnock was carrying the load he had put the other in the wrong wilkinson could not revenge himself by circulating the story he had told before because it would interest nobody at the camp and charnocks friendship with festing would prove it untrue in fact he imagined wilkinson would think it prudent to leave him alone  he delivered the bag and going back stopped at a spot where festing and some others were fitting the end of a heavy beam into a pole charnock watched while the men dragged out the beam and then replaced it after deepening the hole they were splashed and dirty and presently festing leaned upon his shovel while he got his breath  you seem determined to fix it properly charnock remarked  festing nodded theres no use in piling rock about halfbedded frames it would mean trouble if they gave way under a freight train  you look ahead the first difficulty is that if the frames dont hold up you wont get paid the engineers are responsible after the regular traffic starts and ive no doubt they test a contractors work you would save something in wages if you built a piledriver to sink those posts  i havent the men or time if i dont get this part of the work done before the frost comes its going to cost me more it would mean using powder and making fires to thaw out the ground  charnock agreed and went on he had been long enough over his errand and the foremans tongue was sharp but he mused about festing as he picked his way across the pools between the ties festings object was to make money and he imagined perhaps foolishly that he had urgent ground for doing so but he meant to make a good job he felt his responsibility and apart from this took a curious delight in doing things well in fact festings thoroughness was rather fine he was an artist in his way the artists methods however were not as a rule profitable when applied to contract work then charnocks meditations were rudely disturbed for he heard a shout and saw the foreman had noted his cautious advance  watch him coming boys the latter remarked like a blamed cat thats scared of wetting its pretty feet say do you want a private car to move you along the track jump now and load up that trolley you softbodied slob  charnock obeyed promptly and silently he had at first responded to encouragement of this kind by a witty retort but had found the consequences unfortunate there was no use in wasting delicate satire on a dolt besides it was a relief to feel he was getting better and was able to work  in the afternoon he had occasion to pass the spot where festing was occupied and stopped to watch the men were getting a big log on end two steadying it and supporting part of the weight by a tackle fixed to its top while festing and another guided its foot into a hole the ground was wet and slippery and their task looked almost beyond their strength but charnock knew he would get into trouble if he were seen going to their help since he was not in view of the foreman where he stood on top of the bank it was prudent to remain there  the log swayed as its point caught a stone and festings hands slipped on the muddy bank he shouted to the men at the tackle who bent their backs and hauled but the timber did not rise as it ought charnock looking round noted that the stake the tackle was fastened to was pulling out  get from under shes coming down on top of you he cried  festing looked up and saw the danger but if the log fell it would not stop until it and the tackle plunged into the rapid below  stay with it he gasped and he and his companions braced themselves against the crushing weight  the veins rose on his forehead his back was arched and his wet slickers split but it was plain to charnock that the men could not hold up the timber which would injure them if it fell but with help they might perhaps move it enough for the point to sink into the hole before the tackle gave way and charnock leaped recklessly from the top of the bank he knew what he was undertaking when he took hold festing would not let go he meant to put the log into its socket or let it start on its plunge to the river over his body  for a few tense moments they struggled savagely with slipping hands and labored breath while festing using his head as a ram pushed the point of the swaying mass nearer the hole then when all could do no more the strain suddenly slackened and there was a jar as the log sliding through their arms sank into the pit after this it was easier to hold it while one threw in and beat down the gravel five minutes later charnock sat down on the bank his face was crimson his hands bled and his chest heaved as he fought for breath but he felt ridiculously satisfied  thanks gasped festing lucky you came along i thought she was going  blamed silly thing not to let her go charnock replied some day your confounded obstinacy will ruin you anyhow weve put her in not bad for a cripple  then he sucked his torn fingers and fearing that he might have to account for the delay went about his business it was curious that the tense exertion had not brought on the pain but his back and shoulders were sore when he went to festings shack in the evening the small earthfloored room was dry and warm and smelt pleasantly of resinous wood they did not light the lamp for although it was dark the red glow of the fire flickered about the walls charnock felt a comforting sensation of bodily ease as he lounged in his chair and when he had smoked a pipe told festing about his encounter with wilkinson  i imagine the brute isnt hurt much but dont know if im glad or not he said he looked remarkably funny as he slid down the bank with his arms and legs spread out like a frog suppose i should have thought about the risk of his tobogganing into the river but i didnt  well i expect he deserves all he got and remember the satisfaction it gave me to throw him out of the poolroom looks as if we were primitive  were all primitive in this country charnock rejoined they have no use for philosophical refinement in canada their objects are plain and practical and they employ simple means were not bothered by the conventions that handicap you at home if a man hurts you and youre big enough you knock him out  we have both knocked out wilkinson but im not sure that we have done with him the simple plans not always as easy as it looks  i dont think he can make much trouble if he does one of us will knock him out again as it will hurt us less than it hurts him hell probably get tired first  they let the matter drop and festing presently remarked the rain makes things difficult but its lucky the frost keeps off i must try to get the frames up at the awkward places before it begins  you havent enough men  i could use more still one couldnt engage men to come here on short notices and if we get a long coldsnap i might have trouble to keep them employed i could of course use a number of men and teams hauling out logs across the snow but the heavier stuff wont be needed for some time and i cant lock up my money the small mans trouble is generally to finance his undertaking  charnock looked thoughtful yes thats where the pinch comes you cant work economically unless you have capital sadies a good business woman and she often said that if you want to save dollars you must spend some  much depends on how you spend  just so said charnock smiling betting against marked cards doesnt pay but ive stopped that kind of thing however i think i could get you the money you need  festing looked hard at him you have none  sadie has a pile shed give me enough with pleasure if she thought it would help towards my reform but if you take the dollars youve got to take me  ah said festing but why do you want to join  to begin with im getting avaricious and want to go home with my wallet full then im tired of my job i suppose its a foremans privilege to insult his gang but the brute weve got is about the limit hes truculent but not very big and some day if i stop on ill pitch the hog into the river then ill certainly get fired and therell be an end to my dreams of wealth  festing was silent for a few moments he understood charnock better now and knew that when he was serious he often used a careless tone bob wanted to help him as much as he wanted to help himself and he saw no reason to reject his plan he must however be warned  if you join me you run some risk of losing your money  of course its obvious that you dont think the risk very big and im willing to take a fighting chance  i dont know how big it is that depends on the weather and accidents  exactly said charnock if i join you with some money and teams will it lessen or add to the risk  it will lessen the risk  will it reduce or increase your working costs  i think the answers obvious  then it looks as if youd be foolish to turn my offer down  festing got up and walked about irresolutely for a moment or two then he stopped with some color in his face  i called you a shirker bob and ordered helen to leave you alone now i see youre the better man and im a confounded faultfinding prig but youre not vindictive and well let that go the trouble is im obstinate and sure of what i can doat least i was though my confidence has got shaken recently well i think i can finish this contract but dont know ive lost a good deal of money and would hate to feel i might lose yours  thats the line you took with helen charnock rejoined im not surprised that she was vexed and since were being frank youre a little too proud of yourself yet anyhow i like a plunge its exhilarating and theres not much excitement in betting on a certainty he paused and resumed with a twinkle besides if there is a loss sadie will stand for it  festing gave him a puzzled look and he laughed  you dont understand yet youre dull stephen now im not a greedy fellow and my chief use for dollars is to spend them i want to take back some money to show sadie ive made good and if we put this contract over shell be satisfied and youll have her gratitude thats why i mean to make a job if i join you and i imagine youre with me there well perhaps ive said enough is it a bargain  yes said festing quietly and they shook hands    chapter xxiii  charnock makes progress  deep snow covered the hillside and the pines with lower branches bent rose in somber spires against the dazzling background the river had shrunk and the dark water rolled in angry turmoil between iceglazed rocks streaks of gray haze rose a foot or two into the nipping air and the clash of shovels had a new harsh ring it was nearly dinner time and festing noted that his men had not done much since breakfast as he walked down the beaten hollow in the middle of the track one could not tell how long the coldsnap would last but it had already embarrassed him  he stopped above an excavation where charnock and another were cutting a hole in the frozen gravel the former held a steel bar in blue frostcracked hands and twisted it in the cavity while his companion struck the end he knelt in a cramped pose in the snow and festing smiled bob was fond of comfort and it was strange to see him occupied like this then noting the length of the bar he thought they would not sink the hole deep enough for the blasting charge before dinner which was unfortunate because the powder fumes are poisonous and would hang about the spot for some time  a few moments later the whistle blew but charnock and his companion did not stop and festing heard the thud of the hammer as he went on this rather puzzled him the work was hard and he had not expected charnocks assistant to continue his task longer than he need festing was fastidiously just and thought it shabby to steal a workmans time moreover he imagined that if he had asked the fellow to go on after the whistle blew he would have refused  curiosity led him to wait farther along the track until the thud of the hammer stopped it looked as if charnock was putting in the dynamite and festing hoped he would be careful with the detonator by and by he heard a warning shout and a moment or two afterwards saw a blaze of light then there was a curious sharp report and pieces of broken rock splashed into the river the gorge rang with echoes and a mass of gravel roared down the slope it was obviously a good shot and had moved more spoil than festing expected a glance at his watch showed that the others had given up a quarter of an hour of their short noon rest  festing set off again and in the meantime charnock holding his breath as he stood on the snowy bank looked down into the hole the explosion had made  i think weve made a firstclass job he said stepping back out of reach of the fumes i like the companys taste in powder  its better than ours his companion agreed with a chuckle  much better the company is richer than us it would have saved us some hard work if you had hooked a few more sticks  theyre a mean crowd said the other blamed suspicious how they tally out their stores but ill see what i can do id sooner use good powder than cut frozen gravel with the pick  the picks no tool for white men we wont use it unless were forced charnock answered and both laughed  he went to the shack and while they were at dinner festing asked how did you persuade jim brown to stop until you fired the shot  i didnt persuade him i took it for granted he would stop  hes a good man but sometimes sulky if one wants him to do what he thinks is outside his job i dont imagine id have found him so obliging if id asked him to keep on  charnock laughed perhaps not our methods are different you would have explained logically why the thing ought to be finished but thats a mistake there are not so many logical people as you think instead of arguing i made a silly joke  you certainly get on with the boys said festing thoughtfully  theyre a careless irresponsible crowd im irresponsible too and they understand me they trust you but you sometimes puzzle them perhaps that accounts for the thing  festing talked about something else until they went back to work next morning he climbed the hill to a level bench where some of his men were busy hauling logs to the top of the skids it was easier to move the big trunks across the snow and he had seized the opportunity to get some out but was surprised when he saw the number ready to be sent down while he examined them charnock sprinkled with dusty snow came up leading a heavy percheron team they dragged a log into place and then charnock unhooked the chain and beat his hands his skincoat was ragged and his furcap battered but he looked alert and virile as he stood by the steaming horses heads the gray trunks of the pines made a good background for his tall figure which had an almost statuesque grace  you look very well bob festing remarked its obvious that the pain has gone  it wont come back while the dry weather lasts i dont know about afterwards these are pretty good logs  i was wondering how you were able to bring up so many  theyre here thats the main thing you can look after other matters and leave this to me  if you dont mind id like to see how you did it festing replied  oh well youre a persistent fellow i suppose you had better come along  festing went with him and stopped where a gang of men were at work among the fallen trees two swaying backwards and forward with rhythmic precision dragged a big crosscutsaw through a massive trunk others swung bright axes and the wood rang with the noise of their activity all were usefully employed but there were more of them than festing expected  the two boys with the cantpoles belong to the contractors bridgegang he said what are they doing here  i think i told you norton said i could have them when we were moving the big poles charnock replied he saw i needed help  but that was some days since he sent them to help at a particular job which you have finished  he hasnt asked me to send them back looks as if hed forgotten them anyhow theyre useful  we have no right to keep the men how did you get them to stop  that was easy said charnock the cooking at the bunkhouse isnt very good and i told our man to find out what they liked in fact i said wed stand for it if he put up a better hash  festing laughed the plan was characteristic of bobs methods  you must send them back he said and went away doubting if bob would do so  for all that he admitted that charnock was doing well he stuck to his work and had a talent for handling men nobody was at all afraid of him but his sympathetic forbearance with his helpers weaknesses and his whimsical humor seemed to pay much better than bullying he made a joke where festing frowned but the latter felt thoughtful as he went downhill one must make allowance but bob was something of a responsibility  a week later he got a jar as he stood with charnock beside a part of the track they had laboriously underpinned the ballast train was coming down filling the valley with its roar and the beaten snow heaved among the ties as the big cars rolled by the rails sank beneath the wheels and then sprang up until the load on the next axle pressed them down again the snow flaked off the side of the roadbed which was built up with broken rock festing thought the movement was too marked and waited for the locomotive which was coupled to the back of the train  the engine was of the ponderous mountain type but it ran smoothly with steam cut off and although the ground trembled and the rails groaned as it passed there was no threatening disturbance  the banks holding up and this was about the worst spot charnock remarked we had some trouble in bedding the king posts in the slippery stuff  then kerr gave them a nod as he went by looks pretty good and they have a full load on the cars  i think well wait until the train comes back festing said to charnock the engineer will open the throttle wide to pull her up the grade  they sat down in a hollow of the bank for a bitter wind blew through the gorge and after a time the roar of falling gravel echoed among the pines then there was a heavy snorting and the locomotive came round a curve rocking and belching out black smoke the cars banged and rattled slowing with jarred couplings and rolling on when the driving wheels gripped festing waited anxiously because the wheels of a locomotive when driven hard strikes what is called a hammer blow  by and by the ground began to throb the vibration got sharper and festing watched the track as the engine passed cinders rattled about him there was a mist of snow but he saw the crossties start and the rails spring up and down then the clanging cars sped past and when they had gone he climbed down the side of the bank  it was now bare of snow and one could see the stones two or three had fallen and the edges of the others were a little out of line the unevenness was marked and although one or two of the heads of the timbers had moved the movement might not have caught festings eye had he not known the treacherous nature of their support he did not think anybody else would notice that they were not quite in their proper place  im afraid were up against trouble bob he said  charnock looked unusually thoughtful the engineer had to start from a dead stop and turn on full steam that made the jarring worse but it wouldnt happen with the ordinary traffic  perhaps not festing agreed still you see the frequent repetition of a smaller shock  charnock stopped him its those confounded posts if we pull them out well have to cut down to the rock to find a solid bed and theres a mass of stone to move what would the job cost  he said nothing for a minute after festing told him and then remarked its kerrs business to find fault and he looked satisfied  he doesnt know as much about it as we do  then i wish we knew less how long do you think the track would stand if we left it alone  until we got paid said festing it might stand for some time afterwards  he fixed his eyes on charnock and waited bob had expressed some praiseworthy sentiments about making a good job but this was a different thing from living up to them when it would cost him much what they ought to do was plain but festing admitted that the sacrifice required an effort then somewhat to his surprise charnock looked up with a smile  youre not sure of me yet stephen and i dont know that you can be blamed its a nasty knock but we have got to bear it stop there a few minutes  where are you going  to bring kerr back and show him the damage hell have to lay off the gravel gang while we pull down the bank  festing waited bob would stand by him but he felt anxious it would be an expensive business to rebuild the track and the frost would make things worse in fact if they had any more trouble of the kind they might be ruined then he got up as he saw kerr coming along the line  in an hour or two the rails were up and they began to pull down the rockwork that faced the bank the ragged stones cut their numbed hands their backs ached with lifting heavy weights and they stumbled under the loads they carried up the snowy incline they had however help enough for charnock went away for a time and came back with three or four men from the construction gang festing noted that although he made them useful he did not give them the hardest work he refrained from asking how charnock got the men but was not surprised when the foreman arrived and inquired in forcible language what they were doing there  let me answer him said charnock i feel in the mood its my first chance of letting myself go as long as youre working for wages the advantage is with the boss besides i think i ought to do something for the boys who cant talk back  festing admitted that he talked very well charnock had a keen eye for the ridiculous and a pretty wit and was no longer handicapped by the fear of being dismissed while the foreman replied with coarse but rather meaningless abuse charnocks retorts had a definite aim and hit their mark he indicated with humorous skill the defects in his antagonists looks and character and festings gang laughed uproariously while the borrowed workmen applauded as loudly as they durst at length the foreman breathless and red in face gave up the unequal contest and returned to his first question  if you came for an argument youve got it and i can go on for some time yet charnock replied however if you really want to know why the boys are helping me you can ask mr norton at the bridge  the foreman retired muttering but not towards the bridge and festing looked hard at charnock  i was anxious for a moment charnock admitted but i didnt think hed go for one thing i knew he knows norton doesnt like him  then ill leave you to deal with norton if he hears about the matter now you have had your amusement we had better get on  the short rest and laughter had refreshed the gang and they made good progress as the holes between the frames deepened the work got harder and the footing bad because they were forced to stand on slippery ledges while they passed the heavy stones from man to man charnock was ready with jocular sympathy if one fell or a stone bruised somebodys hand and his jokes spurred on the weary it got dark soon in the hollow but as the light faded the flame of a powerful blastlamp sprang up and threw out a dazzling glare the lamp belonged to the company and festing did not ask charnock how he had got it bob had his own methods and it was better to leave him alone when the whistle blew the latter turned to the borrowed men  go to our shack boys and get supper there i told the cook to fix up something extra and dare say youll find it better hash than yours id like you to come back tomorrow but am afraid its risky    chapter xxiv  the chinook wind  the frost got more rigorous drying the snow to a dusty powder in which festings lumber gang floundered awkwardly had there been a thaw the surface would have hardened but now they were forced to move the logs through loose billowy drifts the men sank to their knees it was difficult to find a fulcrum for the handspikes and the logs would not run well on the beaten roads the latter broke into holes and the dry snow retarded the smooth sliding of the lumber like dust one could not touch a saw or axhead with the naked hand  festing had seen that he might be embarrassed by hard frost but had not expected it to continue on the central tablelands of british columbia winter is severe but near the coast and in valleys open to the west the mitigating warmth of the pacific is often felt he had imagined that when his work upon the track was hindered the snow would help him to bring down lumber ready for use when a thaw set in now however wages were mounting up and little work was being done he began to wonder what would happen if a change did not come  one morning he knelt in a hole below the track holding a drill he wore mittens but the back of one was split and showed a raw bruise on his skin it needs practise to hit the end of a drill squarely and charnock who swung the big hammer had missed the worst was that the bruise would not heal while the temperature kept low they were sinking a hole through frozen gravel that was worse to cut than rock because the drill jambed in the crevices and would not turn but for the frost they need not have used the tool a hole for the post they meant to put in could have been made with a shovel without using expensive powder  when he thought they had gone deep enough festing got up and looked about white peaks glittered against a vivid blue sky the pines sparkled with frost and the snow in their shadow was a soft gray the river looked as black as ink except where it foamed among the rocks and the gorge echoed with the crash of drifting ice that shocked and splintered on the ledges the light was strong and rocks and trees far up the slopes stood out harshly distinct as he turned to the west however he noted a faint haziness and shading off in the outline of the hills  i dont know if that softness means anything and hardly believe it does he said when i made up the wages book last night and saw what the work we have been able to do has cost us i got a shock the boys are a pretty good crowd and if we pay them off we wont get them back but its obvious we cant go on long like this  charnock nodded how much money have we left  when festing told him he looked thoughtful i didnt know things were quite as bad well i suppose i could get another cheque but dont want to put too much strain on sadies generosity she might imagine id got on a jag there are drawbacks to having a character like mine its easier lived up to than got rid of however what do you suggest  well hold on while the money lasts  the plans simple as far as it goes its remarkable how short a time money does last and how hard it is to earn sadie misled me about that she used to hint that i had only to apply my talents and pick up the cash but since shes a business woman she ought to have known better the virtuous path is about as rocky as luck can make it but perhaps you take something for granted if you allow that making money is virtuous  festing frowned impatiently one ought to pay ones debts  ones generally forced charnock replied but i think i see what you mean we undertook this contract and must carry it out if possible sadie would agree shes like her father and the old man often said its safe to deal with kellers when you put up the money we put up the goods but lets get the powder  opening a box he took out a stick of yellow material that looked rather like a thick candle a big copper cap was squeezed into one end and from the cap there trailed a length of black fuse festing put the stick into the hole and cautiously filled this up with frozen soil leaving a short piece of fuse sticking out while he was feeling for his matches kerr arrived  you are making trouble for me the latter began you did the square thing in pulling out the weak frames but theyre not replaced and i cant run the gravel train across the spot as the back track is nearly ballasted up i dont know how im going to use the locomotive and cars  the frost is stopping us said festing it is not our fault  thats so but my chiefs at headquarters dont want to know whose fault it is their method as you ought to know is statisticalwere given a number of men and tools and the value of the work done must equal the expense its the only standard for judging an engineer his business is to overcome the difficulties and if hes unable hes obviously of no use  charnock grinned employers logic piffle of that kind only goes when there are more engineers than jobs i imagine therell be a change some day  im sorry daltons gone back kerr resumed hes a friend of yours and would have seen what were all up against but theres another thing the boys are beginning to kick we have had to lay off the ballast gang for a day now and then and they claim theyre not getting a square deal one fellow told me we oughtnt to have given the contract to a man without capital to carry him over a setback he said if youd had money you could have hired extra labor and kept to schedule and in the end it wouldnt have cost you more  the argument is sound festing agreed in fact it shows more understanding than id expect the boys to use  kerr looked hard at him i suspect that somebody is stirring them up you see they havent demanded more wages yet they only claim that i ought to hustle you  the fellows object isnt very plain but ive no doubt the demand for bigger pay will come well we cant hire more help and if theres no change soon the frost will break us without your bothering well do our best until then  well leave it at that said kerr with a sympathetic nod and when he went away charnock turned to festing  wilkinsons the man and as the boys have a real grievance hell find them easy to work on that means ive got to write to sadie  no said festing if you write i stop your wife has sent you money enough and im afraid some of it is lost we must trust to luck and in the meantime well fire the shot  he blew a whistle and then striking a match lighted the fuse and hurried away a minute or two later lumps of frozen gravel flew about the track and showers of smaller fragments scattered the snow as festing came out of his shelter a man with an angry look advanced along the line  why dont you warn folks before you shoot off your rocks he asked  my partner whistled charnock answered whats the matter anyhow did the shot jar your nerves  a rock a foot across mighty near jarred my head a smaller piece got me plumb on the ribs  festing thought this unlikely in view of the fellows distance from the explosion but could not be certain he was not struck  im sorry if you got hurt he said you ought to have heard the whistle  anyhow i didnt you want to stop shooting rocks when there are men around then youve mussed up the track and cant put her straight why dont you hire more boys and rush the job cant see why the bosses let two deadbeats like you and your partner have the contract  we have got it how we mean to carry it out is our business not yours  then its certainly our business if we work or not the other rejoined as the bosses will find out if they reckon were going to lose our time to help you save your dollars  he went away grumbling and charnock looked at festing  was that bluff do you think he means it  i dont know they havent lost much time through our fault but the frost has interfered with other jobs and i expect therell be trouble if it lasts im puzzled because theyre not a badtempered lot and i understand that wilkinson is not a favorite your throwing him down the bank wouldnt strengthen his influence  its easy to work on mens feelings when theyre discontented charnock replied the worst is that kerr cant stand by us if the gang put down their tools labors scarce in the mountains and hell be forced to do what they want  festing gloomily agreed im afraid so however we must do the best we can in the time we have left  they worked by a blastlamp until late at night and began again before daybreak in the morning the weakened frame had been replaced but others needed strengthening and the rockwork must be built up among the timbers the stones required careful fitting and it was impossible to dress them to rough shape the frozen surface resisted the tool and they broke if much force was used fires were made but the rock thawed irregularly and much time was lost  festings bruised hand gave him trouble his mittens wore to rags and his numbed fingers cracked and bled but he worked savagely until evening then he walked stiffly to the shack and sat dejected and aching looking at the food on the table although he had eaten little all day it cost him something of an effort to begin his meal  an hour afterward he heard steps and voices outside and opened the door the light shone out from behind him and he saw a group of dark figures in the snow  well boys he asked what do you want  we want to know when youre going to fix the track one replied  thats easily answered we mean to put it right as soon as we can  not good enough remarked another weve got to know when  then im sorry i cant tell you it depends on the weather  some of them growled and festing felt charnocks hand close warningly on his arm  wont you come into the light boys the latter asked id like to know to whom im talking  they did not move and charnock resumed have you brought your foreman or wilkinson  somebody said neither had come and charnock nodded  well i reckon they know whats best for them wilkinson doesnt like me but hes not looking for more trouble i imagine hes had enough then the foremans not a friend of mine but he has a better job than yours and means to hold it down if you get up against the bosses hes not going to be fired  there was silence and he saw his remarks had not been wasted he had hinted that the men were being used and given them ground to distrust their leaders  i half expected another fellow a friend of wilkinsons who claimed he had been hit by a stone has he come along  said he was too sore and would have to lay off tomorrow one replied thats another thing when you shoot off your blasts you have got to watch out that nobody gets hurt  sure agreed charnock we did watch out and blew the whistle but we want to do the square thing if pearson got hurt and cant work let him show you the bruise well stand for his pay until you think hes fit to begin again  thats fair admitted the other with a laugh he wasnt showing the bruise much say youre pretty smart  i hope so said charnock modestly looks as if i needed all the smartness ive got were up against the weather and a big awkward job and then you come along and worry us however what are you going to do about it if we cant put the rails down as soon as you want  well make the bosses break your contract  charnock pondered keeping his hand on festings arm because he thought he could handle the matter better than his comrade festing was too blunt and sometimes got angry he saw that the men were determined but while they had no doubt been worked upon he thought they had no personal grudge against him or his partner  theres only one way you could put the screw to the bosses and that ways dangerous the colonist states that they have a number of men unemployed in the coast towns if kerr wrote to a labor agent hed send him up a crowd  it would cost him high to bring the men here and take some time  that is so charnock agreed he saw the others had made their plans and calculated the pressure they could put upon the engineers time was important and he thought the foreman had helped them to estimate the expense the company would incur by the delay before they could get new men  putting down your tools would cost you something he resumed how long do you imagine it would take to persuade kerr  i guess a week would fix him he wouldnt stand for a fortnight  very well i dont suppose your object is to put us off the road you want what youre entitled to so do we all and though its often troublesome to get theres no use in taking the hardest way if you stop you lose a fortnights wages and somebody will get fired not now of course but afterwards the bosses know their job well give us ten days and the time you miss wont run to many dollars if we cant put the rails down then well quit  there was silence for a moment and then somebody said well let it go at that its a deal  the others growled consent and charnock waited until they moved away after which he shut the door and sat down wearily  you took the right line festing said  i hesitated about fixing the time but we cant go on much longer  no said festing well we have ten days  they said nothing more and soon afterwards went to bed next morning there was a marked haziness in the west but the frost was keener it looked as if they must be beaten although they meant to fight until defeat was sure and festing was surprised when he glanced at his comrade this was not the careless lounger he had known charnocks face was grim and somewhat pinched his hands were torn and bruised he picked the heaviest stones to lift and was the first to take hold of ponderous beams festing owned that he had misjudged charnock but not more than he had misjudged himself his farming had been a rash experiment and the contract a reckless gamble the one threatened to end as badly as the other then bob had somehow kept his wifes love and he with senseless obstinacy had estranged helen  his thoughts were depressing but they drove him on hope was dead he had made a horrible mess of things all that was left was to take his punishment and hold on until he was knocked out but he meant to do this he did not stop for dinner with the rest but occupied himself with something that needed doing and forgot that he had gone without the meal afterwards a pain began in his left side but he had other aches and the extra discomfort did not trouble him much in the afternoon he worked with a kind of sudden fury and when at length the tired men dropped their tools found some difficulty in straightening his back he had never used his muscles as he had done for the past few days but the strain would soon be over  it was unusually dark when he went up the hill to the shack the pines rose in blurred masses from the shadowy snow and he could not see the hollow of the path supper was a melancholy meal but he ate because he was hungry and afterwards dragged his chair to the fire there was a great pile of crackling logs and the blaze flickered about the room but bitter draughts came in beneath the door  an open fires of no use i thought about getting a stove he said and paused with a dreary smile its lucky i didnt send the order  you may need it yet charnock replied somehow well put the rails down in time  festing did not answer and picked up a newspaper he did not want to read but could not sleep although he was very tired and felt he must have some relief from his anxious thoughts the newspaper was a colonist that had left victoria some days before and he read it methodically from the first column trying to fix his attention on things that had happened in remote mining settlements and market reports his efforts were mechanical but he long afterwards remembered what he read and how he dully followed the arguments in an article on political reform indeed when he saw the colonist his imagination carried him back to the logwalled hut and he felt something of the dazed hopelessness that blunted his senses then  in the meantime charnock half asleep lounged with his legs stretched out to the fire the logs snapped and a fitful wind stirred the tops of the pines now and then some snow fell from a branch and a loose roofing shingle rattled but by degrees the sounds died away everything was strangely quiet except for the roar of the river which had got more distinct charnock shivered and felt a puzzling tension it was often calm at night particularly in hard frost but he felt as if something was going to happen looking up he saw festing nod with his eyes half shut and felt for his tobacco  while he cut the plug the silence was broken there was a humming in the pine tops and light branches began to toss the draught from the door got stronger but did not bite as keenly and it sounded as if the snow was falling from the trees then some slipped down the roof and getting up with tingling nerves he opened the door all the trees were rustling and waves of sound came up the valley the sound swelled the air felt damp and a drop of moisture from the roof splashed upon his head he drew a deep breath of relief for a warm wind from the pacific was roaring through the defile then festing dropped the newspaper  why have you opened the door he asked drowsily and got up with a jerk as the draught swept the smoke about the room  a chinook he exclaimed and ran to the door well have rain and warmth while it blows  its great said charnock hoarsely we are through the worst then he caught festings arm and laughed say something wise partner i want to shout and dance  you had better go to bed it will be thawing hard tomorrow and theres much to be done a chinook doesnt last long in the mountains  this chinook is going to last until we put the rails down charnock replied    chapter xxv  the thaw  when festing went out at daybreak the air was soft and drops from the wet pines fell into the honeycombed snow the surface was turning to slush but he knew it would wear down into a slippery mass on which the logs would run this was fortunate because he doubted if labor could be usefully employed upon the stones just yet for a few moments he pondered the matter and listened to the rivers turmoil the deep booming note was sharper water splashed noisily in the gullies and there was a ringing crash as an icefloe broke upon a rock then he turned as charnock came up  which is itlogs or stones the latter asked  logs i think we can handle them easily festing replied the other job is urgent but the thaw has only begun and when the ground gets properly soft well do twice as much as we could now still theres a risk we could make some progress with the track and the warm spell maynt last  take the risk said charnock with a laugh theres not much fun in playing for safety and you dont get far that way while when you try to foresee things you generally see them wrong but lets be practical as soon as the ground is soft enough well ask leave to hire half the gravel gang that will make friends of the opposition and wont put up our wages bill if you double your helpers you halve the working hours  obviously but you have to pay the larger number all at once wheres the money coming from  from the head contractor well try to make norton sign for an interim payment lets go and see him  festing was doubtful but they found norton the contractors engineer more compliant than he hoped  i suppose you are entitled to ask for a sum on account but id take some responsibility in allowing the demand he said why did you come to me now  we want to be just charnock answered modestly at present theres no prospect of our finishing the work we ask the money for  it doesnt go much beyond a prospect yet norton rejoined however ill help you if i can and will see what kerr thinks hes the man we have both to satisfy in the end  they went to work up the hill in the melting snow and soon their clothes were dripping and their long boots soaked at first the logs vanished in the drifts through which they tried to roll them and the horses slipped and floundered in the slush but this flowed away and left a harder layer that was presently beaten firm the surface turned black and compressed into ice and before long rows of heavy logs plunged down the skids every moment must be turned to good account and festing stopped and went down reluctantly when kerr sent for him  ive seen norton and he thinks we ought to help you out kerr remarked though he argues from single instances his judgments often good and he seems convinced you can be trusted because you saved a skip of his of course i had my opinion but as he represents the contractor you are working for i couldnt urge him  thanks said festing i wish id brought charnock hed deal with this better  kerr laughed your partner has some talents and seems to have made norton and my storekeepers his friends if he hadnt there might have been trouble about certain irregularities however you can have the gravel gang if im forced to lay the boys off and as soon as we can run the train over the repaired track youll get your cheque  festing went away feeling satisfied but not without some anxiety he could not urge norton to go farther than his employer would approve and the payment agreed upon was small besides if the frost returned before he had made the track secure he would have spent enough money in extra wages to prevent his going on and should this happen it might be difficult to obtain payment for other work already completed he would be at the mercy of nortons employer who might contend that by throwing up his contract he had forfeited his claim it was obvious that he must make the utmost use of every hour of open weather and for the rest of the day he worked with a stubborn energy that conquered fatigue  for a time the logs went screaming and grinding down the skids but darkness made launching them dangerous and they could not light the lumber road on the hill they worked in the dark rolling out the sawn trunks from among the brush and melting snow until there was room to hook on the team then the driver walking by his horses heads felt with his feet for the hollowed track and losing it now and then embedded his load in snow then he called for help and men with cantpoles laboriously hove the ponderous mass back to the road  the work was worse on the inclines where the logs ran smoothly and there was a risk of their overtaking the horses rain had begun to fall and one could not see the obstacles but there were pitches where one must go fast in order to keep in front of the dangerous loads but risks must be run in lumbering and festing felt that rashness was justified speed was the thing that counted most  when supper time drew near men and horses were worn out and festing knew that if he urged the former to continue he could not do much without the teams there were however a few logs he meant to haul to the skidway before he stopped and he had some misgivings when he started with the last it was an unusually large trunk and the tired horses floundered as they tightened the chain thawing snow when beaten hard is as slippery as ice but the animals kept their feet and the mass began to move festing got a firm grip on the near horses bridle and plodded forward cautiously with the rain in his face when he crossed the openings in the wood the snow reflected a puzzling glimmer but the darkness was thick among the trees and drops from the shaking branches fell into his eyes turning his hatbrim down he felt for the edge of the trail  by and by he stopped at the top of a descent the gray snow looked all the same and the hollow track vanished a few yards in front the rows of trunks had faded into a vague dark mass and the branches met overhead in a thick canopy the horses were big valuable percherons but they were exhausted and stood slackly with steam rising from their foamflecked coats festing did not like the look of the dip and knew the trees grew close upon the track at the bottom but he must go down and shouted to the hesitating animals  they moved faster the log grinding heavily across the snow behind then the strain on the chain slackened and he dragged at the bridle as he began to run the log could not be stopped now it was moving faster than he had thought and all that he could do was to keep the team in front his feet slipped on the icy trail and the horses floundered but they knew the danger and broke into a clumsy trot it was hard to keep up but festing must hold them to the track and steer them round a bend ahead  the log lurched noisily across lumps and hollows the chain made a harsh clank and the wood echoed the thud of heavy hoofs festing ran his best and imagined that he was running for the horses lives and perhaps for his he durst not look round and could only guess where the log was by the noise the blurred trees rolled back to him in a thick dark mass but he thought the gap he followed got narrower ahead this was no doubt the awkward spot where the trunks closed on the track and there was a corner he must go on and trust to luck for getting round  in a few moments he was almost at the corner and although it was hard to see thought he distinguished a break in the dark wall of trees one must keep to the inside on the right but there was very little room and if he miscalculated he or the horses would collide with a trunk he smashed through a bush that caught his foot but his hold upon the bridle saved him from a fall it looked as if he had left the track and was plunging into the wood then a black trunk became detached from the rest apparently straight in front he did not mean to let go although he might be crushed between the horses shoulder and the tree and drew as close as possible to the animal something brushed his coat he felt a button torn off but the tree was passed he knew where he was now and thrusting hard against the horse urged the animal towards the other side of the road the log ran into soft snow and slowed there was more room here and the steepest pitch was behind a few minutes later he reached the top of the skids and sat down on the log breathing fast and feeling badly shaken  he frowned as he thought there was no physical reason he should feel shaken he was used to strenuous effort and danger could not be avoided when one engaged in construction work it was mental strain that was wearing him out the constant endeavor to finish a task in less than the necessary time want of money was however the main cause of his difficulties and when he had got his cheque it would be possible to take things easier comforting himself with this reflection he got up and led the horses downhill  the clang of hammers and rattle of shovels rose from the gorge sharply distinct at times but melting when the throb of the river swelled and a gust roared among the trees a dark skeleton of steel that stood out against pulsating flame with blurred reflections below marked the central pier of the bridge the line of track was picked out by twinkling fires then the scream of a whistle pierced the sound and the lights went out the men were going back to the bunkhouse and festing envied them their work was finished for the day and they could rest free from care until the whistle roused them to begin again many were no doubt tired but that was mans common lot and muscular fatigue in moderation was no hardship the strain came when one had to make the dollars go round and see that every effort paid its cost among the mountains the cost was high  charnock joined him when he was grooming the horses in the rude stable because the teams must be cared for before the men thought of food supper was ready when they went in and when they had eaten they sat by the hearth drying their damp clothes and enjoying the warmth they had scarcely spoken to one another during the day as a rule it was only after supper one could indulge in talk  presently charnock took his pipe from his mouth its luxuriously warm but one cant expect the chinook to last i imagine well have some use for a stove after all  were not out of danger yet festing replied nortons cheque has still to be earned but i begin to feel hopeful if we can hold out for a few more days i think well turn the corner anyhow the plan you made prevents any trouble from wilkinson for a time do you think he has had enough and will leave us alone  i cant tell but it doesnt matter much we mustnt exaggerate the fellows importance hes a very poor sample of the theatrical villain besides i imagine you seldom meet the latter in real life its an unnecessary part  you mean were up against enough without a plotting antagonist well i must agree considering the weather  charnock stopped him with a smile i dont mean the weather though one cant leave that out in a new country man must make the best fight he can against nature but shes not his worst enemy its our passions our virtues sometimes that lead us into a coil looks as if they didnt want much help from outside  that kind of speculations not much in my line  just so youre what you call practical and your mind runs upon the number of yards of rockwork you can put up in a day or the logs you can cut very useful but it doesnt take you far enough in fact if you had thought more about other matters you wouldnt be here now nor would i  im not sure i see your drift said festing impatiently whats your explanation for our being here  charnocks eyes twinkled if you want the truth its because youre something of an obstinate ass wilkinson had really nothing to do with it and the weather hasnt much your pride brought you and keeps you you took the wrong line with helen and then knowing you were wrong couldnt force yourself to accept her help however ill admit that we are a pair of fools i could have spent a lazy winter at the homestead if id liked  you came to look for me festing remarked with feeling  i did but stayed to please myself thought id show sadie what i could do felt virtuous about it at the time but begin to suspect that vanity pushed me on sadie would no doubt sooner have me safe at home anyhow i think ive proved my argumentwere here doing unthinkable things freezing sweating getting thin because of our own stupidity  in a way that is so festing agreed still i cant go back until i have finished this job  perhaps you had better not said charnock dryly i imagine you wouldnt be easy to live with it you felt you had come home because you had failed you might make good resolutions but the thing would spoil your temper all the same the pinch comes when you try to carry good resolutions out  festing got up and threw fresh wood on the fire if you have finished philosophizing well talk about something else  im not going to talk about logs and wages charnock replied  very well you havent told me much about wilkinson he seems a clever rascal do you think we have ground for being afraid of him  i dont imagine hed run much risk or make a sacrifice for the sake of getting his revenge that kind of thing isnt often done by normal people all the same he doesnt like us and if he found he could do us an injury without much trouble i dare say hed seize the chance on the whole it might be prudent to watch him now well let the matter go  festing nodded and they lounged in silence by the snapping fire  next morning they got to work upon the track and on the following afternoon when the thaw had gone far enough into the ground charnock went for the gravel gang the men came willingly although wilkinson and the foreman did not appear and with the connivance of one charnock obtained several of the companys blastlamps they worked well and when they went away festing was satisfied with what they had done he imagined that kerr and norton had put themselves to some inconvenience in order to let him have the gang and for the next two or three days he redoubled his efforts the strain was getting unbearable but the thaw would not last and he must finish all the work the frost would delay while he could get the men when he dismissed his helpers they parted on friendly terms but his look was grave that evening when he made up his accounts  the wages had been a heavy drain and he could not meet his storekeepers bills unless he got his cheque the defective underpinning had however been replaced or strengthened and he expected that kerr would test it soon if the work did not pass the test he would be ruined and would moreover have involved charnock in a serious loss  it was about the middle of the morning when he stood with kerr and his partner beside the mended tract bright sunshine touched the hillside leaving the gorge in shadow and the air was clear and cold the snow had gone for a few hundred feet above the rails the pines stood out sharply from the dark background and the hollows in the glittering slopes beyond were marked by lines of softblue shade festing thought a change was coming and he had not finished the track too soon  by and by a plume of smoke rose above the trees and something twinkled in an opening a rhythmic snorting and a rumble pierced the throb of the river and kerr looked up the track  the engineers bringing her along fast shall i flag him to snub her and shut the throttle before he runs across the new stuff  no said festing quietly it wont be needful  the work hasnt had much time to settle and a locomotive using steam hits the rails harder than when shes running loose  we dont want our money until its earned and youll have to haul heavy loads up the grade when the regular traffic begins  in the meantime im not thinking about the rest but about the gravel train  the track will stand said festing in a steady voice  the train came on the long lowsided cars rocking and banging down the incline small figures jolted up and down on the gravel and at the far end the big plow flashed in the sun the front of the engine got larger and festing fixed his eyes upon the rockwork he had built among the piles all that could be done had been done he had not spared money or labor for charnock had agreed that the job must stand it was no doubt exaggerated sentiment for he was highly strung but he felt that he had staked his wifes respect and his future happiness on his work  the ground shook and flying fragments of ballast beat upon his turneddown hat there was a deafening roar as the cars jolted past and he saw the rails spring then the wind that buffeted him changed to eddying puffs the noise receded and he lifted his bent head the rockwork stood firm the ends of the timbers had not moved and only a few small heaps of gravel had fallen from the roadbed festing felt that he was trembling and kerr put his hand on his arm  its a good job im quite satisfied if youll come along to nortons office ill tell him he can give you an order on headquarters for your cheque  ill come instead said charnock who turned to festing go to the shack and take a smoke if you come out before i return ill stop the gang  half an hour later he found festing sitting slackly by the fire  the order is in the mailbag and will go out on the first train he said its lucky we got it because we have cut things very fine i had a note some days since from the fellow who sends us our stores insisting on our settling his bill  then why didnt you tell me festing asked  charnock laughed i imagined you had enough to bother you and his account is big we couldnt have paid him without going broke and wages have first claim there was a way out but you had given me strict orders not to write to sadie  i couldnt have allowed that but youre a good sort bob  well said charnock cheerfully it was so to speak touch and go but we have turned the awkward corner and i think are going to make good    chapter xxvi  a new undertaking  soon after the rails were laid down the frost returned and one cold morning festing sat in his shack studying a letter from helen nortons cheque had helped him to overcome the worst of his difficulties things were going better and charnock would superintend the workmen until he was ready to go out festing felt that he need not hurry and wanted to think  helen had written to him before without any hint of resentment and he had told her what he was doing she knew bob was his partner and no doubt understood what this implied it was obvious that he had been wrong in disliking bob and half suspecting him besides helen knew from the beginning that he had not suspected her although he had insisted that she had been imprudent this ground for difference had vanished but he wondered what she thought and could not gather much from her letter  she wrote with apparent goodhumor and stated that all was going satisfactorily at the farm where indeed nothing of importance could be done until spring for all that there was some reserve a personal explanation was needed before they could get back to their old relations of intimate confidence and he was ready to own his mistakes unfortunately the explanation must be put off because there was one point on which he was still determined although his resolve no longer altogether sprang from pride he must if possible repair his damaged fortunes before he went home farming on a proper scale was expensive work and helens capital was not large in order to raise a big crop one must speculate boldly and he meant to do so with his own money  he saw a danger in staying away too long but his contract was only beginning to be profitable besides one thing led to another and a number of extras for which the pay was good had been added to the original plans then he had been asked to undertake another job and had arranged to go over the ground with kerr and norton that morning in a way he would sooner have left it alone because it would keep him longer from home but the terms offered a strong inducement to stop glancing at his watch he saw it was nearly time to meet the engineers  he found them and charnock near the halffinished bridge which crossed the river obliquely the track approached its end in a curve and then stopped where a noisy steamdigger was at work between the machine and the bridge the hillside fell in a very steep slope to the water which rolled in angry turmoil past its foot and the channel dividing the bank from the island that supported the central bridgepier was deep here and there a slab of rock projected from the slope but for the most part the latter consisted of small stones and soil the surface was now frozen beneath a thin crust of snow and the pines were white  you know roughly what we want said kerr if youll come along you can look at the shotholes we made to test the ground then ill show you a carload of the rock we want to use but its largely a lumber job and thats why we thought of offering it you you have some good choppers besides the teams and plant required  they climbed about the bank by dangerous paths and then stopped at the end of the bridge  the thing can be done but it will only make a temporary job festing remarked you will have to do it again properly in a year or two  that the companys business kerr replied as soon as we start the traffic improvements can be paid for out of revenue instead of piling up construction costs  you can imagine the cost if we cut back the hill far enough to ease the curve and lay the track on solid ground norton interposed the halfmeasure of scooping out a shallow roadbed and dumping the stuff on the incline is ruled out because the spoil wouldnt lie and the river would sweep the dirt away if we filled up the channel with rock wed turn the current on the bridgepier  then charnock said something and festing let them talk while he looked about since a temporary job was required he thought the plan was perhaps the best that could be used it called for a timber framework beginning about halfway up the bank although its height would vary with the ground the gaps between the frames would be faced with rockwork and then filled with rubble in order to make a bed for the rails on top  if you will come to the office ill show you the detailed drawings norton said presently and the others followed him  when they reached the office festing studied the drawings and then giving them to charnock lighted his pipe he wanted to undertake the contract but hesitated the work already on his hands would occupy him for some time and a lengthy absence might prejudice him with helen besides he had taken risks enough and a new venture might prove a rash challenge to fortune one could not foresee all the difficulties that might arise but if he succeeded he would go home with the means to resume his farming on a profitable scale then he saw charnock looking at him and knew he would agree to his decision festing put down his pipe and knitted his brows  well said charnock  festing got up with a quick resolute movement and turned to norton  well undertake the job  thats all right said norton ill get the papers drawn up and send them over for you to sign  they went out and as they climbed the hill charnock remarked this may turn out a big thing partner are you going home before we start  festing looked up sharply with a disturbed air no to begin with ive got to be about because the thing is big  then as matters are going smoothly now ill leave you for a week  i can manage for a week and one of us must stay but why dyou want to leave  on the whole i think one of us had better go charnock answered with some dryness if you dont mind ill get off tomorrow  he started next morning in the caboose of a returning supply train and festing who went to see him off stood for a few minutes on the snowy track while the rattle of wheels and snorting of the locomotive died away bob had made a curious remark when he talked about going and festing wondered what he meant but dismissed the matter and went back to his work  it was a bitter afternoon when charnock got down at the little prairie station that was marked by a watertank the agents shack and the lower frames of three unfinished grain elevators he hired a rig at the livery stable and borrowing a furrobe started on his drive across the plain the landscape was empty and featureless except for the gray smears of distant bluffs nothing moved on the white expanse and there was no sound but the measured thud of the horses feet the air was still and keen with frost when the cluster of wooden houses sank behind a gradual rise the wavy blue riband of the trail was the only sign of human activity in the frozen wilderness  the snowfall however is generally light on the western plains and the trail was good its smooth surface was dusty rather than slippery and the team went fast everything was different from the varied grandeur of the mountains the eye found no point to rest upon and the level snow emphasized the loneliness in spite of the thick drivingrobe the cold bit through charnocks wornout clothes but he was conscious of a strange and almost poignant satisfaction this was not because he was at heart still something of a sybarite and had borne many hardships on the railroad he was going home and in an hour or two sadie would welcome him it was curious but when he married sadie he had not thought she could inspire him with the feeling he had now but he had learned her value and understood something of what she had done for him  when it got dark he urged the horses and tried to control his impatience later he felt his heart beat as he drove round the corner of a shadowy bluff and saw his homelights twinkle across the snow a hired man came out to take the team he got down nearly too numbed to move and as he stumbled up the steps sadie met him with a cry of delight she drew him in and when he stood halfdazed by the brightness and change of temperature in the wellwarmed room she took her arm from round his neck and moved back a pace or two  charnocks skincoat was ragged his mittens were tattered and his long boots badly worn he looked tired and unkempt but sadies eyes were soft as she studied him  your face is very thin but i dont like it less she said you havent come back the same bob i think you have grown  perhaps the pains account for the thinness charnock answered with a smile anyway you ought to be satisfied because you tried to make me grow and in a sense i was very small when i left you but we wont be sentimental and i want to change my clothes  he found fresh clothes ready and when he came back his slippers pipe and a recent newspaper occupied their usual place sitting down with a smile of content he lazily looked about  this is remarkably nice he said the curious thing is that i feel as if id only left the house five minutes since everything i want is waiting although you didnt know i was coming  i knew you would come some day and come like this without letting me know  and so you kept everything ready charnock rejoined well i imagine thats significant but you see i didnt know i could leave camp until the day before i started and then it looked as if id get here as soon as the mail  sadie gave him a quick glance then something happened that made you leave  something did happen but nothing bad however its a long story and ive not had much to eat  supper will be ready in five minutes and ive got something that you like  ah said charnock i suppose that means you kept the thing i like ready too  they talked about matters of no importance until the meal was over and then sadie made him sit down by the stove and light his pipe  now she said you can tell me all you did at the construction camp and leave nothing out  charnock was frank he knew sadie understood him perhaps better than he understood himself and if his narrative gave her any pleasure he thought she deserved it moreover when he wanted he talked rather well making his meaning clear without saying too much when he finished she gave him a level glance  youre surely a bigger man bob i see that not only by what you have done but by what you think  well said charnock twinkling im glad youre satisfied but youll probably find out that theres room for improvement yet  i suppose you must joke sadie rejoined with mild reproof but what about festing doesnt he meant to come back until the jobs finished  so far as i could gather he does not i tried tactfully to persuade him he was acting like a fool and imagine he sees a glimmer of the truth all the same hes obstinate  sadie was silent for a minute knitting her brows and then looked up  you have only three days i suppose i mustnt keep you after that  it mightnt be prudent if i stay longer i shall no doubt feel unequal to going back at all my industrious fits very recent and good resolutions fail  pshaw said sadie try to be serious i must see helen tomorrow and cant take you she may have a message for her husband  couldnt she write the message if you went after i had gone  no said sadie firmly she must send it now  charnock looked hard at her and nodded well perhaps its a good plan meddling is sometimes dangerous but one can trust you  sadie wrapped in furs drove across the prairie next afternoon and found helen at home the latter looked rather forlorn and dispirited and sadie felt that she had undertaken a delicate task  bob has come home for three days she said by and by he cant stop longer but i thought youd like to know how they are getting on with their contract  stephen writes to me helen replied with a hint of sharpness  i guess he does sadie agreed still from what bob says they havent much time for letters and he talked to me about the work all last evening he could leave when stephen couldnt because hes the junior partner and doesnt know much about railroading yet  helen smiled rather curiously do you feel you must explain why your husband came home and mine did not  for a moment or two sadie hesitated it looked as if she had not begun well but she braced herself if her tact were faulty she would try frankness  yes she said in a way that was what i did come to explain though its difficult in the first place i know why stephen couldnt come  helen waited and then as sadie seemed to need some encouragement said very well i think id like to be convinced  the reason bob came and stephen stayed begins with the difference between them we know them both and i want to state that im quite satisfied with bob that had to be said and now well let it go but they are different bob will work for an object for dollars to feel hes making good or to please me your husband must work whether he had an object or not because thats the kind of man he is  bobs way is easier understood helen rejoined besides stephen is working for money enough to farm again on the old large scale  he is but you dont understand yet and i want to show you why he feels he has got to farm stephens the kind we have most use for in this country in fact hes my kind perhaps i know him better than you give him a patch of pinescrub or a bit of poor soil in a sandbelt and hed feel it his duty to cultivate it no matter how much work it cost show him good wheat land lying vacant or rocks that block a railroad and he wont rest till he starts the gangplow or gets to work with giantpowder he cant help it the things born in him like liquor or gambling only cleaner  but when such a man marries  what about his wife well she must help all she can or stand out and let him work alone its a sure thing she cant stop him  helen pondered and then remarked stephen is not your kind as you said you wanted to leave the prairie and live in a town  i certainly did but i didnt know myself though i wanted to meet smart people and wear smart clothes to push bob on and see him make his mark in big business or perhaps in politics now i know i really wanted power to order folks about and get things done  you found you must give up your ambitions  i saw they had to be altered sadie replied but when you cant get things done by others you can do them in a smaller way yourself and i find i can be satisfied with running a prairie farm as it ought to be run she paused and resumed with a soft laugh looks as if neither of us was fixed quite as we like i have a husband who must be hustled you want to hold yours back well i guess we cant change that we must take the boys for what they are and make allowances besides your mans fine energy is perhaps the best thing he has  helen was somewhat moved sadies rude philosophy was founded on truth and having made sacrifices she had a right to preach after all to dull the fine edge of stephens energy would be an unworthy action and perhaps dangerous helen had been jealous of his farm but admitted that she might have had worse rivals  do you know the sons of martha she asked and recited a verse  its great said sadie simply that man has our folks placed well i dont read much poetry but theres a piece of whitmans i like when i watch an oxteam break the first furrow in virgin soil or a construction train loaded with new steel go by i hear him calling pioneers oh pioneers  there was silence for a few moments and then sadie leaned forward i dont know if ive said enough or said too much but bob goes back in three days and could take a message  the color crept into helens face and her look was strangely soft  let him tell stephen to finish his work as well as he can say i understand    chapter xxvii  snow  tossing snowflakes filled the air and although it was three oclock in the afternoon the light was fading when charnock opened the door of the caboose a bitter wind rushed past him and eddied about the car making the stove crackle the iron was redhot in places and a fierce twinkle shone out beneath the rattling door halfseen men lay in the bunks along the shadowy wall tools jingled upon the throbbing boards but the motion was gentler than usual and the wheels churned softly instead of hammering  is she going to make it somebody asked  charnock leaned out of the door black smoke streamed about the cars and he heard a heavy snorting some distance off but the caboose lurched slowly along the uneven track the construction train was climbing a steep grade the driving wheels slipped and he doubted if the locomotive could reach the summit from which the line ran down to the camp dim pines hardly distinguishable from the white hillside drifted past a shapeless rack loomed up and slowly drew abreast it was some moments before charnock lost it in the tossing white haze  i dont know if shell make it or not but rather think she wont he said  then come in and shut the blamed door another growled no need to worry about it anyhow pays as good for stopping in the caboose as for humping rails in the snow  youre luckier than me in that way charnock answered as he shut the door there are some drawbacks to being your own boss when you cant get to work its comforting to know that somebody else has to find the dollars and put up the hash  he shivered as he sat down on a box the snow was obviously deep and things would be unpleasant at the camp but festing would not let this interfere with work charnock thought he had been foolish to come back but festing expected him and sadie agreed that he ought to go it was something of an effort to live up to the standards of such a partner and such a wife sadie was a very good sort better than he deserved but he would not have minded it if she were not quite so anxious about his moral welfare besides after the comfort of the homestead the caboose jarred it smelt of acrid softcoal smoke the air was full of dust and rubbish jolted about the floor then charnock grinned as he admitted that he had not expected to find the path of virtue smooth  his reflections were rudely disturbed for a violent jolt threw him off the box the boards he fell upon no longer throbbed and it was evident that the train had stopped the others laughed as he got up  locos hit a big drift said one i guess the engineer wont butt her through  hell surely try jake hates to be beat another remarked and the caboose began to shake as the train ran backwards down the line  a minute or two later there was a savage jerk and a furious snorting the caboose rolled ahead again faster than before for the wheels had cut a channel through the snow and somebody said watch out hold tight when she jumps  the speed slackened a jarring crash ran backwards along the train and the caboose tilted as if the wheels had left the rails tools and sacks of provisions rolled across the inclined floor which suddenly sank to a level and a man who had fallen from his bunk got up and opened the door  shes bedded in good and fast guess jake will be satisfied now he said and laughed when a whistle rang through the snow nobody could hear that a mile ahead and as shes not over the divide its some way to camp i reckon well stop here until they dig us out  soon afterwards some more men came in covered with snow then the door was shut the stove filled and a lamp lighted and charnock resigned himself to spending another night in the caboose after all it was as warm as the shack and he reflected with some amusement that festing probably did not expect him to be punctual the latter knew his habits and no doubt imagined that he would find the comfort of the homestead seductive but festing did not know sadie who had sent him back within the promised time he enjoyed his supper and slept well afterwards in fact he did not waken until a stinging draught swept through the caboose and he saw that it was daylight the door was open and he heard voices outside he recognized one as the foremans and presently the fellow came in  dyou reckon youre here for good you blamed hibernating deadbeats he asked the occupants of the bunks turn out and get busy before i put a move on you  the men got up grumbling and charnock buttoned his skincoat and jumped down into the snow he sank to his knees but went deeper before he reached the engine round which a gang of men were at work with shovels it was not his business to help them and he floundered on up the track they had made until he crossed the summit and saw the bridge in the distance half an hour afterwards he met festing and thought he looked surprised  you didnt come with the boys to dig us out charnock remarked  no said festing we knew the train had passed the butte and guessed where she was held up but i hardly thought  you didnt think id be up to time charnock suggested well its remarkable what a good example does  did you see helen  sadie saw her i understand she was very well and sent you a message youre to finish your job and make goodhelen understands  festing was silent a moment and when he looked up his eyes were soft thank you bob or perhaps its sadie i ought to thank  i wouldnt bother about it sadies fond of meddling charnock answered with some embarrassment but will the snow stop the work  not altogether we can keep busy on the hill and im going up now will you come  presently said charnock smiling foods a thing you dont seem to need when youre occupied but i want my breakfast before i start  festing went away and after a time charnock joined him on the hill where fresh trees had been felled and roughly squared with the ax men and horses were working hard but charnock stopped for a minute or two before he began the snow was different from the thin covering that scarcely hid the short grass on the plains the pines were glittering white pyramids with branches that bent beneath their load and there were no inequalities on the drop to the river every projection was leveled up the hollows were filled and the snow ran unbroken among the trunks in a smooth white sheet it was not drying and getting powdery because the frost was not very keen and he imagined that festing meant to get as much lumber as possible down while the surface could be beaten into a smooth track  you might take gordons team and break a trail by hauling the lighter pieces to the top festing said theyll run down when they have worn a chute but well have some trouble manhandling the first  charnock nodded as he glanced over the edge of the narrow tableland the descent was not steep near the top but farther on it dropped precipitously to the water crossing the curve by the bridge  how will you stop the heavy stuff going into the river he asked  festing indicated two men moving about the waterside they looked curiously stumpy with their legs buried in the snow  i sent them to make a chain fast to the rocks well shackle up the first logs we run down and make a lumber pond a few may shoot across the top but well see what must be done as we get on  charnock hooked the chain round the smallest log he could find and started the horses they slipped and floundered as they plodded through the soft snow sometimes the log ran for a few yards crushing down the surface but it often sank overhead and the team struggled hard to drag it out for all that charnock reached the top of the slope and turning back widened the trail he had made the next log ran easier although it gave him trouble but when he stopped at noon he had beaten down a road  when they started again he left the team to somebody else and joined the men who were clearing out a trough down the hill this was harder work but the small contractor finds it pays to give his men a lead instead of orders and for a time charnock used the shovel and his feet then festing said they had better move a few logs as far as they would go and they worked the first trunk down hill with handspikes and tackles the lumber scored the bottom of the trough and would not run and they struggled through the bankedup snow lifting the heavy mass when it sank now and then they fixed the tackle to a tree and dragged the log across short skids thrust under its end and at length launched it from the brow of the steeper pitch  it plunged down some distance but stopped again half buried in loose snow and they scrambled after it clinging to small trees then the work got dangerous one could scarcely stand on the steep bank and when the log started it rather leaped than slid spikes torn from the mens hands shot into the air and those in front sprang back for their lives but the mass seldom went far before loose snow brought it up and the struggle with the levers began again at last it slipped from a hummock and glided slowly down crumpling the snow in front while a man clinging to the butt and shouting hoarse jokes trailed down the track behind  moving the next was easier and those that followed ran without much help for most of the way while when dark came the bank at the top was empty and there was a pile of logs held up by the chain at the waterside their descent had worn the channel smooth and it was now difficult to stop them going too far in a day or two festing brought the most part of his material to the spot where it would be used and got ready to put up the frames  stinging frost set in and on the morning they cleared the ground for the first post charnock felt daunted as he beat his numbed hands the sky was clear a hard dazzling blue against which the white peaks were silhouetted with every ridge and pinnacle in sharp outline they twinkled like steel in places but there were patches of delicate gray and here and there a dark rock broke through its covering the bottom of the gorge was soft blue and the river a streak of raw indigo but there was no touch of warm color in the savage landscape the glitter made charnocks eyes ache and the reflected sunshine burned his skin  some of the construction gangs were laid off but in places men were at work they looked small and feeble on the vast white slope and a few plumes of smoke seemed to curl futilely out of the hollow frost and snow defied mans engine power and the rattle of the machines was lost in the din the river made its channel was full of snow that had frozen in the honeycombed masses and the ragged floes broke with a harsh ringing crash others screamed as they smashed among the rocks and ground across ledges while the tall cliffs on the opposite bank flung the echoes far among the pines the uproar rose and sank but its throbbing note voiced a challenge to human effort and charnock admitted that had the choice been left to him he would have gone back to the warm shack and waited for better conditions  festing however would wait for nothing and kerr and norton were equally resolute just now festing was clearing away the snow while three or four men cautiously descended the bank dragging loads of branches a big fire was soon lighted and when the resinous wood broke into snapping flame festing cleared a spot farther on for another by and by he scattered the first the thawed surface was pierced and a hole dug then with half an hours savage labor they got the first big post on end the next broke the supporting tackle and a man narrowly escaped when it fell but they raised it again and got to work upon the braces the wood was unseasoned and hard with frozen sap saw and auger would scarcely bite but somehow they cut the notches and bored the holes when the first frame was roughly stayed charnock sat down with a breathless laugh  i suppose its the best job we can make and its up to specification still when one comes to think of it the optimism of these railroad men is remarkable green wood and uncovered bolts that will soon work loose in the rotting pine if i was an engineer the thing would frighten me  the track will stand while they want it festing answered with an impatient look long before it gets shaky theyll pull it down  pulling things down is a national habit a man i met in winnipeg bought a nearly new hotel because he thought he could put up a better building on the site however i suppose theres something to be said for his point of view progress implies continuous moving on  it does said festing while you moralize the men you ought to put to work are standing still  charnock got up and went off beating his hands he noted that there was a hole in the mittens he had brought from home this was annoying because sadie had given him the mittens in spite of many difficulties they braced the posts securely before they stopped work and when supper was over charnock reluctantly put on his coat he wanted to ask norton something and when he left the latters office came back along a narrow path above the track after going a short distance he stopped to look down at the halffinished frames  the moon had not risen but a pale glow shone above a gray peak and the sky was clear one could not see much in the hollow but the snow reflected a faint light the timbers they had erected rose like a black skeleton and after glancing at them charnocks eyes were drawn towards the pile of logs in the pond at the waters edge a log pond is generally made in a river where the stream will carry the trunks into the containing chains but festing had made his on land using the snow instead of the current charnock could not tell what had attracted his attention but stood motionless for a moment or two  he heard nothing but the roar of the current and the crash of splintering ice and could hardly distinguish the logs their outline was blurred and the darkcolored mass melted into a dusky background of rock and water yet he thought something had moved beside the pond  then an indistinct object detached itself from the pile it was shapeless and he lost it next moment but it had been visible against a patch of snow it was not a mans height and so far as he could see moved like an animal but no wild beast would haunt the outskirts of a noisy construction camp since he could not imagine why a man should crawl about the logs at night he resolved to satisfy his curiosity  this needed caution and he lay down and rolled himself in the snow it stuck to his shaggy skincoat and remembering that some drills had been left near the track he felt about until he found one the short steel bar was easy to carry and might be useful the next thing was to get down without being seen and he crept to the logslide and sitting down let himself go his coat rolled up and acted like a brake but he reached and shot over the top of the last pitch next moment he struck the logs at the bottom with a jar that left him breathless and he lay still to recover his coat was white indeed the snow had forced its way inside his clothes but he must be careful about his background and avoid abrupt movements  getting on his hands and knees he crawled along the bottom of the pile the logs were not numerous since some had been used and when charnock reached the end he crouched in the snow and looked about nobody was there and his ears were not of much use because the crash of ice drowned every other sound this made silence needless and he tried to get between the logs and the water but found it dangerous the chain had sagged with the strain and the lowest tier was scarcely a foot from the bank along which the icefloes rasped  he came back and crawled halfway up the pile meaning to reach the top but stopped and lay flat an object moved along the highest row and he knew it was a man the fellows figure showed against the sky though charnock imagined he would have been invisible from above he waited and felt his heart beat as he clenched the bar the other did not seem to know he was watched and charnock resolved to find out what he meant to do he thought of the chain that held the logs if this were loosed the pile would roll into the river and be washed away but it would be impossible to slip the fastening toggle while the links were strained still one might be nicked with a hacksaw and left to break with the shock when the next log ran down the slide the man however could not get at the chain from the top row  he came nearer and then stopped abruptly as if alarmed charnock lay close in the hollow between two logs but his coat was snowy and it was possible that the other had noticed the white patch he turned and began to move back not fast but with caution charnock felt it was unthinkable that he should get away and raising himself swung the drill round his head and let it go it flew over the other man and vanished without a sound because the turmoil of the water drowned the splash but charnock lost his balance and rolled off the logs he fell into the snow and when he got up the man had gone  for a few moments he stood still hesitating and abusing his folly he did not know if the fellow had seen the drill fly past or not but he had thrown away his weapon and might have a dangerous antagonist for all that he meant to discover who his antagonist was floundering through the snow he reached the end of the pile but found nobody there the lumber gang had made a path along the waters edge but charnock could see nobody among the scattered trees he climbed to the top of the logs and looked down on the other side but saw nothing between the water and the pile  after this he felt the fastening of the chain which did not seem to have been tampered with because the toggle was securely fixed across the straplink then he crept about the pile again with an uncomfortable feeling that the other might be lying in wait for him but saw nothing suspicious and there was no use in examining the trampled snow by and by he gave up the search and returned to the path feeling disturbed it was impossible to guess what the man had meant to do or who he was but charnock resolved to watch    chapter xxviii  the lewis bolt  charnock went back next morning and examined the chain but found none of the links or fastenings damaged this was puzzling and he wondered whether the man he had seen knowing that somebody was about had stolen away without beginning what he came to do the explanation was plausible but left charnock uncertain who the fellow was he suspected wilkinson but only because he could think of nobody else with any ground for wishing to do him or festing an injury  on the whole he thought it better not to tell festing it was rather an improbable story and stephen might think him imaginative but he would watch and try to catch the fellow if he came again for a week he made excuses for going out after supper and festing did not object although he looked surprised but he saw nothing and it was very cold lurking about the track moreover he was generally tired after his days hard work and was glad to give up the search  some time later he returned from nortons office one night and had reached the track when he saw a man coming obliquely up the slope there was moonlight and the snow glittered between the shadows of the trees charnock saw the other plainly and drew back into the gloom along the bank the fellow did not seem to mind whether he was seen or not but charnock thought he knew his walk and figure and when he reached the track set off with the object of overtaking him the loose snow dulled his steps and he was close upon the man when the latter stopped and turned then charnock saw without much surprise that it was wilkinson  what were you doing down there he asked  i dont see what that has to do with you wilkinson answered coolly  the logs in the pond are ours  wilkinson looked amused and charnock tried to control his temper he would gain nothing by using force and thought the other meant to give him no excuse for doing so  you dont imagine i meant to steal your logs wilkinson rejoined theyre too large to carry away and theres no sawmill to buy them if i sent them down the river  thats obvious said charnock who thought it prudent not to hint that he had seen the fellow lurking about the pond before for that matter he was not certain he had seen wilkinson  youre much more suspicious than you were when i first knew you wilkinson resumed in a mocking tone  i was a confiding fool then and trusted my friends it cost me something  and now youre afraid to let anybody pass your logs in the dark well cautions useful but it can be overdone  why did you want to pass the pond  for one thing because its the easiest way of getting from the smithy to the track then this piece of hillside doesnt belong to you however as i guess you dont claim it you no doubt reckoned i meant to play you some shabby trick turn your logs adrift for example  i dont think its impossible  wilkinson laughed well i might do you an injury if the thing wasnt difficult but dont let your suspicions make you ridiculous if you feel uneasy you can watch the pond anyhow the colds fierce and im going to the bunkhouse  charnock let him go and returned thoughtfully to the shack he did not doubt that wilkinson had been to the smithy because one could find out if he had not but he felt disturbed the fellow had somehow encouraged him to believe he might tamper with the logs but would hardly have done so had he meant to set them adrift he might of course have wanted to keep him uneasy without ground but suppose it was a feint intended to cover the real attack made at another point charnock determined to be cautious and keep his eyes open  he saw nothing to cause him fresh anxiety although he once or twice visited the pond at night in the daytime his work absorbed his attention for they were now building a lofty frame on the steepest pitch of the dip the foot of the longest timber which was unusually massive rested in a socket cut in the rock near the waters edge and it cost them a very hard and dangerous days work to get the log on end indeed for a few anxious minutes charnock imagined that the mass would break the tackles and come down when fixed it was nearly perpendicular but its top inclined slightly toward the bank and festing sent for norton and kerr  its a good post but im not sure we have got spread enough he said theres not much to resist the outward thrust a heavy train might cause still i dont see how we could have carried the foot farther back  youd have to go into the water norton agreed that would have meant a coffer dam and the company wont stand for expensive extras  the ice would have smashed the dam said kerr the job meets the plan which calls for stays to stop the post canting out put in an extra kingtie halfway up and ill pass your bill and find the ironwork  festing was satisfied with this and the post was stayed with chains while they got the braces fixed this took some days for the men were forced to work on dangerous snowy ledges and boards hung from the top where there was most risk and difficulty festing went himself but he looked anxious  its the worst part of the job and perhaps the most awkward thing ive done he said one night if the frame came down with the rockwork filling it might start the rest and shake some length of road  but theres no reason it should come down charnock argued  not in a way but im glad kerr authorized the extra brace well use the heaviest stuff we can and although the fastenings may give some trouble we havent come to them yet perhaps im getting nervous were up to schedule and doing pretty well but it will be a relief to get the contract finished  charnock told him about wilkinson and he looked thoughtful  i cant see his object particularly since he left the chain alone of course he may have meant some mischief but gave it up when he found you on his track  somehow i dont think that was it said charnock who went to open the door  kerr came in and after a time began to talk about the fastenings for the main tiebeam  as the rock is sound and can be thawed i think we could use a bolt on the lewis plan give me some paper and ill make a sketch you can take to the smith  charnock examined the drawing and noted that the holding part of the bolt was shaped like the letter y except that the stalk was split a wedge was sketched to fit the split and would obviously expand the upper arms to fit tightly into a fanshaped hole with a narrow mouth  ive not seen this kind of fastening before he said it ought to grip well but something depends upon the wedge  kerr nodded the wedge must be properly forged and fit tight but theres a cross bolt to stop it backing out so long as it doesnt break under the hammer it cant come loose something depends on the way the hole is cut and the rock but the stuff youre working is hard enough  next morning charnock took the drawing to the smith and calling at the forge a day or two later found wilkinson sitting on a box he had brought a pick to be mended and made a few ironical remarks until the smith showed charnock some irons he had forged  i guess thats what you want but i havent finished the lewis yet reckoned id wait until i could get a bit of horseshoe iron for the wedge when the new stores come along  whats that bar in the corner charnock asked  steel said the smith a bit off the end would make a wedge but you want to be careful you dont overheat the steel in the forge if its to stand hammering after horseshoe irons better for your particular job come back in a day or two and ill have the thing ready  charnock left him and one afternoon soon afterwards helped festing to notch and bore the heavy crosstie to fit the post and the ends of the timbers it was to hold in place these were intended to strengthen the frame of which the post and tie were the most important members and festing had waited until their other ends were securely fixed when the light was fading he beckoned charnock  you might get the lewis bolt the smith sent word its ready and i want to fasten the tie before we stop  when charnock reached the forge the smith was absent but he blew the fire until the light flickered about the shop and looked for the bolt he found it in a corner and took the wedge to the hearth it was properly shaped and slotted for a crossbolt but it looked rough and scaly and giving the blower a few more strokes he tapped it once or twice the scale fell off and the metal looked sound then while the flame spread about the fuel he glanced round the shop there was no horseshoe iron but the bar of steel had recently been cut and he thought the wedge had been forged out of its end  charnock did not think this mattered much festing had urged the smith to finish the job and the man knew his business since he had been forced to use steel he had no doubt taken the necessary precautions it was dark when charnock got back to the frame but a blastlamp threw out a dazzling glare and he climbed to a beam on which festing sat at the timbers inner end a fire burned on a shelf of rock and a man was stirring something in an iron pot  were melting lead to fill up the hole though i dont know if its necessary festing said have you got the bolt  its here he has made it out of steel the iron he expected hasnt arrived  thats all right they now use steel for many jobs instead of iron and the softer kinds are quite as tough anyhow we can trust the smith not to burn the metal help black while i get the tie ready for fastening  half an hour later the big crossbeam was in position and charnock watched festing fit the bolt into its fanshaped socket he did so with fastidious care and then standing on the beam swung the hammer a workman gave him the blastlamp roared upon a timber overhead throwing down waves of light that flooded the rock face but the twinkling brightness rather puzzled the eye for all that festing struck the wedge squarely and drove it home with a few heavy blows then he fastened the crossbolt and charnock filled a ladle with the melted lead a blue flame flickered about the cavity as he poured in the stuff there was an angry sputtering and he afterwards found some holes in his coat festing dropped his hammer with a gesture of satisfaction  thats an awkward piece of work finished and i feel happier now you can put out the lamp and quit boys ill mark you up full time  then they got down from the frame and went home to supper earlier than usual in the morning they began to build a wall of roughlycut stones among the timber filling in the space behind with rubble and kept on until at noon a day or two later heavy snow began to fall it was impossible to work and they lounged about the shack smoking and reading all next day charnock was thankful for the rest but festing grumbled and now and then walked impatiently to the door late at night the former was wakened by a distant rumbling it sounded like thunder and he called to his comrade  whats that had we better get up  sounds like a big snowslide said festing raising himself in his bunk wont harm us shacks on top of the ridge and were safer here than anywhere else he stopped and listened to the swelling roar and then resumed im glad we got that frame braced its a big slide and will probably come down the gully near the bridge theyre going to snowshed that piece of track and well haul out the posts if we cant get on with the other job  he lay down again but charnock waited this was the first snowslide he had heard and he felt awed by the din growing in a long crescendo it rolled down the hill in a torrent of sound but by and by he thought he could distinguish different notes the crash of trees carried away by the avalanche and the scream of gravel grinding across rocky scraps he could imagine the stones being planed away and the mass of broken trunks riding on top of the huge white billow  it was impossible to sit still and jumping down he lighted the lamp but found it hard to replace the glass the shack throbbed the table on which he put the matches shook and there was a rattle of crockery but this was drowned by an overwhelming roar the avalanche was pouring down a gully near the shack and he leaned against the table deafened until it passed then he heard the turmoil of a tremendous cataract and imagined the snow was plunging into the river and deflecting the current upon the other bank the sound gradually died away and he could hear detached noises great pines broken rocks and soil rushing down behind the fallen mass there were heavy splashes and then a strange unnatural silence  its finished festing remarked rather alarming for the first time but one gets used to it you can put out the light and go back to bed  charnock did so and soon went to sleep in the morning they found that the most part of the avalanche had fallen into the river but its tail remained resting in a steep cone of snow and broken trees and soil against the bank on which they had built the frames the top of the cone extended far up the hill but owing to the sharpness of the pitch its bottom which covered the frames and rockwork was thin festing sent half the men to cut this portion away and the others up the hill to haul posts for the snowshed to the top of the slides it was obvious that a very heavy weight rested on the buried work but the pressure was uniform unlike the jarring of a train and he did not feel disturbed  about four oclock in the afternoon he came to see how much progress the shovel gang had made and charnock who superintended their labor showed him what they had done they had cut a gap in the cone and part of the rockwork was exposed nearly to the bottom on each side the snow ran down to the water in a uniform smooth slant except where broken trees projected from the surface above the mass of snow rested on the shelf that would carry the track and on the top of the halffinished work it glittered with a yellow flush where it caught the fading light but in the hollow its color was a dull cold blue  by and by they examined the wall so far as they could see the stonework bore the unusual load well but in one spot there was a crack between two courses  ill get up there in the morning and see if its worth while to drive in a few wedges festing remarked you had better watch that bank of snow some of it will probably break away  we have had two or three small falls said charnock and festing beckoned one of the men  come up the hill in the morning tom im going to clear the logslide or break a new one which dyou think would be best  while they talked about it a shower of snow fell on charnock who stepped back  watch out he cried theres more coming  festing moved a pace or two and went on talking but charnock fixed his eyes on the snow the part above the track overhung the gap in a bulging cornice as if it was moving down hill and in a few moments a heavier shower began the bulge got more prominent but the cornice did not break off and while he watched it wondering whether he should call out the men a stone fell from the wall and dropped at his feet this was ominous but next moment a mass of snow struck his head nearly knocking him down and when he recovered his balance and wiped his face he noted with alarm that the stones were opening and the big post leaned outwards  jump for your lives boys he shouted and throwing himself on festing drove him back  then there was a roar of falling stones and a crash the massive post lurched towards him and the air was filled with snow he heard struts and braces crack as the post tore them out and thought festing turned round in order to see what was happening he pushed him away and then sank into loose snow and fell before he could get up there was a deafening noise something struck him a heavy blow and he was buried  after a short struggle he got his head out and finding that he was thinly covered made an effort to extricate himself when he had done so he saw the men some distance up the bank they were all there except festing but he noticed a heap of big stones and broken beams close by  back here boys the boss is underneath he shouted and threw himself upon the stones as the others ran up  for a minute or two they worked desperately flinging the lumps of rock about and dragging away the beams and then stopped as they uncovered festing his face looked very white although a red stain ran down his forehead charnock shivered and glanced at the break in the white mass above the track  its risky but weve got to pull him out before some more snow comes down he said in a hoarse voice scrape the snow off carefully tom get hold here with me pete  after two or three minutes cautious work they lifted festing out of the hole he was unconscious and his arm looked short and distorted charnock felt horrorstruck and dizzy but pulled himself together  go for kerr one of you he said then i want the stretcher and a handsledge bring a blastlamp ours is smashed  the men scattered except for one who stayed with him and kneeling in the snow he opened festings furcoat and took off his cap his head was cut and his arm broken but charnock did not think this altogether accounted for his unconsciousness he suspected broken ribs but could detect nothing unusual when he felt his comrades side  kerr arrived first and looked at festing  unconscious all the time he asked and when charnock nodded resumed most important things to get a doctor and ill see to that then ill get some brandy  as he hurried away three or four men came down the hill with the sledge and stretcher and one rigged and lighted a powerful lamp accidents are common at construction camps and one of nortons gang examined festing  hes sure got it badly arms not the worst he said well tend to that and then slide him gently on the stretcher carrying him might be dangerous well fix the whole outfit on the sled  while they were occupied a plume of smoke shot up above the pines and charnock knew kerr had sent off a locomotive to bring help when they had put festing on the stretcher a man arrived with brandy but festing could not swallow and seizing the sledge traces they started up the hill norton was in the shack when they reached it and felt festings clothes  not damp it would be safer to let him lie until the doctor comes he said and sent the men away then he turned to charnock sharply sit right down  charnock swayed clutched the chair and sank limply into the seat the floor heaved and the quiet figure on the stretcher got indistinct then norton held out a glass  drink it quick  charnocks teeth rattled against the glass but he swallowed the liquor and sat motionless for a moment or two  seemed to lose my balance bit of a shock you know and i expect that stone hit me pretty hard  so i imagine theres an ugly bruise on your face said norton giving him back the glass the first dose braced you take some more  i think not said charnock with a forced smile dangerous remedy if you have suffered from my complaint didnt know my face was hurt until you told me when dyou think the doctor will come  theres a man at jacksons bench loco ought to make the double trip in about two hours  two hours said charnock faintly and braced himself to wait    chapter xxix  foul play  some time after the accident a doctor arrived and set festings arm he found two ribs were broken and suspected other injuries but could not question his half conscious patient when he had done all that was possible in the meantime and had seen festing lifted carefully into his bunk he put a dressing on charnocks bruised face and pulled a chair to the fire  ill keep watch your partner has got an ugly knock he said dont think ill want anything and you had better go to bed  charnock could not sleep and spent the night uncomfortably on a chair he was sore and dazed but his anxiety would not let him rest and once or twice he softly crossed the floor to his comrades bunk the last time he did so the doctor whose head had fallen forward looked up with a jerk and frowned as he signed him to go back after this charnock kept as still as his jarred nerves would permit sometimes festing groaned and sometimes made a feeble movement but so far as charnock could see his eyes were shut  about three oclock in the morning the doctor stood for some minutes beside the bunk and charnock shivered as he watched his face the shack seemed very quiet except for the throb of the river and the grinding of the ice then the doctor gave him a nod that hinted at satisfaction and told him to refill the iron drum at festings feet with hot water by and by he put fresh wood in the stove moving cautiously and taking as long as possible because it was a relief to do something after sitting still in suspense  at daybreak there was a knock at the door and charnock finding kerr and norton outside looked at the doctor who put on his furcoat and went out to them  have you any news for us norton asked  no change yet thats encouraging as far as it goes  what about breakfast ours is ready will you join us  i think not if my patient doesnt come out of his stupor i must try to rouse him soon send a man here and take mr charnock i expect he needs food  very well said kerr well see the cook looks after you but can you give us no idea about festing you see there are matters business matters  he has had a bad shock and it will be a long job a month anyway i cant stop long and he ought to have a nurse although it would be difficult to get one to come here but i cant form an opinion yet  he dismissed them and kerr took charnock away it was very cold the white pines were growing into shape their tops caught the light in the east and glimmered with a faint warm flush against the dim blue shadow smoke and puffs of steam floated up from the gorge and the ringing clang of steel pierced the turmoil of the river charnock felt braced but dizzy now he came to think of it he had eaten no supper and after a day of laborious effort the nights watch had fatigued him besides his face smarted under the bandage and his back was sore  when he sat down in nortons shack where a plate was put for kerr he felt ravenously hungry and did not talk much until the meal was over then norton made him sit near the stove  its an awkward business he said to begin with what are we going to do about a nurse this is hardly the place for a woman and i doubt if we could get anybody to undertake the job  ill write to mrs festing  would she come out  i imagine so said charnock thoughtfully still she doesnt know much about nursing  his wife is the proper person to look after him kerr interposed then i have a young fellow in the rail gang who could help found him useful once or twice when the boys got hurt in fact i suspect hes had some medical training though i didnt ask why he quit  norton smiled it is not unusual to find men whose professional career has been cut short working on a western track  that simplifies matters if you had wanted a lawyer or an accountant i could have sent a man however theres another thing  there is its important kerr agreed whos going to carry on the contract  charnock leaned forward eagerly ill try give me a chance i think i know my job  there was silence for a few moments and norton looked at kerr who slowly filled his pipe  id like to consent he said but im the companys servant and theres a risk he paused and turned to norton however its really your business if things go wrong the troubles coming to you first  sure im willing to take the risk i dont expect charnock will fool the job but if he does you can get after me ill stand for it  very well well let it go at that  charnock got up with some color in his bandaged face because he knew what nortons confidence meant he was so to speak an unknown man and the contract had been given to festing who was an engineer if he failed the men who trusted him would be held accountable  thank you both he said with feeling if labor and money can put the thing over i wont let you down  he went out for he had in his anxiety about other matters forgotten his men and it was now important that no time which must be paid for should be wasted finding some of the gang at work clearing away the fallen material and some hauling lumber on the hill he gave them a few orders and returned to the shack when he got there festing was conscious and the doctor said he might speak to him  how do you feel charnock asked  better than the doctor thinks i ought to feel festing answered with a feeble smile you seem to have got knocked about  charnock said he was not much the worse and festing resumed have you seen norton what does he say about the contract  i have seen him you neednt bother he has left the job to me ill finish it somehow  a look of relief came into festings face thats comforting news i was afraidyoure a good partner bob  i dont know if ive been of much help so far and the money i put into the undertaking wasnt mine theres a third partner stephen and i think shed like me to see you through  festing gave him a grateful glance and closed his eyes after a time he opened them feebly and asked do you know why the frame gave way  not yet said charnock with some dryness i mean to find out  then the doctor interrupted and sent him away going back to the scene of the accident he found the damage less serious than he thought part of the wall had fallen and the post which had broken had pulled down the timbers attached but these could be replaced and charnock calling two men began to clear the snow from the kingtie which he imagined had given way first he found the lewis bolt fixed to its end but the wedge had gone and he climbed to the spot where the end of the beam had been fixed the stone socket had not broken but pieces of crushed lead lay near the hole the soft metal had not much holding power and had been used to fill up the crevices  sitting down he began with methodical patience to turn over the snow and loose rubble that remained on the shelf after the large stones had fallen the odds were against his finding what he sought but he persevered for an hour and then picked up a piece of broken metal a few inches long it was half of the wedge which had broken at the slot but although he searched carefully he could not find the other part putting the piece in his pocket he went to the forge and seeing the smith was occupied sat down and filled his pipe the door was open and the light reflected from the snow was strong charnock was glad of this because he wanted to see the smith who presently dropped his hammer and leaned against the hearth  hows your partner getting on he asked mr festings the kind of man i like i was sorry to hear he had got hurt  charnock studied the man his face was pale and wrinkled under the grime but he looked honest and if his statement was sincere as charnock thought it seemed to clear the ground after giving him a few particulars about festings injuries he lighted his pipe  wilkinsons not here today he remarked  hes not always here said the smith he comes when there are picks and drills that want sharpening  i saw him once or twice when i was in and thought he was a friend of yours  he can swap a good yarn kind of handy man and sometimes helps me with the hammer but i guess thats all there is to it  just so said charnock carelessly this is a warm place for a quiet smoke and the foreman cant tell how long one ought to stop particularly as youre sometimes out at the machineshop do you find the boys meddle with your tools if they come in while youre away  no sir thered be trouble if i did besides nobody comes but wilkinson and if im out he waits  charnock nodded as if it did not matter he had found out what he wanted to know and thought he had not excited the smiths suspicions taking the broken wedge from his pocket he put it on the hearth  i expect you know what that is the lewis smashed when the frame came down  its the wedge dont see why it broke plenty metal left though the slot weakened it  whats it made of  steel the iron i wanted didnt come but this is mild lowcarbon stuff  then whats the matter with it it did break  the smith put the piece into a socket in the anvil and struck it with a hammer the end broke short and picking up the fragment he went to the door  natures gone out of it i sure cant understand the thing he said with a puzzled look if i hadnt forged the stuff myself id allow it was burned  you dont often overheat the steel you work  no sir said the smith who took up a piece of metal pierced with holes made this out of the same bar and it took more forging now you watch  he put the object in a vise and hammered down the end which did not break thats all right anyhow tough and most as soft as iron but steels sometimes treacherous you want to be careful  could you tell by looking at it if a piece was burned  well said the smith thoughtfully its not always easy but if the thing was badly scaled id be suspicious of course there might be some scale  but the wedge looked all right when you finished it  it certainly did said the smith who hesitated say do you reckon it was the bolt going that let down your frame  so far i imagine it was the weight of snow the pile ran back up the hill and must have made a crushing load for all that im curious about the wedge  well said the other if it was the wedge im surely sorry the blamed thing is burned though i dont know how but if she was loaded up too much she might have broken anyhow burned or not  i expect so said charnock getting up you neednt bother about the matter im not blaming you  his face got very grim when he went out for what he had learned fitted in with his suspicions wilkinson had heard the smith say that steel could be easily spoiled and sometimes came to the forge when the man was away then there was the rough scaly look of the wedge which had been put out of the smiths sight inside the split shank of the bolt everything was plain charnock knew why the tie gave way and allowed the frame to fall  the thought of the treacherous injury made his blood boil the thing had been so easily done five minutes work at the blower a few strokes with a big hammer when the steel was dangerously hot and then perhaps a sudden quenching in the snow when the steel ought to have slowly cooled he had been wrong in thinking men would not risk much for the sake of revenge wilkinson had foully struck his comrade and perhaps crippled him for life but the cunning brute must be punished and driven from the camp and when he left should carry marks that would make it difficult to forget his offense  charnock however could not at once seek out his antagonist he had promised festing to carry on the contract they had had a number of setbacks and the accident would cost them much wages were high and it was essential that the men should be usefully employed while there was now nobody but himself to superintend the work besides the doctor might want him and he must call at the shack every now and then to see how festing was getting on it looked as if he must leave wilkinson alone until he had more leisure in the evening  it was a trying day the doctor sent him errands and sometimes allowed him to come in for a few minutes but his reports were not favorable and festing was either asleep or too feeble to talk when work stopped and charnock went to the shack after some hours absence the doctor looked very grave  im sorry i must keep you out he said you mean well but youre clumsy while the young fellow mr kerr sent has had some training and knows his job  then my partners worse  well ill own that im anxious about tonight but if he gets over the early morning ill have hope go to the engineers shack and ill send you a report if possible  charnock tried to brace himself as he went away so far he had not imagined that festing might die he had got a shock but must not let it overwhelm him thinking hard he walked to nortons shack to get some food he was worn out and felt some pain  norton gave him supper and offered him room for the night and charnock forced himself to eat when the meal was over he lounged in a comfortable chair with his eyes shut for a time and then got up and put on his coat  where are you going norton asked  ive some business at the camp charnock replied in a very grim voice  he went out and as he walked down the track met the locomotive engineer who stopped  is that you mr charnock colds pretty fierce tonight hows mr festing  charnock had not felt the cold until then but he shivered and beat his hands as he replied that festing was badly hurt then he asked are you going out with the loco  thought id finished but theyve wired that the cars are wanted on the next section and ive got to run them along  ah said charnock have you seen wilkinson  met him going to the bunkhouse just before you came up  charnock went on and presently entered the big wooden shed which was full of tobacco smoke and the smell of hot iron and food the warmth made him dizzy after the cold outside a group of men had gathered about the stove others sat at the dirty table with pipes and newspapers and a few were quarreling about a game of cards but charnock could not see them distinctly  one or two looked round as he stopped near the door dazzled by the light he had pulled off the bandage and there was a large dark bruise on his face which was set his mouth made a firm line and his eyes glittered then the foreman got up  well he asked harshly what do you want  charnock gave him a careless glance the fellow was truculent and had bullied charnock when he worked in his gang while the latter had sometimes replied to his abuse with witty retorts that left a sting afterwards he had beaten his persecutor badly in the dispute about the borrowed workmen  im looking for wilkinson  what dyou want him for the foreman asked suspiciously  thats my business  then this is my bunkhouse anyhow im in charge guess youd better get back to the bosses shacks where you belong  charnock noted the sneer but said quietly ill go as soon as ive had a word with wilkinson  he tried to see if wilkinson was there and did not think he was but could not be certain the foremans manner hinted that he meant to protect the fellow  youll go now dyou want me to put you out  for a moment charnock stood still and then suddenly lost his selfcontrol in a fit of savage rage he had suffered at the hands of the brute who was trying to prevent his finding wilkinson but he did not mean to be baulked and stepped forward with his fists clenched  he could not remember who struck first but got a blow on his body that made him gasp then he felt his knuckles jar on his antagonists face and the next moment staggered and fell against a bench that upset with a crash he recovered bent from the waist to dodge a blow that would have felled him and struck over the others arm  the foreman reeled but did not fall and closed with charnock who could not get away because of the table the latter felt his antagonists strength and there was no room for skill when he tried to break loose his feet struck the upset bench and the wall was close by breathing hard they rocked to and fro in a furious grapple striking when a hand could be loosed and then fell apart exhausted both were bleeding but determined for deeprooted dislike had suddenly changed to overpowering hate moreover charnock knew the foreman was wilkinsons friend and half suspected him of a share in the plot  in the meantime the men gathered round scarcely giving the fighters room and some crowded off the floor mounted the table nobody however interfered they had no part in the quarrel and did not know what it was about but while a number sympathized with charnock it was dangerous to offend their boss  charnock resumed the attack advancing with a savage rush the foreman gave ground but stretched out his foot and charnock tripping over it plunged forward and fell among the legs of the nearest men they crowded back and as he got up awkwardly the foreman seized a heavy billet of cordwood and flung it at his head the billet struck his shoulder but he was on his feet his face set and white and his eyes vindictively hard it was a foul blow but there are few rules to hamper men who fight in a western construction camp and charnock thought his antagonist meant to use a stoveiron that lay close by feinting at the other he dodged and seized a pickhandle he had noticed on the floor he was just in time for the foreman struck at him with the iron it clashed upon the pickhandle but charnock got the next blow home and the foreman fell upon the table on which charnock pinned him down then getting his right arm loose he struck with blind fury  he was seized from behind and while he struggled to get loose somebody gasped thats enough do you want to kill the man  yes said charnock hoarsely let me go  help me choke him off hes surely mad cried the man behind  somebody else got hold of charnock he was dragged back hustled away from the table and towards the door then the bar was torn from his hands and a man pushed him out in the snow  you have fixed him good said somebody in a breathless voice go home and cool off  if wilkinsons inside im coming back charnock declared  the man laughed wilkinson lit out through the storeshed bout a minute after you came in  charnock felt faint and dizzy but tried to think when the fellow banged the door it looked as if wilkinson knew why he had come and had stolen away after seeing the struggle begin moreover he had friends who might go after him and tell him what had happened to the foreman then he remembered that the locomotive engineer had been ordered to move some cars and set off for the track  the snow was rough he fell into holes and stubbed his feet against the ties but stumbled on until he heard the locomotive snort then there was a jar of iron wheels rattled and a dark mass in front began to roll away he was too late and when he stopped and tried to get his breath two men came down the track  did any of the boys go out on the train he asked  only wilkinson one replied  wheres he going  i dont know said the other as he took his clothesbag it doesnt look as if he was coming back  charnock set off for nortons office he did not know how he got there because a reaction had begun and he sat down feeling powerless and badly shaken    chapter xxx  understanding  at midnight charnock sitting drowsily in a chair in nortons office roused himself with a jerk he was too anxious about festing to go to bed but bodily fatigue reacted on his brain and dulled his senses for all that he thought he heard steps in the snow and getting up quickly went to the door the bitter cold pierced him like a knife and he shivered a man stood outside and his dark figure silhouetted against the snow was somehow ominous charnock tried to brace himself for he feared bad news  well he said hoarsely  its musgrave the doctor sent me along your partners taken a turn hes going the right way now  charnock looked at the messenger his relief was overwhelming and he could not speak  thats all but i guess its good enough and you can go to sleep the other resumed and went away  when he vanished among the trees charnock returned to his chair he thought he ought to have brought the man in and made him some coffee but he was horribly tired and did not want to move about and talk besides he was conscious of a poignant satisfaction that prevented his thinking about anything else while he indulged it a wave of fatigue swept over him and his head drooped he tried to open his eyes but could not and a few minutes later he was sound asleep  when he awoke the sun shone into the office and he felt stiff and cramped but not cold this was strange and he glanced at the stove which he had expected to find nearly out the iron however glowed a dull red and he could hear the cordwood snapping somebody must have put in fresh fuel and looking at his watch he got up with a start the men had been at work for two hours with nobody to superintend them then he heard a movement and turning round saw one in the room  feeling better boss the fellow asked mr kerr told me to come and see if you were awake said youd find breakfast ready if you went to his place  i expect you thought waiting for me to wake was easier than rolling logs charnock suggested  oh well said the other you wont find weve fooled away much time  charnock went to festings shack and the doctor nodded and indicated his comrades bunk as charnock stopped beside it festing turned his head  things going all right bob  they were last night said charnock with some embarrassment i dont know about this morning because ive just got up but how are you  festing smiled much better imagine im not knocked out yet you neednt bother about being late the boys are a pretty good crowd and they like you im rather glad you didnt hustle them as much as i wanted  thats enough said the doctor who followed charnock to the door and gave him a hopeful report  charnock ate a very good breakfast in kerrs shack but his face was grave when he began his work luck had put upon him a heavy responsibility but he must shoulder the load sadie and helen and festing had given him much and now the time had come to pay them back moreover with the responsibility had come a chance of proving and so to speak reinstating himself he was entangled in a coil from which there was but one way out he must stand by his comrade and finish the contract or own himself a wastrel the difficulties were obvious but there was some encouragement perhaps the hardest battle had been fought for he had grappled with his craving for liquor and thought he had won then the pain had not troubled him for some time  the men gave him no trouble and he imagined they worked with more energy than usual now and then one or another stopped to ask with obvious sincerity how the boss was getting on men from the railroad gangs some of whom he scarcely knew made inquiries and charnock felt moved his partners justice had won him respect but he saw that some of the sympathy was meant for himself  two days later he heard the rumble of an approaching supply train and walked up the track to meet it the locomotive stopped farther off than he expected and a woman got down running forward he saw that it was helen  stephens doing well thats the first thing youll want to know he said when they met  i know it already a man told me as soon as the train stopped he seemed to guess who i am  ah said charnock the boys are very good it makes me proud to feel they all like stephen but why didnt you telegraph us the company would have sent on the message  helen smiled i didnt see much use in doing so you knew when your letter would arrive and how long it would take me to come its significant that you came to meet the train  perhaps its characteristic that i came too late to help you down but the engineer stopped short of the usual place and i really have much to do just now  helen gave him a quick glance bob had not lost his humor but had gained something else he was thin and haggard but looked determined although his smile was frank his mouth was firm and his eyes were steady  i know she answered quickly i know what you have done for stephen and what you mean to do there is nobody else who can help him and if there was the help would not be like yours  thank you said charnock im afraid youre mistaken about one point but i have an extra reason for doing the best i can then he paused and smiled we tried to make the place comfortable but youll find things rough one lives in a rather primitive way at a construction camp  perhaps so far i have found things too smooth  then helen asked him about the accident and he told her as much as he thought advisable until they reached the shack where the doctor met them at the door  i expect youre mrs festing he said youll find your husband able to talk but remember that he must be kept calm im going out but will be back soon and well see about getting you some food  he took charnock away and festing looked up with a strained expression as helen crossed the floor her eyes were wonderfully gentle and stooping beside the bunk she kissed him and put her arm round his neck  my dear she said softly my poor hurt dear i have come to take care of you until you get well  i imagine ill need to be taken care of afterwards festing answered with a forced smile it looks as if i hadnt much ground for selfconfidence  helen pressed his arm we have both made mistakes but we wont talk about that now do you really feel youre getting better  of course said festing smiling very much better ill get well remarkably fast now you have come  helen brought a chair and for a time they engaged in happy but careless talk both knew there was much to be said but helen skilfully avoided striking a serious note the time for that had not arrived yet  when it got dark the doctor came in and joined them at a meal  the engineers have promised to put me up tonight and i must leave tomorrow when the train goes out he said ill try to get back but musgrave knows what to do and will send for me if necessary the most important thing is to keep mr festing quiet  im afraid it will be difficult helen answered  the doctors eyes twinkled so i imagine but its your job if you find it too hard musgrave will put your husband in plaster  he went east next morning with the supply train and helen was sorry to see him go he had done what was needed with quiet efficiency but she knew he had other patients scattered about a wide district  charnock came in for a few minutes now and then during the day and musgrave was often about but helen was content to be left alone with her husband his helplessness moved her he had been marked by such vigor and energy and it was strange to see him unable to move yet while very pitiful she felt a vague satisfaction because she could help him and he needed her  when it was getting dark she went to the door and looked out the evening was calm and belts of paleyellow broke the soft gray clouds the eastern peaks were touched with an orange glow but the snow lower down faded through shades of blue and purple into gloom to the west the pines were black and sharp with white smears on their lower branches and a thin haze rose from the river the coloring of the landscape was harmoniously subdued but its rugged grandeur of outline caught helens eye and she stood for a few minutes looking about with halfawed admiration  do you feel the cold stephen she asked  no said festing wonderful view isnt it but whats it like outside  very still everything has a soft look the harsh glitters gone and the air has not the sting it had somehow the calms majestic the pictures one sees of the mountains hardly give a hint one feels this is the grandest country in the world but it looks strangely unfinished  festing laughed a few ranches roads and cornfields would make a difference well they follow the steel in canada and its my job to clear the way but the soft look promises warmer weather and bob will get ahead if a chinook wind begins to blow i imagine he hasnt done very much the last few days  you mustnt bother about what bob is doing helen said firmly  very well light the lamp and sit where i can see you theres something i want to say  helen did so and waited until festing resumed to begin with ive been a shortsighted censorious fool about bob im ashamed to remember that i said he was a shiftless wastrel the worst is i cant apologize it wouldnt make things better to tell him what i thought  thats obvious said helen with a smile still in a way perhaps you were not so very wrong bob was something of a wastrel his wife has made him a useful man  another thing i was mistaken about i rather despised sadie now i want to take off my hat when i think of her but its puzzling a girl without polish taste or accomplishments marries a man who has them all she has no particular talents nothing in fact except some beauty rude integrity and native shrewdness yet she so to speak works wonders puts bob on his feet and leads him on when nobody else could have pulled him out of the mire  she loved him said helen softly love gave her patience and cleverness however i think sadie did not always lead bob she knew when to drive  festing was silent for a few moments and then went on well i have confessed two blunders and think it has done me good but im getting nearer what i want to say bobs something of a philosopher and once remarked that events and people seldom force us into coils our passions and characters entangle us he was scoffing at the power of the theatrical villain and used wilkinson for an example  but wilkinson had something to do with our troubles  not very much after all perhaps hes accountable for my broken bones but it was my obstinacy and ridiculous selfconfidence that sent me here thats what i really mean to talk about  is it necessary helen asked i was foolish to be jealous of the farm women have sometimes worse grounds for jealousy  that would have been impossible for us nobody who knew you could be attracted by another woman  bob was attracted said helen with a blush one must own that he was prudent i havent sadies courage and patience  in those days bob was a besotted whiskytank but we are not going to talk about him im afraid i was forgetful and went my own way like an obstinate fool it was wrong ridiculously wrong im not going to excuse myself but i want you to understand  he paused for effort and emotion had tired him but presently resumed i wouldnt use your money but this wasnt altogether because i was too proud to let you help i wanted to keep you safe farmings a risky business and i couldnt play a niggardly cautious game there was the land waiting to be worked i couldnt spare labor or money but since both might be lost i was afraid to use your fortune as a stake  i understand said helen all the same i would have been glad to take the risk i dont think im very much afraid of hardship  festing smiled you have pluck but dont know the strain that the wives of the struggling farmers have to bear my object is to see that you dont know but theres another thing harder to explain you felt that i neglected you and i fear i did  you didnt mean to neglect me perhaps i was foolish stephen but i felt you left me out there were ways i could have helped  i took the wrong line thats plain now but we must think of the future and not make the same mistake you are first with me helen but i must work its all im fit for i cant play games and am not an amusing talkerthough im talking at large tonight well we have made our home on the prairie and all round us the best wheatsoil in the world is lying waste theyre getting short of food in europe america will soon use all she grows and folks in the older countries fix their eyes on us then we have room for an industrious population on our wide plains cities are waiting to spring up a new nation is being born i and the others who were given the land must clear the way its our business our only justification for being there sounds romantic and exaggerated but i think its true  it is true said helen your views are larger than mine  well said festing smiling i dont often let myself go and look far ahead its my share to tackle the job before my eyes to drive the tractor plow and the grading scoop along the road reserve for all that its not a vague sense of duty that really drives me on i must work im unhappy when i stop im afraid ill always feel like that what are we going to do about it  you must let me help more  i need help thats something i have learned and nobody can help like you but the strain will slacken soon the things that will make life easier for you are coming fast branch railroads telephones busy little towns neighbors and social amusements much that you enjoyed in england will surround you on the plains but it will not come as a gift as it did at home we will have worked for and made it possible  helen got up her color was higher than usual and her eyes sparkled she was romantic and festing had struck the right note with rude sincerity and unconscious power she saw visions of the future and the dignity of the immediate task in this wide new country man needed womans help and her part was as large as his like sadie and many another she heard the call for pioneers crossing the door she stood by festings bunk  i understand it all stephen we must be patient and allow for small differences in our points of view for i think in the main we see together you must never leave me out again i want to do my part  festing said nothing but he pressed her hand and she kissed him    chapter xxxi  charnocks triumph  six weeks after the accident musgrave and charnock came into the shack one evening the former had examined festing in the afternoon and helen gave him a meaning look it hinted that she had expected his visit and meant to encourage him  come near the stove and smoke if you like it is very cold  no sign of the frosts breaking i suppose said festing who lay propped up with pillows did you get the particulars i asked for bob  charnock gave him a paper with some calculations and after a time he nodded  on the whole this is satisfactory things are going better than i thought but what about the new job across the river  things are going better than he thought isnt that like stephen charnock remarked to the others and then turned to festing however i expect you didnt mean to be rude and you never were very tactful we havent begun the job you mentioned but i dont know that it matters since were busy at something else and thats not what i want to talk about musgrave has examined you and gives us an encouraging report  my opinion is that he can be moved and the journey home wont hurt him if proper care is used  but i dont want to be moved just yet festing objected  no doubt said musgrave dryly you are an obstinate fellow but youre in our hands now and we have to think what is best for you to begin with you wont be able to get about in time to be of much use and you dont get better as fast as you ought then i understood you were resigned to going home before the contract is finished  if i must but i dont want to go now im able to arrange things with charnock in the evenings  the fact is he doesnt trust me yet charnock remarked with a grin  you know that isnt true bob  then prove you trust me by going home with helen she has been plucky to stay so long and now youre fit to be moved you oughtnt to keep her theres another thing to be frank you dont help much we need a boss to superintend which you cant do and when i want advice i can go to norton as a matter of fact when i come here in the evenings you find fault with what ive done when i undertake a job i like to feel im carrying it out  festing stopped him and looked at helen for he was not deceived by charnocks injured tone  i imagine this is something like a plot to get me away  i think you would get better much faster at home stephen you cannot do anything useful here and you cannot rest mr musgrave agrees  certainly if he stays festing will do himself harm and bother his partner  festing knitted his brows and was silent for a moment or two then he said since it looks as if you had made your plans i had better go youre a very good fellow bob but if you cant keep things straight ill come back and superintend from a stretcher  they talked about other matters but when charnock left helen put on her furs and told festing she wanted fresh air moonlight shone upon the dark pines and sparkled on the snow and when they came out of the shadow of the trees she thought charnocks face was grave  im grateful bob she said its a big thing you have undertaken  i frankly wish it was smaller charnock answered i fact i feel i have been horribly rash i havent stephens constructive talent or for that matter his energy but somehow i mustnt be beaten  helen gave him a gentle look you wont be beaten its unthinkable we trust you  then she went back and read a newspaper to festing who was carried down to the supply train next day and made comfortable in the caboose charnock talked to him carelessly until the couplings tightened and the locomotive began to snort but his mouth was firm and his face set as he went back to his work he knew what he was up against and there were difficulties he had not told festing about  the days got longer and the frost was relaxing its grip on the white prairie when festing left his homestead and walked to the trailfork to meet the mailcarrier he returned with some letters and sat down limply his face was thin and pale  i get tired soon and theres nothing from bob yet he grumbled as he turned over the envelopes its curious because he told us the job was nearly finished and some of the big engineers were coming out to examine the track they ought to have arrived some days ago and ive no doubt theyd test the work thoroughly when they were there  you get too anxious helen replied if you had a calmer temperament you would be stronger now the engineers can hardly have had time to make a proper test  i have some grounds for being anxious if the fellows arent satisfied we wont get paid  helen smiled youre really afraid that bob may have been careless and neglected something  bobs a very good partner ive confessed that i misjudged him festing answered with a touch of embarrassment still you see i know his drawbacks and i know mine there were two or three pieces of work done before i left that i now see might have been better planned  helen went to the door for she heard a soft drumming of hoofs on beaten snow  sadies coming she said perhaps she has some news  festing followed her and sadie stopped the horses but did not get down  ive a telegram from bob hell be home tomorrow she said he wants you both to meet him at the station  did he say anything about the job being finished festing asked as he went down the steps  no said sadie he seemed particularly anxious to see you at the depot my hands are too numb or id show you the telegram i havent time to come in and dont want the team to stand in the cold  then she waved her hand to helen and drove away  about six oclock next evening helen and festing walked up and down beside the track at the railroad settlement there was no platform but the agents office stood near the rails with a baggage shed and a big tank for filtering saline water near the locomotive pipe behind these three tall grainelevators which had not been finished when festing saw them last rose against the sky dwarfing the skeleton frame of a new hotel the ugly wooden houses had extended some distance across the snow and festing knew the significance of this it was not dark yet but the headlamp of a locomotive in the sidetrack flung a glittering beam a quarter of a mile down the line in the west a belt of saffron light cut by the black smear of a bluff glimmered on the horizon festing indicated the settlement  it has grown fast but if things go as some of us expect the change will soon be magical in a year or two youll see a postoffice like a palace and probably an operahouse besides street cars running north and south from the track  i think i should like that helen remarked when it comes you will have an office and a telephone and be satisfied to superintend  festing laughed its possible but theres much to be done first and im not getting on very fast just now still i dont feel knocked out and ive walked half a mile  glancing at the elevator towers and blocks of squarefronted houses that rose abruptly from the snow helen mused the settlement jarred her fastidious taste but she had seen western towns that had in a few years grown out of their raw ugliness and blossomed in an efflorescence of ambitious architecture such beauty as they then possessed was not refined or subdued but it was somehow characteristic of the country and harmonized with the builders optimism there was no permanence on the prairie everything was in a fluid state of change and marked by a bold but sometime misguided striving for something better then she turned to her husband his face was thin and she noted lines that came from mental strain and physical suffering but his eyes were calm she liked his look of quiet resolution  you are getting stronger fast she said the days are lengthening spring is near and you will soon be able to work again well i will not try to stop you when the prairie is plowed and covered with wheat i want you to feel that you have done your part the change that is coming will bring the things women like comfort amusements society but what about you and the others the pioneers when there is no more ground to be broken and the way is cleared  festing smiled as a rule the pioneer sells his homestead and goes on into the wilds to blaze another trail but i imagine i shall be glad to rest if not were an adaptable people and there are different ways of helping things along one can learn to use other tools than the ax and plow  ah said helen you are getting broader you see clearly stephen and your views are often long but i sometimes thought you focused them too narrowly on the object in front perhaps i shall have done something if i have taught you to look all round but heres sadie and the train  a light sprang out from the distant bluff and grew into a dazzling fanshaped beam then the roar of wheels slackened and sadie joined the others as a bell began to toll and with smoke streaming back along the cars the train rolled into the station somebody leaned out from the rails of a vestibule and sadie began to run beside the track  come along she cried its bob  festing and helen followed and when they reached the vestibule charnock pushed a door open and took them inside the car was brightly lighted but not furnished on the usual plan a table stood in the middle the curtained berths were at one end and there were cases holding books and surveying instruments it was obviously meant for the use of railroad managers and engineers and three or four gentlemen stood near the table as if they had just got up festing saw that one was dalton who advanced eagerly as helen came in he presented his companions to her and sadie and a gentleman who was well known on canadian railroads gave festing his hand another was nortons employer a famous contractor  sit down said the first the engineer wants to fill his tank and they wont pull out until we are ready then he turned to festing we have examined a piece of tract you helped build and i must compliment you on a firstclass job as a rule we are glad to get our contract work up to specification but you have done better  my partner is really responsible for that festing replied i got knocked out soon after we made a good start and had to leave him to carry on  the contractor smiled as he interposed a good beginning counts for much and im glad to state that mr charnock has kept to your lines when you were forced to leave it seemed prudent to make some inquiries but we found that your partner was doing highgrade work and now we have inspected it i must admit that nortons favorable reports were deserved he paused and turned to sadie if your husbands as good a farmer as an engineer hell make progress  sadie flushed with pride looks as if hed made some already but you didnt run much risk when you trusted him  my wifes the farmer and my partner the engineer charnock remarked i know my limits but try to keep going when somebody starts me well  you have gone farther than our bargain demanded which doesnt often happen said the contractor who turned to festing mr charnock has my cheque for the main job but there are some accounts to make up and you wont find my cashier disputes the extras perhaps thats all i need say except that you have satisfied me and i gather satisfied your men in fact you and mr charnock leave us with general good feeling  then they talked about something else until a man came in to say that the locomotive tank was filled and the engineer and contractor went to the vestibule with their guests for a minute or two the group stood on the platform exchanging farewell compliments while the station agent waited in the snow then the engineer said  i wanted to meet your husband mrs festing and if we have any more difficult work hope you will let me have him again  he came back the worse last time helen answered smiling im not sure i would have the courage to let him go besides he has other work at home a farm makes many demands on one  i have no doubt it does agreed the engineer one imagines that on the festing farm all demands will be met  he signed to the agent the others went down the steps and the bell began to toll as the lighted cars rolled by the rattle of wheels got louder and a plume of smoke trailed back and spread in a dingy cloud but helen and festing stood a little way from the others watching the receding train they felt that something was finished satisfactorily finished amidst wellearned praise but done with for good festing looked at helen with a comprehending smile  you answered right im not going back our work is waiting here on the plains  ah said helen softly how much easier you make it when you call it ours  they went to the hotel where they had left the team and as the others followed sadie turned to her husband with a glow of happy pride he had come back so to speak triumphant the guest of famous men who had said flattering things about him and for his sake the train had been held up while the great contractor talked to her  bob she said you have made good i cant tell you all i feel about it some day youll be a famous man
